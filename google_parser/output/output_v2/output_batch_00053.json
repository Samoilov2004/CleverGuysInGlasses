No. 11/511,635, filed Aug. 29, 2006, which claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/713,585, filed Aug. 31, 2005, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Sequence Listing filed electronically herewith is also hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety (File Name: BP06380US03 SeqListing.txt; Date Created: Sep. 8, 2010; File Size: 100 KB.)\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to interleukin-23 p19 (IL-23p19) specific antibodies and uses thereof. More specifically, the invention relates to humanized antibodies that recognize human IL-23p19 and modulate its activity, particularly in inflammatory, autoimmune and proliferative disorders.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe immune system functions to protect individuals from infective agents, e.g., bacteria, multi-cellular organisms, and viruses, as well as from cancers. This system includes several types of lymphoid and myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), eosinophils, T cells, B cells, and neutrophils. These lymphoid and myeloid cells often produce signaling proteins known as cytokines. The immune response includes inflammation, i.e., the accumulation of immune cells systemically or in a particular location of the body. In response to an infective agent or foreign substance, immune cells secrete cytokines which, in turn, modulate immune cell proliferation, development, differentiation, or migration. Immune response can produce pathological consequences, e.g., when it involves excessive inflammation, as in the autoimmune disorders (see, e.g., Abbas, et al. (eds.) (2000) \nCellular and Molecular Immunology\n, W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, Pa.; Oppenheim and Feldmann (eds.) (2001) \nCytokine Reference\n, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.; von Andrian and Mackay (2000) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n343:1020-1034; Davidson and Diamond (2001) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n345:340-350).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterleukin-12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric molecule composed of p35 and p40 subunits. Studies have indicated that IL-12 plays a critical role in the differentiation of naïve T cells into T-helper type 1 CD4\n+\n lymphocytes that secrete IFNγ. It has also been shown that IL-12 is essential for T cell dependent immune and inflammatory responses in vivo. (See, e.g., Cua, et al. (2003) \nNature \n421:744-748. The IL-12 receptor is composed of IL-12beta1 and IL-12beta2 subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterleukin-23 (IL-23) is a heterodimeric cytokine comprised of two subunits, p19 which is unique to IL-23, and p40, which is shared with IL-12. The p19 subunit is structurally related to IL-6, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and the p35 subunit of IL-12. IL-23 mediates signaling by binding to a heterodimeric receptor, comprised of IL-23R and IL-12β1, which is shared by the IL-12 receptor. A number of early studies demonstrated that the consequences of a genetic deficiency in p40 (p40 knockout mouse; p40KO mouse) were more severe than those found in a p35KO mouse. Some of these results were eventually explained by the discovery of IL-23, and the finding that the p40KO prevents expression of IL-12, but also of IL-23 (see, e.g., Oppmann, et al. (2000) \nImmunity \n13:715-725; Wiekowski, et al. (2001) \nJ. Immunol. \n166:7563-7570; Parham, et al. (2002) \nJ Immunol \n168:5699-708; Frucht (2002) \nSci STKE \n2002, E1-E3; Elkins, et al. (2002) \nInfection Immunity \n70:1936-1948).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent studies, through the use of p40 KO mice, have shown that blockade of both IL-23 and IL-12 is an effective treatment for various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. However, the blockade of IL-12 through p40, appears to have various systemic consequences such as increased susceptibility to opportunistic microbial infections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most significant limitation in using antibodies as a therapeutic agent in vivo is the immunogenicity of the antibodies. As most monoclonal antibodies are derived from rodents, repeated use in humans results in the generation of an immune response against the therapeutic antibody. Such an immune response results in a loss of therapeutic efficacy at a minimum and a potential fatal anaphylactic response at a maximum. Initial efforts to reduce the immunogenicity of rodent antibodies involved the production of chimeric antibodies, in which mouse variable regions were fused with human constant regions. Liu et al. (1987) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n84:3439-43. However, mice injected with hybrids of human variable regions and mouse constant regions develop a strong anti-antibody response directed against the human variable region, suggesting that the retention of the entire rodent Fv region in such chimeric antibodies may still result in unwanted immunogenicity in patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is generally believed that complementarity determining region (CDR) loops of variable domains comprise the binding site of antibody molecules. Therefore, the grafting of rodent CDR loops onto human frameworks (i.e., humanization) was attempted to further minimize rodent sequences. Jones et al. (1986) \nNature \n321:522; Verhoeyen et al. (1988) \nScience \n239:1534. However, CDR loop exchanges still do not uniformly result in an antibody with the same binding properties as the antibody of origin. Changes in framework residues (FR), residues involved in CDR loop support, in humanized antibodies also are required to preserve antigen binding affinity. Kabat et al. (1991) \nJ. Immunol. \n147:1709. While the use of CDR grafting and framework residue preservation in a number of humanized antibody constructs has been reported, it is difficult to predict if a particular sequence will result in the antibody with the desired binding, and sometimes biological, properties. See, e.g., Queen et al. (1989) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n86:10029, Gorman et al. (1991) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n88:4181, and Hodgson (1991) \nBiotechnology \n(\nNY\n) 9:421-5. Moreover, most prior studies used different human sequences for animal light and heavy variable sequences, rendering the predictive nature of such studies questionable. Sequences of known antibodies have been used or, more typically, those of antibodies having known X-ray structures, antibodies NEW and KOL. See, e.g., Jones et al., supra; Verhoeyen et al., supra; and Gorman et al., supra. Exact sequence information has been reported for a few humanized constructs. The present invention provides engineered IL-23p19 antibodies and uses thereof to treat inflammatory, autoimmune, and proliferative disorders.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 1A-1C\n show comparisons of mouse anti-human IL-23p19 antibody clone heavy chain variable domain sequences.

All references cited herein are incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent application, or patent, was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \nI. Definitions\n\n\n \n \n \n“Activation,” “stimulation,” and “treatment,” as it applies to cells or to receptors, may have the same meaning, e.g., activation, stimulation, or treatment of a cell or receptor with a ligand, unless indicated otherwise by the context or explicitly. “Ligand” encompasses natural and synthetic ligands, e.g., cytokines, cytokine variants, analogues, muteins, and binding compositions derived from antibodies. “Ligand” also encompasses small molecules, e.g., peptide mimetics of cytokines and peptide mimetics of antibodies. “Activation” can refer to cell activation as regulated by internal mechanisms as well as by external or environmental factors. “Response,” e.g., of a cell, tissue, organ, or organism, encompasses a change in biochemical or physiological behavior, e.g., concentration, density, adhesion, or migration within a biological compartment, rate of gene expression, or state of differentiation, where the change is correlated with activation, stimulation, or treatment, or with internal mechanisms such as genetic programming.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Activity” of a molecule may describe or refer to the binding of the molecule to a ligand or to a receptor, to catalytic activity; to the ability to stimulate gene expression or cell signaling, differentiation, or maturation; to antigenic activity, to the modulation of activities of other molecules, and the like. “Activity” of a molecule may also refer to activity in modulating or maintaining cell-to-cell interactions, e.g., adhesion, or activity in maintaining a structure of a cell, e.g., cell membranes or cytoskeleton. “Activity” can also mean specific activity, e.g., [catalytic activity]/[mg protein], or [immunological activity]/[mg protein], concentration in a biological compartment, or the like. “Proliferative activity” encompasses an activity that promotes, that is necessary for, or that is specifically associated with, e.g., normal cell division, as well as cancer, tumors, dysplasia, cell transformation, metastasis, and angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Administration” and “treatment,” as it applies to an animal, human, experimental subject, cell, tissue, organ, or biological fluid, refers to contact of an exogenous pharmaceutical, therapeutic, diagnostic agent, or composition to the animal, human, subject, cell, tissue, organ, or biological fluid. “Administration” and “treatment” can refer, e.g., to therapeutic, pharmacokinetic, diagnostic, research, and experimental methods. Treatment of a cell encompasses contact of a reagent to the cell, as well as contact of a reagent to a fluid, where the fluid is in contact with the cell. “Administration” and “treatment” also means in vitro and ex vivo treatments, e.g., of a cell, by a reagent, diagnostic, binding composition, or by another cell. “Treatment,” as it applies to a human, veterinary, or research subject, refers to therapeutic treatment, prophylactic or preventative measures, to research and diagnostic applications. “Treatment” as it applies to a human, veterinary, or research subject, or cell, tissue, or organ, encompasses contact of an IL-23 agonist or IL-23 antagonist to a human or animal subject, a cell, tissue, physiological compartment, or physiological fluid. “Treatment of a cell” also encompasses situations where the IL-23 agonist or IL-23 antagonist contacts IL-23 receptor (IL-23R/IL-12Rbeta1 heterodimer), e.g., in the fluid phase or colloidal phase, but also situations where the agonist or antagonist does not contact the cell or the receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “antibody” refers to any form of antibody or fragment thereof that exhibits the desired biological activity. Thus, it is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “IL-23p19 binding fragment” or “binding fragment thereof” encompasses a fragment or a derivative of an antibody that still substantially retain its biological activity of inhibiting IL-23p19 activity. Therefore, the term “antibody fragment” or IL-23p19 binding fragment refers to a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules, e.g., sc-Fv; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Typically, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 10% of its IL-23p19 inhibitory activity. Preferably, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 25%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or 100% (or more) of its IL-23p19 inhibitory activity, although any binding fragment with sufficient affinity to exert the desired biological effect will be useful. It is also intended that a IL-23p19 binding fragment can include conservative amino acid substitutions that do not substantially alter its biologic activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody”, as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic epitope. In contrast, conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations typically include a multitude of antibodies directed against (or specific for) different epitopes. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., (1975) \nNature \n256: 495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The “monoclonal antibodies” may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., (1991) \nNature \n352: 624-628 and Marks et al., (1991) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222: 581-597, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81: 6851-6855).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “domain antibody” is an immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain. In some instances, two or more V\nH \nregions are covalently joined with a peptide linker to create a bivalent domain antibody. The two V\nH \nregions of a bivalent domain antibody may target the same or different antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “bivalent antibody” comprises two antigen binding sites. In some instances, the two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. However, bivalent antibodies may be bispecific (see below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “single-chain Fv” or “scFv” antibody refers to antibody fragments comprising the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv, see Pluckthun (1994) T\nHE \nP\nHARMACOLOGY OF \nM\nONOCLONAL \nA\nNTIBODIES\n, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein also include camelized single domain antibodies. See, e.g., Muyldermans et al. (2001) \nTrends Biochem. Sci. \n26:230; Reichmann et al. (1999) \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n231:25; WO 94/04678; WO 94/25591; U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,079, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties). In one embodiment, the present invention provides single domain antibodies comprising two V\nH \ndomains with modifications such that single domain antibodies are formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH\n-V\nL \nor V\nL\n-V\nH\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Holliger et al. (1993) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n90: 6444-6448. For a review of engineered antibody variants generally see Holliger and Hudson (2005) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n23:1126-1136.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “humanized antibody” refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies as well as human antibodies. Such antibodies contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. The prefix “hum” is added to antibody clone designations when necessary to distinguish humanized antibodies (e.g. hum6H12) from parental rodent antibodies (e.g. mouse 6H12, or “m6H12”). The humanized forms of rodent antibodies will generally comprise the same CDR sequences of the parental rodent antibodies, although certain amino acid substitutions may be included to increase affinity or increase stability of the humanized antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention also include antibodies with modified (or blocked) Fc regions to provide altered effector functions. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; WO2003/086310; WO2005/120571; WO2006/0057702; Presta (2006) \nAdv. Drug Delivery Rev. \n58:640-656. Such modification can be used to enhance or suppress various reactions of the immune system, with possible beneficial effects in diagnosis and therapy. Alterations of the Fc region include amino acid changes (substitutions, deletions and insertions), glycosylation or deglycosylation, and adding multiple Fc. Changes to the Fc can also alter the half-life of antibodies in therapeutic antibodies, and a longer half-life would result in less frequent dosing, with the concomitant increased convenience and decreased use of material. See Presta (2005) \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n116:731 at 734-35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “fully human antibody” refers to an antibody that comprises human immunoglobulin protein sequences only. A fully human antibody may contain murine carbohydrate chains if produced in a mouse, in a mouse cell, or in a hybridoma derived from a mouse cell. Similarly, “mouse antibody” refers to an antibody which comprises mouse immunoglobulin sequences only.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “hypervariable region” refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody that are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a “complementarity determining region” or “CDR” (e.g. residues 24-34 (CDRL1), 50-56 (CDRL2) and 89-97 (CDRL3) in the light chain variable domain and residues 31-35 (CDRH1), 50-65 (CDRH2) and 95-102 (CDRH3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al., (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.) and/or those residues from a “hypervariable loop” (i.e. residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk, (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196: 901-917). As used herein, the term “framework” or “FR” residues refers to those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues defined herein as CDR residues. The residue numbering above relates to the Kabat numbering system and does not necessarily correspond in detail to the sequence numbering in the accompanying Sequence Listing. See Tables 2 and 3, in which sequence numbering is with reference to the Sequence Listing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Binding compound” refers to a molecule, small molecule, macromolecule, polypeptide, antibody or fragment or analogue thereof, or soluble receptor, capable of binding to a target. “Binding compound” also may refer to a complex of molecules, e.g., a non-covalent complex, to an ionized molecule, and to a covalently or non-covalently modified molecule, e.g., modified by phosphorylation, acylation, cross-linking, cyclization, or limited cleavage, which is capable of binding to a target. When used with reference to antibodies, the term “binding compound” refers to both antibodies and binding fragments thereof “Binding” refers to an association of the binding composition with a target where the association results in reduction in the normal Brownian motion of the binding composition, in cases where the binding composition can be dissolved or suspended in solution. “Binding composition” refers to a molecule, e.g. a binding compound, in combination with a stabilizer, excipient, salt, buffer, solvent, or additive, capable of binding to a target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Conservatively modified variants” or “conservative substitution” refers to substitutions of amino acids are known to those of skill in this art and may be made generally without altering the biological activity of the resulting molecule. Those of skill in this art recognize that, in general, single amino acid substitutions in non-essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity (see, e.g., Watson, et al., \nMolecular Biology of the Gene\n, The Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co., p. 224 (4th Edition 1987)). Such exemplary substitutions are preferably made in accordance with those set forth in Table 1 as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary Conservative Amino Acid Substitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal\n\n\nConservative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nresidue\n\n\nsubstitution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nGly; Ser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nLys, His\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\nGln; His\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nGlu; Asn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nSer; Ala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nAsn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu (E)\n\n\nAsp; Gln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nAsn; Gln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nLeu; Val\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu (L)\n\n\nIle; Val\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\nArg; His\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nLeu; Ile; Tyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nTyr; Met; Leu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nThr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\nTyr; Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\nTrp; Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nIle; Leu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “consists essentially of,” or variations such as “consist essentially of” or “consisting essentially of,” as used throughout the specification and claims, indicate the inclusion of any recited elements or group of elements, and the optional inclusion of other elements, of similar or different nature than the recited elements, that do not materially change the basic or novel properties of the specified dosage regimen, method, or composition. As a nonlimiting example, a binding compound that consists essentially of a recited amino acid sequence may also include one or more amino acids, including substitutions of one or more amino acid residues, that do not materially affect the properties of the binding compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Effective amount” encompasses an amount sufficient to ameliorate or prevent a symptom or sign of the medical condition. Effective amount also means an amount sufficient to allow or facilitate diagnosis. An effective amount for a particular patient or veterinary subject may vary depending on factors such as the condition being treated, the overall health of the patient, the method route and dose of administration and the severity of side affects (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,530 issued to Netti, et al.). An effective amount can be the maximal dose or dosing protocol that avoids significant side effects or toxic effects. The effect will result in an improvement of a diagnostic measure or parameter by at least 5%, usually by at least 10%, more usually at least 20%, most usually at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, most preferably at least 60%, ideally at least 70%, more ideally at least 80%, and most ideally at least 90%, where 100% is defined as the diagnostic parameter shown by a normal subject (see, e.g., Maynard, et al. (1996) \nA Handbook of SOPs for Good Clinical Practice\n, Interpharm Press, Boca Raton, Fla.; Dent (2001) \nGood Laboratory and Good Clinical Practice\n, Urch Publ., London, UK).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Exogenous” refers to substances that are produced outside an organism, cell, or human body, depending on the context. “Endogenous” refers to substances that are produced within a cell, organism, or human body, depending on the context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Immune condition” or “immune disorder” encompasses, e.g., pathological inflammation, an inflammatory disorder, and an autoimmune disorder or disease. “Immune condition” also refers to infections, persistent infections, and proliferative conditions, such as cancer, tumors, and angiogenesis, including infections, tumors, and cancers that resist eradication by the immune system. “Cancerous condition” includes, e.g., cancer, cancer cells, tumors, angiogenesis, and precancerous conditions such as dysplasia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Inflammatory disorder” means a disorder or pathological condition where the pathology results, in whole or in part, from, e.g., a change in number, change in rate of migration, or change in activation, of cells of the immune system. Cells of the immune system include, e.g., T cells, B cells, monocytes or macrophages, antigen presenting cells (APCs), dendritic cells, microglia, NK cells, NKT cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, or any other cell specifically associated with the immunology, for example, cytokine-producing endothelial or epithelial cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “IL-17-producing cell” means a T cell that is not a classical TH1-type T cell or classical TH2-type T cell, referred to as T\nH\n17 cells. T\nH\n17 cells are discussed in greater detail at Cua and Kastelein (2006) \nNat. Immunol. \n7:557-559; Tato and O'Shea (2006) \nNature \n441:166-168; Iwakura and Ishigame (2006) \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n116:1218-1222, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. “IL-17-producing cell” also means a T cell that expresses a gene or polypeptide of Table 10B of U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0219150 (e.g., mitogen responsive P-protein; chemokine ligand 2; interleukin-17 (IL-17); transcription factor RAR related; and/or suppressor of cytokine signaling 3), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, where expression with treatment by an IL-23 agonist is greater than treatment with an IL-12 agonist, where “greater than” is defined as follows. Expression with an IL-23 agonist is ordinarily at least 5-fold greater, typically at least 10-fold greater, more typically at least 15-fold greater, most typically at least 20-fold greater, preferably at least 25-fold greater, and most preferably at least 30-fold greater, than with IL-12 treatment. Expression can be measured, e.g., with treatment of a population of substantially pure IL-17 producing cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, “IL-17-producing cell” includes a progenitor or precursor cell that is committed, in a pathway of cell development or cell differentiation, to differentiating into an IL-17-producing cell, as defined above. A progenitor or precursor cell to the IL-17 producing cell can be found in a draining lymph node (DLN). Additionally, “IL-17-producing cell” encompasses an IL-17-producing cell, as defined above, that has been, e.g., activated, e.g., by a phorbol ester, ionophore, and/or carcinogen, further differentiated, stored, frozen, desiccated, inactivated, partially degraded, e.g., by apoptosis, proteolysis, or lipid oxidation, or modified, e.g., by recombinant technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “isolated nucleic acid molecule” refers to a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the antibody nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the antibody where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression “control sequences” refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid is “operably linked” when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, “operably linked” means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the expressions “cell,” “cell line,” and “cell culture” are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words “transformants” and “transformed cells” include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it will be clear from the context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “polymerase chain reaction” or “PCR” refers to a procedure or technique in which minute amounts of a specific piece of nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond needs to be available, such that oligonucleotide primers can be designed; these primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. The 5′ terminal nucleotides of the two primers can coincide with the ends of the amplified material. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences, specific DNA sequences from total genomic DNA, and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA, bacteriophage or plasmid sequences, etc. See generally Mullis et al. (1987) \nCold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. \n51:263; Erlich, ed., (1989) PCR T\nECHNOLOGY \n(Stockton Press, N.Y.) As used herein, PCR is considered to be one, but not the only, example of a nucleic acid polymerase reaction method for amplifying a nucleic acid test sample comprising the use of a known nucleic acid as a primer and a nucleic acid polymerase to amplify or generate a specific piece of nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “germline sequence” refers to a sequence of unrearranged immunoglobulin DNA sequences. Any suitable source of unrearranged immunoglobulin DNA may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Inhibitors” and “antagonists” or “activators” and “agonists” refer to inhibitory or activating molecules, respectively, e.g., for the activation of, e.g., a ligand, receptor, cofactor, a gene, cell, tissue, or organ. A modulator of, e.g., a gene, a receptor, a ligand, or a cell, is a molecule that alters an activity of the gene, receptor, ligand, or cell, where activity can be activated, inhibited, or altered in its regulatory properties. The modulator may act alone, or it may use a cofactor, e.g., a protein, metal ion, or small molecule Inhibitors are compounds that decrease, block, prevent, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or down regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. Activators are compounds that increase, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, sensitize, or up regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. An inhibitor may also be defined as a composition that reduces, blocks, or inactivates a constitutive activity. An “agonist” is a compound that interacts with a target to cause or promote an increase in the activation of the target. An “antagonist” is a compound that opposes the actions of an agonist. An antagonist prevents, reduces, inhibits, or neutralizes the activity of an agonist. An antagonist can also prevent, inhibit, or reduce constitutive activity of a target, e.g., a target receptor, even where there is no identified agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo examine the extent of inhibition, for example, samples or assays comprising a given, e.g., protein, gene, cell, or organism, are treated with a potential activating or inhibiting agent and are compared to control samples without the agent. Control samples, i.e., not treated with agent, are assigned a relative activity value of 100%. Inhibition is achieved when the activity value relative to the control is about 90% or less, typically 85% or less, more typically 80% or less, most typically 75% or less, generally 70% or less, more generally 65% or less, most generally 60% or less, typically 55% or less, usually 50% or less, more usually 45% or less, most usually 40% or less, preferably 35% or less, more preferably 30% or less, still more preferably 25% or less, and most preferably less than 25%. Activation is achieved when the activity value relative to the control is about 110%, generally at least 120%, more generally at least 140%, more generally at least 160%, often at least 180%, more often at least 2-fold, most often at least 2.5-fold, usually at least 5-fold, more usually at least 10-fold, preferably at least 20-fold, more preferably at least 40-fold, and most preferably over 40-fold higher.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndpoints in activation or inhibition can be monitored as follows. Activation, inhibition, and response to treatment, e.g., of a cell, physiological fluid, tissue, organ, and animal or human subject, can be monitored by an endpoint. The endpoint may comprise a predetermined quantity or percentage of, e.g., an indicia of inflammation, oncogenicity, or cell degranulation or secretion, such as the release of a cytokine, toxic oxygen, or a protease. The endpoint may comprise, e.g., a predetermined quantity of ion flux or transport; cell migration; cell adhesion; cell proliferation; potential for metastasis; cell differentiation; and change in phenotype, e.g., change in expression of gene relating to inflammation, apoptosis, transformation, cell cycle, or metastasis (see, e.g., Knight (2000) \nAnn. Clin. Lab. Sci. \n30:145-158; Hood and Cheresh (2002) \nNature Rev. Cancer \n2:91-100; Timme, et al. (2003) \nCurr. Drug Targets \n4:251-261; Robbins and Itzkowitz (2002) \nMed. Clin. North Am. \n86:1467-1495; Grady and Markowitz (2002) \nAnnu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. \n3:101-128; Bauer, et al. (2001) \nGlia \n36:235-243; Stanimirovic and Satoh (2000) \nBrain Pathol. \n10:113-126).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn endpoint of inhibition is generally 75% of the control or less, preferably 50% of the control or less, more preferably 25% of the control or less, and most preferably 10% of the control or less. Generally, an endpoint of activation is at least 150% the control, preferably at least two times the control, more preferably at least four times the control, and most preferably at least 10 times the control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Ligand” refers, e.g., to a small molecule, peptide, polypeptide, and membrane associated or membrane-bound molecule, or complex thereof, that can act as an agonist or antagonist of a receptor. “Ligand” also encompasses an agent that is not an agonist or antagonist, but that can bind to the receptor. Moreover, “ligand” includes a membrane-bound ligand that has been changed, e.g., by chemical or recombinant methods, to a soluble version of the membrane-bound ligand. By convention, where a ligand is membrane-bound on a first cell, the receptor usually occurs on a second cell. The second cell may have the same or a different identity as the first cell. A ligand or receptor may be entirely intracellular, that is, it may reside in the cytosol, nucleus, or some other intracellular compartment. The ligand or receptor may change its location, e.g., from an intracellular compartment to the outer face of the plasma membrane. The complex of a ligand and receptor is termed a “ligand receptor complex.” Where a ligand and receptor are involved in a signaling pathway, the ligand occurs at an upstream position and the receptor occurs at a downstream position of the signaling pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Small molecules” are provided for the treatment of physiology and disorders of the hair follicle. “Small molecule” is defined as a molecule with a molecular weight that is less than 10 kD, typically less than 2 kD, and preferably less than 1 kD. Small molecules include, but are not limited to, inorganic molecules, organic molecules, organic molecules containing an inorganic component, molecules comprising a radioactive atom, synthetic molecules, peptide mimetics, and antibody mimetics. As a therapeutic, a small molecule may be more permeable to cells, less susceptible to degradation, and less apt to elicit an immune response than large molecules. Small molecules, such as peptide mimetics of antibodies and cytokines, as well as small molecule toxins are described (see, e.g., Casset, et al. (2003) \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. \n307:198-205; Muyldermans (2001) \nJ. Biotechnol. \n74:277-302; Li (2000) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n18:1251-1256; Apostolopoulos, et al. (2002) \nCurr. Med. Chem. \n9:411-420; Monfardini, et al. (2002) \nCurr. Pharm. Des. \n8:2185-2199; Domingues, et al. (1999) \nNat. Struct. Biol. \n6:652-656; Sato and Sone (2003) \nBiochem. J. \n371:603-608; U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,482 issued to Stewart, et al).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Specifically” or “selectively” binds, when referring to a ligand/receptor, antibody/antigen, or other binding pair, indicates a binding reaction which is determinative of the presence of the protein in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated conditions, a specified ligand binds to a particular receptor and does not bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody, or binding composition derived from the antigen-binding site of an antibody, of the contemplated method binds to its antigen with an affinity that is at least two fold greater, preferably at least ten times greater, more preferably at least 20-times greater, and most preferably at least 100-times greater than the affinity with unrelated antigens. In a preferred embodiment the antibody will have an affinity that is greater than about 10\n9 \nliters/mol, as determined, e.g., by Scatchard analysis (Munsen, et al. (1980) \nAnalyt. Biochem. \n107:220-239).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “immunomodulatory agent” refers to natural or synthetic agents that suppress or modulate an immune response. The immune response can be a humoral or cellular response. Immunomodulatory agents encompass immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Immunosuppressive agents,” “immunosuppressive drugs,” or “immunosuppressants” as used herein are therapeutics that are used in immunosuppressive therapy to inhibit or prevent activity of the immune system. Clinically they are used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs and tissues (e.g. bone marrow, heart, kidney, liver), and/or in the treatment of autoimmune diseases or diseases that are most likely of autoimmune origin (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis). Immunosuppressive drugs can be classified into four groups: glucocorticoids cytostatics; antibodies (including Biological Response Modifiers or DMARDs); drugs acting on immunophilins; other drugs, including known chemotherpeutic agents used in the treatment of proliferative disorders. For multiple sclerosis, in particular, the antibodies of the present invention can be administered in conjunction with a new class of myelin binding protein-like therapeutics, known as copaxones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Anti-inflammatory agents” or “anti-inflammatory drugs”, is used to represent both steroidal and non-steroidal therapeutics. Steroids, also known as corticosteroids, are drugs that closely resemble cortisol, a hormone produced naturally by adrenal glands. Steroids are used as the main treatment for certain inflammatory conditions, such as: Systemic vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels); and Myositis (inflammation of muscle). Steroids might also be used selectively to treat inflammatory conditions such as: rheumatoid arthritis (chronic inflammatory arthritis occurring in joints on both sides of the body); systemic lupus erythematosus (a generalized disease caused by abnormal immune system function); Sjögren's syndrome (chronic disorder that causes dry eyes and a dry mouth).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, usually abbreviated to NSAIDs, are drugs with analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects—they reduce pain, fever and inflammation. The term “non-steroidal” is used to distinguish these drugs from steroids, which (amongst a broad range of other effects) have a similar eicosanoid-depressing, anti-inflammatory action. NSAIDs are generally indicated for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions: rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis; inflammatory arthropathies (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome); acute gout; dysmenorrhoea; metastatic bone pain; headache and migraine; postoperative pain; mild-to-moderate pain due to inflammation and tissue injury; pyrexia; and renal colic. NSAIDs include salicylates, arlyalknoic acids, 2-arylpropionic acids (profens), N-arylanthranilic acids (fenamic acids), oxicams, coxibs, and sulphonanilides.\n\n\n \nII. General\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides engineered anti-IL-23 antibodies and uses thereof to treat inflammatory, autoimmune, and proliferative disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of cytokines have a role in the pathology or repair of neurological disorders. IL-6, IL-17, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have been associated with multiple sclerosis (Matusevicius, et al. (1999) \nMultiple Sclerosis \n5:101-104; Lock, et al. (2002) \nNature Med. \n8:500-508). IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) plays a role in ALS, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease (Hoozemans, et al. (2001) \nExp. Gerontol. \n36:559-570; Griffin and Mrak (2002) \nJ. Leukocyte Biol. \n72:233-238; Ilzecka, et al. (2002) \nCytokine \n20:239-243). TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), and IL-17 appear to modulate response to brain ischemia (see, e.g., Kostulas, et al. (1999) Stroke 30:2174-2179; L1, et al. (2001) \nJ. Neuroimmunol. \n116:5-14). Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) is associated with ALS (Cleveland and Rothstein (2001) \nNature \n2:806-819).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInflammatory bowel disorders, e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and irritable bowel syndrome, are mediated by cells of the immune system and by cytokines. For example, Crohn's disease is associated with increased IL-12 and IFNγ, while ulcerative colitis is associated with increased IL-5, IL-13, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta). IL-17 expression may also increase in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (see, e.g., Podolsky (2002) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n347:417-429; Bouma and Strober (2003) \nNat. Rev. Immunol. \n3:521-533; Bhan, et al. (1999) \nImmunol. Rev. \n169:195-207; Hanauer (1996) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n334:841-848; Green (2003) \nThe Lancet \n362:383-391; McManus (2003) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n348:2573-2574; Horwitz and Fisher (2001) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n344:1846-1850; Andoh, et al. (2002) \nInt. J. Mol. Med. \n10:631-634; Nielsen, et al. (2003) \nScand. J. Gastroenterol. \n38:180-185; Fujino, et al. (2003) \nGut \n52:65-70).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInflammatory diseases of the skin, joints, CNS, as well as proliferative disorders elicit similar immune responses, thus IL-23 blockade should provide inhibition of these immune mediated inflammatory disorders, without comprising the host ability to fight systemic infections. Antagonizing IL-23 should relieve the inflammation associated with inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, Ulcerative Colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. Use of IL-23 inhibitors will also provide inhibition of proliferative disorders, e.g., cancer and autoimmune disorders e.g., multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, and SLE. Descriptions of IL-23 in these various disorders can be found in the following published PCT applications: WO 04/081190; WO 04/071517; WO 00/53631; and WO 01/18051, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe p19 subunit of IL-23 is a member of the ‘long chain’ family of hematopoietic cytokines (Oppmann et al. (2000) supra) and comprises four packed α-helices termed A, B, C and D, with an up-up-down-down topology. The 4 helices are connected by 3 polypeptide loops. The A-B and C-D loops are modeled to be relatively long as they connect parallel helices. The short B-C loop connects the antiparallel B and C helices. The p19 subunit of IL-23 is a member of the IL-6 family of helical cytokines. This family of cytokines bind to their cognate receptors through three conserved epitopes (site I, II and III; Bravo and Heath (2000) \nEMBO J. \n19:2399-2411). The p19 subunit interacts with three cytokine receptor subunits to form the competent signaling complex. When expressed in a cell, the p19 subunit first form a complex with the p40 subunit, which it shares with IL-12. As noted above, the p19p40 complex is secreted from the cell as a heterodimeric protein and is called IL-23 (See, e.g., Oppmann et al., supra). The cellular receptor complex required to transduce the IL-23 signal consists of two members of the tall signaling receptor subunits of the IL-6/IL-12 family of cytokines, the IL-23-specific IL-23R (see, e.g., Parham et al. supra) and the IL-12Rb1, that is shared with IL-12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsights into the structural basis of ‘long chain’ cytokine/receptor recognition have shown that although large areas of protein surface are buried in formation of cytokine-receptor complexes, the affinity of the interaction is dominated by a few, often tightly clustered amino acid residues forming an energetic ‘hot spot’ in the center of the binding interface. The identity of the residues that dominate the binding energy of a large protein-protein interface has been termed the ‘functional epitope’. The affinity of the interaction (and hence biological specificity) is consequently defined by the structural complementarity of the functional epitopes of ligand and receptor. Detailed mutagenesis studies have shown that the most significant residues that make up the functional epitopes of cytokines and receptors are hydrophobic contacts involving either non-polar side chains such as tryptophan, the aliphatic components of non-polar side chains or the polypeptide backbone. The non-polar ‘core’ is surrounded by a halo of polar residues of lesser importance for binding energy. Kinetic studies indicate that the primary role of the functional epitopes is to stabilize protein-protein interaction by decreasing the dissociation rate of the complex. It has been suggested that the initial contact between cytokine and receptor is dominated by random diffusion or ‘rolling’ of protein surfaces producing many unstable contacts. The complex is then stabilized when the functional epitopes of the receptor and ligand engage (see, e.g., Bravo and Heath, supra).\n\n\n \nIII. Generation of IL-23 Specific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAny suitable method for generating monoclonal antibodies may be used. For example, a recipient may be immunized with a linked or unlinked (e.g. naturally occurring) form of the IL-23 heterodimer, or a fragment thereof. Any suitable method of immunization can be used. Such methods can include adjuvants, other immunostimulants, repeated booster immunizations, and the use of one or more immunization routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable source of IL-23 can be used as the immunogen for the generation of the non-human antibody, specific for the p 19 subunit, of the compositions and methods disclosed herein. Such forms include, but are not limited whole protein, including linked and naturally occurring heterodimers, peptide(s), and epitopes, generated through recombinant, synthetic, chemical or enzymatic degradation means known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny form of the antigen can be used to generate the antibody that is sufficient to generate a biologically active antibody. Thus, the eliciting antigen may be a single epitope, multiple epitopes, or the entire protein alone or in combination with one or more immunogenicity enhancing agents known in the art. The eliciting antigen may be an isolated full-length protein, a cell surface protein (e.g., immunizing with cells transfected with at least a portion of the antigen), or a soluble protein (e.g., immunizing with only the extracellular domain portion of the protein). The antigen may be produced in a genetically modified cell. The DNA encoding the antigen may genomic or non-genomic (e.g., cDNA) and encodes at least a portion of the extracellular domain. As used herein, the term “portion” refers to the minimal number of amino acids or nucleic acids, as appropriate, to constitute an immunogenic epitope of the antigen of interest. Any genetic vectors suitable for transformation of the cells of interest may be employed, including but not limited to adenoviral vectors, plasmids, and non-viral vectors, such as cationic lipids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable method can be used to elicit an antibody with the desired biologic properties to inhibit IL-23. It is desirable to prepare monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from various mammalian hosts, such as mice, rodents, primates, humans, etc. Description of techniques for preparing such monoclonal antibodies may be found in, e.g., Stites, et al. (eds.) B\nASIC AND \nC\nLINICAL \nI\nMMUNOLOGY \n(4th ed.) Lange Medical Publications, Los Altos, Calif., and references cited therein; Harlow and Lane (1988) A\nNTIBODIES\n: A L\nABORATORY \nM\nANUAL \nCSH Press; Goding (1986) MONOCLONAL A\nNTIBODIES\n: P\nRINCIPLES AND \nP\nRACTICE \n(2d ed.) Academic Press, New York, N.Y. Thus, monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by a variety of techniques familiar to researchers skilled in the art. Typically, spleen cells from an animal immunized with a desired antigen are immortalized, commonly by fusion with a myeloma cell. See Kohler and Milstein (1976) \nEur. J. Immunol. \n6:511-519. Alternative methods of immortalization include transformation with Epstein Barr Virus, oncogenes, or retroviruses, or other methods known in the art. See, e.g., Doyle, et al. (eds. 1994 and periodic supplements) C\nELL AND \nT\nISSUE \nC\nULTURE\n: L\nABORATORY \nP\nROCEDURES\n, John Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y. Colonies arising from single immortalized cells are screened for production of antibodies of the desired specificity and affinity for the antigen, and yield of the monoclonal antibodies produced by such cells may be enhanced by various techniques, including injection into the peritoneal cavity of a vertebrate host. Alternatively, one may isolate DNA sequences which encode a monoclonal antibody or a binding fragment thereof by screening a DNA library from human B cells according, e.g., to the general protocol outlined by Huse, et al. (1989) \nScience \n246:1275-1281.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable techniques involve selection of libraries of antibodies in phage or similar vectors. See, e.g., Huse et al., \nScience \n246:1275-1281 (1989); and Ward et al., \nNature \n341:544-546 (1989). The polypeptides and antibodies of the present invention may be used with or without modification, including chimeric or humanized antibodies. Frequently, the polypeptides and antibodies will be labeled by joining, either covalently or non-covalently, a substance which provides for a detectable signal. A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known and are reported extensively in both the scientific and patent literature. Suitable labels include radionuclides, enzymes, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, fluorescent moieties, chemiluminescent moieties, magnetic particles, and the like. Patents teaching the use of such labels include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,817,837; 3,850,752; 3,939,350; 3,996,345; 4,277,437; 4,275,149; and 4,366,241. Also, recombinant immunoglobulins may be produced, see Cabilly U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Queen et al. (1989) \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n86:10029-10033; or made in transgenic mice, see Mendez et al. (1997) \nNature Genetics \n15:146-156; also see Abgenix and Medarex technologies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies or binding compositions against predetermined fragments of IL-23 can be raised by immunization of animals with conjugates of the polypeptide, fragments, peptides, or epitopes with carrier proteins. Monoclonal antibodies are prepared from cells secreting the desired antibody. These antibodies can be screened for binding to normal or defective IL-23. These monoclonal antibodies will usually bind with at least a K\nd \nof about 1 μM, more usually at least about 300 nM, typically at least about 30 nM, preferably at least about 10 nM, more preferably at least about 3 nM or better, usually determined by ELISA. Suitable non-human antibodies may also be identified using the biologic assays described in Example 5, below.\n\n\n \nIV. Humanization of IL-23 Specific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAny suitable non-human antibody can be used as a source for the hypervariable region. Sources for non-human antibodies include, but are not limited to, murine, Lagomorphs (including rabbits), bovine, and primates. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which hypervariable region residues of the recipient are replaced by hypervariable region residues from a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance of the desired biological activity. For further details, see Jones et al. (1986) \nNature \n321:522-525; Reichmann et al. (1988) Nature 332:323-329; and Presta (1992) \nCurr. Op. Struct. Biol. \n2:593-596.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for recombinantly engineering antibodies have been described, e.g., by Boss et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397), Cabilly et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), Law et al. (European Patent Application Publication No. 438 310) and Winter (European Patent Application Publication No. 239400).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence variants of humanized anti-IL-23 antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the humanized anti-IL-23 antibody DNA, or by peptide synthesis. Such variants include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences shown for the humanized anti-IL-23 F(ab) (e.g. as in SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2). Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the humanized anti-IL-23 antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody polypeptide that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called “alanine scanning mutagenesis,” as described by Cunningham and Wells (1989) \nScience \n244: 1081-1085. Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (e.g., charged residues such as Arg, Asp, His, Lys, and Glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with IL-23 antigen. The amino acid residues demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, Ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include humanized anti-IL-23 antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other insertional variants of the humanized anti-IL-23 antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of humanized anti-IL-23 antibody of an enzyme or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody molecule removed and a different residue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable loops, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Hypervariable region residues or FR residues involved in antigen binding are generally substituted in a relatively conservative manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody. Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another type of amino acid variant is the substitution of residues to provide for greater chemical stability of the final humanized antibody. For example, an asparagine (N) residue may be changed to reduce the potential for formation of isoaspartate at any NG sequences within a rodent CDR. In one embodiment, the asparagine is changed to glutamine (Q). Isoaspartate formation may debilitate or completely abrogate binding of an antibody to its target antigen. Presta (2005) \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n116:731 at 734. In addition, methionine residues in rodent CDRs may be changed to reduce the possibility that the methionine sulfur would oxidize, which could reduce antigen binding affinity and also contribute to molecular heterogeneity in the final antibody preparation. Id. In one embodiment, the methionine is changed to alanine (A). Antibodies with such substitutions are subsequently screened to ensure that the substitutions do not decrease IL-23p19 binding affinity to unacceptable levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of humanized IL-23 specific antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrdinarily, amino acid sequence variants of the humanized anti-IL-23 antibody will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity with the original humanized antibody amino acid sequences of either the heavy or the light chain more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or homology with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the humanized anti-IL-23 residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or homology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanized antibody can be selected from any class of immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA, and IgE. Preferably, the antibody is an IgG antibody. Any isotype of IgG can be used, including IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, and IgG\n4\n. Variants of the IgG isotypes are also contemplated. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype. Optimization of the necessary constant domain sequences to generate the desired biologic activity is readily achieved by screening the antibodies in the biological assays described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, either class of light chain can be used in the compositions and methods herein. Specifically, kappa, lambda, or variants thereof are useful in the present compositions and methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable portion of the CDR sequences from the non-human antibody can be used. The CDR sequences can be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion of at least one residue such that the CDR sequence is distinct from the human and non-human antibody sequence employed. It is contemplated that such mutations would be minimal. Typically, at least 75% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the non-human CDR residues, more often 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable portion of the FR sequences from the human antibody can be used. The FR sequences can be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion of at least one residue such that the FR sequence is distinct from the human and non-human antibody sequence employed. It is contemplated that such mutations would be minimal. Typically, at least 75% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the human FR residues, more often 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDR and FR residues are determined according to the standard sequence definition of Kabat. Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Md. (1987). SEQ ID NOs: 5-16 and 31-48 show the heavy chain variable domain sequences of various mouse anti-human IL-23p19 antibodies, and SEQ ID NOs: 17-28 and 49-65 depict the light chain variable domain sequences. SEQ ID NOs: 66-68 are consensus sequences for heavy chain CDRs (CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3), and are comprised of the most common amino acid residue at each position in the heavy chain CDRs for the family of antibodies consisting of 7G10, 6H12, 13F11, 13B5, 7E2, 13G1, 11C10, 1E10, 30F11, 34E4, 5B12, 6H4, 9C9, 11B10, 30E1, 33D2, 20A9, 22E9, 29D5, 21A10 and 33B12. \nFIGS. 1A-1C\n provide a sequence lineup of heavy chains of various antibodies of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIGS. 2A-2C\n, the light chain CDRs of the antibodies of the present invention disclosed herein are grouped into three subfamilies, referred to as (a), (b) and (c). Light chain subfamily (a) consists of antibodies 7G10, 6H12, 13F11, 13B5, 7E2, 13G1, 11C10, 30F11, 34E4, 6H4, 33D2 and 33B12. Light chain subfamily (b) consists of antibodies 1E10, 20A9, 22E9, 29D5, 5B12, 9C9 and 11B10. Light chain subfamily (c) consists of antibodies 10H11, 19E9, 10G8, 39G2, 35F12, 49A10, 34F9 and 7D7. These light chain subfamilies were used to derive consensus CDR sequences of CDRL1(a), CDRL1(b) and CDRL1(c) (SEQ ID NOs: 69-71) and corresponding consensus sequences CDRL2 (SEQ ID NOs: 72-74) and CDRL3 (SEQ ID NOs: 75-77) for each subfamily. Consensus sequences for light chain CDRs are comprised of the most common amino acid residue at each position in the light chain CDRs for each subfamily of antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTables 2 and 3 define various domains of humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibodies 6H12, 7G10, 10H11 and 22E9, as well as and the light and heavy chain variable domains of several murine antibodies of the present invention. Residues 1-19 of SEQ ID NOs: 1-4 represent signal sequences for heavy and light strands of hum6H12 and hum7G10. Light chain constant domains of hum6H12 and hum7G10 are at residues 130-233 of SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4, respectively. Heavy chain constant domains of hum6H12 and hum 7G10 are at residues 135-464 of SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 3, respectively, with CH1 at residues 135-242, CH2+hinge at residues 243-357 and CH3 at residues 358-464. All other antibodies are presented as light and heavy chain variable regions (V\nL \nand V\nH\n), and thus lack signal sequences and constant domains.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention or binding fragments thereof comprise CDRs comprising one of several variable amino acids at certain positions. In one embodiment antibodies of the present invention, or binding fragments thereof, comprise the “CDR Variable” domains listed at SEQ ID NOs: 78-89. These “CDR Variable” sequences include the consensus sequence of each family of related antibodies as well as variable positions encompassing all observed sequence variants within that family. Such sequence variants are displayed in \nFIGS. 1A-1C\n and \n2\nA-\n2\nC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the variable amino acids in potential CDRs are selected from those amino acids appearing two or more times in the families reported herein. These antibodies are a subset of the “CDR Variable” antibodies described above in which amino acids that appear only once at a given position in a CDR in a given family of sequences are not included in the pool of potential CDRs. These “single occurrence” amino acid substitutions are readily determined, and thus excluded from the “CDR Variable” sequences, by simple inspection of \nFIGS. 1A-1C\n and \n2\nA-\n2\nC. This narrowed range of potential CDR sequences is referred to herein as a “multiple occurrence variable CDR.” This nomenclature is used herein for convenience in referring to this subset of the “CDR Variable” sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, potential CDRs are not limited to the “CDR Variable” sequences described above, but also include conservatively modified variants of any observed amino acid, as determined using the data of Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, potential CDRs include variants of any single sequence CDR disclosed herein, including consensus sequences SEQ ID NOs: 66-77, in which the variant comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more conservative amino acid substitutions relative to the disclosed sequence, as determined using the data of Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso contemplated are chimeric antibodies. As noted above, typical chimeric antibodies comprise a portion of the heavy and/or light chain identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al. (1984) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81: 6851-6855).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies are also useful in the present methods and compositions. As used herein, the term “bispecific antibody” refers to an antibody, typically a monoclonal antibody, having binding specificities for at least two different antigenic epitopes, e.g., IL-23p19 and IL-23p40. In one embodiment, the epitopes are from the same antigen. In another embodiment, the epitopes are from two different antigens. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. For example, bispecific antibodies can be produced recombinantly using the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain/light chain pairs. See, e.g., Milstein et al. (1983) \nNature \n305: 537-39. Alternatively, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. See, e.g., Brennan, et al. (1985) \nScience \n229: 81. Bispecific antibodies include bispecific antibody fragments. See, e.g., Hollinger, et al. (1993) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n90: 6444-48, Gruber, et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n152: 5368 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, different constant domains may be appended to the humanized V\nL \nand V\nH \nregions provided herein. For example, if a particular intended use of an antibody (or fragment) of the present invention were to call for altered effector functions, a heavy chain constant domain other than IgG1 may be used. Although IgG1 antibodies provide for long half-life and for effector functions, such as complement activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, such activities may not be desirable for all uses of the antibody. In such instances an IgG4 constant domain, for example, may be used.\n\n\n \nV. Biological Activity of Humanized Anti-IL-23\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies having the characteristics identified herein as being desirable in a humanized anti-IL-23 antibody can be screened for inhibitory biologic activity in vitro or suitable binding affinity. To screen for antibodies that bind to the epitope on human IL-23 (i.e. the p19 subunit) bound by an antibody of interest (e.g., those which block binding of the cytokine to its receptor), a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in A\nNTIBODIES\n, A L\nABORATORY \nM\nANUAL\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Antibodies that bind to the same epitope are likely to cross-block in such assays, but not all cross-blocking antibodies will necessarily bind at precisely the same epitope since cross-blocking may result from steric hindrance of antibody binding by antibodies bound at nearby, or even overlapping, epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, epitope mapping, e.g., as described in Champe et al. (1995) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270:1388-1394, can be performed to determine whether the antibody binds an epitope of interest. “Alanine scanning mutagenesis,” as described by Cunningham and Wells (1989) \nScience \n244: 1081-1085, or some other form of point mutagenesis of amino acid residues in human IL-23 may also be used to determine the functional epitope for an anti-IL-23 antibody of the present invention. Mutagenesis studies, however, may also reveal amino acid residues that are crucial to the overall three-dimensional structure of IL-23 but that are not directly involved in antibody-antigen contacts, and thus other methods may be necessary to confirm a functional epitope determined using this method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe epitope bound by a specific antibody may also be determined by assessing binding of the antibody to peptides comprising fragments of human IL-23p19 (SEQ ID NO: 39). A series of overlapping peptides encompassing the sequence of IL-23p19 may be synthesized and screened for binding, e.g. in a direct ELISA, a competitive ELISA (where the peptide is assessed for its ability to prevent binding of an antibody to IL-23p19 bound to a well of a microtiter plate), or on a chip. Such peptide screening methods may not be capable of detecting some discontinuous functional epitopes, i.e. functional epitopes that involve amino acid residues that are not contiguous along the primary sequence of the IL-23p19 polypeptide chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe epitope bound by antibodies of the present invention may also be determined by structural methods, such as X-ray crystal structure determination (e.g., WO2005/044853), molecular modeling and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, including NMR determination of the H-D exchange rates of labile amide hydrogens in IL-23 when free and when bound in a complex with an antibody of interest (Zinn-Justin et al. (1992) \nBiochemistry \n31, 11335-11347; Zinn-Justin et al. (1993) \nBiochemistry \n32, 6884-6891).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to X-ray crystallography, crystallization may be accomplished using any of the known methods in the art (e.g. Giege et al. (1994) \nActa Crystallogr\n. D50:339-350; McPherson (1990) \nEur. J. Biochem. \n189:1-23), including microbatch (e.g. Chayen (1997) \nStructure \n5:1269-1274), hanging-drop vapor diffusion (e.g. McPherson (1976) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n251:6300-6303), seeding and dialysis. It is desirable to use a protein preparation having a concentration of at least about 1 mg/mL and preferably about 10 mg/mL to about 20 mg/mL. Crystallization may be best achieved in a precipitant solution containing polyethylene glycol 1000-20,000 (PEG; average molecular weight ranging from about 1000 to about 20,000 Da), preferably about 5000 to about 7000 Da, more preferably about 6000 Da, with concentrations ranging from about 10% to about 30% (w/v). It may also be desirable to include a protein stabilizing agent, e.g. glycerol at a concentration ranging from about 0.5% to about 20%. A suitable salt, such as sodium chloride, lithium chloride or sodium citrate may also be desirable in the precipitant solution, preferably in a concentration ranging from about 1 mM to about 1000 mM. The precipitant is preferably buffered to a pH of from about 3.0 to about 5.0, preferably about 4.0. Specific buffers useful in the precipitant solution may vary and are well-known in the art (Scopes, Protein Purification: Principles and Practice, Third ed., (1994) Springer-Verlag, New York). Examples of useful buffers include, but are not limited to, HEPES, Tris, MES and acetate. Crystals may be grow at a wide range of temperatures, including 2° C., 4° C., 8° C. and 26° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody:antigen crystals may be studied using well-known X-ray diffraction techniques and may be refined using computer software such as X-PLOR (Yale University, 1992, distributed by Molecular Simulations, Inc.; see e.g. Blundell & Johnson (1985) \nMeth. Enzymol. \n114 & 115, H. W. Wyckoff et al., eds., Academic Press; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0014194), and BUSTER (Bricogne (1993) \nActa Cryst\n. D49:37-60; Bricogne (1997) \nMeth. Enzymol. \n276A:361-423, Carter & Sweet, eds.; Roversi et al. (2000) \nActa Cryst\n. D56:1313-1323), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional antibodies binding to the same epitope as an antibody of the present invention may be obtained, for example, by screening of antibodies raised against IL-23 for binding to the epitope, or by immunization of an animal with a peptide comprising a fragment of human IL-23 comprising the epitope sequence. Antibodies that bind to the same functional epitope might be expected to exhibit similar biological activities, such as blocking receptor binding, and such activities can be confirmed by functional assays of the antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody affinities (e.g. for human IL-23) may be determined using standard analysis. Preferred humanized antibodies are those which bind human IL-23p19 with a K\nD \nvalue of no more than about 1×10\n−7\n; preferably no more than about 1×10\n−8\n; more preferably no more than about 1×10\n−9\n; and most preferably no more than about 1×10\n−1\n° M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies and fragments thereof useful in the present compositions and methods are biologically active antibodies and fragments. As used herein, the term “biologically active” refers to an antibody or antibody fragment that is capable of binding the desired the antigenic epitope and directly or indirectly exerting a biologic effect. Typically, these effects result from the failure of IL-23 to bind its receptor. As used herein, the term “specific” refers to the selective binding of the antibody to the target antigen epitope. Antibodies can be tested for specificity of binding by comparing binding to IL-23 to binding to irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture under a given set of conditions. If the antibody binds to IL-23 at least 10, and preferably 50 times more than to irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture then it is considered to be specific. An antibody that “specifically binds” to IL-23 does not bind to proteins that do not comprise the IL-23-derived sequences, i.e. “specificity” as used herein relates to IL-23 specificity, and not any other sequences that may be present in the protein in question. For example, as used herein, an antibody that “specifically binds” to IL-23 will typically bind to FLAG-hIL-23, which is a fusion protein comprising IL-23 and a FLAG® peptide tag, but it does not bind to the FLAG® peptide tag alone or when it is fused to a protein other than IL-23.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL-23-specific binding compounds of the present invention, such as inhibitory IL-23p19 specific antibodies, can inhibit its biological activity in any manner, including but not limited to production of IL-1β and TNF by peritoneal macrophages and IL-17 by T\nH\n17 T cells (see Langrish et al. (2004) \nImmunol. Rev. \n202:96-105). Anti-IL-23p19 antibodies will also be able to inhibit the gene expression of IL-17A, IL-17F, CCL7, CCL17, CCL20, CCL22, CCR1, and GM-CSF (see Langrish et al. (2005) \nJ. Exp. Med. \n201:233-240). IL-23-specific binding compounds of the present invention, such as anti IL-23p19 antibodies, will also block the ability of IL-23 to enhance proliferation or survival of T\nH\n17 cells. Cua and Kastelein (2006) \nNat. Immunol. \n7:557-559. The inhibitory activity of engineered anti-IL-23p19 will be useful in the treatment of inflammatory, autoimmune, and proliferative disorders. Such disorders are described in PCT patent application publications WO 04/081190; WO 04/071517; WO 00/53631; and WO 01/18051, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n \nVI. Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare pharmaceutical or sterile compositions including an agonist or antagonist of IL-23, the cytokine analogue or mutein, antibody thereto, or nucleic acid thereof, is admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, see, e.g., \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences and U.S. Pharmacopeia: National Formulary\n, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of therapeutic and diagnostic agents may be prepared by mixing with physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers in the form of, e.g., lyophilized powders, slurries, aqueous solutions or suspensions (see, e.g., Hardman, et al. (2001) \nGoodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\n, McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y.; Gennaro (2000) \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy\n, Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, New York, N.Y.; Avis, et al. (eds.) (1993) \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications\n, Marcel Dekker, NY; Lieberman, et al. (eds.) (1990) \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets\n, Marcel Dekker, NY; Lieberman, et al. (eds.) (1990) \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems\n, Marcel Dekker, NY; Weiner and Kotkoskie (2000) \nExcipient Toxicity and Safety\n, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the antibody compositions, administered alone or in combination with an immunosuppressive agent, can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD\n50 \n(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED\n50 \n(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD\n50 \nand ED\n50\n. Antibodies exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED\n50 \nwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mode of administration is not particularly important. Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include oral, rectal, transmucosal, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. Administration of antibody used in the pharmaceutical composition or to practice the method of the present invention can be carried out in a variety of conventional ways, such as oral ingestion, inhalation, topical application or cutaneous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, parenteral, intraarterial or intravenous injection. Intravenous administration to the patient is preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternately, one may administer the antibody in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the antibody directly into an arthritic joint or pathogen-induced lesion characterized by immunopathology, often in a depot or sustained release formulation. Furthermore, one may administer the antibody in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with a tissue-specific antibody, targeting, for example, arthritic joint or pathogen-induced lesion characterized by immunopathology. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the afflicted tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelecting an administration regimen for a therapeutic depends on several factors, including the serum or tissue turnover rate of the entity, the level of symptoms, the immunogenicity of the entity, and the accessibility of the target cells in the biological matrix. Preferably, an administration regimen maximizes the amount of therapeutic delivered to the patient consistent with an acceptable level of side effects. Accordingly, the amount of biologic delivered depends in part on the particular entity and the severity of the condition being treated. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses of antibodies, cytokines, and small molecules are available (see, e.g., Wawrzynczak (1996) \nAntibody Therapy\n, Bios Scientific Pub. Ltd, Oxfordshire, UK; Kresina (ed.) (1991) \nMonoclonal Antibodies, Cytokines and Arthritis\n, Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y.; Bach (ed.) (1993) \nMonoclonal Antibodies and Peptide Therapy in Autoimmune Diseases\n, Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y.; Baert, et al. (2003) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n348:601-608; Milgrom, et al. (1999) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n341:1966-1973; Slamon, et al. (2001) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n344:783-792; Beniaminovitz, et al. (2000) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n342:613-619; Ghosh, et al. (2003) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n348:24-32; Lipsky, et al. (2000) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n343:1594-1602).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of the appropriate dose is made by the clinician, e.g., using parameters or factors known or suspected in the art to affect treatment or predicted to affect treatment. Generally, the dose begins with an amount somewhat less than the optimum dose and it is increased by small increments thereafter until the desired or optimum effect is achieved relative to any negative side effects. Important diagnostic measures include those of symptoms of, e.g., the inflammation or level of inflammatory cytokines produced. Preferably, a biologic that will be used is derived from the same species as the animal targeted for treatment, thereby minimizing an inflammatory, autoimmune, or proliferative response to the reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies, antibody fragments, and cytokines can be provided by continuous infusion, or by doses at intervals of, e.g., one day, one week, or 1-7 times per week. Doses may be provided intravenously, subcutaneously, topically, orally, nasally, rectally, intramuscular, intracerebrally, intraspinally, or by inhalation. A preferred dose protocol is one involving the maximal dose or dose frequency that avoids significant undesirable side effects. A total weekly dose is generally at least 0.05 μg/kg body weight, more generally at least 0.2 μg/kg, most generally at least 0.5 μg/kg, typically at least 1 μg/kg, more typically at least 10 μg/kg, most typically at least 100 μg/kg, preferably at least 0.2 mg/kg, more preferably at least 1.0 mg/kg, most preferably at least 2.0 mg/kg, optimally at least 10 mg/kg, more optimally at least 25 mg/kg, and most optimally at least 50 mg/kg (see, e.g., Yang, et al. (2003) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n349:427-434; Herold, et al. (2002) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n346:1692-1698; Liu, et al. (1999) \nJ. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psych. \n67:451-456; Portielji, et al. (20003) \nCancer Immunol. Immunother. \n52:133-144). The desired dose of a small molecule therapeutic, e.g., a peptide mimetic, natural product, or organic chemical, is about the same as for an antibody or polypeptide, on a moles/kg basis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “inhibit” or “treat” or “treatment” includes a postponement of development of the symptoms associated with autoimmune disease or pathogen-induced immunopathology and/or a reduction in the severity of such symptoms that will or are expected to develop. The terms further include ameliorating existing uncontrolled or unwanted autoimmune-related or pathogen-induced immunopathology symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, and ameliorating or preventing the underlying causes of such symptoms. Thus, the terms denote that a beneficial result has been conferred on a vertebrate subject with an autoimmune or pathogen-induced immunopathology disease or symptom, or with the potential to develop such a disease or symptom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” or “effective amount” refers to an amount of an IL-23p19 specific binding compound, e.g. and antibody, that when administered alone or in combination with an additional therapeutic agent to a cell, tissue, or subject is effective to prevent or ameliorate the autoimmune disease or pathogen-induced immunopathology associated disease or condition or the progression of the disease. A therapeutically effective dose further refers to that amount of the compound sufficient to result in amelioration of symptoms, e.g., treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of the relevant medical condition, or an increase in rate of treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of such conditions. When applied to an individual active ingredient administered alone, a therapeutically effective dose refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, a therapeutically effective dose refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously. An effective amount of therapeutic will decrease the symptoms typically by at least 10%; usually by at least 20%; preferably at least about 30%; more preferably at least 40%, and most preferably by at least 50%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for co-administration or treatment with a second therapeutic agent, e.g., a cytokine, steroid, chemotherapeutic agent, antibiotic, or radiation, are well known in the art, see, e.g., Hardman, et al. (eds.) (2001) \nGoodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, \n10\nth \ned., McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y.; Poole and Peterson (eds.) (2001) \nPharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice: A Practical Approach\n, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., PA; Chabner and Longo (eds.) (2001) \nCancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy\n, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., PA. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may also contain other immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents. Any suitable immunosuppressive agent can be employed, including but not limited to anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus (i.e., FK-506), sirolimus, interferons, soluble cytokine receptors (e.g., sTNRF and sIL-1R), agents that neutralize cytokine activity (e.g., inflixmab, etanercept), mycophenolate mofetil, 15-deoxyspergualin, thalidomide, glatiramer, azathioprine, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and the like. The pharmaceutical composition can also be employed with other therapeutic modalities such as phototherapy and radiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical veterinary, experimental, or research subjects include monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, horses, and humans.\n\n\n \nVII. Antibody Production\n\n\n \n \n \nFor recombinant production of the antibodies of the present invention, the nucleic acids encoding the two chains are isolated and inserted into one or more replicable vectors for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. In one embodiment, both the light and heavy chains of the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody of the present invention are expressed from the same vector, e.g. a plasmid or an adenoviral vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention may be produced by any method known in the art. In one embodiment, antibodies are expressed in mammalian or insect cells in culture, such as chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, mouse myeloma NSO cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, \nSpodoptera frugiperda \novarian (Sf9) cells. In one embodiment, antibodies secreted from CHO cells are recovered and purified by standard chromatographic methods, such as protein A, cation exchange, anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Resulting antibodies are concentrated and stored in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention are produced in yeast according to the methods described in WO2005/040395. Briefly, vectors encoding the individual light or heavy chains of an antibody of interest are introduced into different yeast haploid cells, e.g. different mating types of the yeast \nPichia pastoris\n, which yeast haploid cells are optionally complementary auxotrophs. The transformed haploid yeast cells can then be mated or fused to give a diploid yeast cell capable of producing both the heavy and the light chains. The diploid strain is then able to secret the fully assembled and biologically active antibody. The relative expression levels of the two chains can be optimized, for example, by using vectors with different copy number, using transcriptional promoters of different strengths, or inducing expression from inducible promoters driving transcription of the genes encoding one or both chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the respective heavy and light chains of a plurality of different anti-IL-23p19 antibodies (the “original” antibodies) are introduced into yeast haploid cells to create a library of haploid yeast strains of one mating type expressing a plurality of light chains, and a library of haploid yeast strains of a different mating type expressing a plurality of heavy chains. These libraries of haploid strains can be mated (or fused as spheroplasts) to produce a series of diploid yeast cells expressing a combinatorial library of antibodies comprised of the various possible permutations of light and heavy chains. The combinatorial library of antibodies can then be screened to determine whether any of the antibodies has properties that are superior (e.g. higher affinity for IL-23) to those of the original antibodies. See. e.g., WO2005/040395.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention are human domain antibodies in which portions of an antibody variable domain are linked in a polypeptide of molecular weight approximately 13 kDa. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Publication No. 2004/0110941. Such single domain, low molecular weight agents provide numerous advantages in terms of ease of synthesis, stability, and route of administration.\n\n\n \nVIII. Uses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods for using engineered anti-IL-23 for the treatment and diagnosis of inflammatory disorders and conditions, e.g., of the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract, as well as autoimmune and proliferative disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods are provided for the treatment of, e.g., multiple sclerosis (MS), including relapsing-remitting MS and primary progressive MS, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a.k.a. ALS; Lou Gehrig's disease), ischemic brain injury, prion diseases, and HIV-associated dementia. Also provided are methods for treating neuropathic pain, posttraumatic neuropathies, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), peripheral polyneuropathy, and nerve regeneration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProvided are methods for treating or ameliorating one or more of the following features, symptoms, aspects, manifestations, or signs of multiple sclerosis, or other inflammatory disorder or condition of the nervous system: brain lesions, myelin lesions, demyelination, demyelinated plaques, visual disturbance, loss of balance or coordination, spasticity, sensory disturbances, incontinence, pain, weakness, fatigue, paralysis, cognitive impairment, bradyphrenia, diplopia, optic neuritis, paresthesia, gait ataxia, fatigue, Uhtoff's symptom, neuralgia, aphasia, apraxia, seizures, visual-field loss, dementia, extrapyramidal phenomena, depression, sense of well-being, or other emotional symptoms, chronic progressive myelopathy, and a symptom detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including gadolinium-enhancing lesions, evoked potential recordings, or examination of cerebrospinal fluid (see, e.g., Kenealy et al. (2003) \nJ. Neuroimmunol. \n143:7-12; Noseworthy et al. (2000) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n343:938-952; Miller et al. (2003) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n348:15-23; Chang et al. (2002) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n346:165-173; Bruck and Stadelmann (2003) \nNeurol. Sci. \n24 Suppl. 5:S265-S267).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the present invention provides methods for treating and diagnosing inflammatory bowel disorders, e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. Provides are methods for treating or ameliorating one or more of the following symptoms, aspects, manifestations, or signs of an inflammatory bowel disorder: malabsorption of food, altered bowel motility, infection, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, signs of malnutrition, perianal disease, abdominal mass, and growth failure, as well as intestinal complications such as stricture, fistulas, toxic megacolon, perforation, and cancer, and including endoscopic findings, such as, friability, aphthous and linear ulcers, cobblestone appearance, pseudopolyps, and rectal involvement and, in addition, anti-yeast antibodies (see, e.g., Podolsky, supra; Hanauer, supra; Horwitz and Fisher, supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso contemplated is treatment of inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and type I diabetes, and proliferative disorders such as cancer (see, e.g., PCT patent applications WO 04/081190; WO 04/071517; WO 00/53631; and WO 01/18051).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IL-23p19 binding compounds of the present invention can also be used in combination with one or more antagonists of other cytokines (e.g. antibodies), including but not limited to, IL-17A, IL-1β, IL-6 and TGF-β. See, e.g., Veldhoen (2006) \nImmunity \n24:179-189; Dong (2006) \nNat. Rev. Immunol. \n6(4):329-333. In various embodiments, an IL-23p19 binding compound of the invention is administered before, concurrently with, or after administration of the another antagonist or antagonists, such as an anti-IL-17A antibody. In one embodiment, an IL-17A binding compound is used in treatment of the acute early phase of an adverse immune response (e.g. MS, Crohn's Disease) alone or in combination with an IL-23 antagonist antibody of the present invention. In the latter case, the IL-17A binding compound may be gradually decreased and treatment with the antagonist of IL-23 alone is continued to maintain suppression of the adverse response. Alternatively, antagonists to IL-1β, IL-6 and/or TGF-β may be administered concurrently, before or after an IL-23p19 binding compound of the present invention. See Cua and Kastelein (2006) \nNat. Immunol. \n7:557-559; Tato and O'Shea (2006) \nNature \n441:166-168; Iwakura and Ishigame (2006) \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n116:1218-1222.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe broad scope of this invention is best understood with reference to the following examples, which are not intended to limit the inventions to the specific embodiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll citations herein are incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany modifications and variations of this invention can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The specific embodiments described herein are offered by way of example only, and the invention is to be limited by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled; and the invention is not to be limited by the specific embodiments that have been presented herein by way of example.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nGeneral Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nStandard methods in molecular biology are described (Maniatis et al.

The VH subgroups are listed in M.-P. Lefranc, “Nomenclature of the Human Immunoglobulin Heavy (IGH) Genes”, Experimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, 18:100-116, 2001. 6H12 and 7G10 antibodies scored highest against human heavy chain germline DP-14 in subgroup VH1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor all non-human antibodies, the VL sequences were of the kappa subclass of VL. The amino acid sequence of the non-human VL domain was compared to a group of four human VL kappa germline amino acid sequences. The group of four is comprised of one representative from each of four established human VL subgroups listed in V. Barbie & M.-P. Lefranc, “The Human Immunoglobulin Kappa Variable (IGKV) Genes and Joining (IGKJ) Segments”, \nExperimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, \n15:171-183, 1998 and M.-P. Lefranc, “Nomenclature of the Human Immunoglobulin Kappa (IGK) Genes”, \nExperimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, \n18:161-174, 2001. The four subgroups also correspond to the four subgroups listed in Kabat et al. “Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest”, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Pub. 91-3242, 5th Ed., 1991, pp. 103-130. 6H12 and 7G10 antibodies scored highest against human light chain germline Z-012 in subgroup VLkI.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the target amino acid sequences of the variable heavy and light chains were determined, plasmids encoding the full-length humanized antibody were generated. Starting with a plasmid encoding a humanized anti-IL-10 antibody having VH3 DP-46 and VLkI Z-012 germline frameworks, the plasmids were altered using Kunkel mutagenesis (see, e.g., Kunkel T A. (1985) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A \n82:488-492) to change the DNA sequence to the target humanized 6H12 or 7G10 sequences. Simultaneously, codon optimization was incorporated into the changes to provide for potentially optimal expression. The resulting humanized heavy and light chain sequences, including signal sequences, are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2 (antibody 6H12) and at SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 4 (for antibody 7G10), respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn analogous procedure was performed to determine the proper human frameworks for humanization of antibodies 10H11 and 22E9. Antibody 10H11 scored highest against human antibody heavy chain germline DP-46 in subgroup VH3 and light chain germline Z-A27 in subgroup VLkIII. Antibody 22E9 scored highest against human antibody heavy chain germline DP-14 in subgroup VH1 and light chain germline Z-B3 in subgroup VLkIV. The resulting humanized heavy and light chain variable domain sequences are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 90 and 91 (antibody 10H11) and at SEQ ID NOs: 92 and 93 (for antibody 22E9), respectively.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nDetermining the Equilibrium Dissociation Constant (K\nD\n) for Humanized Anti-Human IL-23 Using KinExA Technology\n\n\n \n \n \nThe equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) for anti human IL-23 antibodies were determined using the KinExA 3000 instrument (Sapidyne Instruments Inc., www.sapidyne.com). KinExA uses the principle of the Kinetic Exclusion Assay method based on measuring the concentration of uncomplexed antibody in a mixture of antibody, antigen and antibody-antigen complex. The concentration of free antibody is measured by exposing the mixture to a solid-phase immobilized antigen for a very brief period of time. In practice, this is accomplished by flowing the solution phase antigen-antibody mixture past antigen-coated particles trapped in a flow cell. Data generated by the instrument are analyzed using custom software. Equilibrium constants are calculated using a mathematical theory based on the following assumptions:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. The binding follows the reversible binding equation for equilibrium:\n\n\n \n \n \nk\non\n[Ab][Ag]=k\noff\n[AbAg]\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Antibody and antigen bind 1:1 and total antibody equals antigen-antibody complex plus free antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Instrument signal is linearly related to free antibody concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n98 micron PMMA particles (Sapidyne, Cat No. 440198) were coated with biotinylated rhIL-23 according to Sapidyne “Protocol for coating PMMA particles with biotinylated ligands having short or nonexistent linker arms”. For biotinylation of rhIL-23, EZ-link TFP PEO-biotin (Pierce, Cat. No. 21219) was used according to manufacturer's recommendations (Pierce bulletin 0874). All experimental procedures were done according to the KinExA 3000 manual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree forms of the heterodimeric IL-23 protein were used. Native or non-linked human IL-23 comprised of two chains, p19 and p40, that are covalently linked by a disulfide-bond. “Non-linked” IL-23 is comprised of human p40 coexpressed in 293T cells with human p19:FLAG-tag peptide and purified over an anti-FLAG peptide affinity column. By non-reducing SDS-PAGE the purified non-linked IL-23 showed presence of multimeric IL-23 forms at molecular weights corresponding to dimers, trimers, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Elastikine” IL-23 is a single-chain peptide comprised of FLAG-tag peptide:GLU-tag peptide:human p40:elasti-linker:human p19. The elasti-linker peptide sequence was derived from R&D Systems form of commercial IL-23. Elastikine was expressed in 293T cells and purified over an anti-FLAG peptide affinity column. By non-reducing SDS-PAGE the purified elastikine IL-23 showed presence of multimeric IL-23 forms at molecular weights corresponding to dimers, trimers, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA non-tagged, non-linked form of native human IL-23p19/p40 coexpressed in SF9 cells was purchased from eBioscience (CAT No. 34-8239). By non-reducing SDS-PAGE the purified eBioscience human IL-23 did not show presence of multimeric IL-23 forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll runs were done in duplicate under the following conditions: Sample volume: 1.5 mL; Sample flow rate: 0.25 mL/min; Label volume: 0.5 mL; Label flow rate: 0.25 mL/min; mAb conc.: 0.1 nM; Highest Ag (hIL-23) conc.: 4.0 nM; Lowest Ag (hIL-23) conc.: 3.91 pM. Two-fold serial dilutions of the antigen were prepared and mixed with the antibody at constant concentration. The mixture was incubated for 2 hr at room temperature to equilibrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 4 shows the results of the KinExA analysis.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\nD \nValues Determined by KinExa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman IL-23\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nK\nD\n(pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nelastikine\n\n\n6H12\n\n\n54, 48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nnon-linked\n\n\n6H12\n\n\n>1200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\neBioscience\n\n\n6H12\n\n\n>1000, >920 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nelastikine\n\n\nhu6H12\n\n\n28, 36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nelastikine\n\n\n7G10\n\n\n 41, 9.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nelastikine\n\n\nhu7G10\n\n\n49, 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nelastikine\n\n\n39G2\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nnon-linked\n\n\n39G2\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\neBioscience\n\n\n39G2\n\n\n620\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nelastikine\n\n\n35F12\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\neBioscience\n\n\n35F12\n\n\n>700\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nelastikine\n\n\n13B5\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\neBioscience\n\n\n13B5\n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nelastikine\n\n\n7D7\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nelastikine\n\n\n3D7\n\n\n0.84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nelastikine\n\n\n49A10\n\n\n7.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nelastikine\n\n\n13F11\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nelastikine\n\n\n33B12\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nDetermining the Equilibrium Dissociation Constant (K\nD\n) for Humanized Anti-human IL-23p19 Antibodies Using BIAcore Technology\n\n\n \n \n \nAll ligands (anti-IL-23 mAbs) were immobilized on a BIAcore CM5 sensor chip using standard amine-coupling procedure. All experiments were carried out at 25° C. and at a flow-rate of 10 μL/min in PBS. All IL-23 forms were diluted in PBS to produce various concentrations. Kinetic constants for the various interactions were determined using BlAevaluation software 3.1. The K\nD \nwas determined using the calculated dissociation and association rate constants. Proteins were used at the following concentrations: anti-IL-23 mAb hu7G10 in PBS at 0.33 mg/mL; anti-IL-23 mAb hu6H12 in PBS at 0.2 mg/mL; bac-wt human IL-23 in PBS at 0.30 mg/mL; eBioscience human IL-23 in PBS at 0.10 mg/mL; N222Q human IL-23 in PBS at 0.33 mg/mL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the proteins noted above other forms were also used. “Bac-wt” human IL-23 is identical to “elastikine” human IL-23 in sequence. This IL-23 was expressed in SF9 cells and purified over an anti-FLAG peptide affinity column. By non-reducing SDS-PAGE the purified IL-23 did not show presence of multimeric IL-23 forms. “N222Q” human IL-23 is identical to “elastikine” human IL-23 in sequence except for alteration of Asn222 to Gln in the p40 subunit (GenBank Accession No. P29460).

The transfectant Ba/F3-2.210 cells proliferate in response to human IL-23 and the response can be inhibited by a neutralizing anti-IL-23 antibody. An antibody is titrated against a concentration of IL-23 chosen within the linear region of the dose-response curve, near plateau and above EC50. Proliferation, or lack thereof, is measured by colorimetric means using Alamar Blue, a growth indicator dye based on detection of metabolic activity. The ability of an antibody to neutralize IL-23 is assessed by its IC50 value, or concentration of antibody that induces half-maximal inhibition of IL-23 proliferation.\n\n\n \nIL-23R Transfectant Cell Line and Cell Culture\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCell line\n\n\nIL-23R expression\n\n\nIL-23 response\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBa/F3-2.2lo-hIL-23R\n\n\nhIL-23R, hIL-12RB1\n\n\nHuman, Cyno\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBa/F3 transfectants are maintained in RPMI-1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 10 ng/mL mouse IL-3. “Cyno” refers to cynomolgus monkey IL-23.\n\n\n \nProliferation Bioassay Medium\n\n\n \n \n \nBa/F3 proliferation bioassays were performed in RPMI-1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-Glutamine, and 50 μg/mL penicillin-streptomycin.\n\n\n \nProcedure\n\n\n \n \n \nAssays were performed in 96-well flat bottom plates (Falcon 3072 or similar).

An amino acid residue on IL-23p19 is considered to be within a given distance of the antibody (e.g. 4.0 Å or 5.0 Å) if the coordinates of any atom of the residue are within the given distance of the coordinates of any atom of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost of these contacted residues fall into two main clusters along the primary structure of IL-23p19, with the first cluster comprising residues 82-95 (in which 11 of 14 residues are within 5.0 Å of the antibody and 9 of 14 are within 4.0 Å) and the second cluster comprising residues 133-140 (in which 7 of 8 residues are within 4.0 Å of the antibody). These clusters define epitopes comprising stretches of 8 or more contiguous amino acid residues of IL-23p19 in which 50%, 70% and 85% or more of the residues are within 5.0 Å of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies binding to either or both of these clusters would be expected to block binding of antibody 7G10. Given the strong sequence homology between all six CDR sequences (see \nFIGS. 1A-1C\n and \n2\nA-\n2\nC), it is likely that the other antibodies comprising the “(a) light chain subfamily” (6H12, 33B12, 13F11, 13B5, 13G1, 11C10, 7E2, 30F11, 34E4, 6H4, 33D2) will also bind to substantially the same epitope in IL-23p19 as antibody 7G10. The consensus CDR sequences for the antibodies of the “(a) light chain subfamily” variable domain sequence are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 69, 72 and 75. Corresponding heavy chain variable domain consensus sequences are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 66-68. Antibodies binding to the same epitope as antibody 7G10 would be expected to exhibit similar biological activities, such as blocking Ba/F3 cell proliferation in the assay described at Example 5 and Table 6, albeit with perhaps somewhat variable affinities and IC50s.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 7 provides a brief description of the sequences in the sequence listing.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequence Identifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO:\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nhum6H12 HC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nhum6H12 LC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nhum7G10 HC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nhum7G10 LC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nm6H12 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nm7G10 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nm13F11 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nm13B5 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nm21A10 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nm33B12 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nm39G2 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nm35F12 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nm49A10 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nm3D7 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nm34F9 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nm7D7 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nm6H12 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nm7G10 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nm13F11 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nm13B5 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nm21A10 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\nm33B12 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\nm39G2 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\nm35F12 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\nm49A10 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\nm34F9 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\nm7D7 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\nm3D7 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\nHuman IL23p19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\nMurine IL-23p19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\nm13G1 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\nm11C10 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\nm7E2 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\nm30F11 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\nm34E4 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\nm6H4 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\nm33D2 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\nm1E10 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n\nm20A9 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\nm22E9 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\nm29D5 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\nm5B12 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\nm9C9 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\nm11B10 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\nm30E1 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\nm10G8 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n47\n\n\nm19E9 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\nm10H11 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\nm13G1 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\nm11C10 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\nm7E2 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\nm30F11 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\nm34E4 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\nm6H4 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\nm33D2 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\n\n\nm1E10 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n\nm20A9 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n58\n\n\nm22E9 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\nm29D5 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\nm5B12 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\nm9C9 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n62\n\n\nm11B10 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\nm10G8 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n64\n\n\nm19E9 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n\nm10H11 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n66\n\n\nCDR-H1 Consensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n67\n\n\nCDR-H2 Consensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\nCDR-H3 Consensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\nCDR-L1(a) Consensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\nCDR-L1(b) Consensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n71\n\n\nCDR-L1(c) Consensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n72\n\n\nCDR-L2(a) Consensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n73\n\n\nCDR-L2(b) Consensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n74\n\n\nCDR-L2(c) Consensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n75\n\n\nCDR-L3(a) Consensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n76\n\n\nCDR-L3(b) Consensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n77\n\n\nCDR-L3(c) Consensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n78\n\n\nCDR-H1 Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n79\n\n\nCDR-H2 Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n80\n\n\nCDR-H3 Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n81\n\n\nCDR-L1(a) Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n82\n\n\nCDR-L1(b) Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n83\n\n\nCDR-L1(c) Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n84\n\n\nCDR-L2(a) Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n85\n\n\nCDR-L2(b) Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n86\n\n\nCDR-L2(c) Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n87\n\n\nCDR-L3(a) Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n88\n\n\nCDR-L3(b) Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n89\n\n\nCDR-L3(c) Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n90\n\n\nhum10H11 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n91\n\n\nhum10H11 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n92\n\n\nhum22E9 V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n\nhum22E9 V\nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany modifications and variations of this invention can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

The invention further relates to diagnostic, prognostic, prophylactic and therapeutic methods and compositions useful in the treatment of cancers that express 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nCancer is the second leading cause of human death next to coronary disease. Worldwide, millions of people die from cancer every year. In the United States alone, as reported by the American Cancer Society, cancer causes the death of well over a half-million people annually, with over 1.2 million new cases diagnosed per year. While deaths from heart disease have been declining significantly, those resulting from cancer generally are on the rise. In the early part of the next century, cancer is predicted to become the leading cause of death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWorldwide, several cancers stand out as the leading killers. In particular, carcinomas of the lung, prostate, breast, colon, pancreas, ovary, and bladder represent the primary causes of cancer death. These and virtually all other carcinomas share a common lethal feature. With very few exceptions, metastatic disease from a carcinoma is fatal. Moreover, even for those cancer patients who initially survive their primary cancers, common experience has shown that their lives are dramatically altered. Many cancer patients experience strong anxieties driven by the awareness of the potential for recurrence or treatment failure. Many cancer patients experience physical debilitations following treatment. Furthermore, many cancer patients experience a recurrence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWorldwide, prostate cancer is the fourth most prevalent cancer in men. In North America and Northern Europe, it is by far the most common cancer in males and is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. In the United States alone, well over 30,000 men die annually of this disease—second only to lung cancer. Despite the magnitude of these figures, there is still no effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Surgical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, hormone ablation therapy, surgical castration and chemotherapy continue to be the main treatment modalities. Unfortunately, these treatments are ineffective for many and are often associated with undesirable consequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the diagnostic front, the lack of a prostate tumor marker that can accurately detect early-stage, localized tumors remains a significant limitation in the diagnosis and management of this disease. Although the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) assay has been a very useful tool, however its specificity and general utility is widely regarded as lacking in several important respects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProgress in identifying additional specific markers for prostate cancer has been improved by the generation of prostate cancer xenografts that can recapitulate different stages of the disease in mice. The LAPC (Los Angeles Prostate Cancer) xenografts are prostate cancer xenografts that have survived passage in severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice and have exhibited the capacity to mimic the transition from androgen dependence to androgen independence (Klein et al., 1997, Nat. Med. 3:402). More recently identified prostate cancer markers include PCTA-1 (Su et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93: 7252), prostate-specific membrane (PSM) antigen (Pinto et al., Clin Cancer Res 1996 Sep. 2 (9): 1445-51), STEAP (Hubert, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1999 Dec. 7; 96(25): 14523-8) and prostate stem cell antigen (161P2F10B) (Reiter et al., 1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95: 1735).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile previously identified markers such as PSA, PSM, PCTA and 161P2F10B have facilitated efforts to diagnose and treat prostate cancer, there is need for the identification of additional markers and therapeutic targets for prostate and related cancers in order to further improve diagnosis and therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 3 percent of adult malignancies. Once adenomas reach a diameter of 2 to 3 cm, malignant potential exists. In the adult, the two principal malignant renal tumors are renal cell adenocarcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis or ureter. The incidence of renal cell adenocarcinoma is estimated at more than 29,000 cases in the United States, and more than 11,600 patients died of this disease in 1998. Transitional cell carcinoma is less frequent, with an incidence of approximately 500 cases per year in the United States.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurgery has been the primary therapy for renal cell adenocarcinoma for many decades. Until recently, metastatic disease has been refractory to any systemic therapy. With recent developments in systemic therapies, particularly immunotherapies, metastatic renal cell carcinoma may be approached aggressively in appropriate patients with a possibility of durable responses. Nevertheless, there is a remaining need for effective therapies for these patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf all new cases of cancer in the United States, bladder cancer represents approximately 5 percent in men (fifth most common neoplasm) and 3 percent in women (eighth most common neoplasm). The incidence is increasing slowly, concurrent with an increasing older population. In 1998, there was an estimated 54,500 cases, including 39,500 in men and 15,000 in women. The age-adjusted incidence in the United States is 32 per 100,000 for men and eight per 100,000 in women. The historic male/female ratio of 3:1 may be decreasing related to smoking patterns in women. There were an estimated 11,000 deaths from bladder cancer in 1998 (7,800 in men and 3,900 in women). Bladder cancer incidence and mortality strongly increase with age and will be an increasing problem as the population becomes more elderly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost bladder cancers recur in the bladder. Bladder cancer is managed with a combination of transurethral resection of the bladder (TUR) and intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy. The multifocal and recurrent nature of bladder cancer points out the limitations of TUR. Most muscle-invasive cancers are not cured by TUR alone. Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion is the most effective means to eliminate the cancer but carry an undeniable impact on urinary and sexual function. There continues to be a significant need for treatment modalities that are beneficial for bladder cancer patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn estimated 130,200 cases of colorectal cancer occurred in 2000 in the United States, including 93,800 cases of colon cancer and 36,400 of rectal cancer. Colorectal cancers are the third most common cancers in men and women. Incidence rates declined significantly during 1992-1996 (−2.1% per year). Research suggests that these declines have been due to increased screening and polyp removal, preventing progression of polyps to invasive cancers. There were an estimated 56,300 deaths (47,700 from colon cancer, 8,600 from rectal cancer) in 2000, accounting for about 11% of all U.S. cancer deaths.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present, surgery is the most common form of therapy for colorectal cancer, and for cancers that have not spread, it is frequently curative. Chemotherapy, or chemotherapy plus radiation, is given before or after surgery to most patients whose cancer has deeply perforated the bowel wall or has spread to the lymph nodes. A permanent colostomy (creation of an abdominal opening for elimination of body wastes) is occasionally needed for colon cancer and is infrequently required for rectal cancer. There continues to be a need for effective diagnostic and treatment modalities for colorectal cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere were an estimated 164,100 new cases of lung and bronchial cancer in 2000, accounting for 14% of all U.S. cancer diagnoses. The incidence rate of lung and bronchial cancer is declining significantly in men, from a high of 86.5 per 100,000 in 1984 to 70.0 in 1996. In the 1990s, the rate of increase among women began to slow. In 1996, the incidence rate in women was 42.3 per 100,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLung and bronchial cancer caused an estimated 156,900 deaths in 2000, accounting for 28% of all cancer deaths. During 1992-1996, mortality from lung cancer declined significantly among men (−1.7% per year) while rates for women were still significantly increasing (0.9% per year). Since 1987, more women have died each year of lung cancer than breast cancer, which, for over 40 years, was the major cause of cancer death in women. Decreasing lung cancer incidence and mortality rates most likely resulted from decreased smoking rates over the previous 30 years; however, decreasing smoking patterns among women lag behind those of men. Of concern, although the declines in adult tobacco use have slowed, tobacco use in youth is increasing again.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment options for lung and bronchial cancer are determined by the type and stage of the cancer and include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. For many localized cancers, surgery is usually the treatment of choice. Because the disease has usually spread by the time it is discovered, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are often needed in combination with surgery. Chemotherapy alone or combined with radiation is the treatment of choice for small cell lung cancer; on this regimen, a large percentage of patients experience remission, which in some cases is long lasting. There is however, an ongoing need for effective treatment and diagnostic approaches for lung and bronchial cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn estimated 182,800 new invasive cases of breast cancer were expected to occur among women in the United States during 2000. Additionally, about 1,400 new cases of breast cancer were expected to be diagnosed in men in 2000. After increasing about 4% per year in the 1980s, breast cancer incidence rates in women have leveled off in the 1990s to about 110.6 cases per 100,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the U.S. alone, there were an estimated 41,200 deaths (40,800 women, 400 men) in 2000 due to breast cancer. Breast cancer ranks second among cancer deaths in women. According to the most recent data, mortality rates declined significantly during 1992-1996 with the largest decreases in younger women, both white and black. These decreases were probably the result of earlier detection and improved treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaking into account the medical circumstances and the patient's preferences, treatment of breast cancer may involve lumpectomy (local removal of the tumor) and removal of the lymph nodes under the arm; mastectomy (surgical removal of the breast) and removal of the lymph nodes under the arm; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; or hormone therapy. Often, two or more methods are used in combination. Numerous studies have shown that, for early stage disease, long-term survival rates after lumpectomy plus radiotherapy are similar to survival rates after modified radical mastectomy. Significant advances in reconstruction techniques provide several options for breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Recently, such reconstruction has been done at the same time as the mastectomy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLocal excision of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with adequate amounts of surrounding normal breast tissue may prevent the local recurrence of the DCIS. Radiation to the breast and/or tamoxifen may reduce the chance of DCIS occurring in the remaining breast tissue. This is important because DCIS, if left untreated, may develop into invasive breast cancer. Nevertheless, there are serious side effects or sequelae to these treatments. There is, therefore, a need for efficacious breast cancer treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere were an estimated 23,100 new cases of ovarian cancer in the United States in 2000. It accounts for 4% of all cancers among women and ranks second among gynecologic cancers. During 1992-1996, ovarian cancer incidence rates were significantly declining. Consequent to ovarian cancer, there were an estimated 14,000 deaths in 2000. Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are treatment options for ovarian cancer. Surgery usually includes the removal of one or both ovaries, the fallopian tubes (salpingo-oophorectomy), and the uterus (hysterectomy). In some very early tumors, only the involved ovary will be removed, especially in young women who wish to have children. In advanced disease, an attempt is made to remove all intra-abdominal disease to enhance the effect of chemotherapy. There continues to be an important need for effective treatment options for ovarian cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere were an estimated 28,300 new cases of pancreatic cancer in the United States in 2000. Over the past 20 years, rates of pancreatic cancer have declined in men. Rates among women have remained approximately constant but may be beginning to decline. Pancreatic cancer caused an estimated 28,200 deaths in 2000 in the United States. Over the past 20 years, there has been a slight but significant decrease in mortality rates among men (about −0.9% per year) while rates have increased slightly among women.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are treatment options for pancreatic cancer. These treatment options can extend survival and/or relieve symptoms in many patients but are not likely to produce a cure for most. There is a significant need for additional therapeutic and diagnostic options for cancers. These include the use of antibodies, vaccines, and small molecules as treatment modalities. Additionally, there is also a need to use these modilities as research tools to diagnose, detect, monitor, and further the state of the art in all areas of cancer treatment and studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic utility of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (G. Kohler and C. Milstein, Nature 256:495-497 (1975)) is being realized. Monoclonal antibodies have now been approved as therapies in transplantation, cancer, infectious disease, cardiovascular disease and inflammation. Different isotypes have different effector functions. Such differences in function are reflected in distinct 3-dimensional structures for the various immunoglobulin isotypes (P. M. Alzari et al., Annual Rev. Immunol., 6:555-580 (1988)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause mice are convenient for immunization and recognize most human antigens as foreign, mAbs against human targets with therapeutic potential have typically been of murine origin. However, murine mAbs have inherent disadvantages as human therapeutics. They require more frequent dosing as mAbs have a shorter circulating half-life in humans than human antibodies. More critically, the repeated administration of murine antibodies to the human immune system causes the human immune system to respond by recognizing the mouse protein as a foreign and generating a human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response. Such a HAMA response may result in allergic reaction and the rapid clearing of the murine antibody from the system thereby rendering the treatment by murine antibody useless. To avoid such affects, attempts to create human immune systems within mice have been attempted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInitial attempts hoped to create transgenic mice capable of responding to antigens with antibodies having human sequences (See Bruggemann et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 86:6709-6713 (1989)), but were limited by the amount of DNA that could be stably maintained by available cloning vehicles. The use of yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) cloning vectors led the way to introducing large germline fragments of human Ig locus into transgenic mammals. Essentially a majority of the human V, D, and J region genes arranged with the same spacing found in the human genome and the human constant regions were introduced into mice using YACs. One such transgenic mouse strain is known as XenoMouse® mice and is commercially available from Abgenix, Inc. (Fremont Calif.).\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides antibodies as well as binding fragments thereof and molecules engineered therefrom, that bind to 161P2F10B proteins and polypeptide fragments of 161P2F10B proteins.

Binding of each of biotinylated 161P2F10B MAbs on the UG-K3 cells were competed with excess amount of each of antibodies, biotinylated antibodies were detected by streptavidin-PE. The cells were analyzed using FACScan. MFI values from FACS were used for data analysis. A shown in the table, cells are highlighted to indicate self-competition (100% competition), the MFI value in these cells are background control for each biotinylated antibody. Additionally, cells with no color indicate that the two antibodies compete each other (low MFI), cells highlighted in gray (high MFI) indicate that the two antibodies bind to two distinct epitopes.

Domain mapping of 161P2F10B MAbs by immunoprecipitation. Tag5 expression constructs encoding either the full extracellular domain (ECD) of 161P2F10B (amino acids 46-875), the somatomedin-b-like domain (amino acids 46-157), the catalytic domain (amino acids 158-558), or the catalytic and nuclease domain (amino acids 158-875) were transfected into 293T cells and cellular lysates were made. These lysates were then used for immunoprecipitation with the indicated 161P2F10B MAbs or H3-1.5 control MAb (10 μg of MAb and 100-200 μg of cell lysate). Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates was then carried out using an anti-His polyclonal Ab that recognizes the His epitope tag present on each recombinant protein. The specific molecular weight band of each recombinant protein was identified by straight Western blotting of the lysates (upper right blot) and is indicated by an arrow. MAbs that bind to the full length ECD and to the somatomedin-b-like domain map to the somatomedin-b-like domain. MAbs that bind to the full length ECD and the catalytic domain, but not the catalytic+nuclease domain, map to the catalytic domain. MAbs that bind the full length ECD and to the catalytic+nuclease domain, but not to the catalytic domain, map to the nuclease domain. The lanes shown in the figure represent: \nlane\n 1.

Presented on the right is a summary table of selected 161P2F10B MAbs, their relative affinity as determined by BiaCore analysis on the full length ECD (amino acids 46-875), their epitope group as determined by a FACS based MAb competition assay, and their epitope domain as determined by immunoprecipitation assay using cell lysates containing either the full length ECD, the somatomedin-b-like domain (amino acids 46-157), the catalytic domain (amino acids 158-558), or the catalytic and nuclease domain (amino acids 158-875). Presented on the left is a schematic of the 161P2F10B protein and assignment of the MAbs groups. The presence of MAbs within a group was inferred by a BiaCore competition assay in which the ability of MAbs to bind simultaneously to the 161P2F10B protein is analyzed. Inability to bind simultaneously suggests the MAbs share the same or an overlapping epitope. Simultaneous binding suggests that the MAbs employed belong in different epitope groups and recognize distinct or non-overlapping regions. The location of MAb groups within each domain in the schematic is arbitrary; however, placement of Nuclease groups c, d, e, and the catalytic group in close and overlapping proximity to each other has been inferred from BiaCore competition data in which MAbs present in different groups compete with MAbs analyzed from a larger panel. These results show that 161P2F10B MAbs map to distinct regions of the extracellular domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 11\n. Cross reactivity of human MAbs on mouse 161P2F10B. 293T-mouse 161P2F10B and 293T-neo cells were used to test cross-reactivity of human mAbs with mouse 161P2F10B by FACS. 50 ul of MAbs at 2 ug/ml were incubated with 293T-mouse 161P2F10B or 293T-neo cells (50,000 cells/100 μl).

MAbs to 161P2F10B mediate saporin dependent killing in KU-812 cells. KU-812 cells are a CML cell line that expresses high levels of endogenous 161P2F10B. KU-812 cells (3000 cells/well) were seeded into a 96 well plate on \nday\n 1. The following day an equal volume of medium containing 2× concentration of the indicated primary antibody together with a 2-fold excess of anti-human (Hum-Zap) polyclonal antibody conjugated with saporin toxin (Advanced Targeting Systems, San Diego, Calif.) was added to each well.

Validation of the 161P2F10B Qa siRNA duplex in HepG2 cells. 2×105 cells were plated in 6 well plates in DMEM plus 10% FBS O.N. and subsequently treated with 20 nM of each indicated siRNA duplex (CT1 or 161P2F10B Qa) complexed with 1 □g/ml Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 72 h at 37° C. Then, cells were harvested with 10 mM EDTA and cell surface stained with 1/100 final dilution of PE conjugated anti-161P2F10B, 97A6 MAb from Immunotech Cat#PNIM3575 (open grey and open black profiles) or control IgG (solid grey profile) and analyzed by FACS (21A). In addition, replicate cells were lysed and equal amounts of each cell lysate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes and Western blotted with a mixture of specific 161P2F10B MAbs (H16-1.52, H16-1.68 and H16-1.92) at 1 μg/ml each (top) or anti-actin MAb, Sigma Cat#A5060 (bottom).

RNAi silencing of 161P2F10B inhibits cell growth. Cells endogenously expressing the 161P2F10B antigen (HepG2) or not expressing 161P2F10B (UMUC3) were treated with the indicated siRNA duplexes and concentrations. Cells were prepared as stated in \nFIG. 22\n and replated for a standard 3H-Thymidine incorporation assay (22A) or a colony growth assay (22B). Briefly, for the 3H-Thymidine incorporation assay, 2000 cells were replated in triplicate in DMEM plus 10% FBS, and 3H-Thymidine was added for 6 hours after which samples were harvested and incorporation of radioactivity was counted. Data are normalized to control CT1 siRNA treated cells at each oligo concentration. For the colony growth assay, 400 cells were replated in 12 well plates and allowed to grow for 14 days after which colonies were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet before the photographs were taken. Expression of 161P2F10B is indicated in the adjacent FACS charts showing expression of 161P2F10B in HepG2 cells (thick black line) by not in UMUC3 (thick black line). These data indicate that silencing 161P2F10B on the cell surface of HepG2 cells, but not on 161P2F10B-deficient UMUC3 cells, inhibits cell growth and proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 23\n. 161P2F10B silencing with RNAi inhibits cell migration and the Rho signal transduction pathway. 2×105 cells were plated in replicate 6-well plates in DMEM plus 10% FBS O.N. and subsequently treated with 10 nM of each indicated siRNA duplex complexed with 1 μg/ml Lipofectamine 2000 for 72 h at 37° C. Cells were harvested with 10 mM EDTA and replated in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS into the top chamber of collagen I pre-coated Boyden migration chambers (8 μm pore size). Ten (10) percent FBS containing DMEM media was used as chemoattractant in the lower chamber. Cells were allowed to migrate for 18 hours, then stained with Calcein AM and photographed at 4× magnification (23A). In parallel, replicate cells were cell surface stained to measure the 161P2F10B silencing level (23B, left panel). Replicate cells were also separately starved in DMEM plus 0.1% FBS O.N. and subsequently stimulated (or not) with 20 ng/ml HGF for 15 min before whole cell lysates were prepared. Equivalent amounts of each cell lysate were incubated with Rhotekin-agarose beads to “pull down” the GTP-bound Rho proteins (Rho in active conformation) following manufacturer's (Upstate Biotechnology) specifications. Active Rho pull downs or total whole cell lysate (to control protein loading) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes and Western blotted with a specific RhoB antibody. Overall, the data indicate that 161P2F10B cell surface silencing reduces the ability of the cells to migrate, correlating with a significant down regulation in Rho B activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 24\n. Relative expression and enzymatic activity of 161P2F10b mutants in recombinant Caki kidney cancer cells. Caki kidney cancer cells were infected with retrovirus containing either wildtype 161P2F10B cDNA, or point mutant cDNAs encoding either a threonine to serine mutation (T/S) at \namino acid\n 205, a threonine to alanine mutation (T/A) at \namino acid\n 205, or a aspartic acid to glutamic acid mutation (D/E) at \namino acid\n 80. Stably expressing cell lines were analyzed for 161P2F10B expression by flow cytometry with 97A6 (CD203c) MAb (25A) and for enzymatic activity with p-nTMP substrate (25B). The results show that mutation of \nthreonine\n 205 to aspartic acid or alanine abolishes the ability to cleave the substrate, demonstrating that \nthreonine\n 205 is critical to the enzymatic activity of 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 25\n. Over-expression of 161P2F10B suppresses ATP-induced intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in Caki-1 cells. Fura-2-loaded Caki-1 cells overexpressing either wild-type (wt) 161P2F10B, a catalytically inactive mutant (T205A), or only a control neomycin resistance gene (neo), were tested for their intracellular Ca2+ mobilization response over time to the purine ligands ATP (25A), ATPγ-S (non-hydrolsable ATP analog) (25B), AMP (25C), and adenosine (25D) using single cell fluorescent microscopic imaging. 5,000 cells of each cell line were plated on collagen coated multi-chambered glass slides and allowed to adhere overnight. After mounting the slides in the microscopic imaging system and initiating image acquisition (alternating 340 nm and 38 nM excitation), the reaction was started by adding the indicated compound (arrow) to a final concentration of 100 μM. Shown in each panel are approximately 15-30 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio traces representing individual cells in a microscopic field. The variation between panels in initiation of the Ca2+ response upon ligand addition was due to variations in the time necessary for the ligand to diffuse to the location of the cells within the field. ATP induced Ca2+ oscillatory waves in both Cak1-neo and Caki-1-161P2F10B catalytically inactive mutant cells. However, the response in Caki-1-161P2F10B wt cells was that of an initial Ca2+ flux that gradually decayed over time with minimal oscillatory waves of lower frequency and longer duration. The non-hydrolysable ATP analog ATPγS induced oscillatory Ca2+ waves in all cell lines. Adenosine and AMP did not induce Ca2+ response in any of the lines, suggesting that the ATP-mediated response is due to signaling through P2Y purinergic ATP receptors and not through receptors for adenosine or AMP, potential metabolites of ATP. Taken together these data suggest that it is the removal of ATP in the extracellular medium by 161P2F10B mediated-enzymatic cleavage that causes the suppressive effect. This assay enables the screening of compounds, drugs, antibodies, and proteins that would disrupt the pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase activity of 161P2F10B and alter the ATP and other purine nucleotide-mediated Ca2+ responses in 161P2F10B-expressing cells and tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 26\n. 161P2F10B ECD induces HUVEC tube formation. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were seeded in endothelial growth media (EGM) onto 200 μl of semi-solid Matrigel® in the presence of 0.1% FBS alone, 10% FBS alone, 0.1% FBS+161P2F10B ECD (1 μg/ml) or 0.1% FBS+control ECD (1 μg/ml). The cells were allowed to form tube networks for 7 hours and then photographed. The closed tube networks were quantitated in each well.

Requirement of 161P2F10B phosphodiesterase activity for HUVEC tube formation. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were seeded in endothelial growth media (EGM) onto 200 μl of semi-solid Matrigel® in the presence of 0.1% FBS alone, 10% FBS alone, 0.1% FBS+VEGF (50 ng/ml), 0.1% FBS+wild-type 161P2F10B WT ECD (0.1, 1 or 5 μg/ml), 0.1% FBS+non-catalytic mutant 161P2F10B D80E ECD (DE) (0.1, 1 or 5 μg/ml), or 0.1% FBS+catalytic mutant 161P2F10B T205A ECD (TA) (0.1, 1 or 5 μg/ml). The cells were allowed to form tube networks for 7 hours and then photographed. The closed tube networks were quantitated in each well. The results show that the phosphodiesterase activity of 161P2F10B is critical for the activity of the ECD in inducing the formation of tube networks in primary endothelial cells when plated on Matrigel®. Further, the RGD domain of the 161P2F10B ECD is also partially critical for the formation of tube networks in primary endothelial cells when plated on Matrigel®.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 28\n. 161P2F10B MAbs inhibit HUVEC tube formation.

SK-RC-01 cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml MAbs and then grown for 3-5 days in culture with 10% FBS. A 6-hour pulse of 3H-Thymidine was added to the cultures and the cells were then processed for incorporation of 3H-Thymidine. The level of inhibition indicated was calculated using the control MAb as the maximum total counts incorporated. The results show that the MAbs to 161P2F10B inhibit the proliferation of SK-RC-01 renal clear cell cancer cells (45-76%) relative to control MAb.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 31\n. Effect of 161P2F10B MAbs on kidney cancer cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis. RFX-393 renal cancer cells were incubated with 20 ug/ml MAbs as indicated (or 5 ug/ml EGFR MAb M225) and then grown for 6 days in culture with 10% FBS. A 6-hour pulse of 3H-Thymidine was added to the cultures and the cells were then processed for incorporation of 3H-Thymidine. The level of inhibition indicated was calculated using the control MAb as the maximum total counts incorporated. For the survival assay (MTS), a small amount of the Solution Reagent from the kit was added directly to cell culture wells, followed by incubation for 1-4 hours, then recording absorbance at 490 nm with a 96-well plate reader. The quantity of colored formazan product as measured by the amount of 490 nm absorbance is directly proportional to the mitochondrial activity and/or the number of living cells in culture. The % inhibition was calculated relative to a control MAb. For the apoptosis assay, the same cell lysates prepared for the MTS assay were used in a nucleosome release assay (cell death ELISA). The level of apoptosis is recorded as the % induction relative to control MAb. The more potent MAbs affect all three assays to the highest degrees. The results indicate that the MAbs to 161P2F10B inhibit proliferation of RXF-393 renal cancer clear cells, reduce their cell survival capacity and induce the apoptotic program.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 32\n. 161P2F10B MAbs dose-dependently inhibit HUVEC tube formation.

The results show that HGF stimulates the invasion of A-704 cells, and that the MAbs to 161P2F10B (H16-1.93) inhibits the cell invasion in both the HGF treated cells and the untreated cells. The results demonstrate that MAbs to 161P2F10B inhibit the invasion of A-704 cells through Matrigel®, and that treatment of the cells with Hepatocyte Growth Factor potentiates the cell invasion which is sensitive to inhibition with MAbs to 161P2F10B. The results are graphically displayed in \nFIG. 35B\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 36\n. 161P2F10B dimerization on KU-812 cells. KU-812 cells (2×105) were incubated with increasing concentrations of ethylene glycol bis[succinimidylsuccinate] (EGS) in PBS as indicated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1% NP-40), subjected to 4-12% gradient non-reducing SDS-PAGE, and then Western blotted for 161P2F10B using a 1 ug/ml MAb mixture (H16-1.52, H16-1.68 and H16-1.92). The results indicate that 161P2F10B is dimeric on the cell surface, and that this property may be required for full enzymatic activity and other functional activities of 161P2F10B when expressed on the surface of tumor cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 37\n. Detection of 161P2F10B protein in cancer patient specimens by IHC. Briefly, frozen tissues were cut into 6 micron sections and mounted on glass slides. The sections were dried for 2 hours at room temperature, fixed for 8 minutes in acetone and subsequently allowed to dry. Sections were then incubated in 161P2F10B antibody, M16-41(3)50, for 3 hours at room temperature. The slides were washed three times in buffer and further incubated with DAKO EnVision+™ peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin secondary antibody (DAKO Corporation, Carpenteria, Calif.) for 1 hour. The sections were then washed in buffer, developed using a DAB kit (SIGMA Chemicals), counterstained using hematoxylin, and analyzed by bright field microscopy. The results show expression of 161P2F10B in the tumor cells of hepatocellular carcinoma (37A and 37B) as indicated by the brown coloration of the cells. Serial sections with no incubation in M16-41(3)50 had no staining (37C and 37D). These results indicate that 161P2F10B is expressed in human liver cancers and that antibodies directed to this antigen are useful as diagnostic reagents.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nOutline of Sections\n\n\nI.)

Definitions:\n\n\n \n \n \nUnless otherwise defined, all terms of art, notations and other scientific terms or terminology used herein are intended to have the meanings commonly understood by those of skill in the art to which this invention pertains. In some cases, terms with commonly understood meanings are defined herein for clarity and/or for ready reference, and the inclusion of such definitions herein should not necessarily be construed to represent a substantial difference over what is generally understood in the art. Many of the techniques and procedures described or referenced herein are well understood and commonly employed using conventional methodology by those skilled in the art, such as, for example, the widely utilized molecular cloning methodologies described in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual 2nd. edition (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. As appropriate, procedures involving the use of commercially available kits and reagents are generally carried out in accordance with manufacturer defined protocols and/or parameters unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “advanced cancer”, “locally advanced cancer”, “advanced disease” and “locally advanced disease” mean cancers that have extended through the relevant tissue capsule, and are meant to include stage C disease under the American Urological Association (AUA) system, stage C1-C2 disease under the Whitmore-Jewett system, and stage T3-T4 and N+ disease under the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) system. In general, surgery is not recommended for patients with locally advanced disease, and these patients have substantially less favorable outcomes compared to patients having clinically localized (organ-confined) cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Altering the native glycosylation pattern” is intended for purposes herein to mean deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in native sequence 161P2F10B (either by removing the underlying glycosylation site or by deleting the glycosylation by chemical and/or enzymatic means), and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the native sequence 161P2F10B. In addition, the phrase includes qualitative changes in the glycosylation of the native proteins, involving a change in the nature and proportions of the various carbohydrate moieties present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “analog” refers to a molecule which is structurally similar or shares similar or corresponding attributes with another molecule (e.g. a 161P2F10B-related protein). For example, an analog of a 161P2F10B protein can be specifically bound by an antibody or T cell that specifically binds to 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody” is used in the broadest sense unless clearly indicated otherwise. Therefore, an “antibody” can be naturally occurring or man-made such as monoclonal antibodies produced by conventional hybridoma technology. Anti-161P2F10B antibodies comprise monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies as well as fragments containing the antigen-binding domain and/or one or more complementarity determining regions of these antibodies. As used herein, the term “antibody” refers to any form of antibody or fragment thereof that specifically binds 161P2F10B and/or exhibits the desired biological activity and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they specifically bind 161P2F10B and/or exhibit the desired biological activity. Any specific antibody can be used in the methods and compositions provided herein. Thus, in one embodiment the term “antibody” encompasses a molecule comprising at least one variable region from a light chain immunoglobulin molecule and at least one variable region from a heavy chain molecule that in combination form a specific binding site for the target antigen. In one embodiment, the antibody is an IgG antibody. For example, the antibody is a IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 antibody. The antibodies useful in the present methods and compositions can be generated in cell culture, in phage, or in various animals, including but not limited to cows, rabbits, goats, mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, sheep, dogs, cats, monkeys, chimpanzees, apes. Therefore, in one embodiment, an antibody of the present invention is a mammalian antibody. Phage techniques can be used to isolate an initial antibody or to generate variants with altered specificity or avidity characteristics. Such techniques are routine and well known in the art. In one embodiment, the antibody is produced by recombinant means known in the art. For example, a recombinant antibody can be produced by transfecting a host cell with a vector comprising a DNA sequence encoding the antibody. One or more vectors can be used to transfect the DNA sequence expressing at least one VL and one VH region in the host cell. Exemplary descriptions of recombinant means of antibody generation and production include Delves, ANTIBODY PRODUCTION: ESSENTIAL TECHNIQUES (Wiley, 1997); Shephard, et al., MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (Oxford University Press, 2000); Goding, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE (Academic Press, 1993); CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN IMMUNOLOGY (John Wiley & Sons, most recent edition). An antibody of the present invention can be modified by recombinant means to increase greater efficacy of the antibody in mediating the desired function. Thus, it is within the scope of the invention that antibodies can be modified by substitutions using recombinant means. Typically, the substitutions will be conservative substitutions. For example, at least one amino acid in the constant region of the antibody can be replaced with a different residue. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821, U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551, Application No. WO 9958572; and Angal, et al., Mol. Immunol. 30: 105-08 (1993). The modification in amino acids includes deletions, additions, substitutions of amino acids. In some cases, such changes are made to reduce undesired activities, e.g., complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Frequently, the antibodies are labeled by joining, either covalently or non-covalently, a substance which provides for a detectable signal. A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known and are reported extensively in both the scientific and patent literature. These antibodies can be screened for binding to normal or defective 161P2F10B. See e.g., ANTIBODY ENGINEERING: A PRACTICAL APPROACH (Oxford University Press, 1996). Suitable antibodies with the desired biologic activities can be identified the following in vitro assays including but not limited to: proliferation, migration, adhesion, soft agar growth, angiogenesis, cell-cell communication, apoptosis, transport, signal transduction, and the following in vivo assays such as the inhibition of tumor growth. The antibodies provided herein can also be useful in diagnostic applications. As capture or non-neutralizing antibodies, they can be screened for the ability to bind to the specific antigen without inhibiting the receptor-binding or biological activity of the antigen. As neutralizing antibodies, the antibodies can be useful in competitive binding assays. They can also be used to quantify the 161P2F10B or its receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “antibody fragment” is defined as at least a portion of the variable region of the immunoglobulin molecule that binds to its target, i.e., the antigen-binding region. In one embodiment it specifically covers single anti-161P2F10B antibodies and clones thereof (including agonist, antagonist and neutralizing antibodies) and anti-161P2F10B antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity. The antibody of the present methods and compositions can be monoclonal or polyclonal. An antibody can be in the form of an antigen binding antibody fragment including a Fab fragment, F(ab′)2 fragment, a single chain variable region, and the like. Fragments of intact molecules can be generated using methods well known in the art and include enzymatic digestion and recombinant means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, any form of the “antigen” can be used to generate an antibody that is specific for 161P2F10B. Thus, the eliciting antigen may be a single epitope, multiple epitopes, or the entire protein alone or in combination with one or more immunogenicity enhancing agents known in the art. The eliciting antigen may be an isolated full-length protein, a cell surface protein (e.g., immunizing with cells transfected with at least a portion of the antigen), or a soluble protein (e.g., immunizing with only the extracellular domain portion of the protein). The antigen may be produced in a genetically modified cell. The DNA encoding the antigen may genomic or non-genomic (e.g., cDNA) and encodes at least a portion of the extracellular domain. As used herein, the term “portion” refers to the minimal number of amino acids or nucleic acids, as appropriate, to constitute an immunogenic epitope of the antigen of interest. Any genetic vectors suitable for transformation of the cells of interest may be employed, including but not limited to adenoviral vectors, plasmids, and non-viral vectors, such as cationic lipids. In one embodiment, the antibody of the methods and compositions herein specifically bind at least a portion of the extracellular domain of the 161P2F10B of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof provided herein may be conjugated to a “bioactive agent.” As used herein, the term “bioactive agent” refers to any synthetic or naturally occurring compound that binds the antigen and/or enhances or mediates a desired biological effect to enhance cell-killing toxins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the binding fragments useful in the present invention are biologically active fragments. As used herein, the term “biologically active” refers to an antibody or antibody fragment that is capable of binding the desired the antigenic epitope and directly or indirectly exerting a biologic effect. Direct effects include, but are not limited to the modulation, stimulation, and/or inhibition of a growth signal, the modulation, stimulation, and/or inhibition of an anti-apoptotic signal, the modulation, stimulation, and/or inhibition of an apoptotic or necrotic signal, modulation, stimulation, and/or inhibition the ADCC cascade, and modulation, stimulation, and/or inhibition the CDC cascade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Bispecific” antibodies are also useful in the present methods and compositions. As used herein, the term “bispecific antibody” refers to an antibody, typically a monoclonal antibody, having binding specificities for at least two different antigenic epitopes. In one embodiment, the epitopes are from the same antigen. In another embodiment, the epitopes are from two different antigens. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. For example, bispecific antibodies can be produced recombinantly using the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain/light chain pairs. See, e.g., Milstein et al., Nature 305:537-39 (1983). Alternatively, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. See, e.g., Brennan, et al., Science 229:81 (1985). Bispecific antibodies include bispecific antibody fragments. See, e.g., Hollinger, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:6444-48 (1993), Gruber, et al., J. Immunol. 152:5368 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they specifically bind the target antigen and/or exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81: 6851-6855 (1984)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Chemotherapeutic Agent” refers to all chemical compounds that are effective in inhibiting tumor growth. Non-limiting examples of chemotherapeutic agents include alkylating agents; for example, nitrogen mustards, ethyleneimine compounds and alkyl sulphonates; antimetabolites; for example, folic acid, purine or pyrimidine antagonists; mitotic inhibitors; for example, vinca alkaloids and derivatives of podophyllotoxin, cytotoxic antibiotics, compounds that damage or interfere with DNA expression, and growth factor receptor antagonists. In addition, chemotherapeutic agents include cytotoxic agents (as defined herein), antibodies, biological molecules and small molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “codon optimized sequences” refers to nucleotide sequences that have been optimized for a particular host species by replacing any codons having a usage frequency of less than about 20%. Nucleotide sequences that have been optimized for expression in a given host species by elimination of spurious polyadenylation sequences, elimination of exon/intron splicing signals, elimination of transposon-like repeats and/or optimization of GC content in addition to codon optimization are referred to herein as an “expression enhanced sequences.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “combinatorial library” is a collection of diverse chemical compounds generated by either chemical synthesis or biological synthesis by combining a number of chemical “building blocks” such as reagents. For example, a linear combinatorial chemical library, such as a polypeptide (e.g., mutein) library, is formed by combining a set of chemical building blocks called amino acids in every possible way for a given compound length (i.e., the number of amino acids in a polypeptide compound). Numerous chemical compounds are synthesized through such combinatorial mixing of chemical building blocks (Gallop et al., J. Med. Chem. 37(9): 1233-1251 (1994)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation and screening of combinatorial libraries is well known to those of skill in the art. Such combinatorial chemical libraries include, but are not limited to, peptide libraries (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,010,175, Furka, Pept. Prot. Res. 37:487-493 (1991), Houghton et al., Nature, 354:84-88 (1991)), peptoids (PCT Publication No WO 91/19735), encoded peptides (PCT Publication WO 93/20242), random bio-oligomers (PCT Publication WO 92/00091), benzodiazepines (U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514), diversomers such as hydantoins, benzodiazepines and dipeptides (Hobbs et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6909-6913 (1993)), vinylogous polypeptides (Hagihara et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 114:6568 (1992)), nonpeptidal peptidomimetics with a Beta-D-Glucose scaffolding (Hirschmann et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 114:9217-9218 (1992)), analogous organic syntheses of small compound libraries (Chen et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 116:2661 (1994)), oligocarbamates (Cho, et al., Science 261:1303 (1993)), and/or peptidyl phosphonates (Campbell et al., J. Org. Chem. 59:658 (1994)). See, generally, Gordon et al., J. Med. Chem. 37:1385 (1994), nucleic acid libraries (see, e.g., Stratagene, Corp.), peptide nucleic acid libraries (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,539,083), antibody libraries (see, e.g., Vaughn et al., Nature Biotechnology 14(3): 309-314 (1996), and PCT/US96/10287), carbohydrate libraries (see, e.g., Liang et al., Science 274:1520-1522 (1996), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,853), and small organic molecule libraries (see, e.g., benzodiazepines, Baum, C&EN, January 18, page 33 (1993); isoprenoids, U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,588; thiazolidinones and metathiazanones, U.S. Pat. No. 5,549,974; pyrrolidines, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,525,735 and 5,519,134; morpholino compounds, U.S. Pat. No. 5,506,337; benzodiazepines, U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514; and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDevices for the preparation of combinatorial libraries are commercially available (see, e.g., 357 NIPS, 390 NIPS, Advanced Chem Tech, Louisville Ky.; Symphony, Rainin, Woburn, Mass.; 433A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.; 9050, Plus, Millipore, Bedford, NIA). A number of well-known robotic systems have also been developed for solution phase chemistries. These systems include automated workstations such as the automated synthesis apparatus developed by Takeda Chemical Industries, LTD. (Osaka, Japan) and many robotic systems utilizing robotic arms (Zymate H, Zymark Corporation, Hopkinton, Mass.; Orca, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, Calif.), which mimic the manual synthetic operations performed by a chemist. Any of the above devices are suitable for use with the present invention. The nature and implementation of modifications to these devices (if any) so that they can operate as discussed herein will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art. In addition, numerous combinatorial libraries are themselves commercially available (see, e.g., ComGenex, Princeton, N.J.; Asinex, Moscow, RU; Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, Mo.; ChemStar, Ltd, Moscow, RU; 3D Pharmaceuticals, Exton, Pa.; Martek Biosciences, Columbia, Md.; etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “conservative substitution” refers to substitutions of amino acids are known to those of skill in this art and may be made generally without altering the biological activity of the resulting molecule. Those of skill in this art recognize that, in general, single amino acid substitutions in non-essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity (see, e.g., Watson, et al., MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE GENE, The Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co., p. 224 (4th Edition 1987)). Such exemplary substitutions are preferably made in accordance with those set forth in Table(s) III(a-b). For example, such changes include substituting any of isoleucine (I), valine (V), and leucine (L) for any other of these hydrophobic amino acids; aspartic acid (D) for glutamic acid (E) and vice versa; glutamine (Q) for asparagine (N) and vice versa; and serine (S) for threonine (T) and vice versa. Other substitutions can also be considered conservative, depending on the environment of the particular amino acid and its role in the three-dimensional structure of the protein. For example, glycine (G) and alanine (A) can frequently be interchangeable, as can alanine (A) and valine (V). Methionine (M), which is relatively hydrophobic, can frequently be interchanged with leucine and isoleucine, and sometimes with valine. Lysine (K) and arginine (R) are frequently interchangeable in locations in which the significant feature of the amino acid residue is its charge and the differing pK's of these two amino acid residues are not significant. Still other changes can be considered “conservative” in particular environments (see, e.g. Table III(a) herein; pages 13-15 “Biochemistry” 2nd ED. Lubert Stryer ed (Stanford University); Henikoff et al., \nPNAS1992 Vol\n 89 10915-10919; Lei et al., J Biol Chem 1995 May 19; 270(20):11882-6). Other substitutions are also permissible and may be determined empirically or in accord with known conservative substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cytotoxic agent” refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the expression activity of cells, function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes, chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or variants thereof. Examples of cytotoxic agents include, but are not limited to auristatins, auristatin e, auromycins, maytansinoids, yttrium, bismuth, ricin, ricin A-chain, combrestatin, duocarmycins, dolostatins, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, taxol, cisplatin, cc1065, ethidium bromide, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicine, dihydroxy anthracin dione, actinomycin, diphtheria toxin, \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin (PE) A, PE40, abrin, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, gelonin, mitogellin, retstrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, curicin, crotin, calicheamicin, Sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, and glucocorticoid and other chemotherapeutic agents, as well as radioisotopes such as At211, I131, I125, Y90, Re186, Re188, Sm153, Bi212 or 213, P32 and radioactive isotopes of Lu including Lu177. Antibodies may also be conjugated to an anti-cancer pro-drug activating enzyme capable of converting the pro-drug to its active form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH-VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-48 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “gene product” is used herein to indicate a peptide/protein or mRNA. For example, a “gene product of the invention” is sometimes referred to herein as a “cancer amino acid sequence”, “cancer protein”, “protein of a cancer listed in Table I”, a “cancer mRNA”, “mRNA of a cancer listed in Table I”, etc. In one embodiment, the cancer protein is encoded by a nucleic acid of \nFIG. 1\n. The cancer protein can be a fragment, or alternatively, be the full-length protein encoded by nucleic acids of \nFIG. 1\n. In one embodiment, a cancer amino acid sequence is used to determine sequence identity or similarity. In another embodiment, the sequences are naturally occurring allelic variants of a protein encoded by a nucleic acid of \nFIG. 1\n. In another embodiment, the sequences are sequence variants as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Heteroconjugate” antibodies are useful in the present methods and compositions. As used herein, the term “heteroconjugate antibody” refers to two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies can be prepared using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including using crosslinking agents. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“High throughput screening” assays for the presence, absence, quantification, or other properties of particular nucleic acids or protein products are well known to those of skill in the art. Similarly, binding assays and reporter gene assays are similarly well known. Thus, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,559,410 discloses high throughput screening methods for proteins; U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,639 discloses high throughput screening methods for nucleic acid binding (i.e., in arrays); while U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,576,220 and 5,541,061 disclose high throughput methods of screening for ligand/antibody binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, high throughput screening systems are commercially available (see, e.g., Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.; Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, Mass.; Air Technical Industries, Mentor, Ohio; Beckman Instruments, Inc. Fullerton, Calif.; Precision Systems, Inc., Natick, Mass.; etc.). These systems typically automate entire procedures, including all sample and reagent pipetting, liquid dispensing, timed incubations, and final readings of the microplate in detector(s) appropriate for the assay. These configurable systems provide high throughput and rapid start up as well as a high degree of flexibility and customization. The manufacturers of such systems provide detailed protocols for various high throughput systems. Thus, e.g., Zymark Corp. provides technical bulletins describing screening systems for detecting the modulation of gene transcription, ligand binding, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “homolog” refers to a molecule which exhibits homology to another molecule, by for example, having sequences of chemical residues that are the same or similar at corresponding positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the antibody provided herein is a “human antibody.” As used herein, the term “human antibody” refers to an antibody in which essentially the entire sequences of the light chain and heavy chain sequences, including the complementary determining regions (CDRs), are from human genes. In one embodiment, human monoclonal antibodies are prepared by the trioma technique, the human B-cell technique (see, e.g., Kozbor, et al., Immunol. Today 4: 72 (1983), EBV transformation technique (see, e.g., Cole et al. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AND CANCER THERAPY 77-96 (1985)), or using phage display (see, e.g., Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581 (1991)). In a specific embodiment, the human antibody is generated in a transgenic mouse. Techniques for making such partially to fully human antibodies are known in the art and any such techniques can be used. According to one particularly preferred embodiment, fully human antibody sequences are made in a transgenic mouse engineered to express human heavy and light chain antibody genes. An exemplary description of preparing transgenic mice that produce human antibodies found in Application No. WO 02/43478 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,657,103 (Abgenix) and its progeny. B cells from transgenic mice that produce the desired antibody can then be fused to make hybridoma cell lines for continuous production of the antibody. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016; and 5,545,806; and Jakobovits, Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 31:33-42 (1998); Green, et al., J. Exp. Med. 188:483-95 (1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Human Leukocyte Antigen” or “HLA” is a human class I or class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) protein (see, e.g., Stites, et al., IMMUNOLOGY, 8TH ED., Lange Publishing, Los Altos, Calif. (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “humanized antibody” refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies as well as human antibodies. Such antibodies are chimeric antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. See e.g., Cabilly U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Queen et al. (1989) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029-10033; and ANTIBODY ENGINEERING: A PRACTICAL APPROACH (Oxford University Press 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “hybridize”, “hybridizing”, “hybridizes” and the like, used in the context of polynucleotides, are meant to refer to conventional hybridization conditions, preferably such as hybridization in 50% formamide/6×SSC/0.1% SDS/100 μg/ml ssDNA, in which temperatures for hybridization are above 37 degrees C. and temperatures for washing in 0.1×SSC/0.1% SDS are above 55 degrees C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrases “isolated” or “biologically pure” refer to material which is substantially or essentially free from components which normally accompany the material as it is found in its native state. Thus, isolated peptides in accordance with the invention preferably do not contain materials normally associated with the peptides in their in situ environment. For example, a polynucleotide is said to be “isolated” when it is substantially separated from contaminant polynucleotides that correspond or are complementary to genes other than the 161P2F10B genes or that encode polypeptides other than 161P2F10B gene product or fragments thereof. A skilled artisan can readily employ nucleic acid isolation procedures to obtain an isolated 161P2F10B polynucleotide. A protein is said to be “isolated,” for example, when physical, mechanical or chemical methods are employed to remove the 161P2F10B proteins from cellular constituents that are normally associated with the protein. A skilled artisan can readily employ standard purification methods to obtain an isolated 161P2F10B protein. Alternatively, an isolated protein can be prepared by chemical means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable “labels” include radionuclides, enzymes, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, fluorescent moieties, chemiluminescent moieties, magnetic particles, and the like. Patents teaching the use of such labels include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,817,837; 3,850,752; 3,939,350; 3,996,345; 4,277,437; 4,275,149; and 4,366,241. In addition, the antibodies provided herein can be useful as the antigen-binding component of fluorobodies. See e.g., Zeytun et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 21:1473-79 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “mammal” refers to any organism classified as a mammal, including mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, cows, horses and humans. In one embodiment of the invention, the mammal is a mouse. In another embodiment of the invention, the mammal is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “metastatic cancer” and “metastatic disease” mean cancers that have spread to regional lymph nodes or to distant sites, and are meant to include stage D disease under the AUA system and stage T×N×M+ under the TNM system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “modulator” or “test compound” or “drug candidate” or grammatical equivalents as used herein describe any molecule, e.g., protein, oligopeptide, small organic molecule, polysaccharide, polynucleotide, etc., to be tested for the capacity to directly or indirectly alter the cancer phenotype or the expression of a cancer sequence, e.g., a nucleic acid or protein sequences, or effects of cancer sequences (e.g., signaling, gene expression, protein interaction, etc.) In one aspect, a modulator will neutralize the effect of a cancer protein of the invention. By “neutralize” is meant that an activity of a protein is inhibited or blocked, along with the consequent effect on the cell. In another aspect, a modulator will neutralize the effect of a gene, and its corresponding protein, of the invention by normalizing levels of said protein. In preferred embodiments, modulators alter expression profiles, or expression profile nucleic acids or proteins provided herein, or downstream effector pathways. In one embodiment, the modulator suppresses a cancer phenotype, e.g. to a normal tissue fingerprint. In another embodiment, a modulator induced a cancer phenotype. Generally, a plurality of assay mixtures is run in parallel with different agent concentrations to obtain a differential response to the various concentrations. Typically, one of these concentrations serves as a negative control, i.e., at zero concentration or below the level of detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModulators, drug candidates or test compounds encompass numerous chemical classes, though typically they are organic molecules, preferably small organic compounds having a molecular weight of more than 100 and less than about 2,500 Daltons. Preferred small molecules are less than 2000, or less than 1500 or less than 1000 or less than 500 D. Candidate agents comprise functional groups necessary for structural interaction with proteins, particularly hydrogen bonding, and typically include at least an amine, carbonyl, hydroxyl or carboxyl group, preferably at least two of the functional chemical groups. The candidate agents often comprise cyclical carbon or heterocyclic structures and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or more of the above functional groups. Modulators also comprise biomolecules such as peptides, saccharides, fatty acids, steroids, purines, pyrimidines, derivatives, structural analogs or combinations thereof. Particularly preferred are peptides. One class of modulators are peptides, for example of from about five to about 35 amino acids, with from about five to about 20 amino acids being preferred, and from about 7 to about 15 being particularly preferred. Preferably, the cancer modulatory protein is soluble, includes a non-transmembrane region, and/or, has an N-terminal Cys to aid in solubility. In one embodiment, the C-terminus of the fragment is kept as a free acid and the N-terminus is a free amine to aid in coupling, i.e., to cysteine. In one embodiment, a cancer protein of the invention is conjugated to an immunogenic agent as discussed herein. In one embodiment, the cancer protein is conjugated to BSA. The peptides of the invention, e.g., of preferred lengths, can be linked to each other or to other amino acids to create a longer peptide/protein. The modulatory peptides can be digests of naturally occurring proteins as is outlined above, random peptides, or “biased” random peptides. In a preferred embodiment, peptide/protein-based modulators are antibodies, and fragments thereof, as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModulators of cancer can also be nucleic acids. Nucleic acid modulating agents can be naturally occurring nucleic acids, random nucleic acids, or “biased” random nucleic acids. For example, digests of prokaryotic or eukaryotic genomes can be used in an approach analogous to that outlined above for proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody”, as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic epitope. In contrast, conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations typically include a multitude of antibodies directed against (or specific for) different epitopes. In one embodiment, the polyclonal antibody contains a plurality of monoclonal antibodies with different epitope specificities, affinities, or avidities within a single antigen that contains multiple antigenic epitopes. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., Nature 256: 495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The “monoclonal antibodies” may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., Nature 352: 624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597 (1991), for example. These monoclonal antibodies will usually bind with at least a Kd of about 1 μM, more usually at least about 300 nM, typically at least about 30 nM, preferably at least about 10 nM, more preferably at least about 3 nM or better, usually determined by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “motif”, as in biological motif of a 161P2F10B-related protein, refers to any pattern of amino acids forming part of the primary sequence of a protein, that is associated with a particular function (e.g. protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, etc) or modification (e.g. that is phosphorylated, glycosylated or amidated), or localization (e.g. secretory sequence, nuclear localization sequence, etc.) or a sequence that is correlated with being immunogenic, either humorally or cellularly. A motif can be either contiguous or capable of being aligned to certain positions that are generally correlated with a certain function or property. In the context of HLA motifs, “motif” refers to the pattern of residues in a peptide of defined length, usually a peptide of from about 8 to about 13 amino acids for a class I HLA motif and from about 6 to about 25 amino acids for a class II HLA motif, which is recognized by a particular HLA molecule. Peptide motifs for HLA binding are typically different for each protein encoded by each human HLA allele and differ in the pattern of the primary and secondary anchor residues. Frequently occurring motifs are set forth in Table V.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “pharmaceutical excipient” comprises a material such as an adjuvant, a carrier, pH-adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, wetting agents, preservative, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to a non-toxic, inert, and/or composition that is physiologically compatible with humans or other mammals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polynucleotide” means a polymeric form of nucleotides of at least 10 bases or base pairs in length, either ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide, and is meant to include single and double stranded forms of DNA and/or RNA. In the art, this term if often used interchangeably with “oligonucleotide”. A polynucleotide can comprise a nucleotide sequence disclosed herein wherein thymidine (T), as shown for example in \nFIG. 1\n, can also be uracil (U); this definition pertains to the differences between the chemical structures of DNA and RNA, in particular the observation that one of the four major bases in RNA is uracil (U) instead of thymidine (T).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polypeptide” means a polymer of at least about 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 amino acids. Throughout the specification, standard three letter or single letter designations for amino acids are used. In the art, this term is often used interchangeably with “peptide” or “protein”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn HLA “primary anchor residue” is an amino acid at a specific position along a peptide sequence which is understood to provide a contact point between the immunogenic peptide and the HLA molecule. One to three, usually two, primary anchor residues within a peptide of defined length generally defines a “motif” for an immunogenic peptide. These residues are understood to fit in close contact with peptide binding groove of an HLA molecule, with their side chains buried in specific pockets of the binding groove. In one embodiment, for example, the primary anchor residues for an HLA class I molecule are located at position 2 (from the amino terminal position) and at the carboxyl terminal position of a 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 residue peptide epitope in accordance with the invention. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the primary anchor residues of a peptide binds an HLA class II molecule are spaced relative to each other, rather than to the termini of a peptide, where the peptide is generally of at least 9 amino acids in length. The primary anchor positions for each motif and supermotif are set forth in Table IV(a). For example, analog peptides can be created by altering the presence or absence of particular residues in the primary and/or secondary anchor positions shown in Table IV. Such analogs are used to modulate the binding affinity and/or population coverage of a peptide comprising a particular HLA motif or supermotif.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Radioisotopes” include, but are not limited to the following (non-limiting exemplary uses are also set forth in Table IV(I)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “randomized” or grammatical equivalents as herein applied to nucleic acids and proteins is meant that each nucleic acid and peptide consists of essentially random nucleotides and amino acids, respectively. These random peptides (or nucleic acids, discussed herein) can incorporate any nucleotide or amino acid at any position. The synthetic process can be designed to generate randomized proteins or nucleic acids, to allow the formation of all or most of the possible combinations over the length of the sequence, thus forming a library of randomized candidate bioactive proteinaceous agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a library is “fully randomized,” with no sequence preferences or constants at any position. In another embodiment, the library is a “biased random” library. That is, some positions within the sequence either are held constant, or are selected from a limited number of possibilities. For example, the nucleotides or amino acid residues are randomized within a defined class, e.g., of hydrophobic amino acids, hydrophilic residues, sterically biased (either small or large) residues, towards the creation of nucleic acid binding domains, the creation of cysteines, for cross-linking, prolines for SH-3 domains, serines, threonines, tyrosines or histidines for phosphorylation sites, etc., or to purines, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “recombinant” DNA or RNA molecule is a DNA or RNA molecule that has been subjected to molecular manipulation in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “single-chain Fv” or “scFv” or “single chain” antibody refers to antibody fragments comprising the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv, see Pluckthun, THE PHARMACOLOGY OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-limiting examples of “small molecules” include compounds that bind or interact with 161P2F10B, ligands including hormones, neuropeptides, chemokines, odorants, phospholipids, and functional equivalents thereof that bind and preferably inhibit 161P2F10B protein function. Such non-limiting small molecules preferably have a molecular weight of less than about 10 kDa, more preferably below about 9, about 8, about 7, about 6, about 5 or about 4 kDa. In certain embodiments, small molecules physically associate with, or bind, 161P2F10B protein; are not found in naturally occurring metabolic pathways; and/or are more soluble in aqueous than non-aqueous solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “specific” refers to the selective binding of the antibody to the target antigen epitope. Antibodies can be tested for specificity of binding by comparing binding to appropriate antigen to binding to irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture under a given set of conditions. If the antibody binds to the appropriate antigen at least 2, 5, 7, and preferably 10 times more than to irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture then it is considered to be specific. In one embodiment, a specific antibody is one that only binds the 161P2F10B antigen, but does not bind to the irrelevent antigen. In another embodiment, a specific antibody is one that binds human 161P2F10B antigen but does not bind a non-human 161P2F10B antigen with 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or greater amino acid homology with the 161P2F10B antigen. In another embodiment, a specific antibody is one that binds human 161P2F10B antigen and binds murine 161P2F10B antigen, but with a higher degree of binding the human antigen. In another embodiment, a specific antibody is one that binds human 161P2F10B antigen and binds primate 161P2F10B antigen, but with a higher degree of binding the human antigen. In another embodiment, the specific antibody binds to human 161P2F10B antigen and any non-human 161P2F10B antigen, but with a higher degree of binding the human antigen or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Stringency” of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art, and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon probe length, washing temperature, and salt concentration. In general, longer probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing, while shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured nucleic acid sequences to reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe and hybridizable sequence, the higher the relative temperature that can be used. As a result, it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent, while lower temperatures less so. For additional details and explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions, see Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Interscience Publishers, (1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Stringent conditions” or “high stringency conditions”, as defined herein, are identified by, but not limited to, those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50° C.; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42° C.; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5×SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5×Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 μg/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42° C., with washes at 42° C. in 0.2×SSC (sodium chloride/sodium. citrate) and 50% formamide at 55° C., followed by a high-stringency wash consisting of 0.1×SSC containing EDTA at 55° C. “Moderately stringent conditions” are described by, but not limited to, those in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, New York: Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1989, and include the use of washing solution and hybridization conditions (e.g., temperature, ionic strength and % SDS) less stringent than those described above. An example of moderately stringent conditions is overnight incubation at 65° C. in a solution comprising: 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5M sodium phosphate pH7.5, 1.25 mM EDTA, and 7\n% SDS\n 5×SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), followed by washing the filters in 2×SSC/1% SDS at 50° C. and 0.2×SSC/0.1% SDS at 50° C. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature, ionic strength, etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn HLA “supermotif” is a peptide binding specificity shared by HLA molecules encoded by two or more HLA alleles. Overall phenotypic frequencies of HLA-supertypes in different ethnic populations are set forth in Table IV (f). The non-limiting constituents of various supertypes are as follows:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nA2: A*0201, A*0202, A*0203, A*0204, A*0205, A*0206, A*6802, A*6901, A*0207;\n \nA3: A3, All, A31, A*3301, A*6801, A*0301, A*1101, A*3101;\n \nB7: B7, B*3501-03, B*51, B*5301, B*5401, B*5501, B*5502, B*5601, B*6701, B*7801, B*0702, B*5101, B*5602;\n \nB44: B*3701, B*4402, B*4403, B*60 (B*4001), B61 (B*4006);\n \nA1: A*0102, A*2604, A*3601, A*4301, A*8001;\n \nA24: A*24, A*30, A*2403, A*2404, A*3002, A*3003;\n \nB27: B*1401-02, B*1503, B*1509, B*1510, B*1518, B*3801-02, B*3901, B*3902, B*3903-04, B*4801-02, B*7301, B*2701-08;\n \nB58: B*1516, B*1517, B*5701, B*5702, B58; and\n \nB62: B*4601, B52, B*1501 (B62), B*1502 (B75), B*1513 (B77).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nCalculated population coverage afforded by different HLA-supertype combinations are set forth in Table IV(g).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “to treat” or “therapeutic” and grammatically related terms, refer to any improvement of any consequence of disease, such as prolonged survival, less morbidity, and/or a lessening of side effects which are the byproducts of an alternative therapeutic modality; as is readily appreciated in the art, full eradication of disease is a preferred out albeit not a requirement for a treatment act.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “transgenic animal” (e.g., a mouse or rat) is an animal having cells that contain a transgene, which transgene was introduced into the animal or an ancestor of the animal at a prenatal, e.g., an embryonic stage. A “transgene” is a DNA that is integrated into the genome of a cell from which a transgenic animal develops.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an HLA or cellular immune response “vaccine” is a composition that contains or encodes one or more peptides of the invention. There are numerous embodiments of such vaccines, such as a cocktail of one or more individual peptides; one or more peptides of the invention comprised by a polyepitopic peptide; or nucleic acids that encode such individual peptides or polypeptides, e.g., a minigene that encodes a polyepitopic peptide. The “one or more peptides” can include any whole unit integer from 1-150 or more, e.g., at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, or 150 or more peptides of the invention. The peptides or polypeptides can optionally be modified, such as by lipidation, addition of targeting or other sequences. HLA class I peptides of the invention can be admixed with, or linked to, HLA class II peptides, to facilitate activation of both cytotoxic T lymphocytes and helper T lymphocytes. HLA vaccines can also comprise peptide-pulsed antigen presenting cells, e.g., dendritic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “variant” refers to a molecule that exhibits a variation from a described type or norm, such as a protein that has one or more different amino acid residues in the corresponding position(s) of a specifically described protein (e.g. the 161P2F10B protein shown in \nFIG. 1\n.) An analog is an example of a variant protein. Splice isoforms and single nucleotides polymorphisms (SNPs) are further examples of variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “161P2F10B-related proteins” of the invention include those specifically identified herein, as well as allelic variants, conservative substitution variants, analogs and homologs that can be isolated/generated and characterized without undue experimentation following the methods outlined herein or readily available in the art. Fusion proteins that combine parts of different 161P2F10B proteins or fragments thereof, as well as fusion proteins of a 161P2F10B protein and a heterologous polypeptide are also included. Such 161P2F10B proteins are collectively referred to as the 161P2F10B-related proteins, the proteins of the invention, or 161P2F10B. The term “161P2F10B-related protein” refers to a polypeptide fragment or a 161P2F10B protein sequence of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, or more than 25 amino acids; or, at least 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 330, 335, 339 or more amino acids.\n\n\n \nII.) 161P2F10B Polynucleotides\n\n\n \n \n \nOne aspect of the invention provides polynucleotides corresponding or complementary to all or part of a 161P2F10B gene, mRNA, and/or coding sequence, preferably in isolated form, including polynucleotides encoding a 161P2F10B-related protein and fragments thereof, DNA, RNA, DNA/RNA hybrid, and related molecules, polynucleotides or oligonucleotides complementary to a 161P2F10B gene or mRNA sequence or a part thereof, and polynucleotides or oligonucleotides that hybridize to a 161P2F10B gene, mRNA, or to a 161P2F10B encoding polynucleotide (collectively, “161P2F10B polynucleotides”). In all instances when referred to in this section, T can also be U in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiments of a 161P2F10B polynucleotide include: a 161P2F10B polynucleotide having the sequence shown in \nFIG. 1\n, the nucleotide sequence of 161P2F10B as shown in \nFIG. 1\n wherein T is U; at least 10 contiguous nucleotides of a polynucleotide having the sequence as shown in \nFIG. 1\n; or, at least 10 contiguous nucleotides of a polynucleotide having the sequence as shown in \nFIG. 1\n where T is U.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolynucleotides encoding relatively long portions of a 161P2F10B protein are also within the scope of the invention. For example, polynucleotides encoding from about amino acid 1 (or 20 or 30 or 40 etc.) to about \namino acid\n 20, (or 30, or 40 or 50 etc.) of the 161P2F10B protein “or variant” shown in \nFIG. 1\n or \nFIG. 3\n can be generated by a variety of techniques well known in the art. These polynucleotide fragments can include any portion of the 161P2F10B sequence as shown in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nII.A.) Uses of 161P2F10B Polynucleotides\n\n \n \n \n \n \nII.A.1. Monitoring of Genetic Abnormalities\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe polynucleotides of the preceding paragraphs have a number of different specific uses. The human 161P2F10B gene maps to the chromosomal location set forth in the Example entitled “Chromosomal Mapping of 161P2F10B.” For example, because the 161P2F10B gene maps to this chromosome, polynucleotides that encode different regions of the 161P2F10B proteins are used to characterize cytogenetic abnormalities of this chromosomal locale, such as abnormalities that are identified as being associated with various cancers. In certain genes, a variety of chromosomal abnormalities including rearrangements have been identified as frequent cytogenetic abnormalities in a number of different cancers (see e.g. Krajinovic et al., Mutat. Res. 382(3-4): 81-83 (1998); Johansson et al., Blood 86(10): 3905-3914 (1995) and Finger et al., P.N.A.S. 85(23): 9158-9162 (1988)). Thus, polynucleotides encoding specific regions of the 161P2F10B proteins provide new tools that can be used to delineate, with greater precision than previously possible, cytogenetic abnormalities in the chromosomal region that encodes 161P2F10B that may contribute to the malignant phenotype. In this context, these polynucleotides satisfy a need in the art for expanding the sensitivity of chromosomal screening in order to identify more subtle and less common chromosomal abnormalities (see e.g. Evans et al., Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol 171(4): 1055-1057 (1994)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, as 161P2F10B was shown to be highly expressed in prostate and other cancers, 161P2F10B polynucleotides are used in methods assessing the status of 161P2F10B gene products in normal versus cancerous tissues. Typically, polynucleotides that encode specific regions of the 161P2F10B proteins are used to assess the presence of perturbations (such as deletions, insertions, point mutations, or alterations resulting in a loss of an antigen etc.) in specific regions of the 161P2F10B gene, such as regions containing one or more motifs. Exemplary assays include both RT-PCR assays as well as single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis (see, e.g., Marrogi et al., J. Cutan. Pathol. 26(8): 369-378 (1999), both of which utilize polynucleotides encoding specific regions of a protein to examine these regions within the protein.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nII.A.2. Antisense Embodiments\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nOther specifically contemplated nucleic acid related embodiments of the invention disclosed herein are genomic DNA, cDNAs, ribozymes, and antisense molecules, as well as nucleic acid molecules based on an alternative backbone, or including alternative bases, whether derived from natural sources or synthesized, and include molecules capable of inhibiting the RNA or protein expression of 161P2F10B. For example, antisense molecules can be RNAs or other molecules, including peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) or non-nucleic acid molecules such as phosphorothioate derivatives that specifically bind DNA or RNA in a base pair-dependent manner. A skilled artisan can readily obtain these classes of nucleic acid molecules using the 161P2F10B polynucleotides and polynucleotide sequences disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntisense technology entails the administration of exogenous oligonucleotides that bind to a target polynucleotide located within the cells. The term “antisense” refers to the fact that such oligonucleotides are complementary to their intracellular targets, e.g., 161P2F10B. See for example, Jack Cohen, Oligodeoxynucleotides, Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, 1989; and Synthesis 1:1-5 (1988). The 161P2F10B antisense oligonucleotides of the present invention include derivatives such as S-oligonucleotides (phosphorothioate derivatives or S-oligos, see, Jack Cohen, supra), which exhibit enhanced cancer cell growth inhibitory action. S-oligos (nucleoside phosphorothioates) are isoelectronic analogs of an oligonucleotide (O-oligo) in which a nonbridging oxygen atom of the phosphate group is replaced by a sulfur atom. The S-oligos of the present invention can be prepared by treatment of the corresponding O-oligos with 3H-1,2-benzodithiol-3-one-1,1-dioxide, which is a sulfur transfer reagent. See, e.g., Iyer, R. P. et al., J. Org. Chem. 55:4693-4698 (1990); and Iyer, R. P. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112:1253-1254 (1990). Additional 161P2F10B antisense oligonucleotides of the present invention include morpholino antisense oligonucleotides known in the art (see, e.g., Partridge et al., 1996, Antisense & Nucleic Acid Drug Development 6: 169-175).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 161P2F10B antisense oligonucleotides of the present invention typically can be RNA or DNA that is complementary to and stably hybridizes with the first 100 5′ codons or last 100 3′ codons of a 161P2F10B genomic sequence or the corresponding mRNA. Absolute complementarity is not required, although high degrees of complementarity are preferred. Use of an oligonucleotide complementary to this region allows for the selective hybridization to 161P2F10B mRNA and not to mRNA specifying other regulatory subunits of protein kinase. In one embodiment, 161P2F10B antisense oligonucleotides of the present invention are 15 to 30-mer fragments of the antisense DNA molecule that have a sequence that hybridizes to 161P2F10B mRNA. Optionally, 161P2F10B antisense oligonucleotide is a 30-mer oligonucleotide that is complementary to a region in the first 10 5′ codons or last 10 3′ codons of 161P2F10B. Alternatively, the antisense molecules are modified to employ ribozymes in the inhibition of 161P2F10B expression, see, e.g., L. A. Couture & D. T. Stinchcomb; Trends Genet. 12: 510-515 (1996).\n\n \n \n \n \n \nII.A.3. Primers and Primer Pairs\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nFurther specific embodiments of these nucleotides of the invention include primers and primer pairs, which allow the specific amplification of polynucleotides of the invention or of any specific parts thereof, and probes that selectively or specifically hybridize to nucleic acid molecules of the invention or to any part thereof. Probes can be labeled with a detectable marker, such as, for example, a radioisotope, fluorescent compound, bioluminescent compound, a chemiluminescent compound, metal chelator or enzyme. Such probes and primers are used to detect the presence of a 161P2F10B polynucleotide in a sample and as a means for detecting a cell expressing a 161P2F10B protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of such probes include polypeptides comprising all or part of the human 161P2F10B cDNA sequence shown in \nFIG. 1\n. Examples of primer pairs capable of specifically amplifying 161P2F10B mRNAs are also described in the Examples. As will be understood by the skilled artisan, a great many different primers and probes can be prepared based on the sequences provided herein and used effectively to amplify and/or detect a 161P2F10B mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 161P2F10B polynucleotides of the invention are useful for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to their use as probes and primers for the amplification and/or detection of the 161P2F10B gene(s), mRNA(s), or fragments thereof; as reagents for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of prostate cancer and other cancers; as coding sequences capable of directing the expression of 161P2F10B polypeptides; as tools for modulating or inhibiting the expression of the 161P2F10B gene(s) and/or translation of the 161P2F10B transcript(s); and as therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes the use of any probe as described herein to identify and isolate a 161P2F10B or 161P2F10B related nucleic acid sequence from a naturally occurring source, such as humans or other mammals, as well as the isolated nucleic acid sequence per se, which would comprise all or most of the sequences found in the probe used.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nII.A.4. Isolation of 161P2F10B-Encoding Nucleic Acid Molecules\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe 161P2F10B cDNA sequences described herein enable the isolation of other polynucleotides encoding 161P2F10B gene product(s), as well as the isolation of polynucleotides encoding 161P2F10B gene product homologs, alternatively spliced isoforms, allelic variants, and mutant forms of a 161P2F10B gene product as well as polynucleotides that encode analogs of 161P2F10B-related proteins. Various molecular cloning methods that can be employed to isolate full length cDNAs encoding a 161P2F10B gene are well known (see, for example, Sambrook, J. et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York, 1989; Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Ausubel et al., Eds., Wiley and Sons, 1995). For example, lambda phage cloning methodologies can be conveniently employed, using commercially available cloning systems (e.g., Lambda ZAP Express, Stratagene). Phage clones containing 161P2F10B gene cDNAs can be identified by probing with a labeled 161P2F10B cDNA or a fragment thereof. For example, in one embodiment, a 161P2F10B cDNA (e.g., \nFIG. 1\n) or a portion thereof can be synthesized and used as a probe to retrieve overlapping and full-length cDNAs corresponding to a 161P2F10B gene. A 161P2F10B gene itself can be isolated by screening genomic DNA libraries, bacterial artificial chromosome libraries (BACs), yeast artificial chromosome libraries (YACs), and the like, with 161P2F10B DNA probes or primers.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nII.A.5. Recombinant Nucleic Acid Molecules and Host-Vector Systems\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also provides recombinant DNA or RNA molecules containing a 161P2F10B polynucleotide, a fragment, analog or homologue thereof, including but not limited to phages, plasmids, phagemids, cosmids, YACs, BACs, as well as various viral and non-viral vectors well known in the art, and cells transformed or transfected with such recombinant DNA or RNA molecules. Methods for generating such molecules are well known (see, for example, Sambrook et al., 1989, supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a host-vector system comprising a recombinant DNA molecule containing a 161P2F10B polynucleotide, fragment, analog or homologue thereof within a suitable prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell. Examples of suitable eukaryotic host cells include a yeast cell, a plant cell, or an animal cell, such as a mammalian cell or an insect cell (e.g., a baculovirus-infectible cell such as an Sf9 or HighFive cell). Examples of suitable mammalian cells include various prostate cancer cell lines such as DU145 and TsuPr1, other transfectable or transducible prostate cancer cell lines, primary cells (PrEC), as well as a number of mammalian cells routinely used for the expression of recombinant proteins (e.g., COS, CHO, 293, 293T cells). More particularly, a polynucleotide comprising the coding sequence of 161P2F10B or a fragment, analog or homolog thereof can be used to generate 161P2F10B proteins or fragments thereof using any number of host-vector systems routinely used and widely known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide range of host-vector systems suitable for the expression of 161P2F10B proteins or fragments thereof are available, see for example, Sambrook et al., 1989, supra; Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1995, supra). Preferred vectors for mammalian expression include but are not limited to pcDNA 3.1 myc-His-tag (Invitrogen) and the retroviral vector pSR tkneo (Muller et al., 1991, MCB 11:1785). Using these expression vectors, 161P2F10B can be expressed in several prostate cancer and non-prostate cell lines, including for example 293, 293T, rat-1, NIH 3T3 and TsuPr1. The host-vector systems of the invention are useful for the production of a 161P2F10B protein or fragment thereof. Such host-vector systems can be employed to study the functional properties of 161P2F10B and 161P2F10B mutations or analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant human 161P2F10B protein or an analog or homolog or fragment thereof can be produced by mammalian cells transfected with a construct encoding a 161P2F10B-related nucleotide. For example, 293T cells can be transfected with an expression plasmid encoding 161P2F10B or fragment, analog or homolog thereof, a 161P2F10B-related protein is expressed in the 293T cells, and the recombinant 161P2F10B protein is isolated using standard purification methods (e.g., affinity purification using anti-161P2F10B antibodies). In another embodiment, a 161P2F10B coding sequence is subcloned into the retroviral vector pSRαMSVtkneo and used to infect various mammalian cell lines, such as NIH 3T3, TsuPr1, 293 and rat-i in order to establish 161P2F10B expressing cell lines. Various other expression systems well known in the art can also be employed. Expression constructs encoding a leader peptide joined in frame to a 161P2F10B coding sequence can be used for the generation of a secreted form of recombinant 161P2F10B protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein, redundancy in the genetic code permits variation in 161P2F10B gene sequences. In particular, it is known in the art that specific host species often have specific codon preferences, and thus one can adapt the disclosed sequence as preferred for a desired host. For example, preferred analog codon sequences typically have rare codons (i.e., codons having a usage frequency of less than about 20% in known sequences of the desired host) replaced with higher frequency codons. Codon preferences for a specific species are calculated, for example, by utilizing codon usage tables available on the INTERNET such as at URL dna.affrc.go jp/˜nakamura/codon.html.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional sequence modifications are known to enhance protein expression in a cellular host. These include elimination of sequences encoding spurious polyadenylation signals, exon/intron splice site signals, transposon-like repeats, and/or other such well-characterized sequences that are deleterious to gene expression. The GC content of the sequence is adjusted to levels average for a given cellular host, as calculated by reference to known genes expressed in the host cell. Where possible, the sequence is modified to avoid predicted hairpin secondary mRNA structures. Other useful modifications include the addition of a translational initiation consensus sequence at the start of the open reading frame, as described in Kozak, Mol. Cell. Biol., 9:5073-5080 (1989). Skilled artisans understand that the general rule that eukaryotic ribosomes initiate translation exclusively at the 5′ proximal AUG codon is abrogated only under rare conditions (see, e.g., Kozak PNAS 92(7): 2662-2666, (1995) and Kozak NAR 15(20): 8125-8148 (1987)).\n\n\n \nIII.) 161P2F10B-Related Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention provides 161P2F10B-related proteins. Specific embodiments of 161P2F10B proteins comprise a polypeptide having all or part of the amino acid sequence of human 161P2F10B as shown in \nFIG. 1\n, preferably \nFIG. 1A\n. Alternatively, embodiments of 161P2F10B proteins comprise variant, homolog or analog polypeptides that have alterations in the amino acid sequence of 161P2F10B shown in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiments of a 161P2F10B polypeptide include: a 161P2F10B polypeptide having a sequence shown in \nFIG. 1\n, a peptide encoded by a polynucleotide sequence of a 161P2F10B as shown in \nFIG. 1\n wherein T is U; at least 10 contiguous nucleotides encoding a polypeptide having the sequence as shown in \nFIG. 1\n; or, at least 10 contiguous peptides encoded by a polynucleotide having the sequence as shown in \nFIG. 1\n where T is U.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid abbreviations are provided in Table II. Conservative amino acid substitutions can frequently be made in a protein without altering either the conformation or the function of the protein. Proteins of the invention can comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 conservative substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiments of the invention disclosed herein include a wide variety of art-accepted variants or analogs of 161P2F10B proteins such as polypeptides having amino acid insertions, deletions and substitutions. 161P2F10B variants can be made using methods known in the art such as site-directed mutagenesis, alanine scanning, and PCR mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis (Carter et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 13:4331 (1986); Zoller et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 10:6487 (1987)), cassette mutagenesis (Wells et al., Gene, 34:315 (1985)), restriction selection mutagenesis (Wells et al., Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London SerA, 317:415 (1986)) or other known techniques can be performed on the cloned DNA to produce the 161P2F10B variant DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScanning amino acid analysis can also be employed to identify one or more amino acids along a contiguous sequence that is involved in a specific biological activity such as a protein-protein interaction. Among the preferred scanning amino acids are relatively small, neutral amino acids. Such amino acids include alanine, glycine, serine, and cysteine. Alanine is typically a preferred scanning amino acid among this group because it eliminates the side-chain beyond the beta-carbon and is less likely to alter the main-chain conformation of the variant. Alanine is also typically preferred because it is the most common amino acid. Further, it is frequently found in both buried and exposed positions (Creighton, The Proteins, (W.H. Freeman & Co., N.Y.); Chothia, J. Mol. Biol., 150:1 (1976)). If alanine substitution does not yield adequate amounts of variant, an isosteric amino acid can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs defined herein, 161P2F10B variants, analogs or homologs, have the distinguishing attribute of having at least one epitope that is “cross reactive” with a 161P2F10B protein having an amino acid sequence of \nFIG. 1\n. As used in this sentence, “cross reactive” means that an antibody or T cell that specifically binds to a 161P2F10B variant also specifically binds to a 161P2F10B protein having an amino acid sequence set forth in \nFIG. 1\n. A polypeptide ceases to be a variant of a protein shown in \nFIG. 1\n, when it no longer contains any epitope capable of being recognized by an antibody or T cell that specifically binds to the starting 161P2F10B protein. Those skilled in the art understand that antibodies that recognize proteins bind to epitopes of varying size, and a grouping of the order of about four or five amino acids, contiguous or not, is regarded as a typical number of amino acids in a minimal epitope. See, e.g., Nair et al., J. Immunol. 2000 165(12): 6949-6955; Hebbes et al., Mol Immunol (1989) 26(9):865-73; Schwartz et al., J Immunol (1985) 135(4):2598-608.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther classes of 161P2F10B-related protein variants share 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or more similarity with an amino acid sequence of \nFIG. 1\n, or a fragment thereof. Another specific class of 161P2F10B protein variants or analogs comprises one or more of the 161P2F10B biological motifs described herein or presently known in the art. Thus, encompassed by the present invention are analogs of 161P2F10B fragments (nucleic or amino acid) that have altered functional (e.g. immunogenic) properties relative to the starting fragment. It is to be appreciated that motifs now or which become part of the art are to be applied to the nucleic or amino acid sequences of \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein, embodiments of the claimed invention include polypeptides containing less than the full amino acid sequence of a 161P2F10B protein shown in \nFIG. 1\n. For example, representative embodiments of the invention comprise peptides/proteins having any 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or more contiguous amino acids of a 161P2F10B protein shown in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B-related proteins are generated using standard peptide synthesis technology or using chemical cleavage methods well known in the art. Alternatively, recombinant methods can be used to generate nucleic acid molecules that encode a 161P2F10B-related protein. In one embodiment, nucleic acid molecules provide a means to generate defined fragments of a 161P2F10B protein (or variants, homologs or analogs thereof).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIII.A.) Motif-Bearing Protein Embodiments\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional illustrative embodiments of the invention disclosed herein include 161P2F10B polypeptides comprising the amino acid residues of one or more of the biological motifs contained within a 161P2F10B polypeptide sequence set forth in \nFIG. 1\n. Various motifs are known in the art, and a protein can be evaluated for the presence of such motifs by a number of publicly available Internet sites such as BIMAS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMotif bearing subsequences of all 161P2F10B variant proteins have previously been disclosed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable IV(h) sets forth several frequently occurring motifs based on pfam searches (see URL address pfam.wustl.edu/). The columns of Table IV(h) list (1) motif name abbreviation, (2) percent identity found amongst the different member of the motif family, (3) motif name or description and (4) most common function; location information is included if the motif is relevant for location.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides comprising one or more of the 161P2F10B motifs discussed above are useful in elucidating the specific characteristics of a malignant phenotype in view of the observation that the 161P2F10B motifs discussed above are associated with growth dysregulation and because 161P2F10B is overexpressed in certain cancers (See, e.g., Table I). Casein kinase II, cAMP and camp-dependent protein kinase, and Protein Kinase C, for example, are enzymes known to be associated with the development of the malignant phenotype (see e.g. Chen et al., Lab Invest., 78(2): 165-174 (1998); Gaiddon et al., Endocrinology 136(10): 4331-4338 (1995); Hall et al., Nucleic Acids Research 24(6): 1119-1126 (1996); Peterziel et al., Oncogene 18(46): 6322-6329 (1999) and O'Brian, Oncol. Rep. 5(2): 305-309 (1998)). Moreover, both glycosylation and myristoylation are protein modifications also associated with cancer and cancer progression (see e.g. Dennis et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1473(1):21-34 (1999); Raju et al., Exp. Cell Res. 235(1): 145-154 (1997)). Amidation is another protein modification also associated with cancer and cancer progression (see e.g. Treston et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. (13): 169-175 (1992)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, proteins of the invention comprise one or more of the immunoreactive epitopes identified in accordance with art-accepted methods, such as the peptides previously disclosed. CTL epitopes can be determined using specific algorithms to identify peptides within a 161P2F10B protein that are capable of optimally binding to specified HLA alleles (e.g., Table IV; Epimatrix™ and Epimer™, Brown University; and BIMAS.) Moreover, processes for identifying peptides that have sufficient binding affinity for HLA molecules and which are correlated with being immunogenic epitopes, are well known in the art, and are carried out without undue experimentation. In addition, processes for identifying peptides that are immunogenic epitopes, are well known in the art, and are carried out without undue experimentation either in vitro or in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso known in the art are principles for creating analogs of such epitopes in order to modulate immunogenicity. For example, one begins with an epitope that bears a CTL or HTL motif (see, e.g., the HLA Class I and HLA Class II motifs/supermotifs of Table IV). The epitope is analoged by substituting out an amino acid at one of the specified positions, and replacing it with another amino acid specified for that position. For example, on the basis of residues defined in Table IV, one can substitute out a deleterious residue in favor of any other residue, such as a preferred residue; substitute a less-preferred residue with a preferred residue; or substitute an originally-occurring preferred residue with another preferred residue. Substitutions can occur at primary anchor positions or at other positions in a peptide; see, e.g., Table IV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of references reflect the art regarding the identification and generation of epitopes in a protein of interest as well as analogs thereof.

Res. 1998 18(2): 79-92.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelated embodiments of the invention include polypeptides comprising combinations of the different motifs set forth in Table(s) IV(a), IV(b), IV(c), IV(d), and IV(h), and/or, one or more of the predicted CTL epitopes of previously disclosed, and/or, one or more of the T cell binding motifs known in the art. Preferred embodiments contain no insertions, deletions or substitutions either within the motifs or within the intervening sequences of the polypeptides. In addition, embodiments which include a number of either N-terminal and/or C-terminal amino acid residues on either side of these motifs may be desirable (to, for example, include a greater portion of the polypeptide architecture in which the motif is located). Typically, the number of N-terminal and/or C-terminal amino acid residues on either side of a motif is between about 1 to about 100 amino acid residues, preferably 5 to about 50 amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B-related proteins are embodied in many forms, preferably in isolated form. A purified 161P2F10B protein molecule will be substantially free of other proteins or molecules that impair the binding of 161P2F10B to antibody, T cell or other ligand. The nature and degree of isolation and purification will depend on the intended use. Embodiments of a 161P2F10B-related proteins include purified 161P2F10B-related proteins and functional, soluble 161P2F10B-related proteins. In one embodiment, a functional, soluble 161P2F10B protein or fragment thereof retains the ability to be bound by antibody, T cell or other ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides 161P2F10B proteins comprising biologically active fragments of a 161P2F10B amino acid sequence shown in \nFIG. 1\n. Such proteins exhibit properties of the starting 161P2F10B protein, such as the ability to elicit the generation of antibodies that specifically bind an epitope associated with the starting 161P2F10B protein; to be bound by such antibodies; to elicit the activation of HTL or CTL; and/or, to be recognized by HTL or CTL that also specifically bind to the starting protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B-related polypeptides that contain particularly interesting structures can be predicted and/or identified using various analytical techniques well known in the art, including, for example, the methods of Chou-Fasman, Garnier-Robson, Kyte-Doolittle, Eisenberg, Karplus-Schultz or Jameson-Wolf analysis, or based on immunogenicity. Fragments that contain such structures are particularly useful in generating subunit-specific anti-161P2F10B antibodies or T cells or in identifying cellular factors that bind to 161P2F10B. For example, hydrophilicity profiles can be generated, and immunogenic peptide fragments identified, using the method of Hopp, T. P. and Woods, K. R., 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:3824-3828. Hydropathicity profiles can be generated, and immunogenic peptide fragments identified, using the method of Kyte, J. and Doolittle, R. F., 1982, J. Mol. Biol. 157:105-132. Percent (%) Accessible Residues profiles can be generated, and immunogenic peptide fragments identified, using the method of Janin J., 1979, Nature 277:491-492. Average Flexibility profiles can be generated, and immunogenic peptide fragments identified, using the method of Bhaskaran R., Ponnuswamy P. K., 1988, Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 32:242-255. Beta-turn profiles can be generated, and immunogenic peptide fragments identified, using the method of Deleage, G., Roux B., 1987, Protein Engineering 1:289-294.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCTL epitopes can be determined using specific algorithms to identify peptides within a 161P2F10B protein that are capable of optimally binding to specified HLA alleles such as BIMAS and SYFPEITHI. Illustrating this, peptide epitopes from 161P2F10B that are presented in the context of human MHC Class I molecules, e.g., HLA-A1, A2, A3, A11, A24, B7 and B35 were predicted. Specifically, the complete amino acid sequence of the 161P2F10B protein and relevant portions of other variants, i.e., for HLA Class I \npredictions\n 9 flanking residues on either side of a point mutation or exon juction, and for HLA \nClass II predictions\n 14 flanking residues on either side of a point mutation or exon junction corresponding to that variant, were entered into the HLA Peptide Motif Search algorithm found in the Bioinformatics and Molecular Analysis Section.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HLA peptide motif search algorithm was developed by Dr. Ken Parker based on binding of specific peptide sequences in the groove of HLA Class I molecules, in particular HLA-A2 (see, e.g., Falk et al., Nature 351: 290-6 (1991); Hunt et al., Science 255:1261-3 (1992); Parker et al., J. Immunol. 149:3580-7 (1992); Parker et al., J. Immunol. 152:163-75 (1994)). This algorithm allows location and ranking of 8-mer, 9-mer, and 10-mer peptides from a complete protein sequence for predicted binding to HLA-A2 as well as numerous other HLA Class I molecules. Many HLA class I binding peptides are 8-, 9-, 10 or 11-mers. For example, for Class I HLA-A2, the epitopes preferably contain a leucine (L) or methionine (M) at \nposition\n 2 and a valine (V) or leucine (L) at the C-terminus (see, e.g., Parker et al., J. Immunol. 149:3580-7 (1992)). Selected results of 161P2F10B predicted binding peptides have been shown. The binding score corresponds to the estimated half time of dissociation of complexes containing the peptide at 37° C. at pH 6.5. Peptides with the highest binding score are predicted to be the most tightly bound to HLA Class I on the cell surface for the greatest period of time and thus represent the best immunogenic targets for T-cell recognition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActual binding of peptides to an HLA allele can be evaluated by stabilization of HLA expression on the antigen-processing defective cell line T2 (see, e.g., Xue et al., Prostate 30:73-8 (1997) and Peshwa et al., Prostate 36:129-38 (1998)). Immunogenicity of specific peptides can be evaluated in vitro by stimulation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in the presence of antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be appreciated that every epitope predicted by the BIMAS site, Epimer™ and Epimatrix™ sites, or specified by the HLA class I or class II motifs available in the art or which become part of the art such as set forth in Table IV are to be “applied” to a 161P2F10B protein in accordance with the invention. As used in this context “applied” means that a 161P2F10B protein is evaluated, e.g., visually or by computer-based patterns finding methods, as appreciated by those of skill in the relevant art. Every subsequence of a 161P2F10B protein of 8, 9, 10, or 11 amino acid residues that bears an HLA Class I motif, or a subsequence of 9 or more amino acid residues that bear an HLA Class II motif are within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIII.B.) Expression of 161P2F10B-Related Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment described in the examples that follow, 161P2F10B can be conveniently expressed in cells (such as 293T cells) transfected with a commercially available expression vector such as a CMV-driven expression vector encoding 161P2F10B with a C-terminal 6×His and MYC tag (pcDNA3.1/mycHIS, Invitrogen or Tag5, GenHunter Corporation, Nashville Tenn.). The Tag5 vector provides an IgGK secretion signal that can be used to facilitate the production of a secreted 161P2F10B protein in transfected cells. The secreted HIS-tagged 161P2F10B in the culture media can be purified, e.g., using a nickel column using standard techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIII.C.) Modifications of 161P2F10B-Related Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications of 161P2F10B-related proteins such as covalent modifications are included within the scope of this invention. One type of covalent modification includes reacting targeted amino acid residues of a 161P2F10B polypeptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues of a 161P2F10B protein. Another type of covalent modification of a 161P2F10B polypeptide included within the scope of this invention comprises altering the native glycosylation pattern of a protein of the invention. Another type of covalent modification of 161P2F10B comprises linking a 161P2F10B polypeptide to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192 or 4,179,337.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 161P2F10B-related proteins of the present invention can also be modified to form a chimeric molecule comprising 161P2F10B fused to another, heterologous polypeptide or amino acid sequence. Such a chimeric molecule can be synthesized chemically or recombinantly. A chimeric molecule can have a protein of the invention fused to another tumor-associated antigen or fragment thereof. Alternatively, a protein in accordance with the invention can comprise a fusion of fragments of a 161P2F10B sequence (amino or nucleic acid) such that a molecule is created that is not, through its length, directly homologous to the amino or nucleic acid sequences shown in \nFIG. 1\n. Such a chimeric molecule can comprise multiples of the same subsequence of 161P2F10B. A chimeric molecule can comprise a fusion of a 161P2F10B-related protein with a polyhistidine epitope tag, which provides an epitope to which immobilized nickel can selectively bind, with cytokines or with growth factors. The epitope tag is generally placed at the amino- or carboxyl-terminus of a 161P2F10B protein. In an alternative embodiment, the chimeric molecule can comprise a fusion of a 161P2F10B-related protein with an immunoglobulin or a particular region of an immunoglobulin. For a bivalent form of the chimeric molecule (also referred to as an “immunoadhesin”), such a fusion could be to the Fc region of an IgG molecule. The Ig fusions preferably include the substitution of a soluble (transmembrane domain deleted or inactivated) form of a 161P2F10B polypeptide in place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule. In a preferred embodiment, the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge, CH2 and CH3, or the hinge, CH1, CH2 and CH3 regions of an IgG1 molecule. For the production of immunoglobulin fusions see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,428,130 issued Jun. 27, 1995.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIII.D.) Uses of 161P2F10B-Related Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proteins of the invention have a number of different specific uses. As 161P2F10B is highly expressed in prostate and other cancers, 161P2F10B-related proteins are used in methods that assess the status of 161P2F10B gene products in normal versus cancerous tissues, thereby elucidating the malignant phenotype. Typically, polypeptides from specific regions of a 161P2F10B protein are used to assess the presence of perturbations (such as deletions, insertions, point mutations etc.) in those regions (such as regions containing one or more motifs). Exemplary assays utilize antibodies or T cells targeting 161P2F10B-related proteins comprising the amino acid residues of one or more of the biological motifs contained within a 161P2F10B polypeptide sequence in order to evaluate the characteristics of this region in normal versus cancerous tissues or to elicit an immune response to the epitope. Alternatively, 161P2F10B-related proteins that contain the amino acid residues of one or more of the biological motifs in a 161P2F10B protein are used to screen for factors that interact with that region of 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B protein fragments/subsequences are particularly useful in generating and characterizing domain-specific antibodies (e.g., antibodies recognizing an extracellular or intracellular epitope of a 161P2F10B protein), for identifying agents or cellular factors that bind to 161P2F10B or a particular structural domain thereof, and in various therapeutic and diagnostic contexts, including but not limited to diagnostic assays, cancer vaccines and methods of preparing such vaccines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProteins encoded by the 161P2F10B genes, or by analogs, homologs or fragments thereof, have a variety of uses, including but not limited to generating antibodies and in methods for identifying ligands and other agents and cellular constituents that bind to a 161P2F10B gene product. Antibodies raised against a 161P2F10B protein or fragment thereof are useful in diagnostic and prognostic assays, and imaging methodologies in the management of human cancers characterized by expression of 161P2F10B protein, such as those listed in Table I. Such antibodies can be expressed intracellularly and used in methods of treating patients with such cancers. 161P2F10B-related nucleic acids or proteins are also used in generating HTL or CTL responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious immunological assays useful for the detection of 161P2F10B proteins are used, including but not limited to various types of radioimmunoassays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), enzyme-linked immunofluorescent assays (ELIFA), immunocytochemical methods, and the like. Antibodies can be labeled and used as immunological imaging reagents capable of detecting 161P2F10B-expressing cells (e.g., in radioscintigraphic imaging methods). 161P2F10B proteins are also particularly useful in generating cancer vaccines, as further described herein.\n\n\n \nIV.) 161P2F10B Antiobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention provides antibodies that bind to 161P2F10B-related proteins. Preferred antibodies specifically bind to a 161P2F10B-related protein and do not bind (or bind weakly) to peptides or proteins that are not 161P2F10B-related proteins under physiological conditions. In this context, examples of physiological conditions include: 1) phosphate buffered saline; 2) Tris-buffered saline containing 25 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl; or normal saline (0.9% NaCl); 4) animal serum such as human serum; or, 5) a combination of any of 1) through 4); these reactions preferably taking place at pH 7.5, alternatively in a range of pH 7.0 to 8.0, or alternatively in a range of pH 6.5 to 8.5; also, these reactions taking place at a temperature between 4° C. to 37° C. For example, antibodies that bind 161P2F10B can bind 161P2F10B-related proteins such as the homologs or analogs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B antibodies of the invention are particularly useful in cancer (see, e.g., Table I) diagnostic and prognostic assays, and imaging methodologies. Similarly, such antibodies are useful in the treatment, diagnosis, and/or prognosis of prostate and other cancers, to the extent 161P2F10B is also expressed or overexpressed in these other cancers. Moreover, intracellularly expressed antibodies (e.g., single chain antibodies) are therapeutically useful in treating cancers in which the expression of 161P2F10B is involved, such as advanced or metastatic prostate cancers or other advanced or metastatic cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides various immunological assays useful for the detection and quantification of 161P2F10B and mutant 161P2F10B-related proteins. Such assays can comprise one or more 161P2F10B antibodies capable of recognizing and binding a 161P2F10B-related protein, as appropriate. These assays are performed within various immunological assay formats well known in the art, including but not limited to various types of radioimmunoassays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), enzyme-linked immunofluorescent assays (ELIFA), and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunological non-antibody assays of the invention also comprise T cell immunogenicity assays (inhibitory or stimulatory) as well as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, immunological imaging methods capable of detecting kidney cancer and other cancers expressing 161P2F10B are also provided by the invention, including but not limited to radioscintigraphic imaging methods using labeled 161P2F10B antibodies. Such assays are clinically useful in the detection, monitoring, and prognosis of 161P2F10B expressing cancers such as kidney cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B antibodies are also used in methods for purifying a 161P2F10B-related protein and for isolating 161P2F10B homologues and related molecules. For example, a method of purifying a 161P2F10B-related protein comprises incubating a 161P2F10B antibody, which has been coupled to a solid matrix, with a lysate or other solution containing a 161P2F10B-related protein under conditions that permit the 161P2F10B antibody to bind to the 161P2F10B-related protein; washing the solid matrix to eliminate impurities; and eluting the 161P2F10B-related protein from the coupled antibody. Other uses of 161P2F10B antibodies in accordance with the invention include generating anti-idiotypic antibodies that mimic a 161P2F10B protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious methods for the preparation of antibodies are well known in the art. For example, antibodies can be prepared by immunizing a suitable mammalian host using a 161P2F10B-related protein, peptide, or fragment, in isolated or immunoconjugated form (Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, CSH Press, Eds., Harlow, and Lane (1988); Harlow, Antibodies, Cold Spring Harbor Press, NY (1989)). In addition, fusion proteins of 161P2F10B can also be used, such as a 161P2F10B GST-fusion protein. In a particular embodiment, a GST fusion protein comprising all or most of the amino acid sequence of \nFIG. 1\n is produced, then used as an immunogen to generate appropriate antibodies. In another embodiment, a 161P2F10B-related protein is synthesized and used as an immunogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, naked DNA immunization techniques known in the art are used (with or without purified 161P2F10B-related protein or 161P2F10B expressing cells) to generate an immune response to the encoded immunogen (for review, see Donnelly et al., 1997, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 15: 617-648).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequence of a 161P2F10B protein as shown in \nFIG. 1\n can be analyzed to select specific regions of the 161P2F10B protein for generating antibodies. For example, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity analyses of a 161P2F10B amino acid sequence are used to identify hydrophilic regions in the 161P2F10B structure. Regions of a 161P2F10B protein that show immunogenic structure, as well as other regions and domains, can readily be identified using various other methods known in the art, such as Chou-Fasman, Garnier-Robson, Kyte-Doolittle, Eisenberg, Karplus-Schultz or Jameson-Wolf analysis. Hydrophilicity profiles can be generated using the method of Hopp, T. P. and Woods, K. R., 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:3824-3828. Hydropathicity profiles can be generated using the method of Kyte, J. and Doolittle, R. F., 1982, J. Mol. Biol. 157:105-132. Percent (%) Accessible Residues profiles can be generated using the method of Janin J., 1979, Nature 277:491-492. Average Flexibility profiles can be generated using the method of Bhaskaran R., Ponnuswamy P. K., 1988, Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 32:242-255. Beta-turn profiles can be generated using the method of Deleage, G., Roux B., 1987, Protein Engineering 1:289-294. Thus, each region identified by any of these programs or methods is within the scope of the present invention. Preferred methods for the generation of 161P2F10B antibodies are further illustrated by way of the examples provided herein. Methods for preparing a protein or polypeptide for use as an immunogen are well known in the art. Also well known in the art are methods for preparing immunogenic conjugates of a protein with a carrier, such as BSA, KLH or other carrier protein. In some circumstances, direct conjugation using, for example, carbodiimide reagents are used; in other instances linking reagents such as those supplied by Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill., are effective. Administration of a 161P2F10B immunogen is often conducted by injection over a suitable time period and with use of a suitable adjuvant, as is understood in the art. During the immunization schedule, titers of antibodies can be taken to determine adequacy of antibody formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B monoclonal antibodies can be produced by various means well known in the art. For example, immortalized cell lines that secrete a desired monoclonal antibody are prepared using the standard hybridoma technology of Kohler and Milstein or modifications that immortalize antibody-producing B cells, as is generally known. Immortalized cell lines that secrete the desired antibodies are screened by immunoassay in which the antigen is a 161P2F10B-related protein. When the appropriate immortalized cell culture is identified, the cells can be expanded and antibodies produced either from in vitro cultures or from ascites fluid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies or fragments of the invention can also be produced, by recombinant means. Regions that bind specifically to the desired regions of a 161P2F10B protein can also be produced in the context of chimeric or complementarity-determining region (CDR) grafted antibodies of multiple species origin. Humanized or human 161P2F10B antibodies can also be produced, and are preferred for use in therapeutic contexts. Methods for humanizing murine and other non-human antibodies, by substituting one or more of the non-human antibody CDRs for corresponding human antibody sequences, are well known (see for example, Jones et al., 1986, Nature 321: 522-525; Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature 332: 323-327; Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science 239: 1534-1536). See also, Carter et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 4285 and Sims et al., 1993, J. Immunol. 151: 2296.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for producing fully human monoclonal antibodies include phage display and transgenic methods (for review, see Vaughan et al., 1998, Nature Biotechnology 16: 535-539). Fully human 161P2F10B monoclonal antibodies can be generated using cloning technologies employing large human Ig gene combinatorial libraries (i.e., phage display) (Griffiths and Hoogenboom, Building an in vitro immune system: human antibodies from phage display libraries. In: Protein Engineering of Antibody Molecules for Prophylactic and Therapeutic Applications in Man, Clark, M. (Ed.), Nottingham Academic, pp 45-64 (1993); Burton and Barbas, Human Antibodies from combinatorial libraries. Id., pp 65-82). Fully human 161P2F10B monoclonal antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice engineered to contain human immunoglobulin gene loci as described in PCT Patent Application WO98/24893, Kucherlapati and Jakobovits et al., published Dec. 3, 1997 (see also, Jakobovits, 1998, Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs 7(4): 607-614; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,162,963 issued 19 Dec. 2000; 6,150,584 issued 12 Nov. 2000; and, 6,114,598 issued 5 Sep. 2000). This method avoids the in vitro manipulation required with phage display technology and efficiently produces high affinity authentic human antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReactivity of 161P2F10B antibodies with a 161P2F10B-related protein can be established by a number of well known means, including Western blot, immunoprecipitation, ELISA, and FACS analyses using, as appropriate, 161P2F10B-related proteins, 161P2F10B-expressing cells or extracts thereof. A 161P2F10B antibody or fragment thereof can be labeled with a detectable marker or conjugated to a second molecule. Suitable detectable markers include, but are not limited to, a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, a bioluminescent compound, chemiluminescent compound, a metal chelator or an enzyme. Further, bi-specific antibodies specific for two or more 161P2F10B epitopes are generated using methods generally known in the art. Homodimeric antibodies can also be generated by cross-linking techniques known in the art (e.g., Wolff et al., Cancer Res. 53: 2560-2565).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides for monoclonal antibodies identified as Ha16-1(3,5)18, Ha16-1(1)11, H16-1.93, H16-9.69 were sent (via Federal Express) to the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), P.O. Box 1549, Manassas, Va. 20108 on 28-Mar.-2006 and assigned Accession numbers PTA-7452 and PTA-7450 and PTA-7449 and PTA-7451, respectively.\n\n\n \nV.) 161P2F10B Cellular Immune Responses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe mechanism by which T cells recognize antigens has been delineated. Efficacious peptide epitope vaccine compositions of the invention induce a therapeutic or prophylactic immune responses in very broad segments of the world-wide population. For an understanding of the value and efficacy of compositions of the invention that induce cellular immune responses, a brief review of immunology-related technology is provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA complex of an HLA molecule and a peptidic antigen acts as the ligand recognized by HLA-restricted T cells (Buus, S. et al., Cell 47:1071, 1986; Babbitt, B. P. et al., Nature 317:359, 1985; Townsend, A. and Bodmer, H., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 7:601, 1989; Germain, R. N., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 11:403, 1993). Through the study of single amino acid substituted antigen analogs and the sequencing of endogenously bound, naturally processed peptides, critical residues that correspond to motifs required for specific binding to HLA antigen molecules have been identified and are set forth in Table IV (see also, e.g., Southwood, et al., J. Immunol. 160:3363, 1998; Rammensee, et al., Immunogenetics 41:178, 1995; Rammensee et al., SYFPEITHI, access via World Wide Web at URL (134.2.96.221/scripts.hlaserver.dll/home.htm); Sette, A. and Sidney, J.

Immunogenetics 1999 November; 50(3-4):201-12, Review).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, x-ray crystallographic analyses of HLA-peptide complexes have revealed pockets within the peptide binding cleft/groove of HLA molecules which accommodate, in an allele-specific mode, residues borne by peptide ligands; these residues in turn determine the HLA binding capacity of the peptides in which they are present. (See, e.g., Madden, D. R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 13:587, 1995; Smith, et al., Immunity 4:203, 1996; Fremont et al., Immunity 8:305, 1998; Stern et al., Structure 2:245, 1994; Jones, E. Y. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 9:75, 1997; Brown, J. H. et al., Nature 364:33, 1993; Guo, H. C. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:8053, 1993; Guo, H. C. et al., Nature 360:364, 1992; Silver, M. L. et al., Nature 360:367, 1992; Matsumura, M. et al., Science 257:927, 1992; Madden et al., Cell 70:1035, 1992; Fremont, D. H. et al., Science 257:919, 1992; Saper, M. A., Bjorkman, P. J. and Wiley, D. C., J. Mol. Biol. 219:277, 1991.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the definition of class I and class II allele-specific HLA binding motifs, or class I or class II supermotifs allows identification of regions within a protein that are correlated with binding to particular HLA antigen(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, by a process of HLA motif identification, candidates for epitope-based vaccines have been identified; such candidates can be further evaluated by HLA-peptide binding assays to determine binding affinity and/or the time period of association of the epitope and its corresponding HLA molecule. Additional confirmatory work can be performed to select, amongst these vaccine candidates, epitopes with preferred characteristics in terms of population coverage, and/or immunogenicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious strategies can be utilized to evaluate cellular immunogenicity, including:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1) Evaluation of primary T cell cultures from normal individuals (see, e.g., Wentworth, P. A. et al., Mol. Immunol. 32:603, 1995; Celis, E. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:2105, 1994; Tsai, V. et al., J. Immunol. 158:1796, 1997; Kawashima, I. et al., Human Immunol. 59:1, 1998). This procedure involves the stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from normal subjects with a test peptide in the presence of antigen presenting cells in vitro over a period of several weeks. T cells specific for the peptide become activated during this time and are detected using, e.g., a lymphokine- or 51Cr-release assay involving peptide sensitized target cells.\n \n2) Immunization of HLA transgenic mice (see, e.g., Wentworth, P. A. et al., J. Immunol. 26:97, 1996; Wentworth, P. A. et al., Int. Immunol. 8:651, 1996; Alexander, J. et al., J. Immunol. 159:4753, 1997). For example, in such methods peptides in incomplete Freund's adjuvant are administered subcutaneously to HLA transgenic mice. Several weeks following immunization, splenocytes are removed and cultured in vitro in the presence of test peptide for approximately one week. Peptide-specific T cells are detected using, e.g., a 51Cr-release assay involving peptide sensitized target cells and target cells expressing endogenously generated antigen.\n \n3) Demonstration of recall T cell responses from immune individuals who have been either effectively vaccinated and/or from chronically ill patients (see, e.g., Rehermann, B. et al., J. Exp. Med. 181:1047, 1995; Doolan, D. L. et al., Immunity 7:97, 1997; Bertoni, R. et al., J. Clin. Invest. 100:503, 1997; Threlkeld, S. C. et al., J. Immunol. 159:1648, 1997; Diepolder, H. M. et al., J. Virol. 71:6011, 1997). Accordingly, recall responses are detected by culturing PBL from subjects that have been exposed to the antigen due to disease and thus have generated an immune response “naturally”, or from patients who were vaccinated against the antigen. PBL from subjects are cultured in vitro for 1-2 weeks in the presence of test peptide plus antigen presenting cells (APC) to allow activation of “memory” T cells, as compared to “naive” T cells. At the end of the culture period, T cell activity is detected using assays including 51Cr release involving peptide-sensitized targets, T cell proliferation, or lymphokine release.\n \n \n \n\n\nVI.) 161P2F10B Transgenic Animals\n\n\n \n \n \nNucleic acids that encode a 161P2F10B-related protein can also be used to generate either transgenic animals or “knock out” animals that, in turn, are useful in the development and screening of therapeutically useful reagents. In accordance with established techniques, cDNA encoding 161P2F10B can be used to clone genomic DNA that encodes 161P2F10B. The cloned genomic sequences can then be used to generate transgenic animals containing cells that express DNA that encode 161P2F10B. Methods for generating transgenic animals, particularly animals such as mice or rats, have become conventional in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,736,866 issued 12 Apr. 1988, and 4,870,009 issued 26 Sep. 1989. Typically, particular cells would be targeted for 161P2F10B transgene incorporation with tissue-specific enhancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransgenic animals that include a copy of a transgene encoding 161P2F10B can be used to examine the effect of increased expression of DNA that encodes 161P2F10B. Such animals can be used as tester animals for reagents thought to confer protection from, for example, pathological conditions associated with its overexpression. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, an animal is treated with a reagent and a reduced incidence of a pathological condition, compared to untreated animals that bear the transgene, would indicate a potential therapeutic intervention for the pathological condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, non-human homologues of 161P2F10B can be used to construct a 161P2F10B “knock out” animal that has a defective or altered gene encoding 161P2F10B as a result of homologous recombination between the endogenous gene encoding 161P2F10B and altered genomic DNA encoding 161P2F10B introduced into an embryonic cell of the animal. For example, cDNA that encodes 161P2F10B can be used to clone genomic DNA encoding 161P2F10B in accordance with established techniques. A portion of the genomic DNA encoding 161P2F10B can be deleted or replaced with another gene, such as a gene encoding a selectable marker that can be used to monitor integration. Typically, several kilobases of unaltered flanking DNA (both at the 5′ and 3′ ends) are included in the vector (see, e.g., Thomas and Capecchi, Cell, 51:503 (1987) for a description of homologous recombination vectors). The vector is introduced into an embryonic stem cell line (e.g., by electroporation) and cells in which the introduced DNA has homologously recombined with the endogenous DNA are selected (see, e.g., Li et al., Cell, 69:915 (1992)). The selected cells are then injected into a blastocyst of an animal (e.g., a mouse or rat) to form aggregation chimeras (see, e.g., Bradley, in Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach, E. J. Robertson, ed. (IRL, Oxford, 1987), pp. 113-152). A chimeric embryo can then be implanted into a suitable pseudopregnant female foster animal, and the embryo brought to term to create a “knock out” animal. Progeny harboring the homologously recombined DNA in their germ cells can be identified by standard techniques and used to breed animals in which all cells of the animal contain the homologously recombined DNA. Knock out animals can be characterized, for example, for their ability to defend against certain pathological conditions or for their development of pathological conditions due to absence of a 161P2F10B polypeptide.\n\n\n \nVII.) Methods for the Detection OF 161P2F10B\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to methods for detecting 161P2F10B polynucleotides and 161P2F10B-related proteins, as well as methods for identifying a cell that expresses 161P2F10B. The expression profile of 161P2F10B makes it a diagnostic marker for metastasized disease. Accordingly, the status of 161P2F10B gene products provides information useful for predicting a variety of factors including susceptibility to advanced stage disease, rate of progression, and/or tumor aggressiveness. As discussed in detail herein, the status of 161P2F10B gene products in patient samples can be analyzed by a variety protocols that are well known in the art including immunohistochemical analysis, the variety of Northern blotting techniques including in situ hybridization, RT-PCR analysis (for example on laser capture micro-dissected samples), Western blot analysis and tissue array analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, the invention provides assays for the detection of 161P2F10B polynucleotides in a biological sample, such as serum, bone, prostate, and other tissues, urine, semen, cell preparations, and the like. Detectable 161P2F10B polynucleotides include, for example, a 161P2F10B gene or fragment thereof, 161P2F10B mRNA, alternative splice variant 161P2F10B mRNAs, and recombinant DNA or RNA molecules that contain a 161P2F10B polynucleotide. A number of methods for amplifying and/or detecting the presence of 161P2F10B polynucleotides are well known in the art and can be employed in the practice of this aspect of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a method for detecting a 161P2F10B mRNA in a biological sample comprises producing cDNA from the sample by reverse transcription using at least one primer; amplifying the cDNA so produced using a 161P2F10B polynucleotides as sense and antisense primers to amplify 161P2F10B cDNAs therein; and detecting the presence of the amplified 161P2F10B cDNA. Optionally, the sequence of the amplified 161P2F10B cDNA can be determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a method of detecting a 161P2F10B gene in a biological sample comprises first isolating genomic DNA from the sample; amplifying the isolated genomic DNA using 161P2F10B polynucleotides as sense and antisense primers; and detecting the presence of the amplified 161P2F10B gene. Any number of appropriate sense and antisense probe combinations can be designed from a 161P2F10B nucleotide sequence (see, e.g., \nFIG. 1\n) and used for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides assays for detecting the presence of a 161P2F10B protein in a tissue or other biological sample such as serum, semen, bone, prostate, urine, cell preparations, and the like. Methods for detecting a 161P2F10B-related protein are also well known and include, for example, immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemical analysis, Western blot analysis, molecular binding assays, ELISA, ELIFA and the like. For example, a method of detecting the presence of a 161P2F10B-related protein in a biological sample comprises first contacting the sample with a 161P2F10B antibody, a 161P2F10B-reactive fragment thereof, or a recombinant protein containing an antigen-binding region of a 161P2F10B antibody; and then detecting the binding of 161P2F10B-related protein in the sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for identifying a cell that expresses 161P2F10B are also within the scope of the invention. In one embodiment, an assay for identifying a cell that expresses a 161P2F10B gene comprises detecting the presence of 161P2F10B mRNA in the cell. Methods for the detection of particular mRNAs in cells are well known and include, for example, hybridization assays using complementary DNA probes (such as in situ hybridization using labeled 161P2F10B riboprobes, Northern blot and related techniques) and various nucleic acid amplification assays (such as RT-PCR using complementary primers specific for 161P2F10B, and other amplification type detection methods, such as, for example, branched DNA, SISBA, TMA and the like). Alternatively, an assay for identifying a cell that expresses a 161P2F10B gene comprises detecting the presence of 161P2F10B-related protein in the cell or secreted by the cell. Various methods for the detection of proteins are well known in the art and are employed for the detection of 161P2F10B-related proteins and cells that express 161P2F10B-related proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B expression analysis is also useful as a tool for identifying and evaluating agents that modulate 161P2F10B gene expression. For example, 161P2F10B expression is significantly upregulated in kidney cancer, and is expressed in cancers of the tissues listed in Table I. Identification of a molecule or biological agent that inhibits 161P2F10B expression or over-expression in cancer cells is of therapeutic value. For example, such an agent can be identified by using a screen that quantifies 161P2F10B expression by RT-PCR, nucleic acid hybridization or antibody binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for Monitoring the Status of 161P2F10B-related Genes and Their Products\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOncogenesis is known to be a multistep process where cellular growth becomes progressively dysregulated and cells progress from a normal physiological state to precancerous and then cancerous states (see, e.g., Alers et al., Lab Invest. 77(5): 437-438 (1997) and Isaacs et al., Cancer Surv. 23: 19-32 (1995)). In this context, examining a biological sample for evidence of dysregulated cell growth (such as aberrant 161P2F10B expression in cancers) allows for early detection of such aberrant physiology, before a pathologic state such as cancer has progressed to a stage that therapeutic options are more limited and or the prognosis is worse. In such examinations, the status of 161P2F10B in a biological sample of interest can be compared, for example, to the status of 161P2F10B in a corresponding normal sample (e.g. a sample from that individual or alternatively another individual that is not affected by a pathology). An alteration in the status of 161P2F10B in the biological sample (as compared to the normal sample) provides evidence of dysregulated cellular growth. In addition to using a biological sample that is not affected by a pathology as a normal sample, one can also use a predetermined normative value such as a predetermined normal level of mRNA expression (see, e.g., Grever et al., J. Comp. Neurol. 1996 Dec. 9; 376(2): 306-14 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,501) to compare 161P2F10B status in a sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “status” in this context is used according to its art accepted meaning and refers to the condition or state of a gene and its products. Typically, skilled artisans use a number of parameters to evaluate the condition or state of a gene and its products. These include, but are not limited to the location of expressed gene products (including the location of 161P2F10B expressing cells) as well as the level, and biological activity of expressed gene products (such as 161P2F10B mRNA, polynucleotides and polypeptides). Typically, an alteration in the status of 161P2F10B comprises a change in the location of 161P2F10B and/or 161P2F10B expressing cells and/or an increase in 161P2F10B mRNA and/or protein expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B status in a sample can be analyzed by a number of means well known in the art, including without limitation, immunohistochemical analysis, in situ hybridization, RT-PCR analysis on laser capture micro-dissected samples, Western blot analysis, and tissue array analysis. Typical protocols for evaluating the status of a 161P2F10B gene and gene products are found, for example in Ausubel et al. eds., 1995, Current Protocols In Molecular Biology, Units 2 (Northern Blotting), 4 (Southern Blotting), 15 (Immunoblotting) and 18 (PCR Analysis). Thus, the status of 161P2F10B in a biological sample is evaluated by various methods utilized by skilled artisans including, but not limited to genomic Southern analysis (to examine, for example perturbations in a 161P2F10B gene), Northern analysis and/or PCR analysis of 161P2F10B mRNA (to examine, for example alterations in the polynucleotide sequences or expression levels of 161P2F10B mRNAs), and, Western and/or immunohistochemical analysis (to examine, for example alterations in polypeptide sequences, alterations in polypeptide localization within a sample, alterations in expression levels of 161P2F10B proteins and/or associations of 161P2F10B proteins with polypeptide binding partners). Detectable 161P2F10B polynucleotides include, for example, a 161P2F10B gene or fragment thereof, 161P2F10B mRNA, alternative splice variants, 161P2F10B mRNAs, and recombinant DNA or RNA molecules containing a 161P2F10B polynucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression profile of 161P2F10B makes it a diagnostic marker for local and/or metastasized disease, and provides information on the growth or oncogenic potential of a biological sample. In particular, the status of 161P2F10B provides information useful for predicting susceptibility to particular disease stages, progression, and/or tumor aggressiveness. The invention provides methods and assays for determining 161P2F10B status and diagnosing cancers that express 161P2F10B, such as cancers of the tissues listed in Table I. For example, because 161P2F10B mRNA is so highly expressed in kidney and other cancers relative to normal kidney tissue, assays that evaluate the levels of 161P2F10B mRNA transcripts or proteins in a biological sample can be used to diagnose a disease associated with 161P2F10B dysregulation, and can provide prognostic information useful in defining appropriate therapeutic options.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression status of 161P2F10B provides information including the presence, stage and location of dysplastic, precancerous and cancerous cells, predicting susceptibility to various stages of disease, and/or for gauging tumor aggressiveness. Moreover, the expression profile makes it useful as an imaging reagent for metastasized disease. Consequently, an aspect of the invention is directed to the various molecular prognostic and diagnostic methods for examining the status of 161P2F10B in biological samples such as those from individuals suffering from, or suspected of suffering from a pathology characterized by dysregulated cellular growth, such as cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, the status of 161P2F10B in a biological sample can be examined by a number of well-known procedures in the art. For example, the status of 161P2F10B in a biological sample taken from a specific location in the body can be examined by evaluating the sample for the presence or absence of 161P2F10B expressing cells (e.g. those that express 161P2F10B mRNAs or proteins). This examination can provide evidence of dysregulated cellular growth, for example, when 161P2F10B-expressing cells are found in a biological sample that does not normally contain such cells (such as a lymph node), because such alterations in the status of 161P2F10B in a biological sample are often associated with dysregulated cellular growth. Specifically, one indicator of dysregulated cellular growth is the metastases of cancer cells from an organ of origin (such as the prostate) to a different area of the body (such as a lymph node). In this context, evidence of dysregulated cellular growth is important for example because occult lymph node metastases can be detected in a substantial proportion of patients with prostate cancer, and such metastases are associated with known predictors of disease progression (see, e.g., Murphy et al., Prostate 42(4): 315-317 (2000); Su et al., Semin. Surg. Oncol. 18(1): 17-28 (2000) and Freeman et al., J Urol 1995 Aug 154(2 Pt 1):474-8).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides methods for monitoring 161P2F10B gene products by determining the status of 161P2F10B gene products expressed by cells from an individual suspected of having a disease associated with dysregulated cell growth (such as hyperplasia or cancer) and then comparing the status so determined to the status of 161P2F10B gene products in a corresponding normal sample. The presence of aberrant 161P2F10B gene products in the test sample relative to the normal sample provides an indication of the presence of dysregulated cell growth within the cells of the individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides assays useful in determining the presence of cancer in an individual, comprising detecting a significant increase in 161P2F10B mRNA or protein expression in a test cell or tissue sample relative to expression levels in the corresponding normal cell or tissue. The presence of 161P2F10B mRNA can, for example, be evaluated in tissues including but not limited to those listed in Table I. The presence of significant 161P2F10B expression in any of these tissues is useful to indicate the emergence, presence and/or severity of a cancer, since the corresponding normal tissues do not express 161P2F10B mRNA or express it at lower levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a related embodiment, 161P2F10B status is determined at the protein level rather than at the nucleic acid level. For example, such a method comprises determining the level of 161P2F10B protein expressed by cells in a test tissue sample and comparing the level so determined to the level of 161P2F10B expressed in a corresponding normal sample. In one embodiment, the presence of 161P2F10B protein is evaluated, for example, using immunohistochemical methods. 161P2F10B antibodies or binding partners capable of detecting 161P2F10B protein expression are used in a variety of assay formats well known in the art for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, one can evaluate the status of 161P2F10B nucleotide and amino acid sequences in a biological sample in order to identify perturbations in the structure of these molecules. These perturbations can include insertions, deletions, substitutions and the like. Such evaluations are useful because perturbations in the nucleotide and amino acid sequences are observed in a large number of proteins associated with a growth dysregulated phenotype (see, e.g., Marrogi et al., 1999, J. Cutan. Pathol. 26(8):369-378). For example, a mutation in the sequence of 161P2F10B may be indicative of the presence or promotion of a tumor. Such assays therefore have diagnostic and predictive value where a mutation in 161P2F10B indicates a potential loss of function or increase in tumor growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of assays for observing perturbations in nucleotide and amino acid sequences are well known in the art. For example, the size and structure of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences of 161P2F10B gene products are observed by the Northern, Southern, Western, PCR and DNA sequencing protocols discussed herein. In addition, other methods for observing perturbations in nucleotide and amino acid sequences such as single strand conformation polymorphism analysis are well known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,382,510 issued 7 Sep. 1999, and 5,952,170 issued 17 Jan. 1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, one can examine the methylation status of a 161P2F10B gene in a biological sample. Aberrant demethylation and/or hypermethylation of CpG islands in \ngene\n 5′ regulatory regions frequently occurs in immortalized and transformed cells, and can result in altered expression of various genes. For example, promoter hypermethylation of the pi-class glutathione S-transferase (a protein expressed in normal prostate but not expressed in >90% of prostate carcinomas) appears to permanently silence transcription of this gene and is the most frequently detected genomic alteration in prostate carcinomas (De Marzo et al., Am. J. Pathol. 155(6): 1985-1992 (1999)). In addition, this alteration is present in at least 70% of cases of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) (Brooks et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev., 1998, 7:531-536). In another example, expression of the LAGE-I tumor specific gene (which is not expressed in normal prostate but is expressed in 25-50% of prostate cancers) is induced by deoxy-azacytidine in lymphoblastoid cells, suggesting that tumoral expression is due to demethylation (Lethe et al., Int. J. Cancer 76(6): 903-908 (1998)). A variety of assays for examining methylation status of a gene are well known in the art. For example, one can utilize, in Southern hybridization approaches, methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes that cannot cleave sequences that contain methylated CpG sites to assess the methylation status of CpG islands. In addition, MSP (methylation specific PCR) can rapidly profile the methylation status of all the CpG sites present in a CpG island of a given gene. This procedure involves initial modification of DNA by sodium bisulfite (which will convert all unmethylated cytosines to uracil) followed by amplification using primers specific for methylated versus unmethylated DNA. Protocols involving methylation interference can also be found for example in Current Protocols In Molecular Biology, \nUnit\n 12, Frederick M. Ausubel et al. eds., 1995.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene amplification is an additional method for assessing the status of 161P2F10B. Gene amplification is measured in a sample directly, for example, by conventional Southern blotting or Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA (Thomas, 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77:5201 5205), dot blotting (DNA analysis), or in situ hybridization, using an appropriately labeled probe, based on the sequences provided herein. Alternatively, antibodies are employed that recognize specific duplexes, including DNA duplexes, RNA duplexes, and DNA RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA protein duplexes. The antibodies in turn are labeled and the assay carried out where the duplex is bound to a surface, so that upon the formation of duplex on the surface, the presence of antibody bound to the duplex can be detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiopsied tissue or peripheral blood can be conveniently assayed for the presence of cancer cells using for example, Northern, dot blot or RT-PCR analysis to detect 161P2F10B expression. The presence of RT-PCR amplifiable 161P2F10B mRNA provides an indication of the presence of cancer. RT-PCR assays are well known in the art. RT-PCR detection assays for tumor cells in peripheral blood are currently being evaluated for use in the diagnosis and management of a number of human solid tumors. In the prostate cancer field, these include RT-PCR assays for the detection of cells expressing PSA and PSM (Verkaik et al., 1997, Urol. Res. 25:373-384; Ghossein et al., 1995, J. Clin. Oncol. 13:1195-2000; Heston et al., 1995, Clin. Chem. 41:1687-1688).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the invention is an assessment of the susceptibility that an individual has for developing cancer. In one embodiment, a method for predicting susceptibility to cancer comprises detecting 161P2F10B mRNA or 161P2F10B protein in a tissue sample, its presence indicating susceptibility to cancer, wherein the degree of 161P2F10B mRNA expression correlates to the degree of susceptibility. In a specific embodiment, the presence of 161P2F10B in prostate or other tissue is examined, with the presence of 161P2F10B in the sample providing an indication of prostate cancer susceptibility (or the emergence or existence of a prostate tumor). Similarly, one can evaluate the integrity 161P2F10B nucleotide and amino acid sequences in a biological sample, in order to identify perturbations in the structure of these molecules such as insertions, deletions, substitutions and the like. The presence of one or more perturbations in 161P2F10B gene products in the sample is an indication of cancer susceptibility (or the emergence or existence of a tumor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also comprises methods for gauging tumor aggressiveness. In one embodiment, a method for gauging aggressiveness of a tumor comprises determining the level of 161P2F10B mRNA or 161P2F10B protein expressed by tumor cells, comparing the level so determined to the level of 161P2F10B mRNA or 161P2F10B protein expressed in a corresponding normal tissue taken from the same individual or a normal tissue reference sample, wherein the degree of 161P2F10B mRNA or 161P2F10B protein expression in the tumor sample relative to the normal sample indicates the degree of aggressiveness. In a specific embodiment, aggressiveness of a tumor is evaluated by determining the extent to which 161P2F10B is expressed in the tumor cells, with higher expression levels indicating more aggressive tumors. Another embodiment is the evaluation of the integrity of 161P2F10B nucleotide and amino acid sequences in a biological sample, in order to identify perturbations in the structure of these molecules such as insertions, deletions, substitutions and the like. The presence of one or more perturbations indicates more aggressive tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the invention is directed to methods for observing the progression of a malignancy in an individual over time. In one embodiment, methods for observing the progression of a malignancy in an individual over time comprise determining the level of 161P2F10B mRNA or 161P2F10B protein expressed by cells in a sample of the tumor, comparing the level so determined to the level of 161P2F10B mRNA or 161P2F10B protein expressed in an equivalent tissue sample taken from the same individual at a different time, wherein the degree of 161P2F10B mRNA or 161P2F10B protein expression in the tumor sample over time provides information on the progression of the cancer. In a specific embodiment, the progression of a cancer is evaluated by determining 161P2F10B expression in the tumor cells over time, where increased expression over time indicates a progression of the cancer. Also, one can evaluate the integrity 161P2F10B nucleotide and amino acid sequences in a biological sample in order to identify perturbations in the structure of these molecules such as insertions, deletions, substitutions and the like, where the presence of one or more perturbations indicates a progression of the cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above diagnostic approaches can be combined with any one of a wide variety of prognostic and diagnostic protocols known in the art. For example, another embodiment of the invention is directed to methods for observing a coincidence between the expression of 161P2F10B gene and 161P2F10B gene products (or perturbations in 161P2F10B gene and 161P2F10B gene products) and a factor that is associated with malignancy, as a means for diagnosing and prognosticating the status of a tissue sample. A wide variety of factors associated with malignancy can be utilized, such as the expression of genes associated with malignancy as well as gross cytological observations (see, e.g., Bocking et al., 1984, Anal. Quant. Cytol. 6(2):74-88; Epstein, 1995, Hum. Pathol. 26(2):223-9; Thorson et al., 1998, Mod. Pathol. 11(6):543-51; Baisden et al., 1999, Am. J. Surg. Pathol. 23(8):918-24). Methods for observing a coincidence between the expression of 161P2F10B gene and 161P2F10B gene products (or perturbations in 161P2F10B gene and 161P2F10B gene products) and another factor that is associated with malignancy are useful, for example, because the presence of a set of specific factors that coincide with disease provides information crucial for diagnosing and prognosticating the status of a tissue sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for detecting and quantifying the expression of 161P2F10B mRNA or protein are described herein, and standard nucleic acid and protein detection and quantification technologies are well known in the art. Standard methods for the detection and quantification of 161P2F10B mRNA include in situ hybridization using labeled 161P2F10B riboprobes, Northern blot and related techniques using 161P2F10B polynucleotide probes, RT-PCR analysis using primers specific for 161P2F10B, and other amplification type detection methods, such as, for example, branched DNA, SISBA, TMA and the like. In a specific embodiment, semi-quantitative RT-PCR is used to detect and quantify 161P2F10B mRNA expression. Any number of primers capable of amplifying 161P2F10B can be used for this purpose, including but not limited to the various primer sets specifically described herein. In a specific embodiment, polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specifically reactive with the wild-type 161P2F10B protein can be used in an immunohistochemical assay of biopsied tissue.\n\n\n \nVIII.) Identification of Molecules That Interact With 161P2F10B\n\n\n \n \n \nThe 161P2F10B protein and nucleic acid sequences disclosed herein allow a skilled artisan to identify proteins, small molecules and other agents that interact with 161P2F10B, as well as pathways activated by 161P2F10B via any one of a variety of art accepted protocols. For example, one can utilize one of the so-called interaction trap systems (also referred to as the “two-hybrid assay”). In such systems, molecules interact and reconstitute a transcription factor which directs expression of a reporter gene, whereupon the expression of the reporter gene is assayed. Other systems identify protein-protein interactions in vivo through reconstitution of a eukaryotic transcriptional activator, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,955,280 issued 21 Sep. 1999, 5,925,523 issued 20 Jul. 1999, 5,846,722 issued 8 Dec. 1998 and 6,004,746 issued 21 Dec. 1999. Algorithms are also available in the art for genome-based predictions of protein function (see, e.g., Marcotte, et al., Nature 402: 4 Nov. 1999, 83-86).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively one can screen peptide libraries to identify molecules that interact with 161P2F10B protein sequences. In such methods, peptides that bind to 161P2F10B are identified by screening libraries that encode a random or controlled collection of amino acids. Peptides encoded by the libraries are expressed as fusion proteins of bacteriophage coat proteins, the bacteriophage particles are then screened against the 161P2F10B protein(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, peptides having a wide variety of uses, such as therapeutic, prognostic or diagnostic reagents, are thus identified without any prior information on the structure of the expected ligand or receptor molecule. Typical peptide libraries and screening methods that can be used to identify molecules that interact with 161P2F10B protein sequences are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,723,286 issued 3 Mar. 1998 and 5,733,731 issued 31 Mar. 1998.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, cell lines that express 161P2F10B are used to identify protein-protein interactions mediated by 161P2F10B. Such interactions can be examined using immunoprecipitation techniques (see, e.g., Hamilton B. J., et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999, 261:646-51). 161P2F10B protein can be immunoprecipitated from 161P2F10B-expressing cell lines using anti-161P2F10B antibodies. Alternatively, antibodies against His-tag can be used in a cell line engineered to express fusions of 161P2F10B and a His-tag (vectors mentioned above). The immunoprecipitated complex can be examined for protein association by procedures such as Western blotting, 35S-methionine labeling of proteins, protein microsequencing, silver staining and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmall molecules and ligands that interact with 161P2F10B can be identified through related embodiments of such screening assays. For example, small molecules can be identified that interfere with protein function, including molecules that interfere with 161P2F10B's ability to mediate phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation, interaction with DNA or RNA molecules as an indication of regulation of cell cycles, second messenger signaling or tumorigenesis. Similarly, small molecules that modulate 161P2F10B-related ion channel, protein pump, or cell communication functions are identified and used to treat patients that have a cancer that expresses 161P2F10B (see, e.g., Hille, B., Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes 2nd Ed., Sinauer Assoc., Sunderland, Mass., 1992). Moreover, ligands that regulate 161P2F10B function can be identified based on their ability to bind 161P2F10B and activate a reporter construct. Typical methods are discussed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,928,868 issued 27 Jul. 1999, and include methods for forming hybrid ligands in which at least one ligand is a small molecule. In an illustrative embodiment, cells engineered to express a fusion protein of 161P2F10B and a DNA-binding protein are used to co-express a fusion protein of a hybrid ligand/small molecule and a cDNA library transcriptional activator protein. The cells further contain a reporter gene, the expression of which is conditioned on the proximity of the first and second fusion proteins to each other, an event that occurs only if the hybrid ligand binds to target sites on both hybrid proteins. Those cells that express the reporter gene are selected and the unknown small molecule or the unknown ligand is identified. This method provides a means of identifying modulators, which activate or inhibit 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn embodiment of this invention comprises a method of screening for a molecule that interacts with a 161P2F10B amino acid sequence shown in \nFIG. 1\n, comprising the steps of contacting a population of molecules with a 161P2F10B amino acid sequence, allowing the population of molecules and the 161P2F10B amino acid sequence to interact under conditions that facilitate an interaction, determining the presence of a molecule that interacts with the 161P2F10B amino acid sequence, and then separating molecules that do not interact with the 161P2F10B amino acid sequence from molecules that do. In a specific embodiment, the method further comprises purifying, characterizing and identifying a molecule that interacts with the 161P2F10B amino acid sequence. The identified molecule can be used to modulate a function performed by 161P2F10B. In a preferred embodiment, the 161P2F10B amino acid sequence is contacted with a library of peptides.\n\n\n \nIX.) Therapeutic Methods and Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe identification of 161P2F10B as a protein that is normally expressed in a restricted set of tissues, but which is also expressed in cancers such as those listed in Table I, opens a number of therapeutic approaches to the treatment of such cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf note, targeted antitumor therapies have been useful even when the targeted protein is expressed on normal tissues, even vital normal organ tissues. A vital organ is one that is necessary to sustain life, such as the heart or colon. A non-vital organ is one that can be removed whereupon the individual is still able to survive. Examples of non-vital organs are ovary, breast, and prostate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, Herceptin® is an FDA approved pharmaceutical that consists of an antibody which is immunoreactive with the protein variously known as HER2, HER2/neu, and erb-b-2. It is marketed by Genentech and has been a commercially successful antitumor agent. Herceptin® sales reached almost $400 million in 2002. Herceptin® is a treatment for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. However, the expression of HER2 is not limited to such tumors. The same protein is expressed in a number of normal tissues. In particular, it is known that HER2/neu is present in normal kidney and heart, thus these tissues are present in all human recipients of Herceptin. The presence of HER2/neu in normal kidney is also confirmed by Latif, Z., et al., B.J.U. International (2002) 89:5-9. As shown in this article (which evaluated whether renal cell carcinoma should be a preferred indication for anti-HER2 antibodies such as Herceptin) both protein and mRNA are produced in benign renal tissues. Notably, HER2/neu protein was strongly overexpressed in benign renal tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite the fact that HER2/neu is expressed in such vital tissues as heart and kidney, Herceptin is a very useful, FDA approved, and commercially successful drug. The effect of Herceptin on cardiac tissue, i.e., “cardiotoxicity,” has merely been a side effect to treatment. When patients were treated with Herceptin alone, significant cardiotoxicity occurred in a very low percentage of patients. To minimize cariotoxicity there is a more stringent entry requirement for the treatment with HER2/neu. Factors such as predisposition to heart condition are evaluated before treatment can occur.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf particular note, although kidney tissue is indicated to exhibit normal expression, possibly even higher expression than cardiac tissue, kidney has no appreciable Herceptin side effect whatsoever. Moreover, of the diverse array of normal tissues in which HER2 is expressed, there is very little occurrence of any side effect. Only cardiac tissue has manifested any appreciable side effect at all. A tissue such as kidney, where HER2/neu expression is especially notable, has not been the basis for any side effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, favorable therapeutic effects have been found for antitumor therapies that target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); Erbitux (ImClone). EGFR is also expressed in numerous normal tissues. There have been very limited side effects in normal tissues following use of anti-EGFR therapeutics. A general side effect that occurs with the EGFR treatment is a severe skin rash observed in 100% of the patients undergoing treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, expression of a target protein in normal tissue, even vital normal tissue, does not defeat the utility of a targeting agent for the protein as a therapeutic for certain tumors in which the protein is also overexpressed. For example, expression in vital organs is not in and of itself detrimental. In addition, organs regarded as dispensible, such as the prostate and ovary, can be removed without affecting mortality. Finally, some vital organs are not affected by normal organ expression because of an immunoprivilege. Immunoprivileged organs are organs that are protected from blood by a blood-organ barrier and thus are not accessible to immunotherapy. Examples of immunoprivileged organs are the brain and testis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, therapeutic approaches that inhibit the activity of a 161P2F10B protein are useful for patients suffering from a cancer that expresses 161P2F10B. These therapeutic approaches generally fall into three classes. The first class modulates 161P2F10B function as it relates to tumor cell growth leading to inhibition or retardation of tumor cell growth or inducing its killing. The second class comprises various methods for inhibiting the binding or association of a 161P2F10B protein with its binding partner or with other proteins. The third class comprises a variety of methods for inhibiting the transcription of a 161P2F10B gene or translation of 161P2F10B mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIX.A.) Anti-Cancer Vaccines\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides cancer vaccines comprising a 161P2F10B-related protein or 161P2F10B-related nucleic acid. In view of the expression of 161P2F10B, cancer vaccines prevent and/or treat 161P2F10B-expressing cancers with minimal or no effects on non-target tissues. The use of a tumor antigen in a vaccine that generates cell-mediated humoral immune responses as anti-cancer therapy is well known in the art and has been employed in prostate cancer using human PSMA and rodent PAP immunogens (Hodge et al., 1995, Int. J. Cancer 63:231-237; Fong et al., 1997, J. Immunol. 159:3113-3117).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch methods can be readily practiced by employing a 161P2F10B-related protein, or a 161P2F10B-encoding nucleic acid molecule and recombinant vectors capable of expressing and presenting the 161P2F10B immunogen (which typically comprises a number of T-cell epitopes or antibody). Skilled artisans understand that a wide variety of vaccine systems for delivery of immunoreactive epitopes are known in the art (see, e.g., Heryln et al., Ann Med 1999 February 31(1):66-78; Maruyama et al., Cancer Immunol Immunother 2000 June 49(3):123-32) Briefly, such methods of generating an immune response (e.g. cell-mediated and/or humoral) in a mammal, comprise the steps of: exposing the mammal's immune system to an immunoreactive epitope (e.g. an epitope present in a 161P2F10B protein shown in \nFIG. 1\n or analog or homolog thereof) so that the mammal generates an immune response that is specific for that epitope (e.g. generates antibodies that specifically recognize that epitope).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe entire 161P2F10B protein, immunogenic regions or epitopes thereof can be combined and delivered by various means. Such vaccine compositions can include, for example, lipopeptides (e.g., Vitiello, A. et al., J. Clin. Invest. 95:341, 1995), peptide compositions encapsulated in poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (“PLG”) microspheres (see, e.g., Eldridge, et al., Molec. Immunol. 28:287-294, 1991: Alonso et al., Vaccine 12:299-306, 1994; Jones et al., Vaccine 13:675-681, 1995), peptide compositions contained in immune stimulating complexes (ISCOMS) (see, e.g., Takahashi et al., Nature 344:873-875, 1990; Hu et al., Clin Exp Immunol. 113:235-243, 1998), multiple antigen peptide systems (MAPs) (see e.g., Tam, J. P., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:5409-5413, 1988; Tam, J. P., J. Immunol. Methods 196:17-32, 1996), peptides formulated as multivalent peptides; peptides for use in ballistic delivery systems, typically crystallized peptides, viral delivery vectors (Perkus, M. E. et al., In: Concepts in vaccine development, Kaufmann, S. H. E., ed., p. 379, 1996; Chakrabarti, S. et al., Nature 320:535, 1986; Hu, S. L. et al., Nature 320:537, 1986; Kieny, M.-P. et al., AIDS Bio/Technology 4:790, 1986; Top, F. H. et al., J. Infect. Dis. 124:148, 1971; Chanda, P. K. et al., Virology 175:535, 1990), particles of viral or synthetic origin (e.g., Kofler, N. et al., J. Immunol. Methods. 192:25, 1996; Eldridge, J. H. et al., Sem. Hematol. 30:16, 1993; Falo, L. D., Jr. et al., Nature Med. 7:649, 1995), adjuvants (Warren, H. S., Vogel, F. R., and Chedid, L. A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 4:369, 1986; Gupta, R. K. et al., Vaccine 11:293, 1993), liposomes (Reddy, R. et al., J. Immunol. 148:1585, 1992; Rock, K. L., Immunol. Today 17:131, 1996), or, naked or particle absorbed cDNA (Ulmer, J. B. et al., Science 259:1745, 1993; Robinson, H. L., Hunt, L. A., and Webster, R. G., Vaccine 11:957, 1993; Shiver, J. W. et al., In: Concepts in vaccine development, Kaufmann, S. H. E., ed., p. 423, 1996; Cease, K. B., and Berzofsky, J. A., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12:923, 1994 and Eldridge, J. H. et al., Sem. Hematol. 30:16, 1993). Toxin-targeted delivery technologies, also known as receptor mediated targeting, such as those of Avant Immunotherapeutics, Inc. (Needham, Mass.) may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn patients with 161P2F10B-associated cancer, the vaccine and antibody compositions of the invention can also be used in conjunction with other treatments used for cancer, e.g., surgery, chemotherapy, drug therapies, radiation therapies, etc. including use in combination with immune adjuvants such as IL-2, IL-12, GM-CSF, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCellular Vaccines:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCTL epitopes can be determined using specific algorithms to identify peptides within 161P2F10B protein that bind corresponding HLA alleles (e.g., Brown University, BIMAS, and SYFPEITHI. In a preferred embodiment, a 161P2F10B immunogen contains one or more amino acid sequences identified using techniques well known in the art, such as the sequences shown in Tables previously disclosed or a peptide of 8, 9, 10 or 11 amino acids specified by an HLA Class I motif/supermotif (e.g., Table IV (A), Table IV (D), or Table IV (E)) and/or a peptide of at least 9 amino acids that comprises an HLA Class II motif/supermotif (e.g., Table IV (B) or Table IV (C)). As is appreciated in the art, the HLA Class I binding groove is essentially closed ended so that peptides of only a particular size range can fit into the groove and be bound, generally HLA Class I epitopes are 8, 9, 10, or 11 amino acids long. In contrast, the HLA Class II binding groove is essentially open ended; therefore a peptide of about 9 or more amino acids can be bound by an HLA Class II molecule. Due to the binding groove differences between HLA Class I and II, HLA Class I motifs are length specific, i.e., position two of a Class I motif is the second amino acid in an amino to carboxyl direction of the peptide. The amino acid positions in a Class II motif are relative only to each other, not the overall peptide, i.e., additional amino acids can be attached to the amino and/or carboxyl termini of a motif-bearing sequence. HLA Class II epitopes are often 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 amino acids long, or longer than 25 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of methods for generating an immune response in a mammal are known in the art (for example as the first step in the generation of hybridomas). Methods of generating an immune response in a mammal comprise exposing the mammal's immune system to an immunogenic epitope on a protein (e.g. a 161P2F10B protein) so that an immune response is generated. A typical embodiment consists of a method for generating an immune response to 161P2F10B in a host, by contacting the host with a sufficient amount of at least one 161P2F10B B cell or cytotoxic T-cell epitope or analog thereof; and at least one periodic interval thereafter re-contacting the host with the 161P2F10B B cell or cytotoxic T-cell epitope or analog thereof. A specific embodiment consists of a method of generating an immune response against a 161P2F10B-related protein or a man-made multiepitopic peptide comprising: administering 161P2F10B immunogen (e.g. a 161P2F10B protein or a peptide fragment thereof, a 161P2F10B fusion protein or analog etc.) in a vaccine preparation to a human or another mammal. Typically, such vaccine preparations further contain a suitable adjuvant (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,146,635) or a universal helper epitope such as a PADRE™ peptide (Epimmune Inc., San Diego, Calif.; see, e.g., Alexander et al., J. Immunol. 2000 164(3); 164(3): 1625-1633; Alexander et al., Immunity 1994 1(9): 751-761 and Alexander et al., Immunol. Res. 1998 18(2): 79-92). An alternative method comprises generating an immune response in an individual against a 161P2F10B immunogen by: administering in vivo to muscle or skin of the individual's body a DNA molecule that comprises a DNA sequence that encodes a 161P2F10B immunogen, the DNA sequence operatively linked to regulatory sequences which control the expression of the DNA sequence; wherein the DNA molecule is taken up by cells, the DNA sequence is expressed in the cells and an immune response is generated against the immunogen (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,962,428). Optionally a genetic vaccine facilitator such as anionic lipids; saponins; lectins; estrogenic compounds; hydroxylated lower alkyls; dimethyl sulfoxide; and urea is also administered. In addition, an antiidiotypic antibody can be administered that mimics 161P2F10B, in order to generate a response to the target antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic Acid Vaccines:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVaccine compositions of the invention include nucleic acid-mediated modalities. DNA or RNA that encode protein(s) of the invention can be administered to a patient. Genetic immunization methods can be employed to generate prophylactic or therapeutic humoral and cellular immune responses directed against cancer cells expressing 161P2F10B. Constructs comprising DNA encoding a 161P2F10B-related protein/immunogen and appropriate regulatory sequences can be injected directly into muscle or skin of an individual, such that the cells of the muscle or skin take-up the construct and express the encoded 161P2F10B protein/immunogen. Alternatively, a vaccine comprises a 161P2F10B-related protein. Expression of the 161P2F10B-related protein immunogen results in the generation of prophylactic or therapeutic humoral and cellular immunity against cells that bear a 161P2F10B protein. Various prophylactic and therapeutic genetic immunization techniques known in the art can be used. Nucleic acid-based delivery is described, for instance, in Wolff et. al., Science 247:1465 (1990) as well as U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,580,859; 5,589,466; 5,804,566; 5,739,118; 5,736,524; 5,679,647; WO 98/04720. Examples of DNA-based delivery technologies include “naked DNA”, facilitated (bupivicaine, polymers, peptide-mediated) delivery, cationic lipid complexes, and particle-mediated (“gene gun”) or pressure-mediated delivery (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,687).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor therapeutic or prophylactic immunization purposes, proteins of the invention can be expressed via viral or bacterial vectors. Various viral gene delivery systems that can be used in the practice of the invention include, but are not limited to, vaccinia, fowlpox, canarypox, adenovirus, influenza, poliovirus, adeno-associated virus, lentivirus, and sindbis virus (see, e.g., Restifo, 1996, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 8:658-663; Tsang et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 87:982-990 (1995)). Non-viral delivery systems can also be employed by introducing naked DNA encoding a 161P2F10B-related protein into the patient (e.g., intramuscularly or intradermally) to induce an anti-tumor response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVaccinia virus is used, for example, as a vector to express nucleotide sequences that encode the peptides of the invention. Upon introduction into a host, the recombinant vaccinia virus expresses the protein immunogenic peptide, and thereby elicits a host immune response. Vaccinia vectors and methods useful in immunization protocols are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,722,848. Another vector is BCG (Bacille Calmette Guerin). BCG vectors are described in Stover et al., Nature 351:456-460 (1991). A wide variety of other vectors useful for therapeutic administration or immunization of the peptides of the invention, e.g. adeno and adeno-associated virus vectors, retroviral vectors, \nSalmonella typhi \nvectors, detoxified anthrax toxin vectors, and the like, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, gene delivery systems are used to deliver a 161P2F10B-related nucleic acid molecule. In one embodiment, the full-length human 161P2F10B cDNA is employed. In another embodiment, 161P2F10B nucleic acid molecules encoding specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and/or antibody epitopes are employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEx Vivo Vaccines\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious ex vivo strategies can also be employed to generate an immune response. One approach involves the use of antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DC) to present 161P2F10B antigen to a patient's immune system. Dendritic cells express MHC class I and II molecules, B7 co-stimulator, and IL-12, and are thus highly specialized antigen presenting cells. In prostate cancer, autologous dendritic cells pulsed with peptides of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) are being used in a Phase I clinical trial to stimulate prostate cancer patients' immune systems (Tjoa et al., 1996, Prostate 28:65-69; Murphy et al., 1996, Prostate 29:371-380). Thus, dendritic cells can be used to present 161P2F10B peptides to T cells in the context of MHC class I or II molecules. In one embodiment, autologous dendritic cells are pulsed with 161P2F10B peptides capable of binding to MHC class I and/or class II molecules. In another embodiment, dendritic cells are pulsed with the complete 161P2F10B protein. Yet another embodiment involves engineering the overexpression of a 161P2F10B gene in dendritic cells using various implementing vectors known in the art, such as adenovirus (Arthur et al., 1997, Cancer Gene Ther. 4:17-25), retrovirus (Henderson et al., 1996, Cancer Res. 56:3763-3770), lentivirus, adeno-associated virus, DNA transfection (Ribas et al., 1997, Cancer Res. 57:2865-2869), or tumor-derived RNA transfection (Ashley et al., 1997, J. Exp. Med. 186:1177-1182). Cells that express 161P2F10B can also be engineered to express immune modulators, such as GM-CSF, and used as immunizing agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B as a Target for Antibody-Based Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B is an attractive target for antibody-based therapeutic strategies. A number of antibody strategies are known in the art for targeting both extracellular and intracellular molecules (see, e.g., complement and ADCC mediated killing as well as the use of intrabodies). Because 161P2F10B is expressed by cancer cells of various lineages relative to corresponding normal cells, systemic administration of 161P2F10B-immunoreactive compositions are prepared that exhibit excellent sensitivity without toxic, non-specific and/or non-target effects caused by binding of the immunoreactive composition to non-target organs and tissues. Antibodies specifically reactive with domains of 161P2F10B are useful to treat 161P2F10B-expressing cancers systemically, either as conjugates with a toxin or therapeutic agent, or as naked antibodies capable of inhibiting cell proliferation or function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B antibodies can be introduced into a patient such that the antibody binds to 161P2F10B and modulates a function, such as an interaction with a binding partner, and consequently mediates destruction of the tumor cells and/or inhibits the growth of the tumor cells. Mechanisms by which such antibodies exert a therapeutic effect can include complement-mediated cytolysis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, modulation of the physiological function of 161P2F10B, inhibition of ligand binding or signal transduction pathways, modulation of tumor cell differentiation, alteration of tumor angiogenesis factor profiles, and/or apoptosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art understand that antibodies can be used to specifically target and bind immunogenic molecules such as an immunogenic region of a 161P2F10B sequence shown in \nFIG. 1\n. In addition, skilled artisans understand that it is routine to conjugate antibodies to cytotoxic agents (see, e.g., Slevers et al. Blood 93:11 3678-3684 (Jun. 1, 1999)). When cytotoxic and/or therapeutic agents are delivered directly to cells, such as by conjugating them to antibodies specific for a molecule expressed by that cell (e.g. 161P2F10B), the cytotoxic agent will exert its known biological effect (i.e. cytotoxicity) on those cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of compositions and methods for using antibody-cytotoxic agent conjugates to kill cells are known in the art. In the context of cancers, typical methods entail administering to an animal having a tumor a biologically effective amount of a conjugate comprising a selected cytotoxic and/or therapeutic agent linked to a targeting agent (e.g. an anti-161P2F10B antibody) that binds to a marker (e.g. 161P2F10B) expressed, accessible to binding or localized on the cell surfaces. A typical embodiment is a method of delivering a cytotoxic and/or therapeutic agent to a cell expressing 161P2F10B, comprising conjugating the cytotoxic agent to an antibody that immunospecifically binds to a 161P2F10B epitope, and, exposing the cell to the antibody-agent conjugate. Another illustrative embodiment is a method of treating an individual suspected of suffering from metastasized cancer, comprising a step of administering parenterally to said individual a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic and/or therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer immunotherapy using anti-161P2F10B antibodies can be done in accordance with various approaches that have been successfully employed in the treatment of other types of cancer, including but not limited to colon cancer (Arlen et al., 1998, Crit. Rev. Immunol. 18:133-138), multiple myeloma (Ozaki et al., 1997, Blood 90:3179-3186, Tsunenari et al., 1997, Blood 90:2437-2444), gastric cancer (Kasprzyk et al., 1992, Cancer Res. 52:2771-2776), B-cell lymphoma (Funakoshi et al., 1996, J. Immunother. Emphasis Tumor Immunol. 19:93-101), leukemia (Zhong et al., 1996, Leuk. Res. 20:581-589), colorectal cancer (Moun et al., 1994, Cancer Res. 54:6160-6166; Velders et al., 1995, Cancer Res. 55:4398-4403), and breast cancer (Shepard et al., 1991, J. Clin. Immunol. 11:117-127). Some therapeutic approaches involve conjugation of naked antibody to a toxin or radioisotope, such as the conjugation of Y91 or I131 to anti-CD20 antibodies (e.g., Zevalin™, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp. or Bexxar™, Coulter Pharmaceuticals) respectively, while others involve co-administration of antibodies and other therapeutic agents, such as Herceptin™ (trastuzu MAb) with paclitaxel (Genentech, Inc.). The antibodies can be conjugated to a therapeutic agent. To treat kidney cancer, for example, 161P2F10B antibodies can be administered in conjunction with radiation, chemotherapy or hormone ablation. Also, antibodies can be conjugated to a toxin such as calicheamicin (e.g., Mylotarg™, Wyeth-Ayerst, Madison, N.J., a recombinant humanized IgG4 kappa antibody conjugated to antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin) or a maytansinoid (e.g., taxane-based Tumor-Activated Prodrug, TAP, platform, ImmunoGen, Cambridge, Mass., also see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,064) or Auristatin E (Nat. Biotechnol. 2003 July; 21(7):778-84. (Seattle Genetics)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough 161P2F10B antibody therapy is useful for all stages of cancer, antibody therapy can be particularly appropriate in advanced or metastatic cancers. Treatment with the antibody therapy of the invention is indicated for patients who have received one or more rounds of chemotherapy. Alternatively, antibody therapy of the invention is combined with a chemotherapeutic or radiation regimen for patients who have not received chemotherapeutic treatment. Additionally, antibody therapy can enable the use of reduced dosages of concomitant chemotherapy, particularly for patients who do not tolerate the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent very well. Fan et al. (Cancer Res. 53:4637-4642, 1993), Prewett et al. (International J. of Onco. 9:217-224, 1996), and Hancock et al. (Cancer Res. 51:4575-4580, 1991) describe the use of various antibodies together with chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough 161P2F10B antibody therapy is useful for all stages of cancer, antibody therapy can be particularly appropriate in advanced or metastatic cancers. Treatment with the antibody therapy of the invention is indicated for patients who have received one or more rounds of chemotherapy. Alternatively, antibody therapy of the invention is combined with a chemotherapeutic or radiation regimen for patients who have not received chemotherapeutic treatment. Additionally, antibody therapy can enable the use of reduced dosages of concomitant chemotherapy, particularly for patients who do not tolerate the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent very well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer patients can be evaluated for the presence and level of 161P2F10B expression, preferably using immunohistochemical assessments of tumor tissue, quantitative 161P2F10B imaging, or other techniques that reliably indicate the presence and degree of 161P2F10B expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor biopsies or surgical specimens is preferred for this purpose. Methods for immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-161P2F10B monoclonal antibodies that treat prostate and other cancers include those that initiate a potent immune response against the tumor or those that are directly cytotoxic. In this regard, anti-161P2F10B monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) can elicit tumor cell lysis by either complement-mediated or antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanisms, both of which require an intact Fc portion of the immunoglobulin molecule for interaction with effector cell Fc receptor sites on complement proteins. In addition, anti-161P2F10B MAbs that exert a direct biological effect on tumor growth are useful to treat cancers that express 161P2F10B. Mechanisms by which directly cytotoxic MAbs act include: inhibition of cell growth, modulation of cellular differentiation, modulation of tumor angiogenesis factor profiles, and the induction of apoptosis. The mechanism(s) by which a particular anti-161P2F10B MAb exerts an anti-tumor effect is evaluated using any number of in vitro assays that evaluate cell death such as ADCC, ADMMC, complement-mediated cell lysis, and so forth, as is generally known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some patients, the use of murine or other non-human monoclonal antibodies, or human/mouse chimeric MAbs can induce moderate to strong immune responses against the non-human antibody. This can result in clearance of the antibody from circulation and reduced efficacy. In the most severe cases, such an immune response can lead to the extensive formation of immune complexes which, potentially, can cause renal failure. Accordingly, preferred monoclonal antibodies used in the therapeutic methods of the invention are those that are either fully human or humanized and that bind specifically to the target 161P2F10B antigen with high affinity but exhibit low or no antigenicity in the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic methods of the invention contemplate the administration of single anti-161P2F10B MAbs as well as combinations, or cocktails, of different MAbs (i.e. 161P2F10B MAbs or Mabs that bind another protein). Such MAb cocktails can have certain advantages inasmuch as they contain MAbs that target different epitopes, exploit different effector mechanisms or combine directly cytotoxic MAbs with MAbs that rely on immune effector functionality. Such MAbs in combination can exhibit synergistic therapeutic effects. In addition, 161P2F10B MAbs can be administered concomitantly with other therapeutic modalities, including but not limited to various chemotherapeutic and biologic agents, androgen-blockers, immune modulators (e.g., IL-2, GM-CSF), surgery or radiation. The 161P2F10B MAbs are administered in their “naked” or unconjugated form, or can have a therapeutic agent(s) conjugated to them.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B Mab formulations are administered via any route capable of delivering the antibodies to a tumor cell. Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intratumor, intradermal, and the like. Treatment generally involves repeated administration of the 161P2F10B Mab preparation, via an acceptable route of administration such as intravenous injection (IV), typically at a dose in the range, including but not limited to, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, or 25 mg/kg body weight. In general, doses in the range of 10-1000 mg MAb per week are effective and well tolerated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on clinical experience with the Herceptin® (Trastuzumab) in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, an initial loading dose of approximately 4 mg/kg patient body weight IV, followed by weekly doses of about 2 mg/kg IV of the MAb preparation represents an acceptable dosing regimen. Preferably, the initial loading dose is administered as a 90-minute or longer infusion. The periodic maintenance dose is administered as a 30 minute or longer infusion, provided the initial dose was well tolerated. As appreciated by those of skill in the art, various factors can influence the ideal dose regimen in a particular case. Such factors include, for example, the binding affinity and half life of the MAbs used, the degree of 161P2F10B expression in the patient, the extent of circulating shed 161P2F10B antigen, the desired steady-state antibody concentration level, frequency of treatment, and the influence of chemotherapeutic or other agents used in combination with the treatment method of the invention, as well as the health status of a particular patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, patients should be evaluated for the levels of 161P2F10B in a given sample (e.g. the levels of circulating 161P2F10B antigen and/or 161P2F10B expressing cells) in order to assist in the determination of the most effective dosing regimen, etc. Such evaluations are also used for monitoring purposes throughout therapy, and are useful to gauge therapeutic success in combination with the evaluation of other parameters (for example, urine cytology and/or ImmunoCyt levels in bladder cancer therapy, or by analogy, serum PSA levels in prostate cancer therapy).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-idiotypic anti-161P2F10B antibodies can also be used in anti-cancer therapy as a vaccine for inducing an immune response to cells expressing a 161P2F10B-related protein. In particular, the generation of anti-idiotypic antibodies is well known in the art; this methodology can readily be adapted to generate anti-idiotypic anti-161P2F10B antibodies that mimic an epitope on a 161P2F10B-related protein (see, for example, Wagner et al., 1997, Hybridoma 16: 33-40; Foon et al., 1995, J. Clin. Invest. 96:334-342; Herlyn et al., 1996, Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 43:65-76). Such anti-idiotypic antibody can be used in cancer vaccine strategies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn object of the present invention is to provide 161P2F10B Mabs, which inhibit or retard the growth of tumor cells expressing 161P2F10B. A further object of this invention is to provide methods to inhibit angiogenesis and other biological functions and thereby reduce tumor growth in mammals, preferably humans, using such 161P2F10B Mabs, and in particular using such 161P2F10B Mabs combined with other drugs or immunologically active treatments, including but not limited to: Avastin® (bevacizumab), Sutent® (sunitinib malate), Nexavar® (Sorafinib tosylate), Taxotere® (docetaxel), Interleukin-2 (a.k.a. Proleukin®, IL-2, or Aldesleukin), or Interferon Alpha (Interferon-Alpha-2a, or Interferon-Alpha-2b) and others in the art known to treat renal and other cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, there is synergy when tumors, including human tumors, are treated with 161P2F10B antibodies in conjunction with chemotherapeutic agents or radiation or combinations thereof. In other words, the inhibition of tumor growth by a 161P2F10B antibody is enhanced more than expected when combined with chemotherapeutic agents or radiation or combinations thereof. Synergy may be shown, for example, by greater inhibition of tumor growth with combined treatment than would be expected from a treatment of only 161P2F10B antibodies or the additive effect of treatment with a 161P2F10B antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent or radiation. Preferably, synergy is demonstrated by remission of the cancer where remission is not expected from treatment either from a naked 161P2F10B antibody or with treatment using an additive combination of a 161P2F10B antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent or radiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method for inhibiting growth of tumor cells using a 161P2F10B antibody and a combination of chemotherapy or radiation or both comprises administering the 161P2F10B antibody before, during, or after commencing chemotherapy or radiation therapy, as well as any combination thereof (i.e. before and during, before and after, during and after, or before, during, and after commencing the chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy). For example, the 161P2F10B antibody is typically administered between 1 and 60 days, preferably between 3 and 40 days, more preferably between 5 and 12 days before commencing radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. However, depending on the treatment protocol and the specific patient needs, the method is performed in a manner that will provide the most efficacious treatment and ultimately prolong the life of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration of chemotherapeutic agents can be accomplished in a variety of ways including systemically by the parenteral and enteral routes. In one embodiment, the 161P2F10B antibody and the chemotherapeutic agent are administered as separate molecules. In another embodiment, the 161P2F10B antibody is attached, for example, by conjugation, to a chemotherapeutic agent. (See the Example entitled “Human Clinical Trials for the Treatment and Diagnosis of Human Carcinomas through use of 161P2F10B Mabs”). Particular examples of chemotherapeutic agents or chemotherapy include cisplatin, dacarbazine (DTIC), dactinomycin, mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard), streptozocin, cyclophosphamide, carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), doxorubicin (adriamycin), daunorubicin, procarbazine, mitomycin, cytarabine, etoposide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vinblastine, vincristine, bleomycin, paclitaxel (taxol), docetaxel (taxotere), aldesleukin, asparaginase, busulfan, carboplatin, cladribine, dacarbazine, floxuridine, fludarabine, hydroxyurea, ifosfamide, interferon alpha, leuprolide, megestrol, melphalan, mercaptopurine, plicamycin, mitotane, pegaspargase, pentostatin, pipobroman, plicamycin, streptozocin, tamoxifen, teniposide, testolactone, thioguanine, thiotepa, uracil mustard, vinorelbine, chlorambucil, taxol and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe source of radiation, used in combination with a 161P2F10B Mab, can be either external or internal to the patient being treated. When the source is external to the patient, the therapy is known as external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). When the source of radiation is internal to the patient, the treatment is called brachytherapy (BT).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above described therapeutic regimens may be further combined with additional cancer treating agents and/or regimes, for example additional chemotherapy, cancer vaccines, signal transduction inhibitors, agents useful in treating abnormal cell growth or cancer, antibodies (e.g. Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies as described in WO/2005/092380 (Pfizer)) or other ligands that inhibit tumor growth by binding to IGF-1R, and cytokines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the mammal is subjected to additional chemotherapy, chemotherapeutic agents described above may be used. Additionally, growth factor inhibitors, biological response modifiers, anti-hormonal therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), angiogenesis inhibitors, and anti-androgens may be used. For example, anti-hormones, for example anti-estrogens such as Nolvadex (tamoxifen) or, anti-androgens such as Casodex (4′-cyano-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-′-(trifluoromethyl)propionanilide) may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, the above described methods are combined with a cancer vaccine. Useful vaccines may be, without limitation, those comprised of cancer-associated antigens (e.g. BAGE, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), EBV, GAGE, gp100 (including gp100:209-217 and gp100:280-288, among others), HBV, HER-2/neu, HPV, HCV, MAGE, mammaglobin, MART-1/Melan-A, Mucin-1, NY-ESO-1, proteinase-3, PSA, RAGE, TRP-1, TRP-2, Tyrosinase (e.g., Tyrosinase: 368-376), WT-1), GM-CSF DNA and cell-based vaccines, dendritic cell vaccines, recombinant viral (e.g. vaccinia virus) vaccines, and heat shock protein (HSP) vaccines. Useful vaccines also include tumor vaccines, such as those formed of melanoma cells, and can be autologous or allogeneic. The vaccines may be, e.g., peptide, DNA or cell-based. These various agents can be combined such that a combination comprising, inter alia, gp100 peptides, Tyrosinase and MART-1 can be administered with the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVaccines may be administered prior to, or subsequent to, stem cell transplantation, and when chemotherapy is part of the regimen, a vaccine may be administered prior to chemotherapy. In certain embodiments, the antibody of the invention may also be administered prior to chemotherapy. Vaccine may also be administered after stem cell transplantation and in certain embodiments concomitantly with the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above described treatments may also be used with signal transduction inhibitors, such as agents that can inhibit EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) responses, such as EGFR antibodies, EGF antibodies, and molecules that are EGFR inhibitors; VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibitors, such as VEGF receptors and molecules that can inhibit VEGF; and erbB2 receptor inhibitors, such as organic molecules or antibodies that bind to the erbB2 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEGFR inhibitors are described in, for example in WO 95/19970 (published Jul. 27, 1995), WO 98/14451 (published Apr. 9, 1998), WO 98/02434 (published Jan. 22, 1998), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,498 (issued May 5, 1998), and such substances can be used in the present invention as described herein. EGFR-inhibiting agents include, but are not limited to, the monoclonal antibodies ERBITUX (ImClone Systems Incorporated of New York, N.Y.), and ABX-EGF (Abgenix Inc. of Fremont, Calif.), the compounds ZD-1839 (AstraZeneca), BIBX-1382 (Boehringer Ingelheim), MDX-447 (Medarex Inc. of Annandale, New. Jersey), and OLX-103 (Merck & Co. of Whitehouse Station, N.J.), VRCTC-310 (Ventech Research) and EGF fusion toxin (Seragen Inc. of Hopkinton, Mass.). These and other EGFR-inhibiting agents can be used in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVEGF inhibitors, for example SU-5416 and SU-6668 (Sugen Inc. of South San Francisco, Calif.), can also be employed in combination with the antibody. VEGF inhibitors are described for example in WO 99/24440 (published May 20, 1999), PCT International Application PCT/IB99/00797 (filed May 3, 1999), in WO 95/21613 (published Aug. 17, 1995), WO 99/61422 (published Dec. 2, 1999), U.S. Pat. No. 5,834,504 (issued Nov. 10, 1998), WO 98/50356 (published Nov. 12, 1998), U.S. Pat. No. 5,883,113 (issued Mar. 16, 1999), U.S. Pat. No. 5,886,020 (issued Mar. 23, 1999), U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,783 (issued Aug. 11, 1998), WO 99/10349 (published Mar. 4, 1999), WO 97/32856 (published Sep. 12, 1997), WO 97/22596 (published Jun. 26, 1997), WO 98/54093 (published Dec. 3, 1998), WO 98/02438 (published Jan. 22, 1998), WO 99/16755 (published Apr. 8, 1999), and WO 98/02437 (published Jan. 22, 1998). Other examples of some specific VEGF inhibitors useful in the present invention are IM862 (Cytran Inc. of Kirkland, Wash.); IMC-IC11 Imclone antibody and angiozyme, a synthetic ribozyme from Ribozyme (Boulder, Colo.) and Chiron (Emeryville, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nErbB2 receptor inhibitors, such as GW-282974 (Glaxo Wellcome), and the monoclonal antibodies AR-209 (Aronex Pharmaceuticals Inc. of The Woodlands, Tex.) and 2B-1 (Chiron), can furthermore be combined with the antibody, for example those indicated in WO 98/02434 (published Jan. 22, 1998), WO 99/35146 (published Jul. 15, 1999), WO 99/35132 (published Jul. 15, 1999), WO 98/02437 (published Jan. 22, 1998), WO 97/13760 (published Apr. 17, 1997), WO 95/19970 (published Jul. 27, 1995), U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,458 (issued Dec. 24, 1996), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,305 (issued Mar. 2, 1999). ErbB2 receptor inhibitors useful in the present invention are also described in EP1029853 (published Aug. 23, 2000) and in WO 00/44728, (published Aug. 3, 2000). The erbB2 receptor inhibitor compounds and substance described in the aforementioned PCT applications, U.S. patents, and U.S. provisional applications, as well as other compounds and substances that inhibit the erbB2 receptor, can be used with the antibody in accordance with the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present treatment regimens may also be combined with antibodies or other ligands that inhibit tumor growth by binding to IGF-1R (insulin-\nlike growth factor\n 1 receptor). Specific anti-IGF-1R antibodies that can be used in the present invention include those described in PCT application PCT/US01/51113, filed Dec. 20, 2001 and published as WO02/053596.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe treatment regimens described herein may be combined with anti-angiogenesis agents, such as MMP-2 (matrix-metalloproteinase 2) inhibitors, MMP-9 (matrix-metalloproteinase 9) inhibitors, and COX-II (cyclooxygenase II) inhibitors, can be used in conjunction with the antibody in the method of the invention. Examples of useful COX-II inhibitors include CELEBREX (celecoxib), valdecoxib, and rofecoxib.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIX.B.) 161P2F10B as a Target for Cellular Immune Responses\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVaccines and methods of preparing vaccines that contain an immunogenically effective amount of one or more HLA-binding peptides as described herein are further embodiments of the invention. Furthermore, vaccines in accordance with the invention encompass compositions of one or more of the claimed peptides. A peptide can be present in a vaccine individually. Alternatively, the peptide can exist as a homopolymer comprising multiple copies of the same peptide, or as a heteropolymer of various peptides. Polymers have the advantage of increased immunological reaction and, where different peptide epitopes are used to make up the polymer, the additional ability to induce antibodies and/or CTLs that react with different antigenic determinants of the pathogenic organism or tumor-related peptide targeted for an immune response. The composition can be a naturally occurring region of an antigen or can be prepared, e.g., recombinantly or by chemical synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarriers that can be used with vaccines of the invention are well known in the art, and include, e.g., thyroglobulin, albumins such as human serum albumin, tetanus toxoid, polyamino acids such as poly L-lysine, poly L-glutamic acid, influenza, hepatitis B virus core protein, and the like. The vaccines can contain a physiologically tolerable (i.e., acceptable) diluent such as water, or saline, preferably phosphate buffered saline. The vaccines also typically include an adjuvant. Adjuvants such as incomplete Freund's adjuvant, aluminum phosphate, aluminum hydroxide, or alum are examples of materials well known in the art. Additionally, as disclosed herein, CTL responses can be primed by conjugating peptides of the invention to lipids, such as tripalmitoyl-S-glycerylcysteinlyseryl-serine (P3CSS). Moreover, an adjuvant such as a synthetic cytosine-phosphorothiolated-guanine-containing (CpG) oligonucleotides has been found to increase CTL responses 10- to 100-fold (see, e.g. Davila and Celis, J. Immunol. 165:539-547 (2000)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon immunization with a peptide composition in accordance with the invention, via injection, aerosol, oral, transdermal, transmucosal, intrapleural, intrathecal, or other suitable routes, the immune system of the host responds to the vaccine by producing large amounts of CTLs and/or HTLs specific for the desired antigen. Consequently, the host becomes at least partially immune to later development of cells that express or overexpress 161P2F10B antigen, or derives at least some therapeutic benefit when the antigen was tumor-associated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, it may be desirable to combine the class I peptide components with components that induce or facilitate neutralizing antibody and or helper T cell responses directed to the target antigen. A preferred embodiment of such a composition comprises class I and class II epitopes in accordance with the invention. An alternative embodiment of such a composition comprises a class I and/or class II epitope in accordance with the invention, along with a cross reactive HTL epitope such as PADRE™ (Epimmune, San Diego, Calif.) molecule (described e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,142).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vaccine of the invention can also include antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC), as a vehicle to present peptides of the invention. Vaccine compositions can be created in vitro, following dendritic cell mobilization and harvesting, whereby loading of dendritic cells occurs in vitro. For example, dendritic cells are transfected, e.g., with a minigene in accordance with the invention, or are pulsed with peptides. The dendritic cell can then be administered to a patient to elicit immune responses in vivo. Vaccine compositions, either DNA- or peptide-based, can also be administered in vivo in combination with dendritic cell mobilization whereby loading of dendritic cells occurs in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the following principles are utilized when selecting an array of epitopes for inclusion in a polyepitopic composition for use in a vaccine, or for selecting discrete epitopes to be included in a vaccine and/or to be encoded by nucleic acids such as a minigene. It is preferred that each of the following principles be balanced in order to make the selection. The multiple epitopes to be incorporated in a given vaccine composition may be, but need not be, contiguous in sequence in the native antigen from which the epitopes are derived.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1.) Epitopes are selected which, upon administration, mimic immune responses that have been observed to be correlated with tumor clearance. For HLA Class I this includes 3-4 epitopes that come from at least one tumor associated antigen (TAA). For HLA Class II a similar rationale is employed; again 3-4 epitopes are selected from at least one TAA (see, e.g., Rosenberg et al., Science 278:1447-1450). Epitopes from one TAA may be used in combination with epitopes from one or more additional TAAs to produce a vaccine that targets tumors with varying expression patterns of frequently-expressed TAAs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2.) Epitopes are selected that have the requisite binding affinity established to be correlated with immunogenicity: for HLA Class I an IC50 of 500 nM or less, often 200 nM or less; and for Class II an IC50 of 1000 nM or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3.) Sufficient supermotif bearing-peptides, or a sufficient array of allele-specific motif-bearing peptides, are selected to give broad population coverage. For example, it is preferable to have at least 80% population coverage. A Monte Carlo analysis, a statistical evaluation known in the art, can be employed to assess the breadth, or redundancy of, population coverage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4.) When selecting epitopes from cancer-related antigens it is often useful to select analogs because the patient may have developed tolerance to the native epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5.) Of particular relevance are epitopes referred to as “nested epitopes.” Nested epitopes occur where at least two epitopes overlap in a given peptide sequence. A nested peptide sequence can comprise B cell, HLA class I and/or HLA class II epitopes. When providing nested epitopes, a general objective is to provide the greatest number of epitopes per sequence. Thus, an aspect is to avoid providing a peptide that is any longer than the amino terminus of the amino terminal epitope and the carboxyl terminus of the carboxyl terminal epitope in the peptide. When providing a multi-epitopic sequence, such as a sequence comprising nested epitopes, it is generally important to screen the sequence in order to insure that it does not have pathological or other deleterious biological properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n6.) If a polyepitopic protein is created, or when creating a minigene, an objective is to generate the smallest peptide that encompasses the epitopes of interest. This principle is similar, if not the same as that employed when selecting a peptide comprising nested epitopes. However, with an artificial polyepitopic peptide, the size minimization objective is balanced against the need to integrate any spacer sequences between epitopes in the polyepitopic protein. Spacer amino acid residues can, for example, be introduced to avoid junctional epitopes (an epitope recognized by the immune system, not present in the target antigen, and only created by the man-made juxtaposition of epitopes), or to facilitate cleavage between epitopes and thereby enhance epitope presentation. Junctional epitopes are generally to be avoided because the recipient may generate an immune response to that non-native epitope. Of particular concern is a junctional epitope that is a “dominant epitope.” A dominant epitope may lead to such a zealous response that immune responses to other epitopes are diminished or suppressed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n7.) Where the sequences of multiple variants of the same target protein are present, potential peptide epitopes can also be selected on the basis of their conservancy. For example, a criterion for conservancy may define that the entire sequence of an HLA class I binding peptide or the entire 9-mer core of a class II binding peptide be conserved in a designated percentage of the sequences evaluated for a specific protein antigen.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIX.B.1. Minigene Vaccines\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nA number of different approaches are available which allow simultaneous delivery of multiple epitopes. Nucleic acids encoding the peptides of the invention are a particularly useful embodiment of the invention. Epitopes for inclusion in a minigene are preferably selected according to the guidelines set forth in the previous section. A preferred means of administering nucleic acids encoding the peptides of the invention uses minigene constructs encoding a peptide comprising one or multiple epitopes of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of multi-epitope minigenes is described below and in, Ishioka et al., J. Immunol. 162:3915-3925, 1999; An, L. and Whitton, J. L., J. Virol. 71:2292, 1997; Thomson, S. A. et al., J. Immunol. 157:822, 1996; Whitton, J. L. et al., J. Virol. 67:348, 1993; Hanke, R. et al., Vaccine 16:426, 1998. For example, a multi-epitope DNA plasmid encoding supermotif- and/or motif-bearing epitopes derived 161P2F10B, the PADRE™ universal helper T cell epitope or multiple HTL epitopes from 161P2F10B, and an endoplasmic reticulum-translocating signal sequence can be engineered. A vaccine may also comprise epitopes that are derived from other TAAs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe immunogenicity of a multi-epitopic minigene can be confirmed in transgenic mice to evaluate the magnitude of CTL induction responses against the epitopes tested. Further, the immunogenicity of DNA-encoded epitopes in vivo can be correlated with the in vitro responses of specific CTL lines against target cells transfected with the DNA plasmid. Thus, these experiments can show that the minigene serves to both: 1.) generate a CTL response and 2.) that the induced CTLs recognized cells expressing the encoded epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, to create a DNA sequence encoding the selected epitopes (minigene) for expression in human cells, the amino acid sequences of the epitopes may be reverse translated. A human codon usage table can be used to guide the codon choice for each amino acid. These epitope-encoding DNA sequences may be directly adjoined, so that when translated, a continuous polypeptide sequence is created. To optimize expression and/or immunogenicity, additional elements can be incorporated into the minigene design. Examples of amino acid sequences that can be reverse translated and included in the minigene sequence include: HLA class I epitopes, HLA class II epitopes, antibody epitopes, a ubiquitination signal sequence, and/or an endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal. In addition, HLA presentation of CTL and HTL epitopes may be improved by including synthetic (e.g. poly-alanine) or naturally-occurring flanking sequences adjacent to the CTL or HTL epitopes; these larger peptides comprising the epitope(s) are within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe minigene sequence may be converted to DNA by assembling oligonucleotides that encode the plus and minus strands of the minigene. Overlapping oligonucleotides (30-100 bases long) may be synthesized, phosphorylated, purified and annealed under appropriate conditions using well known techniques. The ends of the oligonucleotides can be joined, for example, using T4 DNA ligase. This synthetic minigene, encoding the epitope polypeptide, can then be cloned into a desired expression vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard regulatory sequences well known to those of skill in the art are preferably included in the vector to ensure expression in the target cells. Several vector elements are desirable: a promoter with a down-stream cloning site for minigene insertion; a polyadenylation signal for efficient transcription termination; an \nE. coli \norigin of replication; and an \nE. coli \nselectable marker (e.g., ampicillin or kanamycin resistance). Numerous promoters can be used for this purpose, e.g., the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) promoter. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,580,859 and 5,589,466 for other suitable promoter sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional vector modifications may be desired to optimize minigene expression and immunogenicity. In some cases, introns are required for efficient gene expression, and one or more synthetic or naturally-occurring introns could be incorporated into the transcribed region of the minigene. The inclusion of mRNA stabilization sequences and sequences for replication in mammalian cells may also be considered for increasing minigene expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce an expression vector is selected, the minigene is cloned into the polylinker region downstream of the promoter. This plasmid is transformed into an appropriate \nE. coli \nstrain, and DNA is prepared using standard techniques. The orientation and DNA sequence of the minigene, as well as all other elements included in the vector, are confirmed using restriction mappling an DNA sequence analysis. Bacterial cells harboring the correct plasmid can be stored as a master cell bank and a working cell bank.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, immunostimulatory sequences (ISSs or CpGs) appear to play a role in the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. These sequences may be included in the vector, outside the minigene coding sequence, if desired to enhance immunogenicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a bi-cistronic expression vector which allows production of both the minigene-encoded epitopes and a second protein (included to enhance or decrease immunogenicity) can be used. Examples of proteins or polypeptides that could beneficially enhance the immune response if co-expressed include cytokines (e.g., IL-2, IL-12, GM-CSF), cytokine-inducing molecules (e.g., LeIF), costimulatory molecules, or for HTL responses, pan-DR binding proteins (PADRE™, Epimmune, San Diego, Calif.). Helper (HTL) epitopes can be joined to intracellular targeting signals and expressed separately from expressed CTL epitopes; this allows direction of the HTL epitopes to a cell compartment different than that of the CTL epitopes. If required, this could facilitate more efficient entry of HTL epitopes into the HLA class II pathway, thereby improving HTL induction. In contrast to HTL or CTL induction, specifically decreasing the immune response by co-expression of immunosuppressive molecules (e.g. TGF-β) may be beneficial in certain diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic quantities of plasmid DNA can be produced for example, by fermentation in \nE. coli\n, followed by purification. Aliquots from the working cell bank are used to inoculate growth medium, and grown to saturation in shaker flasks or a bioreactor according to well-known techniques. Plasmid DNA can be purified using standard bioseparation technologies such as solid phase anion-exchange resins supplied by QIAGEN, Inc. (Valencia, Calif.). If required, supercoiled DNA can be isolated from the open circular and linear forms using gel electrophoresis or other methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurified plasmid DNA can be prepared for injection using a variety of formulations. The simplest of these is reconstitution of lyophilized DNA in sterile phosphate-buffer saline (PBS). This approach, known as “naked DNA,” is currently being used for intramuscular (IM) administration in clinical trials. To maximize the immunotherapeutic effects of minigene DNA vaccines, an alternative method for formulating purified plasmid DNA may be desirable. A variety of methods have been described, and new techniques may become available. Cationic lipids, glycolipids, and fusogenic liposomes can also be used in the formulation (see, e.g., as described by WO 93/24640; Mannino & Gould-Fogerite, BioTechniques 6(7): 682 (1988); U.S. Pat. No. 5,279,833; WO 91/06309; and Felgner, et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 84:7413 (1987). In addition, peptides and compounds referred to collectively as protective, interactive, non-condensing compounds (PINC) could also be complexed to purified plasmid DNA to influence variables such as stability, intramuscular dispersion, or trafficking to specific organs or cell types.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTarget cell sensitization can be used as a functional assay for expression and HLA class I presentation of minigene-encoded CTL epitopes. For example, the plasmid DNA is introduced into a mammalian cell line that is suitable as a target for standard CTL chromium release assays. The transfection method used will be dependent on the final formulation. Electroporation can be used for “naked” DNA, whereas cationic lipids allow direct in vitro transfection. A plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) can be co-transfected to allow enrichment of transfected cells using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). These cells are then chromium-51 (51Cr) labeled and used as target cells for epitope-specific CTL lines; cytolysis, detected by 51Cr release, indicates both production of, and HLA presentation of, minigene-encoded CTL epitopes. Expression of HTL epitopes may be evaluated in an analogous manner using assays to assess HTL activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo immunogenicity is a second approach for functional testing of minigene DNA formulations. Transgenic mice expressing appropriate human HLA proteins are immunized with the DNA product. The dose and route of administration are formulation dependent (e.g., IM for DNA in PBS, intraperitoneal (i.p.) for lipid-complexed DNA). Twenty-one days after immunization, splenocytes are harvested and restimulated for one week in the presence of peptides encoding each epitope being tested. Thereafter, for CTL effector cells, assays are conducted for cytolysis of peptide-loaded, 51Cr-labeled target cells using standard techniques. Lysis of target cells that were sensitized by HLA loaded with peptide epitopes, corresponding to minigene-encoded epitopes, demonstrates DNA vaccine function for in vivo induction of CTLs. Immunogenicity of HTL epitopes is confirmed in transgenic mice in an analogous manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the nucleic acids can be administered using ballistic delivery as described, for instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,204,253. Using this technique, particles comprised solely of DNA are administered. In a further alternative embodiment, DNA can be adhered to particles, such as gold particles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMinigenes can also be delivered using other bacterial or viral delivery systems well known in the art, e.g., an expression construct encoding epitopes of the invention can be incorporated into a viral vector such as vaccinia.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIX.B.2. Combinations of CTL Peptides with Helper Peptides\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nVaccine compositions comprising CTL peptides of the invention can be modified, e.g., analoged, to provide desired attributes, such as improved serum half life, broadened population coverage or enhanced immunogenicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance, the ability of a peptide to induce CTL activity can be enhanced by linking the peptide to a sequence which contains at least one epitope that is capable of inducing a T helper cell response. Although a CTL peptide can be directly linked to a T helper peptide, often CTL epitope/HTL epitope conjugates are linked by a spacer molecule. The spacer is typically comprised of relatively small, neutral molecules, such as amino acids or amino acid mimetics, which are substantially uncharged under physiological conditions. The spacers are typically selected from, e.g., Ala, Gly, or other neutral spacers of nonpolar amino acids or neutral polar amino acids. It will be understood that the optionally present spacer need not be comprised of the same residues and thus may be a hetero- or homo-oligomer. When present, the spacer will usually be at least one or two residues, more usually three to six residues and sometimes 10 or more residues. The CTL peptide epitope can be linked to the T helper peptide epitope either directly or via a spacer either at the amino or carboxy terminus of the CTL peptide. The amino terminus of either the immunogenic peptide or the T helper peptide may be acylated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHTL peptide epitopes can also be modified to alter their biological properties. For example, they can be modified to include D-amino acids to increase their resistance to proteases and thus extend their serum half life, or they can be conjugated to other molecules such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and the like to increase their biological activity. For example, a T helper peptide can be conjugated to one or more palmitic acid chains at either the amino or carboxyl termini.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIX.B.3. Combinations of CTL Peptides with T Cell Priming Agents\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments it may be desirable to include in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention at least one component which primes B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. Lipids have been identified as agents capable of priming CTL in vivo. For example, palmitic acid residues can be attached to the ε- and α-amino groups of a lysine residue and then linked, e.g., via one or more linking residues such as Gly, Gly-Gly-, Ser, Ser-Ser, or the like, to an immunogenic peptide. The lipidated peptide can then be administered either directly in a micelle or particle, incorporated into a liposome, or emulsified in an adjuvant, e.g., incomplete Freund's adjuvant. In a preferred embodiment, a particularly effective immunogenic composition comprises palmitic acid attached to ε- and α-amino groups of Lys, which is attached via linkage, e.g., Ser-Ser, to the amino terminus of the immunogenic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs another example of lipid priming of CTL responses, \nE. coli \nlipoproteins, such as tripalmitoyl-S-glycerylcysteinlyseryl-serine (P3CSS) can be used to prime virus specific CTL when covalently attached to an appropriate peptide (see, e.g., Deres, et al., Nature 342:561, 1989). Peptides of the invention can be coupled to P3CSS, for example, and the lipopeptide administered to an individual to prime specifically an immune response to the target antigen. Moreover, because the induction of neutralizing antibodies can also be primed with P3CSS-conjugated epitopes, two such compositions can be combined to more effectively elicit both humoral and cell-mediated responses.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIX.B.4. Vaccine Compositions Comprising DC Pulsed with CTL and/or HTL Peptides\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAn embodiment of a vaccine composition in accordance with the invention comprises ex vivo administration of a cocktail of epitope-bearing peptides to PBMC, or isolated DC therefrom, from the patient's blood. A pharmaceutical to facilitate harvesting of DC can be used, such as Progenipoietin™ (Pharmacia-Monsanto, St. Louis, Mo.) or GM-CSF/IL-4. After pulsing the DC with peptides and prior to reinfusion into patients, the DC are washed to remove unbound peptides. In this embodiment, a vaccine comprises peptide-pulsed DCs which present the pulsed peptide epitopes complexed with HLA molecules on their surfaces.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DC can be pulsed ex vivo with a cocktail of peptides, some of which stimulate CTL responses to 161P2F10B. Optionally, a helper T cell (HTL) peptide, such as a natural or artificial loosely restricted HLA Class II peptide, can be included to facilitate the CTL response. Thus, a vaccine in accordance with the invention is used to treat a cancer which expresses or overexpresses 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIX.C.) Adoptive Immunotherapy\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigenic 161P2F10B-related peptides are used to elicit a CTL and/or HTL response ex vivo, as well. The resulting CTL or HTL cells, can be used to treat tumors in patients that do not respond to other conventional forms of therapy, or will not respond to a therapeutic vaccine peptide or nucleic acid in accordance with the invention. Ex vivo CTL or HTL responses to a particular antigen are induced by incubating in tissue culture the patient's, or genetically compatible, CTL or HTL precursor cells together with a source of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells, and the appropriate immunogenic peptide. After an appropriate incubation time (typically about 7-28 days), in which the precursor cells are activated and expanded into effector cells, the cells are infused back into the patient, where they will destroy (CTL) or facilitate destruction (HTL) of their specific target cell (e.g., a tumor cell). Transfected dendritic cells may also be used as antigen presenting cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIX.D.) Administration of Vaccines for Therapeutic or Prophylactic Purposes\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical and vaccine compositions of the invention are typically used to treat and/or prevent a cancer that expresses or overexpresses 161P2F10B. In therapeutic applications, peptide and/or nucleic acid compositions are administered to a patient in an amount sufficient to elicit an effective B cell, CTL and/or HTL response to the antigen and to cure or at least partially arrest or slow symptoms and/or complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as “therapeutically effective dose.” Amounts effective for this use will depend on, e.g., the particular composition administered, the manner of administration, the stage and severity of the disease being treated, the weight and general state of health of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor pharmaceutical compositions, the immunogenic peptides of the invention, or DNA encoding them, are generally administered to an individual already bearing a tumor that expresses 161P2F10B. The peptides or DNA encoding them can be administered individually or as fusions of one or more peptide sequences. Patients can be treated with the immunogenic peptides separately or in conjunction with other treatments, such as surgery, as appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor therapeutic use, administration should generally begin at the first diagnosis of 161P2F10B-associated cancer. This is followed by boosting doses until at least symptoms are substantially abated and for a period thereafter. The embodiment of the vaccine composition (i.e., including, but not limited to embodiments such as peptide cocktails, polyepitopic polypeptides, minigenes, or TAA-specific CTLs or pulsed dendritic cells) delivered to the patient may vary according to the stage of the disease or the patient's health status. For example, in a patient with a tumor that expresses 161P2F10B, a vaccine comprising 161P2F10B-specific CTL may be more efficacious in killing tumor cells in patient with advanced disease than alternative embodiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is generally important to provide an amount of the peptide epitope delivered by a mode of administration sufficient to stimulate effectively a cytotoxic T cell response; compositions which stimulate helper T cell responses can also be given in accordance with this embodiment of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage for an initial therapeutic immunization generally occurs in a unit dosage range where the lower value is about 1, 5, 50, 500, or 1,000 μg and the higher value is about 10,000; 20,000; 30,000; or 50,000 μg. Dosage values for a human typically range from about 500 μg to about 50,000 μg per 70 kilogram patient. Boosting dosages of between about 1.0 μg to about 50,000 μg of peptide pursuant to a boosting regimen over weeks to months may be administered depending upon the patient's response and condition as determined by measuring the specific activity of CTL and HTL obtained from the patient's blood. Administration should continue until at least clinical symptoms or laboratory tests indicate that the neoplasia, has been eliminated or reduced and for a period thereafter. The dosages, routes of administration, and dose schedules are adjusted in accordance with methodologies known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the peptides and compositions of the present invention are employed in serious disease states, that is, life-threatening or potentially life threatening situations. In such cases, as a result of the minimal amounts of extraneous substances and the relative nontoxic nature of the peptides in preferred compositions of the invention, it is possible and may be felt desirable by the treating physician to administer substantial excesses of these peptide compositions relative to these stated dosage amounts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe vaccine compositions of the invention can also be used purely as prophylactic agents. Generally the dosage for an initial prophylactic immunization generally occurs in a unit dosage range where the lower value is about 1, 5, 50, 500, or 1000 μg and the higher value is about 10,000; 20,000; 30,000; or 50,000 μg. Dosage values for a human typically range from about 500 μg to about 50,000 μg per 70 kilogram patient. This is followed by boosting dosages of between about 1.0 μg to about 50,000 μg of peptide administered at defined intervals from about four weeks to six months after the initial administration of vaccine. The immunogenicity of the vaccine can be assessed by measuring the specific activity of CTL and HTL obtained from a sample of the patient's blood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions for therapeutic treatment are intended for parenteral, topical, oral, nasal, intrathecal, or local (e.g. as a cream or topical ointment) administration. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered parentally, e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, intradermally, or intramuscularly. Thus, the invention provides compositions for parenteral administration which comprise a solution of the immunogenic peptides dissolved or suspended in an acceptable carrier, preferably an aqueous carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of aqueous carriers may be used, e.g., water, buffered water, 0.8% saline, 0.3% glycine, hyaluronic acid and the like. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional, well-known sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile solution prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH-adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, wetting agents, preservatives, and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of peptides of the invention in the pharmaceutical formulations can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.1%, usually at or at least about 2% to as much as 20% to 50% or more by weight, and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA human unit dose form of a composition is typically included in a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a human unit dose of an acceptable carrier, in one embodiment an aqueous carrier, and is administered in a volume/quantity that is known by those of skill in the art to be used for administration of such compositions to humans (see, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th Edition, A. Gennaro, Editor, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985). For example a peptide dose for initial immunization can be from about 1 to about 50,000 μg, generally 100-5,000 μg, for a 70 kg patient. For example, for nucleic acids an initial immunization may be performed using an expression vector in the form of naked nucleic acid administered IM (or SC or ID) in the amounts of 0.5-5 mg at multiple sites. The nucleic acid (0.1 to 1000 μg) can also be administered using a gene gun. Following an incubation period of 3-4 weeks, a booster dose is then administered. The booster can be recombinant fowlpox virus administered at a dose of 5-10\n7 \nto 5×10\n9 \npfu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor antibodies, a treatment generally involves repeated administration of the anti-161P2F10B antibody preparation, via an acceptable route of administration such as intravenous injection (IV), typically at a dose in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg body weight. In general, doses in the range of 10-500 mg MAb per week are effective and well tolerated. Moreover, an initial loading dose of approximately 4 mg/kg patient body weight IV, followed by weekly doses of about 2 mg/kg IV of the anti-161P2F10B MAb preparation represents an acceptable dosing regimen. As appreciated by those of skill in the art, various factors can influence the ideal dose in a particular case. Such factors include, for example, half life of a composition, the binding affinity of an Ab, the immunogenicity of a substance, the degree of 161P2F10B expression in the patient, the extent of circulating shed 161P2F10B antigen, the desired steady-state concentration level, frequency of treatment, and the influence of chemotherapeutic or other agents used in combination with the treatment method of the invention, as well as the health status of a particular patient. Non-limiting preferred human unit doses are, for example, 500 μg-1 mg, 1 mg-50 mg, 50 mg-100 mg, 100 mg-200 mg, 200 mg-300 mg, 400 mg-500 mg, 500 mg-600 mg, 600 mg-700 mg, 700 mg-800 mg, 800 mg-900 mg, 900 mg-1 g, or 1 mg-700 mg. In certain embodiments, the dose is in a range of 2-5 mg/kg body weight, e.g., with follow on weekly doses of 1-3 mg/kg; 0.5 mg, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 mg/kg body weight followed, e.g., in two, three or four weeks by weekly doses; 0.5-10 mg/kg body weight, e.g., followed in two, three or four weeks by weekly doses; 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400 mg m\n2 \nof body area weekly; 1-600 mg m\n2 \nof body area weekly; 225-400 mg m\n2 \nof body area weekly; these does can be followed by weekly doses for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 19, 11, 12 or more weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, human unit dose forms of polynucleotides comprise a suitable dosage range or effective amount that provides any therapeutic effect. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art a therapeutic effect depends on a number of factors, including the sequence of the polynucleotide, molecular weight of the polynucleotide and route of administration. Dosages are generally selected by the physician or other health care professional in accordance with a variety of parameters known in the art, such as severity of symptoms, history of the patient and the like. Generally, for a polynucleotide of about 20 bases, a dosage range may be selected from, for example, an independently selected lower limit such as about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 mg/kg up to an independently selected upper limit, greater than the lower limit, of about 60, 80, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000 or 10,000 mg/kg. For example, a dose may be about any of the following: 0.1 to 100 mg/kg, 0.1 to 50 mg/kg, 0.1 to 25 mg/kg, 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, 1 to 500 mg/kg, 100 to 400 mg/kg, 200 to 300 mg/kg, 1 to 100 mg/kg, 100 to 200 mg/kg, 300 to 400 mg/kg, 400 to 500 mg/kg, 500 to 1000 mg/kg, 500 to 5000 mg/kg, or 500 to 10,000 mg/kg. Generally, parenteral routes of administration may require higher doses of polynucleotide compared to more direct application to the nucleotide to diseased tissue, as do polynucleotides of increasing length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, human unit dose forms of T-cells comprise a suitable dosage range or effective amount that provides any therapeutic effect. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, a therapeutic effect depends on a number of factors. Dosages are generally selected by the physician or other health care professional in accordance with a variety of parameters known in the art, such as severity of symptoms, history of the patient and the like. A dose may be about 10\n4 \ncells to about 10\n6 \ncells, about 10\n6 \ncells to about 10\n8 \ncells, about 10\n8 \nto about 10\n11 \ncells, or about 10\n8 \nto about 5×10\n10 \ncells. A dose may also about 10\n6 \ncells/m\n2 \nto about 10\n10 \ncells/m\n2\n, or about 10\n6 \ncells/m\n2 \nto about 108 cells/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProteins(s) of the invention, and/or nucleic acids encoding the protein(s), can also be administered via liposomes, which may also serve to: 1) target the proteins(s) to a particular tissue, such as lymphoid tissue; 2) to target selectively to diseases cells; or, 3) to increase the half-life of the peptide composition. Liposomes include emulsions, foams, micelles, insoluble monolayers, liquid crystals, phospholipid dispersions, lamellar layers and the like. In these preparations, the peptide to be delivered is incorporated as part of a liposome, alone or in conjunction with a molecule which binds to a receptor prevalent among lymphoid cells (such as monoclonal antibodies which bind to the CD45 antigen) or with other therapeutic or immunogenic compositions. Thus, liposomes either filled or decorated with a desired peptide of the invention can be directed to the site of lymphoid cells, where the liposomes then deliver the peptide compositions. Liposomes for use in accordance with the invention are formed from standard vesicle-forming lipids, which generally include neutral and negatively charged phospholipids and a sterol, such as cholesterol. The selection of lipids is generally guided by consideration of, e.g., liposome size, acid lability and stability of the liposomes in the blood stream. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka, et al., Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 9:467 (1980), and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728, 4,837,028, and 5,019,369.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor targeting cells of the immune system, a ligand to be incorporated into the liposome can include, e.g., antibodies or fragments thereof specific for cell surface determinants of the desired immune system cells. A liposome suspension containing a peptide may be administered intravenously, locally, topically, etc. in a dose which varies according to, inter alia, the manner of administration, the peptide being delivered, and the stage of the disease being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor solid compositions, conventional nontoxic solid carriers may be used which include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic composition is formed by incorporating any of the normally employed excipients, such as those carriers previously listed, and generally 10-95% of active ingredient, that is, one or more peptides of the invention, and more preferably at a concentration of 25%-75%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor aerosol administration, immunogenic peptides are preferably supplied in finely divided form along with a surfactant and propellant. Typical percentages of peptides are about 0.01%-20% by weight, preferably about 1%-10%. The surfactant must, of course, be nontoxic, and preferably soluble in the propellant. Representative of such agents are the esters or partial esters of fatty acids containing from about 6 to 22 carbon atoms, such as caproic, octanoic, lauric, palmitic, stearic, linoleic, linolenic, olesteric and oleic acids with an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol or its cyclic anhydride. Mixed esters, such as mixed or natural glycerides may be employed. The surfactant may constitute about 0.1%-20% by weight of the composition, preferably about 0.25-5%. The balance of the composition is ordinarily propellant. A carrier can also be included, as desired, as with, e.g., lecithin for intranasal delivery.\n\n\n \nX.) Diagnostic and Prognostic Embodiments of 161P2F10B\n\n\n \n \n \nAs disclosed herein, 161P2F10B polynucleotides, polypeptides, reactive cytotoxic T cells (CTL), reactive helper T cells (HTL) and anti-polypeptide antibodies are used in well known diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic assays that examine conditions associated with dysregulated cell growth such as cancer, in particular the cancers listed in Table I (see, e.g., both its specific pattern of tissue expression as well as its overexpression in certain cancers as described for example in the Example entitled “Expression analysis of 161P2F10B in normal tissues, and patient specimens”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B can be analogized to a prostate associated antigen PSA, the archetypal marker that has been used by medical practitioners for years to identify and monitor the presence of prostate cancer (see, e.g., Merrill et al., J. Urol. 163(2): 503-5120 (2000); Polascik et al., J. Urol. Aug; 162(2):293-306 (1999) and Fortier et al., J. Nat. Cancer Inst. 91(19): 1635-1640 (1999)). A variety of other diagnostic markers are also used in similar contexts including p53 and K-ras (see, e.g., Tulchinsky et al., Int J Mol Med 1999 July 4(1):99-102 and Minimoto et al., Cancer Detect Prev 2000; 24(1):1-12). Therefore, this disclosure of 161P2F10B polynucleotides and polypeptides (as well as 161P2F10B polynucleotide probes and anti-161P2F10B antibodies used to identify the presence of these molecules) and their properties allows skilled artisans to utilize these molecules in methods that are analogous to those used, for example, in a variety of diagnostic assays directed to examining conditions associated with cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical embodiments of diagnostic methods which utilize the 161P2F10B polynucleotides, polypeptides, reactive T cells and antibodies are analogous to those methods from well-established diagnostic assays, which employ, (e.g., PSA polynucleotides, polypeptides, reactive T cells and antibodies.) For example, just as PSA polynucleotides are used as probes (for example in Northern analysis, see, e.g., Sharief et al., Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 33(3):567-74 (1994)) and primers (for example in PCR analysis, see, e.g., Okegawa et al., J. Urol. 163(4): 1189-1190 (2000)) to observe the presence and/or the level of PSA mRNAs in methods of monitoring PSA overexpression or the metastasis of prostate cancers, the 161P2F10B polynucleotides described herein can be utilized in the same way to detect 161P2F10B overexpression or the metastasis of kidney and other cancers expressing this gene. Alternatively, just as PSA polypeptides are used to generate antibodies specific for PSA which can then be used to observe the presence and/or the level of PSA proteins in methods to monitor PSA protein overexpression (see, e.g., Stephan et al., Urology 55(4):560-3 (2000)) or the metastasis of prostate cells (see, e.g., Alanen et al., Pathol. Res. Pract. 192(3):233-7 (1996)), the 161P2F10B polypeptides described herein can be utilized to generate antibodies for use in detecting 161P2F10B overexpression or the metastasis of kidney cells and cells of other cancers expressing this gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, because metastases involves the movement of cancer cells from an organ of origin (such as the lung or prostate gland etc.) to a different area of the body (such as a lymph node), assays which examine a biological sample for the presence of cells expressing 161P2F10B polynucleotides and/or polypeptides can be used to provide evidence of metastasis. For example, when a biological sample from tissue that does not normally contain 161P2F10B-expressing cells is found to contain 161P2F10B-expressing cells this finding is indicative of metastasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively 161P2F10B polynucleotides and/or polypeptides can be used to provide evidence of cancer, for example, when cells in a biological sample that do not normally express 161P2F10B or express 161P2F10B at a different level are found to express 161P2F10B or have an increased expression of 161P2F10B (see, e.g., the 161P2F10B expression in the cancers listed in Table I and in patient samples etc. shown in the accompanying Figures). In such assays, artisans may further wish to generate supplementary evidence of metastasis by testing the biological sample for the presence of a second tissue restricted marker (in addition to 161P2F10B).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of immunohistochemistry to identify the presence of a 161P2F10B polypeptide within a tissue section can indicate an altered state of certain cells within that tissue. It is well understood in the art that the ability of an antibody to localize to a polypeptide that is expressed in cancer cells is a way of diagnosing presence of disease, disease stage, progression and/or tumor aggressiveness. Such an antibody can also detect an altered distribution of the polypeptide within the cancer cells, as compared to corresponding non-malignant tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 161P2F10B polypeptide and immunogenic compositions are also useful in view of the phenomena of altered subcellular protein localization in disease states. Alteration of cells from normal to diseased state causes changes in cellular morphology and is often associated with changes in subcellular protein localization/distribution. For example, cell membrane proteins that are expressed in a polarized manner in normal cells can be altered in disease, resulting in distribution of the protein in a non-polar manner over the whole cell surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phenomenon of altered subcellular protein localization in a disease state has been demonstrated with MUC1 and Her2 protein expression by use of immunohistochemical means. Normal epithelial cells have a typical apical distribution of MUC1, in addition to some supranuclear localization of the glycoprotein, whereas malignant lesions often demonstrate an apolar staining pattern (Diaz et al, The Breast Journal, 7; 40-45 (2001); Zhang et al, Clinical Cancer Research, 4; 2669-2676 (1998): Cao, et al, The Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry, 45: 1547-1557 (1997)). In addition, normal breast epithelium is either negative for Her2 protein or exhibits only a basolateral distribution whereas malignant cells can express the protein over the whole cell surface (De Potter, et al, International Journal of Cancer, 44; 969-974 (1989): McCormick, et al, 117; 935-943 (2002)). Alternatively, distribution of the protein may be altered from a surface only localization to include diffuse cytoplasmic expression in the diseased state. Such an example can be seen with MUC1 (Diaz, et al, The Breast Journal, 7: 40-45 (2001)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlteration in the localization/distribution of a protein in the cell, as detected by immunohistochemical methods, can also provide valuable information concerning the favorability of certain treatment modalities. This last point is illustrated by a situation where a protein may be intracellular in normal tissue, but cell surface in malignant cells; the cell surface location makes the cells favorably amenable to antibody-based diagnostic and treatment regimens. When such an alteration of protein localization occurs for 161P2F10B, the 161P2F10B protein and immune responses related thereto are very useful. Use of the 161P2F10B compositions allows those skilled in the art to make important diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunohistochemical reagents specific to 161P2F10B are also useful to detect metastases of tumors expressing 161P2F10B when the polypeptide appears in tissues where 161P2F10B is not normally produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, 161P2F10B polypeptides and antibodies resulting from immune responses thereto are useful in a variety of important contexts such as diagnostic, prognostic, preventative and/or therapeutic purposes known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, 161P2F10B-related proteins or polynucleotides of the invention can be used to treat a pathologic condition characterized by the over-expression of 161P2F10B. For example, the amino acid or nucleic acid sequence of \nFIG. 1\n, or fragments of either, can be used to generate an immune response to a 161P2F10B antigen. Antibodies or other molecules that react with 161P2F10B can be used to modulate the function of this molecule, and thereby provide a therapeutic benefit.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nX.A.) Inhibition of 161P2F10B Protein Function\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention includes various methods and compositions for inhibiting the binding of 161P2F10B to its binding partner or its association with other protein(s) as well as methods for inhibiting 161P2F10B function.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nX.B.) Inhibition of 161P2F10B with Intracellular Antibodies\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn one approach, a recombinant vector that encodes single chain antibodies that specifically bind to 161P2F10B are introduced into 161P2F10B expressing cells via gene transfer technologies. Accordingly, the encoded single chain anti-161P2F10B antibody is expressed intracellularly, binds to 161P2F10B protein, and thereby inhibits its function. Methods for engineering such intracellular single chain antibodies are well known. Such intracellular antibodies, also known as “intrabodies”, are specifically targeted to a particular compartment within the cell, providing control over where the inhibitory activity of the treatment is focused. This technology has been successfully applied in the art (for review, see Richardson and Marasco, 1995, TIBTECH vol. 13). Intrabodies have been shown to virtually eliminate the expression of otherwise abundant cell surface receptors (see, e.g., Richardson et al., 1995, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92: 3137-3141; Beerli et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 289: 23931-23936; Deshane et al., 1994, Gene Ther. 1: 332-337).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle chain antibodies comprise the variable domains of the heavy and light chain joined by a flexible linker polypeptide, and are expressed as a single polypeptide. Optionally, single chain antibodies are expressed as a single chain variable region fragment joined to the light chain constant region. Well-known intracellular trafficking signals are engineered into recombinant polynucleotide vectors encoding such single chain antibodies in order to target precisely the intrabody to the desired intracellular compartment. For example, intrabodies targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are engineered to incorporate a leader peptide and, optionally, a C-terminal ER retention signal, such as the KDEL amino acid motif. Intrabodies intended to exert activity in the nucleus are engineered to include a nuclear localization signal. Lipid moieties are joined to intrabodies in order to tether the intrabody to the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane. Intrabodies can also be targeted to exert function in the cytosol. For example, cytosolic intrabodies are used to sequester factors within the cytosol, thereby preventing them from being transported to their natural cellular destination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, intrabodies are used to capture 161P2F10B in the nucleus, thereby preventing its activity within the nucleus. Nuclear targeting signals are engineered into such 161P2F10B intrabodies in order to achieve the desired targeting. Such 161P2F10B intrabodies are designed to bind specifically to a particular 161P2F10B domain. In another embodiment, cytosolic intrabodies that specifically bind to a 161P2F10B protein are used to prevent 161P2F10B from gaining access to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from exerting any biological activity within the nucleus (e.g., preventing 161P2F10B from forming transcription complexes with other factors).\n\n \n \n \n \n \nX.C.) Inhibition of 161P2F10B with Recombinant Proteins\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn another approach, recombinant molecules bind to 161P2F10B and thereby inhibit 161P2F10B function. For example, these recombinant molecules prevent or inhibit 161P2F10B from accessing/binding to its binding partner(s) or associating with other protein(s). Such recombinant molecules can, for example, contain the reactive part(s) of a 161P2F10B specific antibody molecule. In a particular embodiment, the 161P2F10B binding domain of a 161P2F10B binding partner is engineered into a dimeric fusion protein, whereby the fusion protein comprises two 161P2F10B ligand binding domains linked to the Fc portion of a human IgG, such as human IgG\n1\n. Such IgG portion can contain, for example, the CH\n2 \nand CH\n3 \ndomains and the hinge region, but not the CH\n1 \ndomain. Such dimeric fusion proteins are administered in soluble form to patients suffering from a cancer associated with the expression of 161P2F10B, whereby the dimeric fusion protein specifically binds to 161P2F10B and blocks 161P2F10B interaction with a binding partner. Such dimeric fusion proteins are further combined into multimeric proteins using known antibody linking technologies.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nX.D.) Inhibition of 161P2F10B Transcription or Translation\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also comprises various methods and compositions for inhibiting the transcription of the 161P2F10B gene. Similarly, the invention also provides methods and compositions for inhibiting the translation of 161P2F10B mRNA into protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one approach, a method of inhibiting the transcription of the 161P2F10B gene comprises contacting the 161P2F10B gene with a 161P2F10B antisense polynucleotide. In another approach, a method of inhibiting 161P2F10B mRNA translation comprises contacting a 161P2F10B mRNA with an antisense polynucleotide. In another approach, a 161P2F10B specific ribozyme is used to cleave a 161P2F10B message, thereby inhibiting translation. Such antisense and ribozyme based methods can also be directed to the regulatory regions of the 161P2F10B gene, such as 161P2F10B promoter and/or enhancer elements. Similarly, proteins capable of inhibiting a 161P2F10B gene transcription factor are used to inhibit 161P2F10B mRNA transcription. The various polynucleotides and compositions useful in the aforementioned methods have been described above. The use of antisense and ribozyme molecules to inhibit transcription and translation is well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther factors that inhibit the transcription of 161P2F10B by interfering with 161P2F10B transcriptional activation are also useful to treat cancers expressing 161P2F10B. Similarly, factors that interfere with 161P2F10B processing are useful to treat cancers that express 161P2F10B. Cancer treatment methods utilizing such factors are also within the scope of the invention.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nX.E.) General Considerations for Therapeutic Strategies\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nGene transfer and gene therapy technologies can be used to deliver therapeutic polynucleotide molecules to tumor cells synthesizing 161P2F10B (i.e., antisense, ribozyme, polynucleotides encoding intrabodies and other 161P2F10B inhibitory molecules). A number of gene therapy approaches are known in the art. Recombinant vectors encoding 161P2F10B antisense polynucleotides, ribozymes, factors capable of interfering with 161P2F10B transcription, and so forth, can be delivered to target tumor cells using such gene therapy approaches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above therapeutic approaches can be combined with any one of a wide variety of surgical, chemotherapy or radiation therapy regimens. The therapeutic approaches of the invention can enable the use of reduced dosages of chemotherapy (or other therapies) and/or less frequent administration, an advantage for all patients and particularly for those that do not tolerate the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-tumor activity of a particular composition (e.g., antisense, ribozyme, intrabody), or a combination of such compositions, can be evaluated using various in vitro and in vivo assay systems. In vitro assays that evaluate therapeutic activity include cell growth assays, soft agar assays and other assays indicative of tumor promoting activity, binding assays capable of determining the extent to which a therapeutic composition will inhibit the binding of 161P2F10B to a binding partner, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo, the effect of a 161P2F10B therapeutic composition can be evaluated in a suitable animal model. For example, xenogenic kidney cancer models can be used, wherein human prostate cancer explants or passaged xenograft tissues are introduced into immune compromised animals, such as nude or SCID mice (Klein et al., 1997, Nature Medicine 3: 402-408). For example, PCT Patent Application WO98/16628 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,107,540 describe various xenograft models of human prostate cancer capable of recapitulating the development of primary tumors, micrometastasis, and the formation of osteoblastic metastases characteristic of late stage disease. Efficacy can be predicted using assays that measure inhibition of tumor formation, tumor regression or metastasis, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo assays that evaluate the promotion of apoptosis are useful in evaluating therapeutic compositions. In one embodiment, xenografts from tumor bearing mice treated with the therapeutic composition can be examined for the presence of apoptotic foci and compared to untreated control xenograft-bearing mice. The extent to which apoptotic foci are found in the tumors of the treated mice provides an indication of the therapeutic efficacy of the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic compositions used in the practice of the foregoing methods can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions comprising a carrier suitable for the desired delivery method. Suitable carriers include any material that when combined with the therapeutic composition retains the anti-tumor function of the therapeutic composition and is generally non-reactive with the patient's immune system. Examples include, but are not limited to, any of a number of standard pharmaceutical carriers such as sterile phosphate buffered saline solutions, bacteriostatic water, and the like (see, generally, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th Edition, A. Osal., Ed., 1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic formulations can be solubilized and administered via any route capable of delivering the therapeutic composition to the tumor site. Potentially effective routes of administration include, but are not limited to, intravenous, parenteral, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intratumor, intradermal, intraorgan, orthotopic, and the like. A preferred formulation for intravenous injection comprises the therapeutic composition in a solution of preserved bacteriostatic water, sterile unpreserved water, and/or diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags containing 0.9% sterile Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP. Therapeutic protein preparations can be lyophilized and stored as sterile powders, preferably under vacuum, and then reconstituted in bacteriostatic water (containing for example, benzyl alcohol preservative) or in sterile water prior to injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosages and administration protocols for the treatment of cancers using the foregoing methods will vary with the method and the target cancer, and will generally depend on a number of other factors appreciated in the art.\n\n\n \nXI.) Identification, Characterization and Use of Modulators of 161P2F10B\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods to Identify and Use Modulators\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, screening is performed to identify modulators that induce or suppress a particular expression profile, suppress or induce specific pathways, preferably generating the associated phenotype thereby. In another embodiment, having identified differentially expressed genes important in a particular state; screens are performed to identify modulators that alter expression of individual genes, either increase or decrease. In another embodiment, screening is performed to identify modulators that alter a biological function of the expression product of a differentially expressed gene. Again, having identified the importance of a gene in a particular state, screens are performed to identify agents that bind and/or modulate the biological activity of the gene product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, screens are done for genes that are induced in response to a candidate agent. After identifying a modulator (one that suppresses a cancer expression pattern leading to a normal expression pattern, or a modulator of a cancer gene that leads to expression of the gene as in normal tissue) a screen is performed to identify genes that are specifically modulated in response to the agent. Comparing expression profiles between normal tissue and agent-treated cancer tissue reveals genes that are not expressed in normal tissue or cancer tissue, but are expressed in agent treated tissue, and vice versa. These agent-specific sequences are identified and used by methods described herein for cancer genes or proteins. In particular these sequences and the proteins they encode are used in marking or identifying agent-treated cells. In addition, antibodies are raised against the agent-induced proteins and used to target novel therapeutics to the treated cancer tissue sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModulator-Related Identification and Screening Assays:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene Expression-Related Assays\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProteins, nucleic acids, and antibodies of the invention are used in screening assays. The cancer-associated proteins, antibodies, nucleic acids, modified proteins and cells containing these sequences are used in screening assays, such as evaluating the effect of drug candidates on a “gene expression profile,” expression profile of polypeptides or alteration of biological function. In one embodiment, the expression profiles are used, preferably in conjunction with high throughput screening techniques to allow monitoring for expression profile genes after treatment with a candidate agent (e.g., Davis, G F, et al, J Biol Screen 7:69 (2002); Zlokarnik, et al., Science 279:84-8 (1998); Heid, Genome Res 6:986-94, 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cancer proteins, antibodies, nucleic acids, modified proteins and cells containing the native or modified cancer proteins or genes are used in screening assays. That is, the present invention comprises methods for screening for compositions which modulate the cancer phenotype or a physiological function of a cancer protein of the invention. This is done on a gene itself or by evaluating the effect of drug candidates on a “gene expression profile” or biological function. In one embodiment, expression profiles are used, preferably in conjunction with high throughput screening techniques to allow monitoring after treatment with a candidate agent, see Zlokarnik, supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of assays are executed directed to the genes and proteins of the invention. Assays are run on an individual nucleic acid or protein level. That is, having identified a particular gene as up regulated in cancer, test compounds are screened for the ability to modulate gene expression or for binding to the cancer protein of the invention. “Modulation” in this context includes an increase or a decrease in gene expression. The preferred amount of modulation will depend on the original change of the gene expression in normal versus tissue undergoing cancer, with changes of at least 10%, preferably 50%, more preferably 100-300%, and in some embodiments 300-1000% or greater. Thus, if a gene exhibits a 4-fold increase in cancer tissue compared to normal tissue, a decrease of about four-fold is often desired; similarly, a 10-fold decrease in cancer tissue compared to normal tissue a target value of a 10-fold increase in expression by the test compound is often desired. Modulators that exacerbate the type of gene expression seen in cancer are also useful, e.g., as an upregulated target in further analyses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of gene expression is monitored using nucleic acid probes and the quantification of gene expression levels, or, alternatively, a gene product itself is monitored, e.g., through the use of antibodies to the cancer protein and standard immunoassays. Proteomics and separation techniques also allow for quantification of expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression Monitoring to Identify Compounds that Modify Gene Expression\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, gene expression monitoring, i.e., an expression profile, is monitored simultaneously for a number of entities. Such profiles will typically involve one or more of the genes of \nFIG. 1\n. In this embodiment, e.g., cancer nucleic acid probes are attached to biochips to detect and quantify cancer sequences in a particular cell. Alternatively, PCR can be used. Thus, a series, e.g., wells of a microtiter plate, can be used with dispensed primers in desired wells. A PCR reaction can then be performed and analyzed for each well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression monitoring is performed to identify compounds that modify the expression of one or more cancer-associated sequences, e.g., a polynucleotide sequence set out in \nFIG. 1\n. Generally, a test modulator is added to the cells prior to analysis. Moreover, screens are also provided to identify agents that modulate cancer, modulate cancer proteins of the invention, bind to a cancer protein of the invention, or interfere with the binding of a cancer protein of the invention and an antibody or other binding partner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, high throughput screening methods involve providing a library containing a large number of potential therapeutic compounds (candidate compounds). Such “combinatorial chemical libraries” are then screened in one or more assays to identify those library members (particular chemical species or subclasses) that display a desired characteristic activity. The compounds thus identified can serve as conventional “lead compounds,” as compounds for screening, or as therapeutics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, combinatorial libraries of potential modulators are screened for an ability to bind to a cancer polypeptide or to modulate activity. Conventionally, new chemical entities with useful properties are generated by identifying a chemical compound (called a “lead compound”) with some desirable property or activity, e.g., inhibiting activity, creating variants of the lead compound, and evaluating the property and activity of those variant compounds. Often, high throughput screening (HTS) methods are employed for such an analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, gene expression monitoring is conveniently used to test candidate modulators (e.g., protein, nucleic acid or small molecule). After the candidate agent has been added and the cells allowed to incubate for a period, the sample containing a target sequence to be analyzed is, e.g., added to a biochip.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf required, the target sequence is prepared using known techniques. For example, a sample is treated to lyse the cells, using known lysis buffers, electroporation, etc., with purification and/or amplification such as PCR performed as appropriate. For example, an in vitro transcription with labels covalently attached to the nucleotides is performed. Generally, the nucleic acids are labeled with biotin-FITC or PE, or with cy3 or cy5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe target sequence can be labeled with, e.g., a fluorescent, a chemiluminescent, a chemical, or a radioactive signal, to provide a means of detecting the target sequence's specific binding to a probe. The label also can be an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase, which when provided with an appropriate substrate produces a product that is detected. Alternatively, the label is a labeled compound or small molecule, such as an enzyme inhibitor, that binds but is not catalyzed or altered by the enzyme. The label also can be a moiety or compound, such as, an epitope tag or biotin which specifically binds to streptavidin. For the example of biotin, the streptavidin is labeled as described above, thereby, providing a detectable signal for the bound target sequence. Unbound labeled streptavidin is typically removed prior to analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be appreciated by those in the art, these assays can be direct hybridization assays or can comprise “sandwich assays”, which include the use of multiple probes, as is generally outlined in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,681,702; 5,597,909; 5,545,730; 5,594,117; 5,591,584; 5,571,670; 5,580,731; 5,571,670; 5,591,584; 5,624,802; 5,635,352; 5,594,118; 5,359,100; 5,124, 246; and 5,681,697. In this embodiment, in general, the target nucleic acid is prepared as outlined above, and then added to the biochip comprising a plurality of nucleic acid probes, under conditions that allow the formation of a hybridization complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of hybridization conditions are used in the present invention, including high, moderate and low stringency conditions as outlined above. The assays are generally run under stringency conditions which allow formation of the label probe hybridization complex only in the presence of target. Stringency can be controlled by altering a step parameter that is a thermodynamic variable, including, but not limited to, temperature, formamide concentration, salt concentration, chaotropic salt concentration pH, organic solvent concentration, etc. These parameters may also be used to control non-specific binding, as is generally outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,697. Thus, it can be desirable to perform certain steps at higher stringency conditions to reduce non-specific binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reactions outlined herein can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Components of the reaction can be added simultaneously, or sequentially, in different orders, with preferred embodiments outlined below. In addition, the reaction may include a variety of other reagents. These include salts, buffers, neutral proteins, e.g. albumin, detergents, etc. which can be used to facilitate optimal hybridization and detection, and/or reduce nonspecific or background interactions. Reagents that otherwise improve the efficiency of the assay, such as protease inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors, anti-microbial agents, etc., may also be used as appropriate, depending on the sample preparation methods and purity of the target. The assay data are analyzed to determine the expression levels of individual genes, and changes in expression levels as between states, forming a gene expression profile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological Activity-Related Assays\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods to identify or screen for a compound that modulates the activity of a cancer-related gene or protein of the invention. The methods comprise adding a test compound, as defined above, to a cell comprising a cancer protein of the invention. The cells contain a recombinant nucleic acid that encodes a cancer protein of the invention. In another embodiment, a library of candidate agents is tested on a plurality of cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the assays are evaluated in the presence or absence or previous or subsequent exposure of physiological signals, e.g. hormones, antibodies, peptides, antigens, cytokines, growth factors, action potentials, pharmacological agents including chemotherapeutics, radiation, carcinogenics, or other cells (i.e., cell-cell contacts). In another example, the determinations are made at different stages of the cell cycle process. In this way, compounds that modulate genes or proteins of the invention are identified. Compounds with pharmacological activity are able to enhance or interfere with the activity of the cancer protein of the invention. Once identified, similar structures are evaluated to identify critical structural features of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a method of modulating (e.g., inhibiting) cancer cell division is provided; the method comprises administration of a cancer modulator. In another embodiment, a method of modulating (e.g., inhibiting) cancer is provided; the method comprises administration of a cancer modulator. In a further embodiment, methods of treating cells or individuals with cancer are provided; the method comprises administration of a cancer modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a method for modulating the status of a cell that expresses a gene of the invention is provided. As used herein status comprises such art-accepted parameters such as growth, proliferation, survival, function, apoptosis, senescence, location, enzymatic activity, signal transduction, etc. of a cell. In one embodiment, a cancer inhibitor is an antibody as discussed above. In another embodiment, the cancer inhibitor is an antisense molecule. A variety of cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis assays are known to those of skill in the art, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh Throughput Screening to Identify Modulators\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assays to identify suitable modulators are amenable to high throughput screening. Preferred assays thus detect enhancement or inhibition of cancer gene transcription, inhibition or enhancement of polypeptide expression, and inhibition or enhancement of polypeptide activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, modulators evaluated in high throughput screening methods are proteins, often naturally occurring proteins or fragments of naturally occurring proteins. Thus, e.g., cellular extracts containing proteins, or random or directed digests of proteinaceous cellular extracts, are used. In this way, libraries of proteins are made for screening in the methods of the invention. Particularly preferred in this embodiment are libraries of bacterial, fungal, viral, and mammalian proteins, with the latter being preferred, and human proteins being especially preferred. Particularly useful test compound will be directed to the class of proteins to which the target belongs, e.g., substrates for enzymes, or ligands and receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUse of Soft Agar Growth and Colony Formation to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNormal cells require a solid substrate to attach and grow. When cells are transformed, they lose this phenotype and grow detached from the substrate. For example, transformed cells can grow in stirred suspension culture or suspended in semi-solid media, such as semi-solid or soft agar. The transformed cells, when transfected with tumor suppressor genes, can regenerate normal phenotype and once again require a solid substrate to attach to and grow. Soft agar growth or colony formation in assays are used to identify modulators of cancer sequences, which when expressed in host cells, inhibit abnormal cellular proliferation and transformation. A modulator reduces or eliminates the host cells' ability to grow suspended in solid or semisolid media, such as agar.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for soft agar growth or colony formation in suspension assays are described in Freshney, Culture of Animal Cells a Manual of Basic Technique (3rd ed., 1994). See also, the methods section of Garkavtsev et al. (1996), supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEvaluation of Contact Inhibition and Growth Density Limitation to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNormal cells typically grow in a flat and organized pattern in cell culture until they touch other cells. When the cells touch one another, they are contact inhibited and stop growing. Transformed cells, however, are not contact inhibited and continue to grow to high densities in disorganized foci. Thus, transformed cells grow to a higher saturation density than corresponding normal cells. This is detected morphologically by the formation of a disoriented monolayer of cells or cells in foci. Alternatively, labeling index with (3H)-thymidine at saturation density is used to measure density limitation of growth, similarly an MTT or Alamar blue assay will reveal proliferation capacity of cells and the ability of modulators to affect same. See Freshney (1994), supra. Transformed cells, when transfected with tumor suppressor genes, can regenerate a normal phenotype and become contact inhibited and would grow to a lower density.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this assay, labeling index with 3H)-thymidine at saturation density is a preferred method of measuring density limitation of growth. Transformed host cells are transfected with a cancer-associated sequence and are grown for 24 hours at saturation density in non-limiting medium conditions. The percentage of cells labeling with (3H)-thymidine is determined by incorporated cpm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nContact independent growth is used to identify modulators of cancer sequences, which had led to abnormal cellular proliferation and transformation. A modulator reduces or eliminates contact independent growth, and returns the cells to a normal phenotype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEvaluation of Growth Factor or Serum Dependence to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformed cells have lower serum dependence than their normal counterparts (see, e.g., Temin, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 37:167-175 (1966); Eagle et al., J. Exp. Med 131:836-879 (1970)); Freshney, supra. This is in part due to release of various growth factors by the transformed cells. The degree of growth factor or serum dependence of transformed host cells can be compared with that of control. For example, growth factor or serum dependence of a cell is monitored in methods to identify and characterize compounds that modulate cancer-associated sequences of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUse of Tumor-specific Marker Levels to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor cells release an increased amount of certain factors (hereinafter “tumor specific markers”) than their normal counterparts. For example, plasminogen activator (PA) is released from human glioma at a higher level than from normal brain cells (see, e.g., Gullino, Angiogenesis, Tumor Vascularization, and Potential Interference with Tumor Growth, in Biological Responses in Cancer, pp. 178-184 (Mihich (ed.) 1985)). Similarly, Tumor Angiogenesis Factor (TAF) is released at a higher level in tumor cells than their normal counterparts. See, e.g., Folkman, Angiogenesis and Cancer, Sem. Cancer Biol. (1992)), while bFGF is released from endothelial tumors (Ensoli, B et al.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques which measure the release of these factors are described in Freshney (1994), supra. Also, see, Unkless et al., J. Biol. Chem. 249:4295-4305 (1974); Strickland & Beers, J. Biol. Chem. 251:5694-5702 (1976); Whur et al., Br. J. Cancer 42:305 312 (1980); Gullino, Angiogenesis, Tumor Vascularization, and Potential Interference with Tumor Growth, in Biological Responses in Cancer, pp. 178-184 (Mihich (ed.) 1985); Freshney, Anticancer Res. 5:111-130 (1985). For example, tumor specific marker levels are monitored in methods to identify and characterize compounds that modulate cancer-associated sequences of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInvasiveness into Matrigel to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe degree of invasiveness into Matrigel or an extracellular matrix constituent can be used as an assay to identify and characterize compounds that modulate cancer associated sequences. Tumor cells exhibit a positive correlation between malignancy and invasiveness of cells into Matrigel or some other extracellular matrix constituent. In this assay, tumorigenic cells are typically used as host cells. Expression of a tumor suppressor gene in these host cells would decrease invasiveness of the host cells. Techniques described in Cancer Res. 1999; 59:6010; Freshney (1994), supra, can be used. Briefly, the level of invasion of host cells is measured by using filters coated with Matrigel or some other extracellular matrix constituent. Penetration into the gel, or through to the distal side of the filter, is rated as invasiveness, and rated histologically by number of cells and distance moved, or by prelabeling the cells with 1251 and counting the radioactivity on the distal side of the filter or bottom of the dish. See, e.g., Freshney (1984), supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEvaluation of Tumor Growth In Vivo to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffects of cancer-associated sequences on cell growth are tested in transgenic or immune-suppressed organisms. Transgenic organisms are prepared in a variety of art-accepted ways. For example, knock-out transgenic organisms, e.g., mammals such as mice, are made, in which a cancer gene is disrupted or in which a cancer gene is inserted. Knock-out transgenic mice are made by insertion of a marker gene or other heterologous gene into the endogenous cancer gene site in the mouse genome via homologous recombination. Such mice can also be made by substituting the endogenous cancer gene with a mutated version of the cancer gene, or by mutating the endogenous cancer gene, e.g., by exposure to carcinogens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo prepare transgenic chimeric animals, e.g., mice, a DNA construct is introduced into the nuclei of embryonic stem cells. Cells containing the newly engineered genetic lesion are injected into a host mouse embryo, which is re-implanted into a recipient female. Some of these embryos develop into chimeric mice that possess germ cells some of which are derived from the mutant cell line. Therefore, by breeding the chimeric mice it is possible to obtain a new line of mice containing the introduced genetic lesion (see, e.g., Capecchi et al., Science 244:1288 (1989)). Chimeric mice can be derived according to U.S. Pat. No. 6,365,797, issued 2 Apr. 2002; U.S. Pat. No. 6,107,540 issued 22 Aug. 2000; Hogan et al., Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1988) and Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach, Robertson, ed., IRL Press, Washington, D.C., (1987).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, various immune-suppressed or immune-deficient host animals can be used. For example, a genetically athymic “nude” mouse (see, e.g., Giovanella et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 52:921 (1974)), a SCID mouse, a thymectornized mouse, or an irradiated mouse (see, e.g., Bradley et al., Br. J. Cancer 38:263 (1978); Selby et al., Br. J. Cancer 41:52 (1980)) can be used as a host. Transplantable tumor cells (typically about 10\n6 \ncells) injected into isogenic hosts produce invasive tumors in a high proportion of cases, while normal cells of similar origin will not. In hosts which developed invasive tumors, cells expressing cancer-associated sequences are injected subcutaneously or orthotopically. Mice are then separated into groups, including control groups and treated experimental groups) e.g. treated with a modulator). After a suitable length of time, preferably 4-8 weeks, tumor growth is measured (e.g., by volume or by its two largest dimensions, or weight) and compared to the control. Tumors that have statistically significant reduction (using, e.g., Student's T test) are said to have inhibited growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Vitro Assays to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays to identify compounds with modulating activity can be performed in vitro. For example, a cancer polypeptide is first contacted with a potential modulator and incubated for a suitable amount of time, e.g., from 0.5 to 48 hours. In one embodiment, the cancer polypeptide levels are determined in vitro by measuring the level of protein or mRNA. The level of protein is measured using immunoassays such as Western blotting, ELISA and the like with an antibody that selectively binds to the cancer polypeptide or a fragment thereof. For measurement of mRNA, amplification, e.g., using PCR, LCR, or hybridization assays, e.g., Northern hybridization, RNAse protection, dot blotting, are preferred. The level of protein or mRNA is detected using directly or indirectly labeled detection agents, e.g., fluorescently or radioactively labeled nucleic acids, radioactively or enzymatically labeled antibodies, and the like, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a reporter gene system can be devised using a cancer protein promoter operably linked to a reporter gene such as luciferase, green fluorescent protein, CAT, or P-gal. The reporter construct is typically transfected into a cell. After treatment with a potential modulator, the amount of reporter gene transcription, translation, or activity is measured according to standard techniques known to those of skill in the art (Davis G F, supra; Gonzalez, J. & Negulescu, P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998: 9:624).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs outlined above, in vitro screens are done on individual genes and gene products. That is, having identified a particular differentially expressed gene as important in a particular state, screening of modulators of the expression of the gene or the gene product itself is performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, screening for modulators of expression of specific gene(s) is performed. Typically, the expression of only one or a few genes is evaluated. In another embodiment, screens are designed to first find compounds that bind to differentially expressed proteins. These compounds are then evaluated for the ability to modulate differentially expressed activity. Moreover, once initial candidate compounds are identified, variants can be further screened to better evaluate structure activity relationships.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding Assays to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn binding assays in accordance with the invention, a purified or isolated gene product of the invention is generally used. For example, antibodies are generated to a protein of the invention, and immunoassays are run to determine the amount and/or location of protein. Alternatively, cells comprising the cancer proteins are used in the assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the methods comprise combining a cancer protein of the invention and a candidate compound such as a ligand, and determining the binding of the compound to the cancer protein of the invention. Preferred embodiments utilize the human cancer protein; animal models of human disease of can also be developed and used. Also, other analogous mammalian proteins also can be used as appreciated by those of skill in the art. Moreover, in some embodiments variant or derivative cancer proteins are used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the cancer protein of the invention, or the ligand, is non-diffusibly bound to an insoluble support. The support can, e.g., be one having isolated sample receiving areas (a microtiter plate, an array, etc.). The insoluble supports can be made of any composition to which the compositions can be bound, is readily separated from soluble material, and is otherwise compatible with the overall method of screening. The surface of such supports can be solid or porous and of any convenient shape.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable insoluble supports include microtiter plates, arrays, membranes and beads. These are typically made of glass, plastic (e.g., polystyrene), polysaccharide, nylon, nitrocellulose, or Teflon™, etc. Microtiter plates and arrays are especially convenient because a large number of assays can be carried out simultaneously, using small amounts of reagents and samples. The particular manner of binding of the composition to the support is not crucial so long as it is compatible with the reagents and overall methods of the invention, maintains the activity of the composition and is nondiffusable. Preferred methods of binding include the use of antibodies which do not sterically block either the ligand binding site or activation sequence when attaching the protein to the support, direct binding to “sticky” or ionic supports, chemical crosslinking, the synthesis of the protein or agent on the surface, etc. Following binding of the protein or ligand/binding agent to the support, excess unbound material is removed by washing. The sample receiving areas may then be blocked through incubation with bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein or other innocuous protein or other moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce a cancer protein of the invention is bound to the support, and a test compound is added to the assay. Alternatively, the candidate binding agent is bound to the support and the cancer protein of the invention is then added. Binding agents include specific antibodies, non-natural binding agents identified in screens of chemical libraries, peptide analogs, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf particular interest are assays to identify agents that have a low toxicity for human cells. A wide variety of assays can be used for this purpose, including proliferation assays, cAMP assays, labeled in vitro protein-protein binding assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, immunoassays for protein binding, functional assays (phosphorylation assays, etc.) and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA determination of binding of the test compound (ligand, binding agent, modulator, etc.) to a cancer protein of the invention can be done in a number of ways. The test compound can be labeled, and binding determined directly, e.g., by attaching all or a portion of the cancer protein of the invention to a solid support, adding a labeled candidate compound (e.g., a fluorescent label), washing off excess reagent, and determining whether the label is present on the solid support. Various blocking and washing steps can be utilized as appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, only one of the components is labeled, e.g., a protein of the invention or ligands labeled. Alternatively, more than one component is labeled with different labels, e.g., I\n125\n, for the proteins and a fluorophor for the compound. Proximity reagents, e.g., quenching or energy transfer reagents are also useful.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive Binding to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the binding of the “test compound” is determined by competitive binding assay with a “competitor.” The competitor is a binding moiety that binds to the target molecule (e.g., a cancer protein of the invention). Competitors include compounds such as antibodies, peptides, binding partners, ligands, etc. Under certain circumstances, the competitive binding between the test compound and the competitor displaces the test compound. In one embodiment, the test compound is labeled. Either the test compound, the competitor, or both, is added to the protein for a time sufficient to allow binding. Incubations are performed at a temperature that facilitates optimal activity, typically between four and 40° C. Incubation periods are typically optimized, e.g., to facilitate rapid high throughput screening; typically between zero and one hour will be sufficient. Excess reagent is generally removed or washed away. The second component is then added, and the presence or absence of the labeled component is followed, to indicate binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the competitor is added first, followed by the test compound. Displacement of the competitor is an indication that the test compound is binding to the cancer protein and thus is capable of binding to, and potentially modulating, the activity of the cancer protein. In this embodiment, either component can be labeled. Thus, e.g., if the competitor is labeled, the presence of label in the post-test compound wash solution indicates displacement by the test compound. Alternatively, if the test compound is labeled, the presence of the label on the support indicates displacement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, the test compound is added first, with incubation and washing, followed by the competitor. The absence of binding by the competitor indicates that the test compound binds to the cancer protein with higher affinity than the competitor. Thus, if the test compound is labeled, the presence of the label on the support, coupled with a lack of competitor binding, indicates that the test compound binds to and thus potentially modulates the cancer protein of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the competitive binding methods comprise differential screening to identity agents that are capable of modulating the activity of the cancer proteins of the invention. In this embodiment, the methods comprise combining a cancer protein and a competitor in a first sample. A second sample comprises a test compound, the cancer protein, and a competitor. The binding of the competitor is determined for both samples, and a change, or difference in binding between the two samples indicates the presence of an agent capable of binding to the cancer protein and potentially modulating its activity. That is, if the binding of the competitor is different in the second sample relative to the first sample, the agent is capable of binding to the cancer protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, differential screening is used to identify drug candidates that bind to the native cancer protein, but cannot bind to modified cancer proteins. For example the structure of the cancer protein is modeled and used in rational drug design to synthesize agents that interact with that site, agents which generally do not bind to site-modified proteins. Moreover, such drug candidates that affect the activity of a native cancer protein are also identified by screening drugs for the ability to either enhance or reduce the activity of such proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPositive controls and negative controls can be used in the assays. Preferably control and test samples are performed in at least triplicate to obtain statistically significant results. Incubation of all samples occurs for a time sufficient to allow for the binding of the agent to the protein. Following incubation, samples are washed free of non-specifically bound material and the amount of bound, generally labeled agent determined. For example, where a radiolabel is employed, the samples can be counted in a scintillation counter to determine the amount of bound compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of other reagents can be included in the screening assays. These include reagents like salts, neutral proteins, e.g. albumin, detergents, etc. which are used to facilitate optimal protein-protein binding and/or reduce non-specific or background interactions. Also reagents that otherwise improve the efficiency of the assay, such as protease inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors, anti-microbial agents, etc., can be used. The mixture of components is added in an order that provides for the requisite binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUse of Polynucleotides to Down-Regulate or Inhibit a Protein of the Invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolynucleotide modulators of cancer can be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleotide sequence by formation of a conjugate with a ligand-binding molecule, as described in WO 91/04753. Suitable ligand-binding molecules include, but are not limited to, cell surface receptors, growth factors, other cytokines, or other ligands that bind to cell surface receptors. Preferably, conjugation of the ligand binding molecule does not substantially interfere with the ability of the ligand binding molecule to bind to its corresponding molecule or receptor, or block entry of the sense or antisense oligonucleotide or its conjugated version into the cell. Alternatively, a polynucleotide modulator of cancer can be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence, e.g., by formation of a polynucleotide-lipid complex, as described in WO 90/10448. It is understood that the use of antisense molecules or knock out and knock in models may also be used in screening assays as discussed above, in addition to methods of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitory and Antisense Nucleotides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the activity of a cancer-associated protein is down-regulated, or entirely inhibited, by the use of antisense polynucleotide or inhibitory small nuclear RNA (snRNA), i.e., a nucleic acid complementary to, and which can preferably hybridize specifically to, a coding mRNA nucleic acid sequence, e.g., a cancer protein of the invention, mRNA, or a subsequence thereof. Binding of the antisense polynucleotide to the mRNA reduces the translation and/or stability of the mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of this invention, antisense polynucleotides can comprise naturally occurring nucleotides, or synthetic species formed from naturally occurring subunits or their close homologs. Antisense polynucleotides may also have altered sugar moieties or inter-sugar linkages. Exemplary among these are the phosphorothioate and other sulfur containing species which are known for use in the art. Analogs are comprised by this invention so long as they function effectively to hybridize with nucleotides of the invention. See, e.g., Isis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, Calif.; Sequitor, Inc., Natick, Mass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch antisense polynucleotides can readily be synthesized using recombinant means, or can be synthesized in vitro. Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors, including Applied Biosystems. The preparation of other oligonucleotides such as phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives is also well known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntisense molecules as used herein include antisense or sense oligonucleotides. Sense oligonucleotides can, e.g., be employed to block transcription by binding to the anti-sense strand. The antisense and sense oligonucleotide comprise a single stranded nucleic acid sequence (either RNA or DNA) capable of binding to target mRNA (sense) or DNA (antisense) sequences for cancer molecules. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides, according to the present invention, comprise a fragment generally at least about 12 nucleotides, preferably from about 12 to 30 nucleotides. The ability to derive an antisense or a sense oligonucleotide, based upon a cDNA sequence encoding a given protein is described in, e.g., Stein &Cohen (Cancer Res. 48:2659 (1988 and van der Krol et al. (BioTechniques 6:958 (1988)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRibozymes\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to antisense polynucleotides, ribozymes can be used to target and inhibit transcription of cancer-associated nucleotide sequences. A ribozyme is an RNA molecule that catalytically cleaves other RNA molecules. Different kinds of ribozymes have been described, including group I ribozymes, hammerhead ribozymes, hairpin ribozymes, RNase P, and axhead ribozymes (see, e.g., Castanotto et al., Adv. in Pharmacology 25: 289-317 (1994) for a general review of the properties of different ribozymes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe general features of hairpin ribozymes are described, e.g., in Hampel et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 18:299-304 (1990); European Patent Publication No. 0360257; U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,678. Methods of preparing are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., WO 94/26877; Ojwang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6340-6344 (1993); Yamada et al., Human Gene Therapy 1:39-45 (1994); Leavitt et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 92:699-703 (1995); Leavitt et al., Human Gene Therapy 5: 1151-120 (1994); and Yamada et al., Virology 205: 121-126 (1994)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUse of Modulators in Phenotypic Screening\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a test compound is administered to a population of cancer cells, which have an associated cancer expression profile. By “administration” or “contacting” herein is meant that the modulator is added to the cells in such a manner as to allow the modulator to act upon the cell, whether by uptake and intracellular action, or by action at the cell surface. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid encoding a proteinaceous agent (i.e., a peptide) is put into a viral construct such as an adenoviral or retroviral construct, and added to the cell, such that expression of the peptide agent is accomplished, e.g., PCT US97/01019. Regulatable gene therapy systems can also be used. Once the modulator has been administered to the cells, the cells are washed if desired and are allowed to incubate under preferably physiological conditions for some period. The cells are then harvested and a new gene expression profile is generated. Thus, e.g., cancer tissue is screened for agents that modulate, e.g., induce or suppress, the cancer phenotype. A change in at least one gene, preferably many, of the expression profile indicates that the agent has an effect on cancer activity. Similarly, altering a biological function or a signaling pathway is indicative of modulator activity. By defining such a signature for the cancer phenotype, screens for new drugs that alter the phenotype are devised. With this approach, the drug target need not be known and need not be represented in the original gene/protein expression screening platform, nor does the level of transcript for the target protein need to change. The modulator inhibiting function will serve as a surrogate marker\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs outlined above, screens are done to assess genes or gene products. That is, having identified a particular differentially expressed gene as important in a particular state, screening of modulators of either the expression of the gene or the gene product itself is performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUse of Modulators to Affect Peptides of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeasurements of cancer polypeptide activity, or of the cancer phenotype are performed using a variety of assays. For example, the effects of modulators upon the function of a cancer polypeptide(s) are measured by examining parameters described above. A physiological change that affects activity is used to assess the influence of a test compound on the polypeptides of this invention. When the functional outcomes are determined using intact cells or animals, a variety of effects can be assesses such as, in the case of a cancer associated with solid tumors, tumor growth, tumor metastasis, neovascularization, hormone release, transcriptional changes to both known and uncharacterized genetic markers (e.g., by Northern blots), changes in cell metabolism such as cell growth or pH changes, and changes in intracellular second messengers such as cGNIP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of Identifying Characterizing Cancer-associated Sequences\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression of various gene sequences is correlated with cancer. Accordingly, disorders based on mutant or variant cancer genes are determined. In one embodiment, the invention provides methods for identifying cells containing variant cancer genes, e.g., determining the presence of, all or part, the sequence of at least one endogenous cancer gene in a cell. This is accomplished using any number of sequencing techniques. The invention comprises methods of identifying the cancer genotype of an individual, e.g., determining all or part of the sequence of at least one gene of the invention in the individual. This is generally done in at least one tissue of the individual, e.g., a tissue set forth in Table I, and may include the evaluation of a number of tissues or different samples of the same tissue. The method may include comparing the sequence of the sequenced gene to a known cancer gene, i.e., a wild-type gene to determine the presence of family members, homologies, mutations or variants. The sequence of all or part of the gene can then be compared to the sequence of a known cancer gene to determine if any differences exist. This is done using any number of known homology programs, such as BLAST, Bestfit, etc. The presence of a difference in the sequence between the cancer gene of the patient and the known cancer gene correlates with a disease state or a propensity for a disease state, as outlined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the cancer genes are used as probes to determine the number of copies of the cancer gene in the genome. The cancer genes are used as probes to determine the chromosomal localization of the cancer genes. Information such as chromosomal localization finds use in providing a diagnosis or prognosis in particular when chromosomal abnormalities such as translocations, and the like are identified in the cancer gene locus.\n\n\n \n \nXII.) RNAi and Therapeutic Use of Small Interfering RNA (siRNAs)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is also directed towards siRNA oligonucleotides, particularly double stranded RNAs encompassing at least a fragment of the 161P2F10B coding region or 5″ UTR regions, or complement, or any antisense oligonucleotide specific to the 161P2F10B sequence. In one embodiment such oligonucleotides are used to elucidate a function of 161P2F10B, or are used to screen for or evaluate modulators of 161P2F10B function or expression. In another embodiment, gene expression of 161P2F10B is reduced by using siRNA transfection and results in significantly diminished proliferative capacity of transformed cancer cells that endogenously express the antigen; cells treated with specific 161P2F10B siRNAs show reduced survival as measured, e.g., by a metabolic readout of cell viability, correlating to the reduced proliferative capacity. Thus, 161P2F10B siRNA compositions comprise siRNA (double stranded RNA) that correspond to the nucleic acid ORF sequence of the 161P2F10B protein or subsequences thereof; these subsequences are generally 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 or more than 35 contiguous RNA nucleotides in length and contain sequences that are complementary and non-complementary to at least a portion of the mRNA coding sequence In a preferred embodiment, the subsequences are 19-25 nucleotides in length, most preferably 21-23 nucleotides in length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA interference is a novel approach to silencing genes in vitro and in vivo, thus small double stranded RNAs (siRNAs) are valuable therapeutic agents. The power of siRNAs to silence specific gene activities has now been brought to animal models of disease and is used in humans as well. For example, hydrodynamic infusion of a solution of siRNA into a mouse with a siRNA against a particular target has been proven to be therapeutically effective.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pioneering work by Song et al. indicates that one type of entirely natural nucleic acid, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), served as therapeutic agents even without further chemical modification (Song, E., et al. “RNA interference targeting Fas protects mice from fulminant hepatitis” Nat. Med. 9(3): 347-51 (2003)). This work provided the first in vivo evidence that infusion of siRNAs into an animal could alleviate disease. In that case, the authors gave mice injections of siRNA designed to silence the FAS protein (a cell death receptor that when over-activated during inflammatory response induces hepatocytes and other cells to die). The next day, the animals were given an antibody specific to Fas. Control mice died of acute liver failure within a few days, while over 80% of the siRNA-treated mice remained free from serious disease and survived. About 80% to 90% of their liver cells incorporated the naked siRNA oligonucleotides. Furthermore, the RNA molecules functioned for 10 days before losing effect after 3 weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use in human therapy, siRNA is delivered by efficient systems that induce long-lasting RNAi activity. A major caveat for clinical use is delivering siRNAs to the appropriate cells. Hepatocytes seem to be particularly receptive to exogenous RNA. Today, targets located in the liver are attractive because liver is an organ that can be readily targeted by nucleic acid molecules and viral vectors. However, other tissue and organs targets are preferred as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of siRNAs with compounds that promote transit across cell membranes are used to improve administration of siRNAs in therapy. Chemically modified synthetic siRNA, that are resistant to nucleases and have serum stability have concomitant enhanced duration of RNAi effects, are an additional embodiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, siRNA technology is a therapeutic for human malignancy by delivery of siRNA molecules directed to 161P2F10B to individuals with the cancers, such as those listed in Table 1. Such administration of siRNAs leads to reduced growth of cancer cells expressing 161P2F10B, and provides an anti-tumor therapy, lessening the morbidity and/or mortality associated with malignancy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of this modality of gene product knockdown is significant when measured in vitro or in vivo. Effectiveness in vitro is readily demonstrable through application of siRNAs to cells in culture (as described above) or to aliquots of cancer patient biopsies when in vitro methods are used to detect the reduced expression of 161P2F10B protein.\n\n\n \nXIII.)

First strand cDNA was generated from normal stomach, normal brain, normal heart, normal liver, normal skeletal muscle, normal testis, normal prostate, normal bladder, normal kidney, normal colon, normal lung, normal pancreas, and a pool of cancer specimens from prostate cancer patients, bladder cancer patients, kidney cancer patients, colon cancer patients, lung cancer patients, pancreas cancer patients, a pool of prostate cancer xenografts (LAPC-4AD, LAPC-4AI, LAPC-9AD and LAPC-9AI), and a pool of 2 patient prostate metastasis to lymph node. Normalization was performed by PCR using primers to actin. Semi-quantitative PCR, using primers to 161P2F10B, was performed at 26 and 30 cycles of amplification. Samples were run on an agarose gel, and PCR products were quantitated using the AlphaImager software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression of 161P2F10B in a panel of kidney cancer clear cell carcinoma, kidney cancer papillary carcinoma, and in uterus patient cancer specimens has been shown previously. First strand cDNA was prepared from the patient specimens. Normalization was performed by PCR using primers to actin. Semi-quantitative PCR, using primers to 161P2F10B, was performed at 26 and 30 cycles of amplification. Samples were run on an agarose gel, and PCR products were quantitated using the AlphaImager software. Expression was recorded as absent, low, medium or strong. Results show expression of 161P2F10B in 94.7% of clear cell renal carcinoma, 62.5% of papillary renal cell carcinoma, and in 61.5% of uterus cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe restricted expression of 161P2F10B in normal tissues and the upregulation detected in kidney cancer, in kidney cancer metastasis, as well as in prostate, bladder, colon, lung, pancreas, bone, lymphoma, uterus, breast, and ovary cancers, suggest that 161P2F10B is a therapeutic target and a diagnostic marker for human cancers.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nSplice Variants of 161P2F10B\n\n\n \n \n \nTranscript variants are variants of mature mRNA from the same gene, which arise by alternative transcription or alternative splicing. Alternative transcripts are transcripts from the same gene but start transcription at different points. Splice variants are mRNA variants spliced differently from the same transcript. In eukaryotes, when a multi-exon gene is transcribed from genomic DNA, the initial RNA is spliced to produce functional mRNA, which has only exons and is used for translation into an amino acid sequence. Accordingly, a given gene can have zero to many alternative transcripts and each transcript can have zero to many splice variants. Each transcript variant has a unique exon makeup, and can have different coding and/or non-coding (5′ or 3′ end) portions, from the original transcript. Transcript variants can code for similar or different proteins with the same or a similar function or can encode proteins with different functions, and can be expressed in the same tissue at the same time, or in different tissues at the same time, or in the same tissue at different times, or in different tissues at different times. Proteins encoded by transcript variants can have similar or different cellular or extracellular localizations, e.g., secreted versus intracellular.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscript variants are identified by a variety of art-accepted methods. For example, alternative transcripts and splice variants are identified by full-length cloning experiment, or by use of full-length transcript and EST sequences. First, all human ESTs were grouped into clusters which show direct or indirect identity with each other. Second, ESTs in the same cluster were further grouped into sub-clusters and assembled into a consensus sequence. The original gene sequence is compared to the consensus sequence(s) or other full-length sequences. Each consensus sequence is a potential splice variant for that gene. Even when a variant is identified that is not a full-length clone, that portion of the variant is very useful for antigen generation and for further cloning of the full-length splice variant, using techniques known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, computer programs are available in the art that identify transcript variants based on genomic sequences. Genomic-based transcript variant identification programs include FgenesH (A. Salamov and V. Solovyev, “Ab initio gene finding in \nDrosophila \ngenomic DNA,” Genome Research. 2000 April; 10(4):516-22); Grail and GenScan. For a general discussion of splice variant identification protocols see., e.g., Southan, C., A genomic perspective on human proteases, FEBS Lett. 2001 Jun. 8; 498(2-3):214-8; de Souza, S. J., et al., Identification of \nhuman chromosome\n 22 transcribed sequences with ORF expressed sequence tags, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Nov. 7; 97(23):12690-3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further confirm the parameters of a transcript variant, a variety of techniques are available in the art, such as full-length cloning, proteomic validation, PCR-based validation, and 5′ RACE validation, etc. (see e.g., Proteomic Validation: Brennan, S. O., et al., Albumin banks peninsula: a new termination variant characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry, Biochem Biophys Acta. 1999 Aug. 17; 1433(1-2):321-6; Ferranti P, et al., Differential splicing of pre-messenger RNA produces multiple forms of mature caprine alpha(s1)-casein, Eur J.

E., et al., Organization of the murine reduced folate carrier gene and identification of variant splice forms, Biochem Biophys Acta. 1997 Aug. 7; 1353(2): 191-8).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is known in the art that genomic regions are modulated in cancers. When the genomic region to which a gene maps is modulated in a particular cancer, the alternative transcripts or splice variants of the gene are modulated as well. Disclosed herein is that 161P2F10B has a particular expression profile related to cancer. Alternative transcripts and splice variants of 161P2F10B are also involved in cancers in the same or different tissues, thus serving as tumor-associated markers/antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B amino acid and nucleic acid sequences are set forth on a variant by variant basis in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nSingle Nucleotide Polymorphisms of 161P2F10B\n\n\n \n \n \nA Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) is a single base pair variation in a nucleotide sequence at a specific location. At any given point of the genome, there are four possible nucleotide base pairs: A/T, C/G, G/C and T/A. Genotype refers to the specific base pair sequence of one or more locations in the genome of an individual. Haplotype refers to the base pair sequence of more than one location on the same DNA molecule (or the same chromosome in higher organisms), often in the context of one gene or in the context of several tightly linked genes. SNPs that occur on a cDNA are called cSNPs. These cSNPs may change amino acids of the protein encoded by the gene and thus change the functions of the protein. Some SNPs cause inherited diseases; others contribute to quantitative variations in phenotype and reactions to environmental factors including diet and drugs among individuals. Therefore, SNPs and/or combinations of alleles (called haplotypes) have many applications, including diagnosis of inherited diseases, determination of drug reactions and dosage, identification of genes responsible for diseases, and analysis of the genetic relationship between individuals (P. Nowotny, J. M. Kwon and A. M. Goate, “SNP analysis to dissect human traits,” Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001 October; 11(5):637-641; M. Pirmohamed and B. K. Park, “Genetic susceptibility to adverse drug reactions,” Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001 June; 22(6):298-305; J. H. Riley, C. J. Allan, E. Lai and A. Roses, “The use of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the isolation of common disease genes,” Pharmacogenomics. 2000 February; 1(1):39-47; R. Judson, J. C. Stephens and A. Windemuth, “The predictive power of haplotypes in clinical response,” Pharmacogenomics. 2000 feb; 1(1):15-26).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSNPs are identified by a variety of art-accepted methods (P. Bean, “The promising voyage of SNP target discovery,” Am. Clin. Lab. 2001 October-November; 20(9):18-20; K. M. Weiss, “In search of human variation,” Genome Res. 1998 July; 8(7):691-697; M. M. She, “Enabling large-scale pharmacogenetic studies by high-throughput mutation detection and genotyping technologies,” Clin. Chem. 2001 February; 47(2):164-172). For example, SNPs are identified by sequencing DNA fragments that show polymorphism by gel-based methods such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). They can also be discovered by direct sequencing of DNA samples pooled from different individuals or by comparing sequences from different DNA samples. With the rapid accumulation of sequence data in public and private databases, one can discover SNPs by comparing sequences using computer programs (Z. Gu, L. Hillier and P. Y. Kwok, “Single nucleotide polymorphism hunting in cyberspace,” Hum. Mutat. 1998; 12(4):221-225). SNPs can be verified and genotype or haplotype of an individual can be determined by a variety of methods including direct sequencing and high throughput microarrays (P. Y. Kwok, “Methods for genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms,” Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2001; 2:235-258; M. Kokoris, K. Dix, K. Moynihan, J. Mathis, B. Erwin, P. Grass, B. Hines and A. Duesterhoeft, “High-throughput SNP genotyping with the Masscode system,” Mol. Diagn. 2000 December; 5(4):329-340).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the methods described above, four SNPs were identified in the original transcript, 161P2F10B v.1, at positions 408 (A/G), 2502 (A/G), 2663 (A/C) and 3233 (A/C). The transcripts or proteins with alternative alleles were designated as variants 161P2F10B v.2, v.3, v.4, and v.5, respectively. These alleles of the SNPs, though discussed separately, can occur in different combinations (haplotypes) and in any one of the transcript variants (such as 161P2F10B v.7) that contains the sequence context of the SNPs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B amino acid and nucleic acid sequences are set forth on a variant by variant basis in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nProduction of Recombinant 161P2F10B in Prokaryotic Systems\n\n\n \n \n \nTo express recombinant 161P2F10B and 161P2F10B variants in prokaryotic cells, the full or partial length 161P2F10B and 161P2F10B variant cDNA sequences are cloned into any one of a variety of expression vectors known in the art. One or more of the following regions of 161P2F10B variants are expressed: the full length sequence presented in \nFIG. 1\n, or any 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 or more contiguous amino acids from 161P2F10B, variants, or analogs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Vitro Transcription and Translation Constructs:\n\n\n \n \n \n \npCRII: To generate 161P2F10B sense and anti-sense RNA probes for RNA in situ investigations, pCRII constructs (Invitrogen, Carlsbad Calif.) are generated encoding either all or fragments of the 161P2F10B cDNA. The pCRII vector has Sp6 and T7 promoters flanking the insert to drive the transcription of 161P2F10B RNA for use as probes in RNA in situ hybridization experiments. These probes are used to analyze the cell and tissue expression of 161P2F10B at the RNA level. Transcribed 161P2F10B RNA representing the cDNA amino acid coding region of the 161P2F10B gene is used in in vitro translation systems such as the TnT™ Coupled Reticulolysate System (Promega, Corp., Madison, Wis.) to synthesize 161P2F10B protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBacterial Constructs:\n\n\n \n \n \n \npGEX Constructs: To generate recombinant 161P2F10B proteins in bacteria that are fused to the Glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein, all or parts of the 161P2F10B cDNA protein coding sequence are cloned into the pGEX family of GST-fusion vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.). These constructs allow controlled expression of recombinant 161P2F10B protein sequences with GST fused at the amino-terminus and a six histidine epitope (6×His) at the carboxyl-terminus. The GST and 6×His tags permit purification of the recombinant fusion protein from induced bacteria with the appropriate affinity matrix and allow recognition of the fusion protein with anti-GST and anti-His antibodies. The 6×His tag is generated by adding 6 histidine codons to the cloning primer at the 3′ end, e.g., of the open reading frame (ORF). A proteolytic cleavage site, such as the PreScission™ recognition site in pGEX-6P-1, may be employed such that it permits cleavage of the GST tag from 161P2F10B-related protein. The ampicillin resistance gene and pBR322 origin permits selection and maintenance of the pGEX plasmids in \nE. coli. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \npMAL Constructs: To generate, in bacteria, recombinant 161P2F10B proteins that are fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP), all or parts of the 161P2F10B cDNA protein coding sequence are fused to the MBP gene by cloning into the pMAL-c2X and pMAL-p2X vectors (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.). These constructs allow controlled expression of recombinant 161P2F10B protein sequences with MBP fused at the amino-terminus and a 6× His epitope tag at the carboxyl-terminus. The MBP and 6×His tags permit purification of the recombinant protein from induced bacteria with the appropriate affinity matrix and allow recognition of the fusion protein with anti-MBP and anti-His antibodies. The 6×His epitope tag is generated by adding 6 histidine codons to the 3′ cloning primer. A Factor Xa recognition site permits cleavage of the pMAL tag from 161P2F10B. The pMAL-c2X and pMAL-p2X vectors are optimized to express the recombinant protein in the cytoplasm or periplasm respectively. Periplasm expression enhances folding of proteins with disulfide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \npET Constructs: To express 161P2F10B in bacterial cells, all or parts of the 161P2F10B cDNA protein coding sequence are cloned into the pET family of vectors (Novagen, Madison, Wis.). These vectors allow tightly controlled expression of recombinant 161P2F10B protein in bacteria with and without fusion to proteins that enhance solubility, such as NusA and thioredoxin (Trx), and epitope tags, such as 6×His and S-Tag™ that aid purification and detection of the recombinant protein. For example, constructs are made utilizing pET NusA fusion system 43.1 such that regions of the 161P2F10B protein are expressed as amino-terminal fusions to NusA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYeast Constructs:\n\n\n \n \n \n \npESC Constructs: To express 161P2F10B in the yeast species \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae \nfor generation of recombinant protein and functional studies, all or parts of the 161P2F10B cDNA protein coding sequence are cloned into the pESC family of vectors each of which contain 1 of 4 selectable markers, HIS3, TRP1, LEU2, and URA3 (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). These vectors allow controlled expression from the same plasmid of up to 2 different genes or cloned sequences containing either Flag™ or Myc epitope tags in the same yeast cell. This system is useful to confirm protein-protein interactions of 161P2F10B. In addition, expression in yeast yields similar post-translational modifications, such as glycosylations and phosphorylations that are found when expressed in eukaryotic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \npESP Constructs: To express 161P2F10B in the yeast species \nSaccharomyces pombe\n, all or parts of the 161P2F10B cDNA protein coding sequence are cloned into the pESP family of vectors. These vectors allow controlled high level of expression of a 161P2F10B protein sequence that is fused at either the amino terminus or at the carboxyl terminus to GST which aids purification of the recombinant protein. A Flag™ epitope tag allows detection of the recombinant protein with anti-Flag™ antibody.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nProduction of Recombinant 161P2F10B in Higher Eukaryotic Systems\n\n\n \n \n \nA. Mammalian Constructs:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo express recombinant 161P2F10B in eukaryotic cells, the full or partial length 161P2F10B cDNA sequences, or variants thereof, can be cloned into any one of a variety of expression vectors known in the art. One or more of the following regions of 161P2F10B are expressed in these constructs, \namino acids\n 1 to 875, or any 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 or more contiguous amino acids from 161P2F10B v.1, 161P2F10B variants, or analogs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe constructs can be transfected into any one of a wide variety of mammalian cells such as 293T cells. Transfected 293T cell lysates can be probed with the anti-161P2F10B polyclonal serum, described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \npcDNA4/HisMax Constructs: To express 161P2F10B in mammalian cells, a 161P2F10B ORF, or portions thereof, of 161P2F10B are cloned into pcDNA4/HisMax Version A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Protein expression is driven from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and the SP16 translational enhancer. The recombinant protein has Xpress™ and six histidine (6× His) epitopes fused to the amino-terminus. The pcDNA4/HisMax vector also contains the bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence to enhance mRNA stability along with the SV40 origin for episomal replication and simple vector rescue in cell lines expressing the large T antigen. The Zeocin resistance gene allows for selection of mammalian cells expressing the protein and the ampicillin resistance gene and ColE1 origin permits selection and maintenance of the plasmid in \nE. coli. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \npcDNA3.1/MycHis Constructs: To express 161P2F10B in mammalian cells, a 161P2F10B ORF, or portions thereof, of 161P2F10B with a consensus Kozak translation initiation site was cloned into pcDNA3.1/MycHis Version A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Protein expression is driven from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The recombinant proteins have the myc epitope and 6×His epitope fused to the carboxyl-terminus. The pcDNA3.1/MycHis vector also contains the bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence to enhance mRNA stability, along with the SV40 origin for episomal replication and simple vector rescue in cell lines expressing the large T antigen. The Neomycin resistance gene can be used, as it allows for selection of mammalian cells expressing the protein and the ampicillin resistance gene and ColE1 origin permits selection and maintenance of the plasmid in \nE. coli. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \npcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO Construct: To express 161P2F10B in mammalian cells and to allow detection of the recombinant proteins using fluorescence, a 161P2F10B ORF, or portions thereof, with a consensus Kozak translation initiation site are cloned into pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO (Invitrogen, CA). Protein expression is driven from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The recombinant proteins have the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fused to the carboxyl-terminus facilitating non-invasive, in vivo detection and cell biology studies. The pcDNA3.1CT-GFP-TOPO vector also contains the bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence to enhance mRNA stability along with the SV40 origin for episomal replication and simple vector rescue in cell lines expressing the large T antigen. The Neomycin resistance gene allows for selection of mammalian cells that express the protein and the ampicillin resistance gene and ColE1 origin permits selection and maintenance of the plasmid in \nE. coli\n. Additional constructs with an amino-terminal GFP fusion are made in pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO spanning the entire length of a 161P2F10B protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPAPtag: A 161P2F10B ORF, or portions thereof, is cloned into pAPtag-5 (GenHunter Corp. Nashville, Tenn.). This construct generates an alkaline phosphatase fusion at the carboxyl-terminus of a 161P2F10B protein while fusing the IgGK signal sequence to the amino-terminus. Constructs are also generated in which alkaline phosphatase with an amino-terminal IgGK signal sequence is fused to the amino-terminus of a 161P2F10B protein. The resulting recombinant 161P2F10B proteins are optimized for secretion into the media of transfected mammalian cells and can be used to identify proteins such as ligands or receptors that interact with 161P2F10B proteins. Protein expression is driven from the CMV promoter and the recombinant proteins also contain myc and 6×His epitopes fused at the carboxyl-terminus that facilitates detection and purification. The Zeocin resistance gene present in the vector allows for selection of mammalian cells expressing the recombinant protein and the ampicillin resistance gene permits selection of the plasmid in \nE. coli. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nptag5: A 161P2F10B ORF, or portions thereof, was cloned into pTag-5. This vector is similar to pAPtag but without the alkaline phosphatase fusion. This construct generates 161P2F10B protein with an amino-terminal IgGK signal sequence and myc and 6× His epitope tags at the carboxyl-terminus that facilitate detection and affinity purification. The resulting recombinant 161P2F10B protein is optimized for secretion into the media of transfected mammalian cells, and is used as immunogen or ligand to identify proteins such as ligands or receptors that interact with the 161P2F10B proteins. Protein expression is driven from the CMV promoter. The Zeocin resistance gene present in the vector allows for selection of mammalian cells expressing the protein, and the ampicillin resistance gene permits selection of the plasmid in \nE. coli. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nPsecFc: A 161P2F10B ORF, or portions thereof, was cloned into psecFc. The psecFc vector was assembled by cloning the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG) Fc (hinge, CH2, CH3 regions) into pSecTag2 (Invitrogen, California). This construct generates an IgG1 Fc fusion at the carboxyl-terminus of the 161P2F10B proteins, while fusing the IgGK signal sequence to N-terminus. 161P2F10B fusions utilizing the murine IgG1 Fc region are also used. The resulting recombinant 161P2F10B proteins are optimized for secretion into the media of transfected mammalian cells, and can be used as immunogens or to identify proteins such as ligands or receptors that interact with 161P2F10B protein. Protein expression is driven from the CMV promoter. The hygromycin resistance gene present in the vector allows for selection of mammalian cells that express the recombinant protein, and the ampicillin resistance gene permits selection of the plasmid in \nE. coli. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \npSRα Constructs: To generate mammalian cell lines that express 161P2F10B constitutively, 161P2F10B ORF, or portions thereof, of 161P2F10B were cloned into pSRα constructs. Amphotropic and ecotropic retroviruses were generated by transfection of pSRα constructs into the 293T-10A1 packaging line or co-transfection of pSRα and a helper plasmid (containing deleted packaging sequences) into the 293 cells, respectively. The retrovirus is used to infect a variety of mammalian cell lines, resulting in the integration of the cloned gene, 161P2F10B, into the host cell-lines. Protein expression is driven from a long terminal repeat (LTR). The Neomycin resistance gene present in the vector allows for selection of mammalian cells that express the protein, and the ampicillin resistance gene and ColE1 origin permit selection and maintenance of the plasmid in \nE. coli\n. The retroviral vectors can thereafter be used for infection and generation of various cell lines using, for example, PC3, NIH 3T3, TsuPr1, 293 or rat-I cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional pSRα constructs are made that fuse an epitope tag such as the FLAG™ tag to the carboxyl-terminus of 161P2F10B sequences to allow detection using anti-Flag antibodies. For example, the \nFLAG™ sequence\n 5′ GAT TAC AAG GAT GAC \nGAC GAT AAG\n 3′ (SEQ ID NO: 165) is added to cloning primer at the 3′ end of the ORF. Additional pSRα constructs are made to produce both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal GFP and myc/6× His fusion proteins of the full-length 161P2F10B proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional Viral Vectors: Additional constructs are made for viral-mediated delivery and expression of 161P2F10B. High virus titer leading to high level expression of 161P2F10B is achieved in viral delivery systems such as adenoviral vectors and herpes amplicon vectors. A 161P2F10B coding sequences or fragments thereof are amplified by PCR and subcloned into the AdEasy shuttle vector (Stratagene). Recombination and virus packaging are performed according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate adenoviral vectors. Alternatively, 161P2F10B coding sequences or fragments thereof are cloned into the HSV-1 vector (Imgenex) to generate herpes viral vectors. The viral vectors are thereafter used for infection of various cell lines such as PC3, NIH 3T3, 293 or rat-1 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegulated Expression Systems: To control expression of 161P2F10B in mammalian cells, coding sequences of 161P2F10B, or portions thereof, are cloned into regulated mammalian expression systems such as the T-Rex System (Invitrogen), the GeneSwitch System (Invitrogen) and the tightly-regulated Ecdysone System (Sratagene). These systems allow the study of the temporal and concentration dependent effects of recombinant 161P2F10B. These vectors are thereafter used to control expression of 161P2F10B in various cell lines such as PC3, NIH 3T3, 293 or rat-1 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. Baculovirus Expression Systems\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo generate recombinant 161P2F10B proteins in a baculovirus expression system, 161P2F10B ORF, or portions thereof, are cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac 4.5 (Invitrogen), which provides a His-tag at the N-terminus. Specifically, pBlueBac-161P2F10B is co-transfected with helper plasmid pBac-N-Blue (Invitrogen) into SF9 (\nSpodoptera frugiperda\n) insect cells to generate recombinant baculovirus (see Invitrogen instruction manual for details). Baculovirus is then collected from cell supernatant and purified by plaque assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant 161P2F10B protein is then generated by infection of HighFive insect cells (Invitrogen) with purified baculovirus. Recombinant 161P2F10B protein can be detected using anti-161P2F10B or anti-His-tag antibody. 161P2F10B protein can be purified and used in various cell-based assays or as immunogen to generate polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression Vectors for 161P2F10B Orthologs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMouse and monkey orthologs of 161P2F10B were cloned into pcDNA3.1/MycHis Version A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Protein expression is driven from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The recombinant proteins have the myc epitope and 6×His epitope fused to the carboxyl-terminus. These vectors allow expression of 161P2F10B orthologs to assay cross-reactivity of monoclonal anti-human 161P2F10B antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMouse and monkey orthologs of 161P2F10B were also cloned into pSRα constructs. The pSRα constructs allow for the generation of mammalian cell lines that express 161P2F10B orthologs constitutively. Protein expression is driven from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The recombinant proteins have the myc epitope and 6×His epitope fused to the carboxyl-terminus. These vectors allow expression of 161P2F10B orthologs to assay cross-reactivity of monoclonal anti-human 161P2F10B antibodies and to study functional activity of 161P2F10B orthologs. Amphotropic and ecotropic retroviruses were generated by transfection of pSRα constructs into the 293T-10A1 packaging line or co-transfection of pSRα and a helper plasmid (containing deleted packaging sequences) into the 293 cells, respectively. The retrovirus is used to infect a variety of mammalian cell lines, resulting in the integration of the cloned gene, 161P2F10B ortholog, into the host cell-lines.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nAntigenicity Profiles and Secondary Structure\n\n\n \n \n \nAmino acid profiles of 161P2F10B and 161P2F10B variants were found accessing the ProtScale website on the World Wide Web at on the ExPasy molecular biology server.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese profiles: Hydrophilicity, (Hopp T. P., Woods K. R., 1981. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:3824-3828); Hydropathicity, (Kyte J., Doolittle R. F., 1982. J. Mol. Biol. 157:105-132); Percentage Accessible Residues (Janin J., 1979 Nature 277:491-492); Average Flexibility, (Bhaskaran R., and Ponnuswamy P. K., 1988. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 32:242-255); Beta-turn (Deleage, G., Roux B. 1987 Protein Engineering 1:289-294); and optionally others available in the art, such as on the ProtScale website, were used to identify antigenic regions of each of the 161P2F10B variant proteins. Each of the above amino acid profiles of 161P2F10B variants were generated using the following ProtScale parameters for analysis: 1) A window size of 9; 2) 100% weight of the window edges compared to the window center; and, 3) amino acid profile values normalized to lie between 0 and 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHydrophilicity, Hydropathicity, and Percentage Accessible Residues profiles were used to determine stretches of hydrophilic amino acids (i.e., values greater than 0.5 on the Hydrophilicity and Percentage Accessible Residues profile, and values less than 0.5 on the Hydropathicity profile). Such regions are likely to be exposed to the aqueous environment, be present on the surface of the protein, and thus available for immune recognition, such as by antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAverage Flexibility and Beta-turn profiles determine stretches of amino acids (i.e., values greater than 0.5 on the Beta-turn profile and the Average Flexibility profile) that are not constrained in secondary structures such as beta sheets and alpha helices. Such regions are also more likely to be exposed on the protein and thus accessible to immune recognition, such as by antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigenic sequences of the 161P2F10B variant proteins indicated, e.g., by the profiles described above are used to prepare immunogens, either peptides or nucleic acids that encode them, to generate therapeutic and diagnostic anti-161P2F10B antibodies. The immunogen can be any 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 or more than 50 contiguous amino acids, or the corresponding nucleic acids that encode them, from the 161P2F10B protein variants listed in \nFIG. 1\n of which the amino acid profiles can be inferred because the variant contains sequence that is the same as a variant depicted. In particular, peptide immunogens of the invention can comprise, a peptide region of at least 5 amino acids of \nFIG. 1\n in any whole number increment that includes an amino acid position having a value greater than 0.5 in the Hydrophilicity profile; a peptide region of at least 5 amino acids of \nFIG. 1\n in any whole number increment that includes an amino acid position having a value less than 0.5 in the Hydropathicity profile; a peptide region of at least 5 amino acids of \nFIG. 1\n in any whole number increment that includes an amino acid position having a value greater than 0.5 in the Percent Accessible Residues profiles; a peptide region of at least 5 amino acids of \nFIG. 1\n in any whole number increment that includes an amino acid position having a value greater than 0.5 in the Average Flexibility profiles; and, a peptide region of at least 5 amino acids of \nFIG. 1\n in any whole number increment that includes an amino acid position having a value greater than 0.5 in the Beta-turn profile. Peptide immunogens of the invention can also comprise nucleic acids that encode any of the forgoing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll immunogens of the invention, peptide or nucleic acid, can be embodied in human unit dose form, or comprised by a composition that includes a pharmaceutical excipient compatible with human physiology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe secondary structure of 161P2F10B and 161P2F10B variants, namely the predicted presence and location of alpha helices, extended strands, and random coils, is predicted from the primary amino acid sequence using the HNN—Hierarchical Neural Network method (NPS@: Network Protein Sequence Analysis TIBS 2000 March Vol. 25, No 3 [291]:147-150 Combet C., Blanchet C., Geourjon C. and Deléage G., accessed from the ExPasy molecular biology server located on the World Wide Web. The analysis indicates that \n161P2F10B variant\n 1 is composed of 31.31% alpha helix, 11.31% extended strand, and 57.37% random coil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis for the potential presence of transmembrane domains in the 161P2F10B variant proteins was carried out using a variety of transmembrane prediction algorithms accessed from the ExPasy molecular biology server located on the World Wide Web.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nGeneration of 161P2F10B Polyclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nPolyclonal antibodies can be raised in a mammal, for example, by one or more injections of an immunizing agent and, if desired, an adjuvant. Typically, the immunizing agent and/or adjuvant will be injected in the mammal by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections. In addition to immunizing with a full length 161P2F10B protein variant, computer algorithms are employed in design of immunogens that, based on amino acid sequence analysis contain characteristics of being antigenic and available for recognition by the immune system of the immunized host (see the Example entitled “Antigenicity Profiles and Secondary Structure”). Such regions would be predicted to be hydrophilic, flexible, in beta-turn conformations, and be exposed on the surface of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, recombinant bacterial fusion proteins or peptides containing hydrophilic, flexible, beta-turn regions of 161P2F10B protein variants are used as antigens to generate polyclonal antibodies in New Zealand White rabbits or monoclonal antibodies as described in the Example entitled “Generation of 161P2F10B Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs)”. For example, in \n161P2F10B variant\n 1, such regions include, but are not limited to, amino acids 43-93, 100-134, 211-246, 567-492, 500-517 and amino acids 810-870.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther recombinant bacterial fusion proteins that may be employed include maltose binding protein, LacZ, thioredoxin, NusA, or an immunoglobulin constant region (see the section entitled “Production of 161P2F10B in Prokaryotic Systems” and Current Protocols In Molecular Biology, \nVolume\n 2, \nUnit\n 16, Frederick M. Ausubul et al. eds., 1995; Linsley, P. S., Brady, W., Urnes, M., Grosmaire, L., Damle, N., and Ledbetter, L. (1991) J. Exp. Med. 174, 561-566).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to bacterial derived fusion proteins, mammalian expressed protein antigens are also used. These antigens are expressed from mammalian expression vectors such as the Tag5 and Fc-fusion vectors (see the section entitled “Production of Recombinant 161P2F10B in Eukaryotic Systems”), and retain post-translational modifications such as glycosylations found in native protein. In one embodiment, amino acids 45-875, are cloned into the Tag5 mammalian secretion vector. The recombinant protein was purified by metal chelate chromatography from tissue culture supernatants of 293T cells stably expressing the recombinant vector. The purified Tag5 161P2F10B protein was then used as immunogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring the immunization protocol, it is useful to mix or emulsify the antigen in adjuvants that enhance the immune response of the host animal. Examples of adjuvants include, but are not limited to, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and MPL-TDM adjuvant (monophosphoryl Lipid A, synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a typical protocol, rabbits are initially immunized subcutaneously with up to 200 μg, typically 100-200 μg, of fusion protein or peptide conjugated to KLH mixed in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Rabbits are then injected subcutaneously every two weeks with up to 200 μg, typically 100-200 μg, of the immunogen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). Test bleeds are taken approximately 7-10 days following each immunization and used to monitor the titer of the antiserum by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test reactivity and specificity of immune serum, such as rabbit serum derived from immunization with Tag5 161P2F10B encoding amino acids 58-538, the respective full-length 161P2F10B variant cDNA is cloned into pcDNA 3.1 myc-his expression vector (Invitrogen, see the Example entitled “Production of Recombinant 161P2F10B in Eukaryotic Systems”). After transfection of the constructs into 293T cells, cell lysates are probed with the anti-variant serum and with anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) to determine specific reactivity to denatured variant protein using the Western blot technique. In addition, the immune serum is tested by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation against 293T and other recombinant 161P2F10B variant-expressing cells to determine specific recognition of native protein. Western blot, immunoprecipitation, fluorescent microscopy, and flow cytometric techniques using cells that endogenously express 161P2F10B are also carried out to test reactivity and specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-serum from the Tag5 161P2F10B immunized rabbit is affinity purified by passage over a column of GST protein covalently coupled to AffiGel matrix (BioRad). The antiserum is then affinity purified by passage over a column composed of a MBP-161P2F10B fusion protein covalently coupled to Affigel matrix. The serum is then further purified by protein G affinity chromatography to isolate the IgG fraction. Sera from other His-tagged antigens and peptide immunized rabbits as well as fusion partner depleted sera are affinity purified by passage over a column matrix composed of the original protein immunogen or free peptide.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nGeneration of 161P2F10B Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies (“MAbs”) to 161P2F10B and 161P2F10B variants comprise those that react with epitopes specific for each protein or specific to sequences in common between the variants that would bind, internalize, disrupt or modulate the biological function of 161P2F10B or 161P2F10B variants, for example, those that would disrupt the interaction with ligands, substrates, and binding partners. Immunogens for generation of such MAbs include those designed to encode or contain the extracellular domain or the entire 161P2F10B protein sequence, regions predicted to contain functional motifs, and regions of the 161P2F10B protein variants predicted to be antigenic from computer analysis of the amino acid sequence. Immunogens include peptides and recombinant proteins such as tag5-161P2F10B a mammalian expressed purified His tagged protein. In addition, cells engineered through retroviral transduction to express high levels of \n161P2F10B variant\n 1, such as RAT1-161P2F10B are used to immunize mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo generate MAbs to 161P2F10B, mice are first immunized in the foot pad (FP) with, typically, 5-50 μg of protein immunogen or between 10\n6 \nand 10\n7 \n161P2F10B-expressing cells mixed in a suitable adjuvant. Examples of suitable adjuvants for FP immunizations are TiterMax (Sigma) for the initial FP injection and alum gel for subsequent immunizations. Following an initial injection, mice are immunized twice a week until the time they are sacrificed. Upon sacrifice, lymph nodes are removed and their B-cells are harvested for electro-cell fusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the course of the immunizations test bleeds are taken to monitor the titer and specificity of the immune response. In most cases, once appropriate reactivity and specificity are obtained as determined by ELISA, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometric analyses, fusion and hybridoma generation are then carried out using electrocell fusion (BTX, ECM2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides for monoclonal antibodies designated: Ha16-1(3,5)18, Ha16-1(2,4)4, Ha16-1(3,5)56, Ha16-1(1)11, H16-1.68, H16-1.93, H16-7.8, H169.10, H16-9.44, H16-9.69, Ha16-1(1)23, Ha16-1(3,5)36, H16-1.52, H16-1.67, H16-1.86, H16-7.213, H16-9.33, Ha16-1(3,5)27.1, H16-1.61.1, H16-1(3,5)5, H16-7.200, Ha16-1(3,5)42, H16-9.65, H16-1.29.1.1, H16-3.4, H16-1.92.1.1, Ha16-1(3,5)19, and H16-1.80.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies listed above were shown to react and bind with cell surface 161P2F10B by flow cytometry or immobilized 161P2F10B by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMAbs to 161P2F10B were generated using XenoMouse Technology® wherein the murine heavy and kappa light chain loci have been inactivated and a majority of the human heavy and kappa light chain immunoglobulin loci have been inserted.

Box 1549, Manassas, Va. 20108 on 28 Mar. 2006 and assigned Accession numbers PTA-7452 and PTA-7450 and PTA-7449 and PTA-7451, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA coding sequences for 161P2F10B MAbs Ha16-1(3,5)18, Ha16-1(2,4)4, Ha16-1(3,5)56, Ha16-1(1)11, H16-1.68, H16-1.93, H16-7.8, H16-9.10, H16-9.44, H16-9.69, Ha16-1(1)23, Ha16-1(3,5)36, H16-1.52, H16-1.67, H16-1.86, H16-7.213, H16-9.33, Ha16-1(3,5)27.1, H16-1.61.1, H16-1(3,5)5, H16-7.200, Ha16-1(3,5)42, H16-9.65, H16-1.29.1.1, H16-3.4, H16-1.92.1.1, Ha16-1(3,5)19, and H16-1.80 were determined after isolating mRNA from the respective hybridoma cells with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Gibco BRL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTotal RNA was purified and quantified. First strand cDNAs was generated from total RNA with oligo (dT)12-18 priming using the Gibco BRL Superscript Preamplification system. First strand cDNA was amplified using human immunoglobulin variable heavy chain primers, and human immunoglobulin variable light chain primers. PCR products were cloned into the pCRScript vector (Stratagene). Several clones were sequenced and the variable heavy and light chain regions determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of the variable heavy and light chain regions are listed in \nFIG. 2\n and \nFIG. 3\n. Alignment of 161P2F10B antibodies to germline V-D-J Sequences is set forth in \nFIG. 4A-FIG\n. \n4\nZ and \nFIG. 5A-FIG\n. \n5\nX.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nScreening, Identification, and Characterization of 161P2F10B MAbs\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies generated using the procedures set forth in the example entitled “Generation of 161P2F10B Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs)” were screened, identified, and characterized using a combination of assays including ELISA, FACS, affinity ranking by Surface Plasmon Resonance (BIAcore) (“SPR”), epitope grouping, affinity to recombinant 161P2F10B, and 161P2F10B expressed on the cell surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA. 161P2F10B Human MAb Screening by FACS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary hybridoma screening for MAbs to 161P2F10B is performed by FACS analysis. The protocol is as follows: 50 μl/well of hybridoma supernatant (neat) or purified antibodies (in serial dilutions) are added to 96-well FACS plates and mixed with 161P2F10B-expressing cells (endogenous or recombinant, 50,000 cells/well). The mixture is incubated at 4° C. for two hours. At the end of incubation, the cells are washed with FACS Buffer and incubated with 100 μl of detection antibody (anti-hIgG-PE) for 45 minutes at 4° C. At the end of incubation, the cells are washed with FACS Buffer, fixed with Formaldehyde and analyzed using FACScan. Data are analyzed using CellQuest Pro software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPositive hybridomas identified from primary screens are transferred to 24-well plates and supernatants collected for confirmatory screens. Confirmatory screens included FACS analysis on Caki-161P2F10B/Caki-neo, HepG2 (human liver cancer cell line), KU812 (human promyeolcytic cell line), SKRC-01 (human renal tumor cell line), and ELISA using Tag5-161P2F10B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. 161P2F10B Human MAb Screening by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B MAbs were screened by ELISA to determine antibody isotype. The protocol used is as follows, ELISA plates were coated with Tag5-161P2F10B-ECD or anti-hIgG antibody. Several sets of testing antibodies were added on the plates and incubated for 1 hour. After washing the plates to wash out unbound antibodies, bound antibodies were detected by the following HRP conjugated detection antibodies: anti-hIgG1, anti-hIgG2, anti-hIgK, and anti-hIgL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC. 161P2F10B Human MAb Screening by SPR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSPR allows identification and real time characterization of the kinetics and affinity of protein-protein interactions and therefore is a useful technique in the selection and characterization of MAbs to target antigens of interest. SPR analysis is employed to screen and characterize hybridoma supernatants and purified MAbs to 161P2F10B. Hybridoma screening for MAbs to 161P2F10B by SPR biosensor (BIAcore 3000) are performed as follows: 50 μl/well of hybridoma supernatant (neat) diluted to 1.5-2 μg/ml with the running buffer (HBS-P, 10 ug/ml BSA) are added to 96-well plates (BIAcore) and MAbs (20 μl) are captured on goat-anti-human Fcγ pAbs covalently immobilized on the surface of the CM5 sensor chip. Three (3) MAbs containing hybridoma supernatants are tested per run (cycle) on \n \n \nchannels\n \n \n 2, 3 and 4 of the flow cell, where \nchannel\n 1 is reserved as reference for non-specific binding. Prior to measuring antigen binding to captured MAbs in each individual channel, 60 μl of running buffer is injected over the chip surface at the flowrate of 20 μl/min to serve as reference for drift in captured MAb baseline. Sixty microliters (60 μl) of the purified recombinant 161P2F10B at 150 nM is then injected over the chip surface at the same flowrate of 20 μl/min to measure antigen binding. Each cycle of antigen binding to MAbs are followed by surface regeneration with injection of 100 mM phosphoric acid (for 1 min) to strip the surface of any captured MAb.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData analysis is performed using BiaEvaluation 4.1 and CLAMP software (Myszka and Morton, 1998). After subtracting the references and normalizing the response to the level of captured MAb, data is fit globally using a 1:1 binding model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe affinities are calculated from the association and dissociation rate constants. As is apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, slow dissociation rates generally indicate higher overall affinity for MAbs. The preliminary affinity data and dissociation rates are used as a basis of the selection criteria for therapeutic MAbs to 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nD. Epitope Grouping by FACS\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B antibodies were grouped according to epitope by evaluating their binding pattern on UG-K3 (human renal cancer cell line), or KU812 cells. In brief, a small amount of each of the antibodies was biotinylated; then each of the biotinylated antibodies were incubated with KU812 in the presence of excess (100×) amount of non-biotinylated antibodies at 4° C. for 1 hour. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that during the incubation, an excess amount of antibodies will compete with biotinylated antibodies if they bind to the same epitope. At the end of incubation, cells were washed and incubated with Streptavidin-PE for 45 min at 4° C. After washing off the unbound streptavidin-PE, the cells were analyzed using FACS. MFI values were obtained using CellQuest Pro software and were used for data analysis. As shown in \nFIG. 8\n, twenty-five (25) 161P2F10B MAbs were epitope grouped using UG-K3 cells. Cells are highlighted to indicate self-competition (100% competition), the MFI value in these cells are background control for each biotinylated antibody. Additionally, cells with no color indicate that the two antibodies compete each other (low MFI), cells highlighted in gray (high MFI) indicate that the two antibodies bind to two distinct epitopes. The results show the antibodies that have the same binding pattern bind to the same epitope among the antibodies and that there are 16 epitope groups within the antibodies tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nE. Domain Mapping of 161P2F10B MAbs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to identify regions of the 161P2F10B protein that contain the binding epitope of MAbs several constructs were created encoding portions of the 161P2F10B extracellular domain and used in immunoprecipitation experiments. Tag5 expression constructs encoding either the full extracellular domain (ECD) of 161P2F10B (amino acids 46-875), the somatomedin-b-like domain (amino acids 46-157), the catalytic domain (amino acids 158-558), or the catalytic and nuclease domain (amino acids 158-875) were transfected into 293T cells and cellular lysates were made. These lysates were then used for immunoprecipitation with the indicated 161P2F10B MAbs or control MAb. Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates was then performed using an anti-His polyclonal polyclonal MAb that recognizes the His epitope tag present on each recombinant protein. The specific molecular weight band of each recombinant protein was identified by straight Western blotting of the lysates. The domain containing the binding epitope of each MAb is determined through identification of the pattern of recombinant proteins immunoprecipitated by each MAb. MAbs that bind to the full length ECD and to the somatomedin-b-like domain map to the somatomedin-b-like domain. MAbs that bind to the full length ECD and the catalytic domain, but not the catalytic+nuclease domain, map to the catalytic domain. MAbs that bind the full length ECD and to the catalytic+nuclease domain, but not to the catalytic domain, map to the nuclease domain. Such analysis is presented in \nFIG. 9\n. Such data when combined with SPR competition data is useful in grouping together MAbs that bind to similar or overlapping epitopes as presented in \nFIG. 10\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nF. Affinity Determination by FACS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA panel of 33 human 161P2F10B MAbs were tested for their binding affinity to 161P2F10B on several cell lines (HepG2, KU812, SKRC-01, and RXF393) which express 161P2F10B. Briefly, twenty-three (23) serial 1:2 dilutions of purified antibodies were incubated with 161P2F10B expressing cells (50,000 cells per well) overnight at 4° C. at a final concentration of 167 nM to 0.01 pM. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed and incubated with anti-hIgG-PE detection antibody for 45 min at 4° C. After washing the unbound detection antibodies, the cells were analyzed by FACS. MFI values of each point were obtained using CellQuest Pro software and were used for the affinity calculation using Graphpad Prism software and the one site binding (hyperbola) equation. A summary of affinity values of thirteen (13) antibodies are set forth in Table VI.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG. Affinity Determination by SPR\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPanels of purified anti-human 161P2F10B MAbs were tested for their binding affinity to the purified recombinant 161P2F10B by SPR. Briefly, each purified human MAb is captured onto a CM5 sensor chip surface. On average approximately 150 RUs of each MAb is captured in every cycle. A series of 5-6 dilutions of recombinant 161P2F10B ranging from 1 nM to 100 nM is injected over such surface to generate binding curves (sensograms) that are globally fit to a 1:1 interaction model using CLAMP software (Myszka and Morton, 1998). The affinity of several 161P2F10B MAbs, expressed as K\nD\n, defined by dissociation rate constant and association rate constant using the equation K\nD\n=k\ndiss\n/k\nassoc \nis shown in Table VII. The affinity data and dissociation rates along with the affinity analysis by FACS (See, part F, above) were part of the selection criteria for MAbs to 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nH. Cross Reactivity with Mouse 161P2F10B\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMAbs were screened and characterized for their ability to react with mouse 161P2F10B orthology. This property is useful to understand the consequences of MAb engagement of 161P2F10B on cells and tissues when using mouse animal models. The mouse 161P2F10B gene was cloned then transiently transfected into 293T cells. To test cross-reactivity of 161P2F10B MAbs with mouse 161P2F10B, the antibodies were incubated with 293-T cells expressing murine 161P2F10B or 293T cells expressing the-neo gene only as a negative control and Ku812 cells were used as positive controls for MAb binding to human 161P2F10B. Specific recognition was determined using anti-hIgG-PE secondary detection antibody. A representative histogram depicting species cross-reactivity and binding to human 161P2F10B is presented in \nFIG. 11\n. The results show eight (8) antibodies cross-react with mouse 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nI. Cross Reactivity with Monkey 161P2F10B\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B MAbs are screened and characterized for their ability to react with 161P2F10B of monkey origin. This property is useful to understand the expression of 161P2F10B on tissues from different monkey species for toxicological purposes. The cynomolgous monkey 161P2F10B gene was cloned and sequenced. The homology to human 161P2F10B is 100%. Cross-reactivity of all 161P2F10B MAbs with monkey tissues expressing 161P2F10B is equivalent to that of cells and tissues of human origin expressing 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nAntibody Immune Mediated Cytotoxicity\n\n\n \n \n \nADCC (Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity) is an immune mediated lytic attack on cells bound with an antibody targeted to a specific cell surface antigen. Immune cells recognize the Fc portion of the antibody through binding to Fcã receptors on the surface of leukocytes, monocytes, and NK cells triggering a lytic attack that result in cell death. Briefly, Caki cells engineered to express the target antigen 161P2F10B are incubated in vitro with 51chromium for 1 hr. After washing with fresh medium, the labeled cells are incubated with 2.5 mg/ml human MAbs directed to 16P2F10B and freshly isolated peripheral blood mono nuclear cells at different effector to target cell ratios (E:T Ratio). After 4 hours at 37 C, the cells are gently centrifuged and the supernatant containing 51Cr released from the dead cells is counted in a Beta counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results demonstrate that antibody dependent cell killing increased when the effector to target (E:T) cell ratio was increased. At E:T ratios of 50:1 or greater, HA16-1.80 and HA16-1.93 demonstrated specific killing of Caki-AGS-16 cells while Ha16-9.69, which has a g-2 isotype, showed no activity in the assay. The specificity of the assay was determined by showing that an irrelevant IgG1 Control MAb (H3-1.4) and incubation of target cells and effector cells in the absence of antibody (Cells+PBMCs) did not cause cell killing (See, Table VIII).\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nAntibody Mediated Secondary Killing\n\n\n \n \n \nMAbs to 161P2F10B mediate saporin dependent killing in KU-812 cells. KU-812 cells are a CML cell line that expresses high levels of endogenous 161P2F10B. KU-812 cells (3000 cells/well) were seeded into a 96 well plate on \nday\n 1. The following day an equal volume of medium containing 2× concentration of the indicated primary antibody together with a 2-fold excess of anti-human (Hum-Zap) polyclonal antibody conjugated with saporin toxin (Advanced Targeting Systems, San Diego, Calif.) was added to each well. The cells were allowed to incubate for 5 days at 37 degrees C. At the end of the incubation period, MTS (Promega) was added to each well and incubation continued for an additional 4 hours. The optical density at 450 nM was then determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results in \nFIG. 12\n show that 161P2F10B MAbs HA16-9.69, HA16-1.18 and HA16-1.93 mediated saporin dependent cytotoxicity in KU-812 cells while a control, nonspecific human IgG1 (H3-1.4) and another 161P2F10B MAb (HA16-7.200) had no effect. These results indicate that drugs or cytotoxic proteins can selectively be delivered to KU-812 and other 161P2F10B expressing cells using an appropriate 161P2F10B MAb.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nGeneration of F(Ab′)2 Fragments\n\n\n \n \n \nGeneration of F(Ab′)2 fragments of MAbs is useful to study the effects of MAb molecules that retain their bivalent antigen binding site but lack the immune effector Fc domain in in vitro and in vivo therapeutic models. Generally, the protocol is as follows, 20 mgs of MAb in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 4.5 is incubated with and without immobilized pepsin (Pierce. Rockford Ill.) for the indicated times. Intact MAb and digested Fc fragments are removed by protein A chromatography. The reagent can be used to treat animals bearing 161P2F10B expressing tumors. The anti-tumor activity observed with this antibody fragment can distinguish intrinsic biologic activity from activity mediated by immune dependent mechanisms.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nExpression of Human MAbs Using Recombinant DNA Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nTo express 161P2F10B MAbs recombinantly in transfected cells, 161P2F10B MAb variable heavy and light chain sequences are cloned upstream of the human heavy chain IgG1 and light chain Igκ constant regions respectively. The complete 161P2F10B MAb human heavy chain and light chain cassettes are cloned downstream of the CMV promoter/enhancer in a cloning vector. A polyadenylation site is included downstream of the MAb coding sequence. The recombinant 161P2F10B MAb expressing constructs are transfected into 293T, Cos and CHO cells. The 161P2F10B MAbs secreted from recombinant cells are evaluated for binding to cell surface 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nIn Vivo Assay for 161P2F10B Tumor Growth Promotion\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of the 161P2F10B protein on tumor cell growth is evaluated in vivo by evaluating tumor development and growth of cells expressing or lacking 161P2F10B. For example, SCID mice are injected subcutaneously on each flank with 1×10\n6 \nof kidney cancer cell lines (e.g. UG-K3) containing tkNeo empty vector or 161P2F10B. At least two strategies may be used: (1) Constitutive 161P2F10B expression under regulation of a promoter such as a constitutive promoter obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus (UK 2,211,504 published 5 Jul. 1989), adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), or from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems, and (2) Regulated expression under control of an inducible vector system, such as ecdysone, tetracycline, etc., provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems. Tumor volume is then monitored by caliper measurement at the appearance of palpable tumors and followed over time to determine if 161P2F10B-expressing cells grow at a faster rate and whether tumors produced by 161P2F10B-expressing cells demonstrate characteristics of altered aggressiveness (e.g. enhanced metastasis, vascularization, reduced responsiveness to chemotherapeutic drugs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, mice can be implanted with 1×10\n5 \nof the same cells orthotopically to determine if 161P2F10B has an effect on local growth in the kidney, and whether 161P2F10B affects the ability of the cells to metastasize (Miki T et al, Oncol Res. 2001; 12:209; Fu X et al, Int J Cancer. 1991, 49:938). The effect of 161P2F10B on tumor formation and growth may be assessed by injecting kidney or liver tumor cells intratibially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay is also useful to determine the 161P2F10B inhibitory effect of candidate therapeutic compositions, such as for example, 161P2F10B intrabodies, 161P2F10B antisense molecules and ribozymes.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\n161P2F10B Monoclonal Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tumors In Vivo\n\n\n \n \n \nThe significant expression of 161P2F10B on the cell surface of tumor tissues, together with its restrictive expression in normal tissues makes 161P2F10B a good target for antibody therapy. Similarly, 161P2F10B is a target for T cell-based immunotherapy. Thus, the therapeutic efficacy of 161P2F10B MAbs in human kidney cancer xenograft mouse models and human liver cancer xenograft mouse models is evaluated by using cell lines such as RXF-393 and HepG2, as well as human renal clear cell xenograft models such as UG-K3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody efficacy on tumor growth and metastasis formation is studied, e.g., in a mouse orthotopic kidney or liver cancer xenograft models. The antibodies can be unconjugated, as discussed in this Example, or can be conjugated to a therapeutic modality, as appreciated in the art. 161P2F10B MAbs inhibit formation of both renal and hepatic cancer xenografts. 161P2F10B MAbs also retard the growth of established orthotopic tumors and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice. These results indicate the utility of 161P2F10B MAbs in the treatment of local and advanced stages of kidney and liver cancer and those cancers set forth in Table I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the 161P2F10B MAbs led to retardation of established orthotopic tumor growth and inhibition of metastasis to distant sites, resulting in a significant prolongation in the survival of tumor-bearing mice. These studies indicate that 161P2F10B is an attractive target for immunotherapy and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of 161P2F10B MAbs for the treatment of local and metastatic kidney and liver cancer. This example demonstrates that unconjugated 161P2F10B MAbs are effective to inhibit the growth of human kidney tumor xenografts grown in SCID mice; accordingly a combination of such efficacious MAbs is also effective.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor Inhibition Using Multiple 161P2F10B MAbs Materials and Methods 161P2F10B Monoclonal Antibodies:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies were raised against 161P2F10B as described in the Example entitled “Generation of 161P2F10B Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs).” The MAbs are characterized by ELISA, Western blot, FACS, and immunoprecipitation for their capacity to bind 161P2F10B. Epitope mapping data for the 161P2F10B MAbs, as determined by ELISA and Western analysis, recognize epitopes on the 161P2F10B protein. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal and cancer tissues and cells with these antibodies is performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe MAbs are purified from ascites or hybridoma tissue culture supernatants by Protein-G or Protein-A Sepharose chromatography, dialyzed against PBS, filter sterilized, and stored at −20° C. Protein determinations are performed by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.). A therapeutic MAb or a cocktail comprising a mixture of individual MAbs is prepared and used for the treatment of mice receiving subcutaneous or orthotopic injections of UG-K3 and RXF-393 tumor xenografts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell Lines and Xenografts\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kidney cancer cell line RXF-393 and SKRC01 as well as the liver cancer cell line HepG2 (American Type Culture Collection) are maintained in RPMI and DMEM respectively, supplemented with L-glutamine and 10% FBS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe UG-K3 xenograft is passaged in 6- to 8-week-old male ICR-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Taconic Farms) by s.c. trocar implant (Craft, N., et al., Nat. Med. 1999, 5:280). Single-cell suspensions of UG-K3 tumor cells are prepared as described in Craft, et al. Other cell lines are used as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nXenograft Mouse Models.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubcutaneous (s.c.) tumors are generated by injection of 1×106 cancer cells mixed at a 1:1 dilution with Matrigel (Collaborative Research) in the right flank of male SCID mice. To test antibody efficacy on tumor formation, i.e. antibody injections are started on the same day as tumor-cell injections. As a control, mice are injected with either purified mouse IgG (ICN) or PBS; or a purified MAb that recognizes an irrelevant antigen not expressed in human cells. In preliminary studies, no difference is found between mouse IgG or PBS on tumor growth. Tumor sizes are determined by caliper measurements, and the tumor volume is calculated as length×width×height. Mice with subcutaneous tumors greater than 1.5 cm in diameter are sacrificed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrthotopic injections are performed under anesthesia by using ketamine/xylazine. For kidney orthotopic studies, an incision is made through the abdomen to expose the kidney and UG-K3 or RXF-393 tumor cells (2×10\n6\n) mixed with Matrigel are injected into the kidney capsule in a 10-μl volume. To monitor tumor growth, mice are palpated. The mice are segregated into groups for the appropriate treatments, with 161P2F10B or control MAbs being injected i.p.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B MAbs Inhibit Growth of 161P2F10B-Expressing Xenograft Tumors\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of 161P2F10B MAbs on tumor formation is tested by using UG-K3 and RXF-393 orthotopic models. As compared with the s.c. tumor model, the orthotopic model, which requires injection of tumor cells directly in the mouse kidney, results in a local tumor growth, development of metastasis in distal sites, deterioration of mouse health, and subsequent death. These features make the orthotopic model more representative of human disease progression and allowed us to follow the therapeutic effect of MAbs on clinically relevant end points.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, tumor cells are injected into the mouse kidney, and 2 days later, the mice are segregated into two groups and treated with either: a) 250-1000 μg, of 161P2F10B MAb, or b) control antibody three times per week for two to five weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA major advantage of the orthotopic cancer models is the ability to study the development of metastases. Formation of metastasis in mice bearing established orthotopic tumors is studies by IHC analysis on tissue sections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother advantage of xenograft cancer models is the ability to study neovascularization and angiogenesis. Tumor growth is partly dependent on new blood vessel development. Although the capillary system and developing blood network is of host origin, the initiation and architecture of the neovasculature is regulated by the xenograft tumor (Davidoff et al., Clin Cancer Res. (2001) 7:2870; Solesvik et al., Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. (1984) 20:1295). The effect of antibody and small molecule on neovascularization is studied in accordance with procedures known in the art, such as by IHC analysis of tumor tissues and their surrounding microenvironment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice bearing established orthotopic tumors are administered injections of either 161P2F10B MAb or control antibody over a 4-week period. Mice in both groups are allowed to establish a high tumor burden, to ensure a high frequency of metastasis formation in mouse lungs. Mice then are killed and their bladders, livers, bone and lungs are analyzed for the presence of tumor cells by IHC analysis. These studies demonstrate a broad anti-tumor efficacy of anti-161P2F10B antibodies on initiation and progression of kidney cancer in xenograft mouse models. Anti-161P2F10B antibodies inhibit tumor formation of tumors as well as retarding the growth of already established tumors and prolong the survival of treated mice. Moreover, 161P2F10B MAbs demonstrate a dramatic inhibitory effect on the spread of local kidney tumor to distal sites, even in the presence of a large tumor burden. Thus, 161P2F10B MAbs are efficacious on major clinically relevant end points (tumor growth), prolongation of survival, and health.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffect of 161P2F10B MAbs on the Growth of Human Renal Cell Carcinoma in Mice\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following protocol was used. Patient-derived clear cell renal cancer UG-K3 cells (2.0×10\n6 \ncells) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice. The mice were randomized into groups (n=10 in each group) and treatment initiated intraperitoneally (i.p.) on \nday\n 0 with treatment MAbs or isotype MAb control as indicated. Animals were treated twice weekly for a total of 8 doses at 750 μg/dose until \nstudy day\n 27. Tumor growth was monitored using caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days as indicated. The results show 161P2F10B MAbs H16-1.29.1.1, Ha16-1(3,5)27.1, H16-9.69 and Ha16-1(1)11 statistically and significantly inhibited the growth of human renal cancer xenograft UG-K3 implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice (p<0.05).

The mice were randomized into groups (n=10 mice in each group) and treatment initiated intraperitoneally (i.p.) on \nDay\n 0 with treatment MAbs or isotype MAb control as indicated. Animals were treated twice weekly for a total of 6 doses until \nstudy day\n 20. Tumor growth was monitored using caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days as indicated. The results show 161P2F10B MAbs Ha16-11(3,5)27 and Ha16-1(3,5)18 statistically and significantly inhibited the growth of human renal cancer xenograft UG-K3 implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice (P<0.05). (\nFIG. 14\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another experiment, human renal cancer RXF-393 tumor cells (2.0×10\n6 \ncells) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice. The mice were randomized into groups (n=10 in each group) and treatment initiated intraperitoneally (i.p.) on \nday\n 0 with treatment MAbs or isotype MAb control as indicated. Animals were treated twice weekly for a total of 7 doses at 400 μg/dose until \nstudy day\n 22. Tumor growth was monitored using caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days as indicated. The results show 161P2F10B MAbs Ha16-1(3,5)18 (P<0.01), H16-1.68 (P<0.05) and H16-9.44 (P<0.05) statistically and significantly inhibited the growth of human renal cancer xenograft RXF-393 implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice. (\nFIG. 15\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another experiment, human renal cancer SKRC-01 tumor cells (2.5×10\n6 \ncells) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice. The mice were randomized into groups (n=10 in each group) and treatment initiated intraperitoneally (i.p.) on \nday\n 0 with treatment MAbs or isotype MAb control as indicated. Animals were treated twice weekly for a total of 7 doses at 250 μg/dose until \nstudy day\n 22. Tumor growth was monitored using caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days as indicated. The results show 161P2F10B MAbs H16-1.68 (P<0.05), H16-7.8 (P<0.05), H16-9.44 (P<0.05) and H16-3.4 (P<0.01) statistically and significantly inhibited the growth of human renal cancer xenograft SKRC-01 implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice. (\nFIG. 16\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another experiment, human renal cancer UG-K3 tumor cells (2.0×10\n6 \ncells) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice. The mice were randomized into groups (n=10 in each group) and treatment initiated intraperitoneally (i.p.) on \nday\n 0 with treatment MAbs or isotype MAb control as indicated. Animals were treated twice weekly for a total of 6 doses at 750 μg/dose until \nstudy day\n 19. Tumor growth was monitored using caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days as indicated. The results show 161P2F10B MAbs H16-1.29.1.1 (P<0.05), Ha16-1(3,5)56 (P<0.01) and Ha16-1(2,4)4 (P<0.05) statistically and significantly inhibited the growth of human renal cancer xenograft UG-K3 implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice. (\nFIG. 17\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another experiment, human renal cancer UG-K3 tumor cells (2.0×10\n6 \ncells) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice. The mice were randomized into groups (n=10 in each group) and treatment initiated intraperitoneally (i.p.) on \nday\n 0 with treatment MAbs or isotype MAb control as indicated. Animals were treated twice weekly for a total of 7 doses at 500 μg/dose until \nstudy day\n 22. Tumor growth was monitored using caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days as indicated. The results show 161P2F10B MAbs H16-1.93 and Ha16-1(3,5)18 statistically and significantly inhibited the growth of human renal cancer xenograft UG-K3 implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice (P<0.05). (\nFIG. 18\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffect of a Cocktail of 161P2F10B MAbs on the Growth of Human Renal Cancer in Mice\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this experiment, human renal cancer UG-K3 tumor cells (2.0×10\n6 \ncells) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice. The mice were randomized into groups (n=10 in each group) and treatment initiated intraperitoneally (i.p.) on \nday\n 0 as indicated. For 161P2F10B MAb treatment, three MAbs at 200 μg each were pooled together at each dosing. Animals were treated twice weekly for a total of 7 doses until \nstudy day\n 27. Tumor growth was monitored using caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days as indicated. The results show that combination treatment with a cocktail of 161P2F10B MAbs statistically and significantly inhibited the growth of human renal cancer xenograft UG-K3 implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice (P<0.05). (\nFIG. 19\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffect of a Combination treatment of 161P2F10B MAbs and Avastin® (Bevacizumab) on the Growth of Human Renal Cancer Xenografts in Mice\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this experiment, human renal cancer UG-K3 tumor cells (2.0×10\n6 \ncells) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice. The mice were randomized into groups (n=10 mice in each group) and treatment initiated intraperitoneally (i.p.) on \nDay\n 0 with treatment MAbs, Avastin, or isotype MAb control as indicated. Animals were treated twice weekly for a total of 6 doses until \nstudy day\n 18. Tumor growth was monitored using caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days as indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results show 161P2F10B MAbs H16-1.93 and Ha16-1(3, 5)18.1, when combined with Avastin® (bevacizumab), statistically and significantly inhibited the growth of human renal cancer xenograft UG-K3 implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice (p<0.01). (\nFIG. 20\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of these experiments show that 161P2F10B MAbs can be used for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes to treat and manage cancers set forth in Table I.\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nTherapeutic and Diagnostic use of Anti-161P2F10B Antibodies in Humans\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-161P2F10B monoclonal antibodies are safely and effectively used for diagnostic, prophylactic, prognostic and/or therapeutic purposes in humans. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis of cancer tissues and cancer xenografts with anti-161P2F10B MAb show strong extensive staining in carcinoma but significantly lower or undetectable levels in normal tissues. Detection of 161P2F10B in carcinoma and in metastatic disease demonstrates the usefulness of the MAb as a diagnostic and/or prognostic indicator. Anti-161P2F10B antibodies are therefore used in diagnostic applications such as immunohistochemistry of kidney biopsy specimens to detect cancer from suspect patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs determined by flow cytometry, anti-161P2F10B MAb specifically binds to carcinoma cells. Thus, anti-161P2F10B antibodies are used in diagnostic whole body imaging applications, such as radioimmunoscintigraphy and radioimmunotherapy, (see, e.g., Potamianos S., et. al. Anticancer Res 20(2A):925-948 (2000)) for the detection of localized and metastatic cancers that exhibit expression of 161P2F10B. Shedding or release of an extracellular domain of 161P2F10B into the extracellular milieu, such as that seen for alkaline phosphodiesterase B10 (Meerson, N. R., Hepatology 27:563-568 (1998)), allows diagnostic detection of 161P2F10B by anti-161P2F10B antibodies in serum and/or urine samples from suspect patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-161P2F10B antibodies that specifically bind 161P2F10B are used in therapeutic applications for the treatment of cancers that express 161P2F10B. Anti-161P2F10B antibodies are used as an unconjugated modality and as conjugated form in which the antibodies are attached to one of various therapeutic or imaging modalities well known in the art, such as a prodrugs, enzymes or radioisotopes. In preclinical studies, unconjugated and conjugated anti-161P2F10B antibodies are tested for efficacy of tumor prevention and growth inhibition in the SCID mouse cancer xenograft models, e.g., kidney cancer models, (see, e.g., the Example entitled “161P2F10B Monoclonal Antibody-mediated Inhibition of Tumors In Vivo”). Either conjugated and unconjugated anti-161P2F10B antibodies are used as a therapeutic modality in human clinical trials either alone or in combination with other treatments as described in following Examples.\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nHuman Clinical Trials for the Treatment and Diagnosis of Human Carcinomas through use of 161P2F10B MAbs\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies are used in accordance with the present invention which recognize an epitope on 161P2F10B, and are used in the treatment of certain tumors, preferably those listed in Table I. In connection with each of these indications, three clinical approaches are successfully pursued.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nI.) Adjunctive Therapy:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn adjunctive therapy, patients are treated with 161P2F10B MAbs (either naked or conjugated to an agent) in combination with a chemotherapeutic or anti-neoplastic agent and/or radiation therapy or a combination thereof. Primary cancer targets, such as those listed in Table I, are treated under standard protocols by the addition of 161P2F10B MAbs to standard first and second line therapy. Protocol designs address effectiveness as assessed by the following examples, including but not limited to, reduction in tumor mass of primary or metastatic lesions, increased progression free survival, overall survival, improvement of patients health, disease stabilization, as well as the ability to reduce usual doses of standard chemotherapy and other biologic agents. These dosage reductions allow additional and/or prolonged therapy by reducing dose-related toxicity of the chemotherapeutic or biologic agent. 161P2F10B MAbs are utilized in several adjunctive clinical trials in combination with the chemotherapeutic or anti-neoplastic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nII.) Monotherapy:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with the use of the 161P2F10B MAbs (either naked or conjugated) in monotherapy of tumors, the antibodies are administered to patients without a chemotherapeutic or anti-neoplastic agent. In one embodiment, monotherapy is conducted clinically in end-stage cancer patients with extensive metastatic disease. Protocol designs address effectiveness as assessed by the following examples, including but not limited to, reduction in tumor mass of primary or metastatic lesions, increased progression free survival, overall survival, improvement of patients health, disease stabilization, as well as the ability to reduce usual doses of standard chemotherapy and other biologic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIII.) Imaging Agent:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThrough binding a radionuclide (e.g., iodine or yttrium (I\n131\n, Y\n90\n) to 161P2F10B MAbs, the radiolabeled antibodies are utilized as a diagnostic and/or imaging agent. In such a role, the labeled antibodies localize to both solid tumors, as well as, metastatic lesions of cells expressing 161P2F10B. In connection with the use of the 161P2F10B MAbs as imaging agents, the antibodies are used as an adjunct to surgical treatment of solid tumors, as both a pre-surgical screen as well as a post-operative follow-up to determine what tumor remains and/or returns. In one embodiment, a (\n111\nIn)-161P2F10B antibody is used as an imaging agent in a Phase I human clinical trial in patients having a carcinoma that expresses 161P2F10B (by analogy see, e.g., Divgi et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 83:97-104 (1991)). Patients are followed with standard anterior and posterior gamma camera. The results indicate that primary lesions and metastatic lesions are identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response. For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the antibody and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary, non limiting range for a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody administered in combination according to the invention is at least 1 mg/kg, at least 5 mg/kg, at least 10 mg/kg, more than 10 mg/kg, or at least 15 mg/kg, for example 1-21 mg/kg, or for example 5-21 mg/kg, or for example 5-18 mg/kg, or for example 10-18 mg/kg, or for example 15 mg/kg. The high dose embodiment of the invention relates to a dosage of more than 10 mg/kg. It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated, and may include single or multiple doses. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClinical Development Plan (CDP)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP follows and develops treatments of 161P2F10B MAbs in connection with adjunctive therapy, monotherapy, and/or as an imaging agent. Trials initially demonstrate safety and thereafter confirm efficacy in repeat doses. Trials are open label comparing standard chemotherapy with standard therapy plus 161P2F10B MAbs. As will be appreciated, one non-limiting criteria that can be utilized in connection with enrollment of patients is 161P2F10B expression levels in their tumors as determined by biopsy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with any protein or antibody infusion-based therapeutic, safety concerns are related primarily to (i) cytokine release syndrome, i.e., hypotension, fever, shaking, chills; (ii) the development of an immunogenic response to the material (i.e., development of human antibodies by the patient to the antibody therapeutic, or HAHA response); and, (iii) toxicity to normal cells that express 161P2F10B. Standard tests and follow-up are utilized to monitor each of these safety concerns. 161P2F10B MAbs are found to be safe upon human administration.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\n161P2F10B Functional Studies\n\n\n \n \n \nA. RNA Interference (RNAi)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNAi is a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) which induces specific mRNA degradation leading to changes in protein expression and subsequently in gene function. The RNAi technology has been used successfully in mammalian cells to silence the intended genes. In mammalian cells, these dsRNAs (called short interfering RNA or siRNA) activate the RNAi pathway, leading to the degradation of target sequence specific mRNAs. See, Elbashir S. M., et al., \nDuplexes of \n21-\nnucleotide RNAs Mediate RNA interference in Cultured Mammalian Cells, Nature \n411(6836):494-8 (2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, RNAi was used to investigate the function of the 161P2F10B antigen. To generate specific siRNAs for 161P2F10B, algorithms were used to predict oligonucleotides that exhibit the critical molecular parameters (G:C content, melting temperature, etc.) and have the ability to significantly reduce the expression levels of the 161P2F10B protein when introduced into cells. In accordance with this Example, 161P2F10B siRNA compositions used correspond to the nucleic acid ORF, 5′ or 3′ untranslated sequences of the 161P2F10B protein or subsequences thereof. Thus, siRNA subsequences used in this manner are generally 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 or more than 35 contiguous RNA nucleotides in length. These siRNA sequences are complementary and non-complementary to at least a portion of the mRNA coding or non-coding sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the subsequences are 19-25 nucleotides in length, most preferably 21-23 nucleotides in length. In preferred embodiments, these siRNA achieve a substantial knockdown of 161P2F10B antigen in cells expressing the protein and have the potential of reversing a phenotype found in a particular disease by mimicking the inhibition of the 161P2F10B target. Therefore, correlating gene knockdown with functional cellular phenotype is critical to draw valid conclusions and rule out toxicity or other non specific effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo validate our approach, the level of 161P2F10B silencing upon RNAi transfection was assessed in HepG2 liver cancer cells both by cell surface staining using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) and by Western blotting (WB). The following samples were prepared: LF2k (cells treated with the transfection reagent LF2k only), control siRNA duplex CT1 and 161P2F10B specific duplex Qa (the sequences are disclosed below). Mammalian siRNA transfections: The day before siRNA transfection, cell lines were plated in media (RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS w/o antibiotics) at 2×10\n3 \ncells/well in 80 μl (96 well plate format). In parallel with the 161P2F10B specific siRNA oligo, the following sequences were included in every experiment as controls: a) Mock transfected cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and annealing buffer (LF2k); b) CT1 non-specific siRNA (targeted sequence: 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′) (SEQ ID NO: 166); c) Eg5 specific siRNA (targeted sequence: 5′-AACTGAAGACCTGAAGACAATAA-3′) (SEQ ID NO: 167) and 161P2F10B specific siRNA Qa (targeted \nsequence\n 5′-AACCTCATGGCTGGAAGAAAA-3′) (SEQ ID NO: 168). The siRNAs were used at the indicated concentrations and 1 μg/ml Lipofectamine 2000 final concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe procedure was as follows: The siRNAs were first diluted in OPTIMEM (serum-free transfection media, Invitrogen) at 0.1 μM (10-fold concentrated) and incubated 5-10 min RT. Lipofectamine 2000 was diluted at 10 μg/ml (10-fold concentrated) for the total number transfections and incubated 5-10 minutes at room temperature (RT). Appropriate amounts of diluted 10-fold concentrated Lipofectamine 2000 were mixed 1:1 with diluted 10-fold concentrated siRNA and incubated at RT for 20-30″ (5-fold concentrated transfection solution). Twenty (20) μl of the 5-fold concentrated transfection solutions were added to the respective samples and incubated at 37° C. for 96 hours before analysis. In every case, the cells were incubated for 72 h prior to the analysis by FACS with the 161P2F10B specific PE-labelled MAb 97A6 (Beckman-Coulter) or by WB. The 161P2F10B siRNA duplex Qa efficiently down-regulated the targeted gene as detected both by FACS and by WB (\nFIG. 21\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the invention is a method to analyze the role of 161P2F10B in cell proliferation. Loss of cell proliferation control is a hallmark of cancerous cells; therefore, the role of specific 161P2F10B protein silencing in cell proliferation assays was addressed. Incorporation of the labeled precursor (i.e. \n3\nH-Thymidine) into DNA is directly proportional to the amount of cell divisions occurring in the culture. HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations (ranging from 200 nM to 20 pM) of control siRNA duplexes (negative control CT1 and positive control Eg5) as well as the 161P2F10B siRNA duplex Qa, and their impact on cell proliferation was assessed by the \n3\nH-Thymidime incorporation assay. The data shown in \nFIG. 22A\n indicate that the cell surface levels of 161P2F10B (\nFIG. 21\n) correlate with cell proliferation, since reduction of the 161P2F10B protein levels corresponded to an impact on the ability of the cells to synthesize DNA under these conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother method used to measure cell proliferation is the clonogenic/colony forming assay. In this assay, a defined number of cells are plated onto the appropriate matrix and the number and size of the colonies formed after a period of growth following siRNA treatment is assessed. 161P2F10B positive HepG2 cells or 161P2F10B negative UMUC3 cells were treated with LF2k of the following siRNA duplexes: CT1, Eg5 and 161P2F10B Qa. As shown in \nFIG. 22B\n, the 161P2F10B Qa duplex reduced both the number and the size of the colonies formed only in the endogenously 161P2F10B expressing cells and had no effect in the UMUC3 negative cells, correlating with the effect on cell proliferation previously observed. Overall, the data indicate that cell proliferation and growth, which are key hallmarks of the cancer phenotype, are regulated by expression of the 161P2F10B in cancer cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell migration plays a central role in a wide variety of biological phenomena. In the adult organism, cell migration remains prominent in both normal physiological and pathological conditions. In metastasis, tumor cells migrate from the initial tumor mass to localize in other areas of the body. Cell migration is evaluated by several different methods, of which, the most widely accepted is the Boyden chamber assay. This assay uses a hollow plastic transwell chamber with a porous membrane (membranes can be coated with an extra cellular matrix if necessary). This chamber is suspended over a larger well which may contain media plus chemoattractants. Cells are placed inside the chamber and allowed to migrate through the pores to the other side of the membrane; migratory cells are then stained and counted. The potential role of 161P2F10B in regulating cell migration was addressed. The selected 161P2F10B Qa duplex was tested in two cell lines endogenously expressing 161P2F10B (HepG2 and A-704) in the Boyden chamber migration assay. As shown in \nFIG. 23\n, 161P2F10B silencing with oligo Qa significantly reduced the level of cell migration on collagen I coated inserts relative to control oligo CT1 in both A-704 (renal clear cell cancer) and HepG2 (liver cancer) systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further support the role of 161P2F10B in cell migration, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying this phenotype. One of the major signal transduction networks driving cell motility is the Rho/Rac/Cdc42 pathway. Rho is a member of a family of small GTPases that regulates cell morphology and motility via actin cytoskeleton reorganization in response to extracellular signals. Active Rho increases the stability of actin-based structures such as stress fibers and focal adhesions. Deregulation of Rho activity has been linked to changes both in cell proliferation and cell motility by reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton and gene expression control. We assessed whether 161P2F10B expression regulates Rho activity by using the Rhotekin pull down assay which uses the Rhotekin protein that specifically binds to and precipitates active GTP-Rho, but not inactive GDP-Rho from cell lysates. \nFIG. 23B\n shows that 161P2F10B silencing significantly reduces the cell surface expression of 161P2F10B on HepG2 cells and concomitantly reduces the Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)-induced Rho B activation (Rho B-GTP). Together, the results in \nFIG. 23\n indicate that 161P2F10B plays a role in cancer cell migration through activation of the Rho-family GTPases (Rho B), and is critical for the metastasis of 161P2F10B-expressing cancer cells during tumorigenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the 161P2F10B gene, RNAi studies facilitate the understanding of the contribution of the gene product in cancer pathways. Such active RNAi molecules have use in identifying assays to screen for MAbs that are active anti-tumor therapeutics. Further, siRNA are administered as therapeutics to cancer patients for reducing the malignant growth of several cancer types, including those listed in Table 1. When 161P2F10B plays a role in cell survival, cell proliferation, tumor genesis, or apoptosis, it is used as a target for diagnostic, prognostic, preventative and/or therapeutic purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. 161P2F10B-Modulated ATP-Induced Ca2+ Mobilization Assay in 161P2F10B-expressing cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n161P2F10B is a cell surface pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (PDE) capable of hydrolyzing the purine nucleotide ATP. Mutation of the PDE catalytic domain at \namino acid\n 205 from threonine to alanine (T205A) eliminates the PDE activity of 161P2F10B (\nFIG. 24\n). In addition to ATP, other purine based analogs are known to be substrates for the enzymatic activity of 161P2F10B. ATP present in the extracellular milieu modulates a variety of biological responses, some of which are mediated through binding and activation of P2Y G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) that induce signal transduction through Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and through P2X ligand gated Ca2+ channels that modulate Ca2+ flux from extracellular sources (See, McLamon, J. G. (2005) J. NeuroSci. Res. 81:349-356). Therefore the effect of ATP on calcium mobilization in cells expressing 161P2F10B was investigated. Over-expression of 161P2F10B in the Caki cell line results in noticeable differences in cytoplasmic calcium mobilization in response to treatment with purine nucleotides and purine nucleotide analogs. We employed single cell imaging to record the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization of Caki-1 cells expressing either wild type 161P2F10B (wt), 161P2F10B T205A mutant devoid of PDE activity, or control cells expressing only the neomycin resistance gene (neo) in response to the purine ligands ATP, ATPγ-S (non-hydrolysable ATP analog), AMP, and adenosine. The results are presented in \nFIG. 25\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experiments were performed as follows: Caki-1-neo, or Caki-1-161P2F10B, or Caki-1-161P2F10B T205A mutant cells were plated overnight onto chambered coverslips precoated with collagen; cells were washed in serum-free media and loaded with fura-2 dye (3 uM in serum free media) for 30 minutes at 37° C. followed by wash and additional 30 minute incubation in serum free media at 37° C. Then media was replaced with Ringers' solution (20 mM HEPES, pH7.4, 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 3 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose) and cells were analyzed by ratiometric imaging of intracellular Ca2+[Ca2+]i on an inverted microscope (Nikon 2000TS) equipped with a 20× objective, 340/380 nm excitation filters fitted to LAMBDA-10B filter wheel (Sutter), a dichroic (beam splitter) filter and emission filter (CHROMA) fitted to a filter cube for FURA-2 measurements. Ratio images were obtained by acquiring pair of images at alternate wavelengths (340/380 nm) using an ORCA-ER Hamamatsu CCD camera under the control of MetaFluor 6.2 imaging software (Molecular Devices Corp.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll studied compounds were prepared as 400 uM stock in Ringer's solution and added to a final concentration of 100 μM into a chamber with cells. While ATP elicited a robust Ca2+ mobilization response in all three cell lines, the kinetics and pattern of this response was noticeably different between them: both Neo and the enzymatic “dead” mutant of 161P2F10B demonstrated calcium oscillations with high amplitude and frequency, while the wild-type 161P2F10B (wt) expressing cells exhibited an initial Ca2+ flux that gradually decayed over time with minimal oscillatory waves of lower frequency and longer duration. The non-hydrolysable analog of ATP, ATPγS, induced similar “wave-like” oscillatory responses in all three cell lines. Taken together these data suggest that the pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase enzymatic activity of 161P2F10B mediates the suppression of Ca2+ oscillations in Caki-1 cells expressing 161P2F10B through depletion of ATP in the extracellular medium by cleavage into AMP and pyrophosphate. In addition, adenosine and adenosine monophosphate (AMP), potential metabolites of ATP, did not elicit calcium response in any of the cell lines suggesting that the response is mediated through the ATP activated P2Y family of GPCRs and not through receptors activated by adenosine or AMP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Ca2+ mobilization assay and monitoring of intracellular signaling pathways activated by P2Y receptors enables the screening of compounds, drugs, antibodies, and proteins that would modulate the PDE activity of 161P2F10B leading to suppression or alteration of ATP and other purine nucleotide responses in 161P2F10B-expressing cells and tissues. The significance of calcium oscillations in the 161P2F10B mutant or Neo cells versus that of the smooth sustained response in wild-type 16P2F10B is that a normal resolved calcium response correlates with an increased proliferative capacity of cells (See, Schreiber, R., 2005, J. Membrane Biol. 205:129-137). Calcium mobilization leads to activation of calmodulin and CamKII cell proliferation components, which induces the stimulation of the Ras-Raf axis of the cell growth pathway (See, Agell, N., Bachs, O., Rocamora, N., and Villalonga, P., 2002, Cellular Signaling 14:649-654). Thus, calcium is a critical element in the stimulation of the cell growth program. ATP-mediated activation of P2Y receptors leads to phospholipase C activation and downstream signal transduction events (See, Communi, D., et. al., 2000, Cellular Signaling 12: 351-360). Extracellular ATP plays a role in providing energy to extracellular ATP-dependent enzymes and transporters, is a DNA building block, and also stimulates cells to proliferate. Additionally, the PDE activity of 161P2F10B may supply tumor cells with metabolites from ATP (ADP, AMP, Adenosine, inorganic phosphate) and other purine nucleotides which are critical nutrients for tumor cell growth. Together, the results indicate that 161P2F10B provides a regulatory function for extracellular ATP that impacts the growth and survival of tumor cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC. Enhanced Angiogenesis (Tube Formation) of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells by Recombinant Extracellular Domain (ECD) of 161P2F10B and Modulation by MAb.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAngiogenesis is a critical event in the maintenance of tumors for their growth, nutrition and oxygenation. Growth and migration of endothelial cells is a hallmark of angiogenesis, and the stimulation of such cells requires multiple serum growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). To address whether 161P2F10B facilitates angiogenesis of primary endothelium, an assay was established to detect the effect of the extracellular domain (ECD) (amino acids 46-875) of 161P2F10B on the formation of endothelial networks (tubes) when plated on Matrigel®. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) or human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) were grown in 10% FBS in media to 70% confluency (passage 2-passage 6). Cells were detached in 1:1 trypsin:PBS or 10 mM EDTA, washed and resuspended in EBM-0.1% FBS. Recombinant 161P2F10B ECD (described in Example entitled “Production of Recombinant 161P2F10B in Eukaryotic Systems”) was added to the cells and then incubated on a 200 ul layer of Matrigel® for 8-16 hours at 37° C. Tube formation was quantitated by microscopy and data captured by photography. \nFIG. 26\n shows that the 161P2F10B ECD induced the formation of endothelial tubes similarly as generated by treatment with 10% FBS, although fewer closed networks were observed using the 161P2F10B ECD, while control ECD did not generate tubes above the 0.1% FBS control. \nFIG. 27\n shows that mutation of either the catalytic domain of 161P2F10B (T205A) which inactivates the PDE enzymatic activity 161P2F10B or the putative integrin binding RGD sequence (D80E) resulted in reduced tube formation. These data indicate that the PDE activity of 161P2F10B is required for the observed tube formation of HUVEC. Together these results indicate that the 161P2F10B protein is involved in promoting angiogenesis through its PDE activity that facilitates tumor growth, tumor cell invasion and/or activation of endothelium for tumor vascularization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nD. Enhanced Migration of Endothelial Cells by Recombinant Extracellular Domain (ECD) of 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced migration is a hallmark of both angiogenesis and the cancer cell phenotype. To address the effect of the 161P2F10B protein on the migration of normal endothelial cells, HUVEC were treated with the 161P2F10B ECD and assayed in serum free conditions (0.1% BSA). The cells were grown overnight in 0.5% FBS, washed and then compared to cells treated with VEGF, 10% FBS or 161P2F10B ECD. The cells were evaluated for migration in transwells by the Boyden chamber assay. The results in \nFIG. 29\n indicate that HUVEC cell migration was increased by the endothelial growth factor VEGF or 10% FBS (positive controls) as well as increasing concentrations of recombinant 161P2F10B ECD. These results indicate that HUVEC cells that are treated with 161P2F10B protein have an enhanced migratory capacity in low serum conditions. Accordingly, 161P2F10B expressing cells induce increased potential for migration of endothelium in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nE. 161P2F10B Dimerization on KU-812 Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 161P2F10B protein contains different extracellular domains (for example, the somatomedin B-like domain) that may be involved in protein homodimerization. To investigate the potential dimeric state of 161P2F10B on the cell surface, KU-812 cells which endogenously express 161P2F10B were treated with a chemical cross-linking agent, ethylene glycol bis[succinimidylsuccinate] (EGS), at different concentrations for 30 minutes. The cells were then lysed, the cell proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then Western blotted for 161P2F10B. The results in \nFIG. 36\n indicate that with increasing concentrations of EGS treatment, the monomeric form of 161P2F10B (˜100 kDa) was diminished while a new band at ˜200-kDa was observed. The 200-kDa band correlates with a dimeric form of the 161P2F10B protein. The EGS agent will cross-link molecules that are within 16.1 Angstroms distance between each other to form stable dimers or multimers. The data indicate that 161P2F10B molecules on KU-812 cells are in close proximity, such that they are already dimers on the cell surface prior to chemical cross-linking. The hypothesis that 161P2F10B could randomly form dimers with other proteins is eliminated by the observation that only a dimeric molecular weight species was observed in the specific Western blot, and not other molecular weight bands. Overall, the results indicate that 161P2F10B is dimeric on the cell surface, and that this property may be required for full enzymatic activity and other functional activities of 161P2F10B when expressed on the surface of tumor cells.\n\n\n \nExample 19\n\n\n161P2F10B MAb Inhibition Studies\n\n\n \n \n \nA. MAbs Inhibit Cell Proliferation, Survival and Apoptosis in 161P2F10B Expressing Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced proliferation and entry into S-phase of tumor cells relative to normal cells are hallmarks of the cancer cell phenotype. To address the effect of modulation of 161P2F10B on the proliferation rate of cells, cancer cell lines endogenously expressing the 161P2F10B gene (renal clear cell cancer lines SK-RC-01 and RXF-393; liver cancer line HepG2; promyelocytic line KU-812) were evaluated in a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay (cell proliferation assay) in the absence or presence of MAbs to the 161P2F10B protein. The cells were grown in 10% FBS, incubated with MAb and then evaluated for proliferation after 18-96 hr post-treatment by a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. The results in \nFIG. 30\n show that MAbs inhibited the proliferation of cells expressing the 161P2F10B antigen; while the isotype matched control MAb did not affect cell growth. Similar results were obtained for the RXF-393, HepG2 and KU-812 cancer cells expressing 161P2F10B. Further, renal clear cell line RXF-393 cells were evaluated in an MTS survival assay (\nFIG. 31\n). The MTS assay is a colorimetric method for determining the number of viable cells in proliferation, cytotoxicity or chemosensitivity assays based on a tetrazolium compound [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; MTS(b)] and an electron coupling reagent (phenazine ethosulfate; PES). Assays were performed by adding a small amount of the Solution Reagent directly to culture wells, incubating for 1-4 hours and then recording absorbance at 490 nm with a 96-well plate reader. The quantity of colored formazan product as measured by the amount of 490 nm absorbance is directly proportional to the mitochondrial activity and/or the number of living cells in culture. As shown in \nFIG. 31\n, MAbs to 161P2F10B inhibited the survival of the RXF-393 cells, which correlated with inhibition of cell proliferation. As a further test of MAb modulation of cell viability, the cells tested in the MTS survival assay were lysed and also tested in a cell death ELISA that measures cellular apoptosis. A method to observe fragmented DNA in cells is the immunological detection of histone-complexed DNA fragments by an immunoassay (i.e. cell death detection ELISA) which measures the enrichment of histone-complexed DNA fragments (mono- and oligo-nucleosomes) in the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells. In \nFIG. 31\n, the same MAbs that inhibited both proliferation and survival also induced increased apoptosis. These results confirm that cells expressing 161P2F10B antigen are modulated by MAb to 161P2F10B protein, resulting in reduced proliferative capacity and survival in high serum conditions, and an increased apoptotic program. Accordingly, 161P2F10B expressing cancer cells with potential for growth as tumor cells in vivo may be modulated for growth by MAb to 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. MAbs Inhibit Enhanced Angiogenesis (Tube Formation) of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells Stimulated with Recombinant Extracellular Domain (ECD) of 161P2F10B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 28\n shows that incubation of HUVEC cells and ECD in the in vitro angiogenesis (tube formation) assay with 20 μg/ml MAb to 161P2F10B resulted in 33-78% inhibition of network formation, depending upon the MAb used in the assay. An isotype control MAb at the same concentration did not inhibit tube formation. Further, as shown in \nFIG. 32\n, inhibition of angiogenesis by 161P2F10B MAbs is dose-dependent. Together, these results indicate that the 161P2F10B protein is involved in promoting angiogenesis through its PDE activity that facilitates tumor growth, tumor cell invasion and/or activation of endothelium for tumor vascularization, and that MAbs to 161P2F10B inhibit such activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC. Inhibition of Cell Migration and Invasion by 161P2F10B MAb.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced migration and invasion are hallmarks of the cancer cell phenotype. To address the effect of MAbs to 161P2F10B on migration, HepG2 cells (liver cancer) and A-704 cells (renal clear cell cancer) which endogenously express 161P2F10B protein were evaluated in a transwell migration assay. The cells were incubated with a control MAb or a pool of three MAbs (25 ug/ml each) to 161P2F10B and allowed to migrate for 24 hours through a transwell chamber. The results in \nFIG. 33\n indicate that the MAb pool to 161P2F10B inhibited the migration of HepG2 cells, while the control MAb did not inhibit migration. As shown in \nFIG. 34\n, inhibition of A-704 renal clear cell migration also was observed. Enhancement of migration was seen in both cell lines by treatment of the cells with 8 ng/ml Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). For both cell lines, the enhanced HGF-induced migration was inhibited by the MAbs to 161P2F10B (\nFIGS. 33 and 34\n). To address the ability of the cells to invade into the extracellular matrix, A-704 cells were seeded into transwell chambers that were coated with Matrigel®. This assay is fundamentally similar to the migration assay except that the cells need to migrate through the Matrigel® in order to be scored as having moved in the assay. This is a property of tumor cells in that they express enzymes (i.e., matrix metalloproteases such as MMPs, ADAMs, etc.) that degrade the extracellular matrix proteins in the Matrigel® and facilitate cellular migration. The results in \nFIG. 35\n demonstrate that A-704 cells possess the ability to invade and that MAb H16-1.93 exhibits an inhibitory activity on this cell phenotype. Furthermore, HGF treatment of the cells increases their capacity to invade in the Matrigel® which is inhibited by MAb H16-1.93.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverall, the in vitro functional results and MAb inhibition studies indicate that the 161P2F10B protein has growth promoting, survival potentiating, migration and invasion enhancing, and angiogenic activities. These activities when assayed in vitro were inhibited by MAbs to 161P2F10B. Such cellular and biochemical functions are vital for the establishment and maintenance of tumors by stimulating capillary bed formation by endothelial cells (See, Ferrara, N. and Kerbel, R. S., 2005 Nature 438: 967-974). This increased angiogenesis provides a means of increased nutrition and oxygenation of growing tumors, and affords a therapeutic intervention strategy for targeting of 161P2F10B in malignancies. The 161P2F10B protein also plays a role in cell migration and invasion, particularly for cells that express the protein, and also serves as an attractant for endothelial cells and other cells expressing its ligand. The phosphodiesterase/pyrophosphatase (PDE) activity of 161P2F10B protein may be critical for altering the concentration of ATP in the tumor microenvironment to facilitate angiogenesis and provide a nutritional advantage. Cell migration and invasion are important for the metastatic potential of tumor cells, and facilitate their homing and recruitment to remote tissues. Expression of 161P2F10B protein in metastases indicates that the migratory phenotype of 161P2F10B-expressing cells imparts a strong potential for such cells to metastasize. All of the assayed functions of 161P2F10B in vitro are inhibited by MAbs.\n\n\n \nExample 20\n\n\nDetection of 161P2F10B Protein in Cancer Patient Specimens by IHC\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression of 161P2F10B protein in tumor specimens from liver cancer patients was detected using the antibody M16-41(3)50. Briefly, frozen tissues were cut into 6 micron sections and mounted on glass slides. The sections were dried for 2 hours at room temperature, fixed for 8 minutes in acetone and subsequently allowed to dry. Sections were then incubated in 161P2F10B antibody, M16-41(3)50, for 3 hours at room temperature. The slides were washed three times in buffer and further incubated with DAKO EnVision+™ peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin secondary antibody (DAKO Corporation, Carpenteria, Calif.) for 1 hour. The sections were then washed in buffer, developed using a DAB kit (SIGMA Chemicals), counterstained using hematoxylin, and analyzed by bright field microscopy. The results show expression of 161P2F10B in the tumor cells of hepatocellular carcinoma (37A and 37B) as indicated by the brown coloration of the cells. Serial sections with no incubation in M16-41(3)50 had no staining (37C and 37D). These results indicate that 161P2F10B is expressed in human liver cancers and that antibodies directed to this antigen are useful as diagnostic reagents (\nFIG. 37\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese results indicate that 161P2F10B is a target for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic applications in cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout this application, various website data content, publications, patent applications and patents are referenced.
