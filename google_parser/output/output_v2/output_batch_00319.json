Description\n\n\n\n\n TITLE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIMIDAZO[1, 2-a]PYRIDINES AND IMIDAZO[1 ,2-b]PYRIDAZINES AS MARK\n\n\nINHIBITORS.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and is characterised by a decline in cognitive function, that progresses slowly and results in symptoms such as memory loss and disorientation. Death occurs, on average, 9 years after diagnosis. The incidence of AD increases with age, so that while about 5% of people over the age of 70 are sufferers, this figure increases to 20% of those over 80 years old.\n\n\nExisting treatments exclusively target the primary symptoms of AD. Diseased neurons may release insufficient or excessive amounts of particular neurotransmitters, and so current drugs are aimed at increasing neurotransmitter levels or at reducing the stimulation of nerve cells by neurotransmitters. Although these drugs provide some improvement in the symptoms of AD\n5\n they fail to address the underlying cause of the disease.\n\n\nThe classic clinical and neuropathological features of AD consist of senile or neuritic plaques and tangled bundles of fibers (neurofibrillary tangles) [Verdile, G., et al, Pharm. Res. 50:397-409 (2004)]. In addition, there is a severe loss of neurons in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. Neuritic plaques are extracellular lesions, consisting mainly of deposits of β- amyloid peptide (Aβ), surrounded by dystrophic (swollen, damaged and degenerating) neurites and glial cells activated by inflammatory processes. In contrast, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are intracellular clusters composed of a hyperphosphorylated form of the protein tau, which are found extensively in the brain (e.g. mainly in cortex and hippocampus in AD). Tau is a soluble cytoplasmic protein which has a role in microtubule stabilisation. Excessive phosphorylation of this protein renders it insoluble and leads to its aggregation into paired helical filaments, which in turn form NFTs,\n\n\nThe amyloid cascade hypothesis proposes that abnormal accumulation of Aβ peptides, particularly Aβ42, initiates a cascade of events leading to the classical symptoms of AD and ultimately, to the death of the patient. There is strong evidence [e.g. Rapoport, M., el al (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 99:6364-6369] that dysregulation of tau function is a key step in the cascade of Alzheimer's disease pathology leading ultimately to neuronal death. Furthermore, tau mutations and NFTs are found in other dementias in which Aβ pathology is absent, such as fronlotemporal dementia, Pick's disease and parkinsonism linked to chromosome \n\n 17 (FTDP- 17) [Mizutani, T. (1999) Rinsho Shikeigaku 39: 1262-1263]. Also, in AD the frequency of NFTs correlates to the degree of dementia better than that of senile plaques [Arriagada, P. V,, et al (1992) Neurology 42:631-639], while significant numbers of amyloid plaques are often found in the brains of non-demented elderly people, suggesting that amyloid pathology on its own is not sufficient to cause dementia. For these reasons, normalisation of tau function (in particular prevention of hyperphosphorylation) is seen as a desirable therapeutic goal for the treatment of AD and other dementing conditions.\n\n\nTau is a 352-441 amino acid protein encoded by the Mapt (Microtubule- associated protein tau) gene which is widely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) with localisation primarily in axons [Binder et al J. Cell Biol. 1985, 101(4), 1371-1378]. The major function of tau is regulation of the stability of microtubules (MTs), intracellular structural components comprised of tubulin dimers which are integral in regulating many essential cellular processes such as axonal transport and elongation as well as generation of cell polarity and shape. Tau binding to tubulin is a key factor in determining the rates of polymerisation/depolyrnerisation (termed dynamic instability) of MTs, and tau is therefore key to the regulation of many essential cellular processes [see, for example, Butner, K. A., Kirschner, M. W. (1991) J.Cell. Biol. 115: 717-730].\n\n\nTau is a basic protein with numerous serine and threonine residues, many of which are susceptible to phosphorylation. While normal tau has two to three phosphoryiated amino acid residues, hyperphosphorylated tau found in AD and other tauopathies typically has eight or nine phosphoryiated residues. A variety of kinases promote phosphorylation of these sites, including proline-directed kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and cyclin dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), and non-proline-directed kinases such as protein kinase A (PKA) and calmodulin (CaM) kinase II, which phosphorylate tau at Lys-(Ile/Cys)-Gly-Ser sequences, also known as KXGS motifs. One KXGS motif is found in each of the MT binding repeats. Phosphorylation at these sites is important for the regulation of tau-MT binding and while the degree of phosphorylation is normally low, it has been shown to be increased in brain tissue from AD patients. Phosphorylation of one particular residue within the KXGS motifs, Ser-262 has been shown to be elevated in tau protein extracted from the NFTs in AD [Hasegawa, M. et al (1992) J. Biol. Chem 267:17047-17054] and phosphorylation at this site also appears to dramatically reduce MT binding [Biernat, J. et al. (1993) Neuron 11: 153-163]. Nishimura et al. [Cell 116: 671-682 (2004)] demonstrated that overexpression of the kinase PAR- 1 in Drosophila led to enhanced tau-mediated toxicity and an increase in the \n\n phosphorylation of tau on Ser-262, Ser-356, and other amino acid residues, including sites phosphorylated by GSK3β and Cdk5. Their findings suggest that PAR-I kinase acts as a master kinase during the process of tau hyperphosphorylation, with the phosphorylation of the Ser-262 and Ser-356 sites being a prerequisite for the subsequent phosphorylation at downstream sites by other kinases.\n\n\nThe mammalian ortholog of PAR-I is microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK). There are four MARK isoforms and these form part of the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) family. Like PAR-I\n5\n MARK is thought to phosphorylate tau, perhaps in response to an external insult, such as the disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis caused by Aβ, priming it for further phosphorylation events. It is not clear whether the phosphorylation of tau by MARK leads directly to its detachment from MTs or the subsequent phosphorylation events cause detachment. The resulting unbound, hyperphosphorylated tau is delocalised to the somatodendritic compartment and is then cleaved by caspases to form fragments prone to aggregation [Drewes, G. (2004). Trends Biochem. Sci 29:548-555; Gamblin, T.C., et al, (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100:10032-10037]. These aggregates can grow into filaments, which are potentially toxic, eventually forming the NFTs found in AD.\n\n\nFor these reasons, it is proposed that MARK inhibitors will enable the prevention or amelioration of neurodegeneration in AD and other tauopathies.\n\n\nThis invention relates to methods and materials for the treatment or prevention of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In particular, there is disclosed a particular class of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine and imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine derivatives which selectively inhibit microtubule affinity regulating kinase (MARK).\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention encompasses imidazo[ 1 ,2-a]pyridine and imidazof 1 ,2~b]pyridazine derivatives which selectively inhibit microtubule affinity regulating kinase (MARK) and are therefore useful for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease.

where \"aryl\" refers to phenyl or 5- or 6-membered heleroaryl, either of which phenyl or heteroaryl is optionally fused to a 5- or 6-membered carbocycle or heterocycle, and \"Het\" refers to a nonaromatic mono- or bicyclic heterocyclic system of up to 10 ring atoms, of which 1-3 are selected from N, O and S(O)χ and the remainder are C.\n\n\nThe invention also encompasses a compound selected from the examples described below, including stereoisomers or mixtures thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of any of these compounds or stereoisomers.\n\n\nThe invention also encompasses a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nThe invention further provides a method for treatment or prevention of a neurodegenerative disease associated with hyperphosphorylation of tau in a human patient, said method comprising administering to that patient an effective amount of a compound of formula I as defined above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate thereof.\n\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases associated with hyperphosphorylation of tau include AD, frontotemporal dementia, Pick's disease and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP- 17).\n\n\nIn a further aspect, the invention provides a method for reducing the production of hyperphosphorylated tau in a human patient, said method comprising administering to said patient an effective amount of a compound of formula I as defined above or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate thereof. \n\n As used herein, the expression \"C\n1-\nxalkyl\" where x is an integer greater than 1 refers to straight-chained and branched alkyl groups wherein the number of constituent carbon atoms is in the range 1 to x. Particular alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl and t-butyl. Derived expressions such as \"C\n2-6\nalkenyl\", \"hydroxyC\n1-6\nalkyl\", \"heteroarylC\n1-6\nalkyl\", \"C\n2-6\nalkynyl\" and \"C\n1-6\nalkoxy\" are to be construed in an analogous manner. Most suitably, the number of carbon atoms in such groups is not more than 6.\n\n\nThe term \"halogen\" as used herein includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.\n\n\nThe expression \"C3-χcycloalkyl'\nt\n as used herein, where x is an integer greater than 3, refers to nonaromatic hydrocarbon ring systems containing from 3 to x ring atoms. Said systems may be monocyclic or bicyclic if the magnitude of x allows it. Examples include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, bicycloheptyl and decalinyl.\n\n\nUnless indicated otherwise, the term \"bicyclic\" includes bridged bicyclic and spiro-linked ring systems as well as fused ring systems. However, a bicyclic system in which one or both rings are aromatic is of necessity a fused ring system.\n\n\nFor use in medicine, the compounds of formula I may be in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of the compounds of formula I or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, benzoic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid. Alternatively, where the compound of the invention carries an acidic moiety, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be formed by neutralisation of said acidic moiety with a suitable base. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus formed include alkali metal salts such as sodium or potassium salts; ammonium salts; alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium or magnesium salts; and salts formed with suitable organic bases, such as amine salts (including pyridinium salts) and quaternary ammonium salts. When the compounds useful in the invention have one or more asymmetric centres, they may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the compounds according to the invention possess two or more asymmetric centers, they may additionally exist as \n\n diastereoisomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures thereof in any proportion are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Any formulas, structures or names of compounds described herein that do not specify a particular stereochemistry are meant Io encompass any and all existing isomers as described above in substantially pure form free of other isomers and mixtures thereof in any proportion. When stereochemistry is specified, the invention is meant to encompass that particular isomer, either in substantially pure form free of other isomers or as part of a mixture.\n\n\nWhen a compound useful in the invention is capable of existing in tautomeric keto and enol forms, both of said forms are considered to be within the scope of the invention. A nitrogen atom forming part of a heteroaryl ring may be in the form of the N- oxide. A sulphur atom forming part of a nonaromatic heterocycle may be in the form of the S- oxide or S,S-dioxide.\n\n\nA heteroaryl group may be attached to the remainder of the molecule via a ring carbon or a ring nitrogen, provided that this is consistent with preservation of aromaticity. In formula I, X\n1\n may represent a monocyclic or bicyclic ring system comprising up to 10 ring atoms, of which 1-3 are heteroatoms selected from N, O and S(O)χ and the remainder are C. In the case of a bicyclic system comprising 2 or 3 heteroatoms, said heteroatoms may be confined to one of the rings or distributed over both of the rings. In the case of a bicyclic system, preferably at least one of the rings is aromatic, for example the ring which is bonded to the pyrazolopyridine system of formula I. In the case of a monocyclic system, the ring typically comprises 5 or 6 ring atoms and may be aromatic or nonaromatic, and in a particular embodiment such a ring is either aromatic or partially unsaturated.\n\n\nExamples of aromatic monocyclic systems represented by X\n1\n include pyridine, pyrazole, imidazole, pyrrole, thiophene and furan. Examples of nonaromatic monocyclic systems represented by X\n1\n include dihydropyridine and tetrahydropyridine.\n\n\nExamples of bicyclic systems represented by X\n1\n include indole, benzofuran, quinoline, isoquinoline, l/f-pyrrolo[2,3-^3pyridine, 5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[1,2-&3pyrazoie and\n\n\n2,3-dihydro- 1 /i-benzimidazole. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that a hydroxyl substituent on an unsaturated ring may be capable of tautomerising to a ketone, In such circumstances, both \n\n tautomers are to be considered equivalent. Thus, for example, 2-hydroxypyridine is considered equivalent to 2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine.\n\n\nSpecific examples of compounds in accordance with the invention are provided in the Examples hereinafter, It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that individual compounds in accordance with formula I may be converted into other compounds in accordance with formula I using standard synthetic techniques. For example, compounds in which X\n1\n is a fluoro- substituted aromatic moiety may be treated with primary or secondary amines in DMF in the presence of alkali at elevated temperatures to provide the corresponding amino-substituted derivatives. Similarly, compounds in which X\n1\n comprises a dihydro- or tetrahydropyridine ring or similar may be N-alkylated using standard methods. Such transformations may also be carried out on intermediates in the synthesis of compounds of formula I.\n\n\nWhere they are not themselves commercially available, the starting materials and reagents described above may be obtained from commercially available precursors by means of well known synthetic procedures and/or the methods disclosed in the Examples section herein.\n\n\nWhere the above-described processes for the preparation of the compounds of use in the invention give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers by standard techniques such as preparative HPLC, or the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, such as di-/>-toluoyl~D- tartaric acid and/or di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid, followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary.\n\n\nDuring any of the above synthetic sequences it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene & P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley Sc Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from the art. \n\n The compounds of formula I are suitably administered to patients in the form a pharmaceutical composition comprising the active ingredient (i.e. the compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate thereof) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and said pharmaceutical compositions constitute a further aspect of the invention. Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, transdermal patches, auto-injector devices or suppositories; for oral, parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. The principal active ingredient typically is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate and dicalcium phosphate, or gums, dispersing agents, suspending agents or surfactants such as sorbitan monooleate and polyethylene glycol, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a homogeneous preformulation composition containing a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. Typical unit dosage forms contain from 1 to 100 mg, for example 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg, of the active ingredient. Tablets or pills of the composition can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.\n\n\nThe liquid forms in which the compositions useful in the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, liquid- or gel- filled capsules, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous \n\n suspensions include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, poly(ethylene glycol), ρoly(vinylpyrrolidone) or gelatin.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the compound of formula I is administered to a patient suffering from AD, FTDP- 17, Pick's disease or frontotemporal dementia, in particular AD.\n\n\nIn an alternative embodiment of the invention, the compound of formula I is administered to a patient suffering from mild cognitive impairment or age-related cognitive decline. A favourable outcome of such treatment is prevention or delay of the onset of AD. Age-related cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are conditions in which a memory deficit is present, but other diagnostic criteria for dementia are absent (Santacruz and Swagerty, American Family Physician, 63 (2001), 70343). (See also \"The ICD-IO Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders\", Geneva: World Health Organisation, 1992, 64-5). As used herein, \"age-related cognitive decline\" implies a decline of at least six months' duration in at least one of: memory and learning; attention and concentration; thinking; language; and visuo spatial functioning and a score of more than one standard deviation below the norm on standardized neuropsychologic testing such as the MMSE. In particular, there may be a progressive decline in memory. In the more severe condition MCI, the degree of memory impairment is outside the range considered normal for the age of the patient but AD is not present. The differential diagnosis of MCI and mild AD is described by Petersen et al, Arch Neurol, 56 (1999), 303-8. Further information on the differential diagnosis of MCI is provided by Knopman et al, Mayo Clinic Proceedings, 78 (2003), 1290-1308. In a study of elderly subjects, Tuokko et al {Arch, Neurol, 60 (2003) 577-82) found that those exhibiting MCI at the outset had a three-fold increased risk of developing dementia within 5 years. Grundman et al (J. MoI Neurosci,, 19 (2002), 23-28) report that lower baseline hippocampal volume in MCI patients is a prognostic indicator for subsequent AD. Similarly, Andreasen et al {Acta Neurol. Scand, 107 (2003) 47-51) report that high CSF levels of total tau, high CSF levels of phospho-tau and lowered CSF levels of Aβ42 are all associated with increased risk of progression from MCI to AD. Within this embodiment, the compound of formula I is advantageously administered to patients who suffer impaired memory function but do not exhibit symptoms of dementia. Such impairment of memory function typically is not attributable to systemic or cerebral disease, such as stroke or metabolic disorders caused by pituitary dysfunction. Such \n\n patients may be in particular people aged 55 or over, especially people aged 60 or over, and preferably people aged 65 or over. Such patients may have normal patterns and levels of growth hormone secretion for their age. However, such patients may possess one or more additional risk factors for developing Alzheimer's disease. Such factors include a family history of the disease; a genetic predisposition to the disease; elevated serum cholesterol; and adult-onset diabetes mellitus.\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment of the invention, the compound of formula I is administered to a patient suffering from age-related cognitive decline or MCI who additionally possesses one or more risk factors for developing AD selected from: a family history of the disease; a genetic predisposition to the disease; elevated serum cholesterol; adult-onset diabetes mellitus; elevated baseline hippocampal volume; elevated CSF levels of total tau; elevated CSF levels of phospho-tau; and lowered CSF levels of Aβ(l-42).\n\n\nA genetic predisposition (especially towards early onset AD) can arise from point mutations in one or more of a number of genes, including the APP, presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 genes. Also, subjects who are homozygous for the ε4 isoform of the apolipoprotein E gene are at greater risk of developing AD.\n\n\nThe patient's degree of cognitive decline or impairment is advantageously assessed at regular intervals before, during and/or after a course of treatment in accordance with the invention, so that changes therein may be detected, e.g. the slowing or halting of cognitive decline. A variety of neuropsychological tests are known in the art for this purpose, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) with norms adjusted for age and education (Folstein et at, J. Psych. Res., U (1975), 196-198, Anthony et al, Psychological Med., 12 (1982), 397-408; Cockrell et al, Psychopharmacology, 24 (1988), 689-692; Crum et al., J. Am. Med. Λssoc'n. 18 (1993), 2386-2391). The MMSE is a brief, quantitative measure of cognitive status in adults. It can be used to screen for cognitive decline or impairment, to estimate the severity of cognitive decline or impairment at a given point in time, to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time, and to document an individual's response to treatment. Another suitable test is the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), in particular the cognitive element thereof (AD AS-cog) (See Rosen et al., Am. J. Psychiatry, 141 (1984), 1356-64). For treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease, a suitable dosage level is about\n\n\n0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, preferably about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg per day, and more preferably about 0.05 to 50 mg/kg of body weight per day, of the active compound. The compounds may be \n\n administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day. In some cases, however, a dosage outside these limits may be used.\n\n\nThe compound of formula I optionally may be administered in combination with one or more additional compounds known to be useful in the treatment or prevention of AD or the symptoms thereof. Such additional compounds thus include cognition-enhancing drugs such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. donepezϋ and galanthamine), NMDA antagonists (e.g. memantine) or PDE4 inhibitors (e.g. Ariflo™ and the classes of compounds disclosed in WO 03/018579, WO 01/46151, WO 02/074726 and WO 02/098878). Such additional compounds also include cholesterol-lowering drugs such as the statins, e.g. simvastatin. Such additional compounds similarly include compounds known to modify the production or processing of Aβ in the brain (\"amyloid modifiers\"), such as compounds which modulate the secretion of Aβ (including γ-secretase inhibitors, γ-secretase modulators and β-secretase inhibitors), compounds which inhibit the aggregation of Aβ, and antibodies which selectively bind to Aβ. Such additional compounds further include growth hormone secretagogues, e.g. as described in WO 2004/080459.\n\n\nIn this embodiment of the invention, the amyloid modifier may be a compound which inhibits the secretion of Aβ, for example an inhibitor of γ-secretase (such as those disclosed in WO 01/90084, WO 02/30912, WO 01/70677, WO 03/013506, WO 02/36555, WO 03/093252, WO 03/093264, WO 03/093251, WO 03/093253, WO 2004/039800, WO 2004/039370, WO 2005/030731, WO 2005/014553, WO 2004/089911, WO 02/081435, WO 02/081433, WO 03/018543, WO 2004/031137, WO 2004/031139, WO 2004/031138, WO 2004/101538, WO 2004/101539 and WO 02/47671), or a β-secretase inhibitor (such as those disclosed in WO 03/037325, WO 03/030886, WO 03/006013, WO 03/006021, WO 03/006423, WO 03/006453, WO 02/002122, WO 01/70672, WO 02/02505, WO 02/02506, WO 02/02512, WO 02/02520, WO 02/098849 and WO 02/100820), or any other compound which inhibits the formation or release of Aβ including those disclosed in WO 98/28268, WO 02/47671, WO 99/67221, WO 01/34639, WO 01/34571, WO 00/07995, WO 00/38618, WO 01/92235, WO 01/77086, WO 01/74784, WO 01/74796, WO 01/74783, WO 01/60826, WO 01/19797, WO 01/27108, WO 01/27091, WO 00/50391, WO 02/057252, US 2002/0025955 and US2002/0022621, and also including GSK-3 inhibitors, particularly GSK-3α inhibitors, such as lithium, as disclosed in Phiel et al, Nature, 423 (2003), 435-9. \n\n Alternatively, the amyloid modifier may be a compound which modulates the action of γ-secretase so as to selectively attenuate the production of Aβ(l-42). Compounds reported to show this effect include certain non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and their analogues (see WO 01/78721 and US 2002/0128319 and Weggen et al Nature, 414 (2001) 212-16; Morihara et al, J. Neurochem., 83 (2002), 1009-12; and Takahashi et al, J. Biol Chem., 278 (2003), 18644-70), and compounds which modulate the activity of PP ARa and/or PPARδ (WO 02/100836). Further examples of γ-secretase modulators are disclosed in WO 2005/054193, WO 2005/013985, WO 2005/108362, WO 2006/008558 and WO 2006/043064. Alternatively, the amyloid modifier may be a compound which inhibits the aggregation of Aβ or otherwise attenuates is neurotoxicicity. Suitable examples include chelating agents such as clioquinol (Gouras and Beal, Neuron, 30 (2001), 641-2) and the compounds disclosed in WO 99/16741, in particular that known as DP-109 (Kalendarev et al, J Pharm. Biomed. Anal., 24 (2001), 967-75). Other inhibitors of Aβ aggregation suitable for use in the invention include the compounds disclosed in WO 96/28471, WO 98/08868 and WO 00/052048, including the compound known as Apan™ (Praecis); WO 00/06442O\n5\n WO 03/017994, WO 99/59571 (in particular 3 -aminopropane-1 -sulfonic acid, also known as tramiprosate or Alzhemed™); WO 00/149281 and the compositions known as PTI-777 and PTI- 00703 (ProteoTech); WO 96/39834, WO 01/83425, WO 01/55093, WO 00/76988, WO 00/76987, WO 00/76969, WO 00/76489, WO 97/26919, WO 97/16194, and WO 97/16191. Further examples include phytic acid derivatives as disclosed in US 4,847,082 and inositol derivatives as taught in US 2004/0204387.\n\n\nAlternatively, the amyloid modifier may be an antibody which binds selectively to Aβ. Said antibody may be polyclonal or monoclonal, but is preferably monoclonal, and is preferably human or humanized. Preferably, the antibody is capable of sequestering soluble Aβ from biological fluids, as described in WO 03/016466, WO 03/016467, WO 03/015691 and WO 01/62801. Suitable antibodies include humanized antibody 266 (described in WO 01/62801) and the modified version thereof described in WO 03/016466. Suitable antibodies also include those specific to Aβ-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLS), as disclosed in WO 2004/031400.\n\n\nAs used herein, the expression \"in combination with\" requires that therapeutically effective amounts of both the compound of formula I and the additional compound are administered to the subject, but places no restriction on the manner in which this is achieved. Thus, the two species may be combined in a single dosage form for simultaneous administration \n\n to the subject, or may be provided in separate dosage forms for simultaneous or sequential administration to the subject. Sequential administration may be close in time or remote in time, e.g. one species administered in the morning and the other in the evening. The separate species may be administered at the same frequency or at different frequencies, e.g. one species once a day and the other two or more times a day. The separate species may be administered by the same route or by different routes, e.g. one species orally and the other parenterally, although oral administration of both species is preferred, where possible. When the additional compound is an antibody, it will typically be administered parenteraliy and separately from the compound of formula I.\n\n\nEXAMPLES MARK 3 Assay\n\n\nMARK3 activity was assayed in vitro using a Cdc25C biotinylated peptide substrate (Cell Signalling Technologies). The phosphopeptide product was quantitated using a Homogenous Time-Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) assay system (Park et al., 1999, Anal, Biochem. 269:94404).

The reaction was allowed to equilibrate overnight at 0 °C, and relative fluorescent units were read on an HTRF enabled plate reader (e.g. TECAN GENios Pro).\n\n\nInhibitor compounds were assayed in the reaction described above to determine compound IC50S.

In case of an ester, compound C was hydrolyzed with potassium hydroxide in methanol, and the amide G was formed employing BOP as a coupling reagent. Alternatively, compound C was brominated on the thiophene with thionyl bromide, then a second Suzuki coupling with either potassium alkyltrifluoroborate or boronic ester provided compound F. In case of an ester, compound F was hydrolyzed and coupled with an amine to afford compound H. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 1\n\n\nZ\n1\n - OMe)\n\n\n \n\n The 5-vinylthiophene I was selectively reduced with Pd/C and ammonium formate in n-propanol to afford the 5-ethylthiophene J (Scheme 2). Basic hydrolysis followed by amide formation provided amide K. The vinylthiophene I was also subjected to dihydroxylation conditions (OsO\n4\n, NMO, THF/water) to provide the 1,2-diol L, which was then converted to aldehyde M with NaIO\n4\n in THF/water. Fluori nation of M with Deoxo-Fluor afforded the difluoromethylthiophene N, Hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide and a coupling with an amine provided the amide O.\n\n\nScheme 2\n\n\nt BOP \n\n\n \n\n To install the thiazole moiety, the 3-bromoimidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine or 3- bromoimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine A was coupled to tribuyl(l-ethoxyvinyl)tin under Stille reaction conditions (Scheme 3). The enol ether was hydro lyzed with aqueous hydrochloric acid to afford ketone P. Bromination with Br\n2\n and HBr afforded the gem-dibromoketone Q, which was then condensed with ethylthiooxamate to provide thiazole R. After basic hydrolysis of the ester, thionyl chloride treatment of compound S at 100 °C converted the acid to the acid chloride and installed a chlorine on the thiazole at the same time. Acid chloride T was coupled with an amine to afford compound U.\n\n\nScheme 3\n\n\nne\n\n\nW = CH or N\n\n\nX\n1\n = H, Cl, CF\n3\n, Ar\n\n\n \n\n PREPARATION OF 3-BR0M0IMIDAZ0[l, 2-B]PYRIDAZINES\n\n\nThe following methods were used to prepare 3-bromoimidazo[l ,2-b]pyridazines that were not available from commercial sources or literature.\n\n\nINTERMEDIATE 1 3-Bromo-7-(4-fluorophenyl)imidazo[ 1 ,2-6]pyridazine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. 2-Benzyl-4,5-dichloropyridazin-3(2H)-one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA stirred mixture of 4,5-dichloropyridazin-3(2/i)-one (26,7 g, 160 ratnol), benzyl bromide (19.3 mL, 160 mmol)\n?\n tetrabutylammonium bromide (2.61 g, 8.10 mmol), and potassium carbonate (56.O g, 405 mmol) in acetonitrile (405 mL) was heated to reflux for 2 h.

Description\n\n\n\n\n TITLE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nOXADIAZOLE BETA CARBOLINE DERIVATIVES AS ANTIDIABETIC COMPOUNDS\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION The instant invention is concerned with substituted beta-carboline derivatives, which are selective antagonists of the somatostatin subtype receptor 3 (SSTR3) which are useful for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and of conditions that are often associated with this disease, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, obesity, lipid disorders, and hypertension. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of depression and anxiety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nDiabetes is a disease derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose (hyperglycemia) in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. In Type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), insulin is still produced by islet cells in the pancreas. Patients having Type 2 diabetes have a resistance to the effects of insulin in stimulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, including muscle, liver and adipose tissues. These patients often have normal levels of insulin, and may have hyperinsulinemia (elevated plasma insulin levels), as they compensate for the reduced effectiveness of insulin by secreting increased amounts of insulin (Polonsky, Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 24 Suppl 2:S29-31, 2000). The beta cells within the pancreatic islets initially compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin output. Insulin resistance is not primarily caused by a diminished number of insulin receptors but rather by a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not yet completely understood. This lack of responsiveness to insulin results in insufficient insulin-mediated activation of uptake, oxidation and storage of glucose in muscle, and inadequate insulin-mediated repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver. Eventually, a patient may be become diabetic due to the inability to properly compensate for insulin resistance. In humans, the onset of Type 2 diabetes due to insufficient increases (or actual declines) in beta cell mass is apparently due to increased beta cell apoptosis relative to non-diabetic insulin resistant individuals (Butler et ah, Diabetes 52:102-110, 2003).\n\n\nPersistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia that occurs with diabetes is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with obesity, hypertension, and alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism, as well as other metabolic and hemodynamic disease.\n\n\nI \n\n Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus have a significantly increased risk of macro vascular and microvascular complications, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, effective therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, obesity, and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.\n\n\nPatients who have insulin resistance often exhibit several symptoms that together are referred to as syndrome X or Metabolic Syndrome. According to one widely used definition, a patient having Metabolic Syndrome is characterized as having three or more symptoms selected from the following group of five symptoms: (1) abdominal obesity, (2) hypertriglyceridemia, (3) low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), (4) high blood pressure, and (5) elevated fasting glucose, which may be in the range characteristic of Type 2 diabetes if the patient is also diabetic. Each of these symptoms is defined clinically in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III, or ATP III), National Institutes of Health, 2001, NIH Publication No. 01-3670. Patients with Metabolic Syndrome, whether they have or develop overt diabetes mellitus, have an increased risk of developing the macrovascular and microvascular complications that occur with Type 2 diabetes, such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.\n\n\nThere are several available treatments for Type 2 diabetes, each of which has its own limitations and potential risks. Physical exercise and a reduction in dietary intake of calories often dramatically improves the diabetic condition and are the usual recommended first-line treatment of Type 2 diabetes and of pre-diabetic conditions associated with insulin resistance. Compliance with this treatment is generally very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of fat and carbohydrates. Pharmacologic treatments have largely focused on three areas of pathophysiology: (1) hepatic glucose production (biguanides), (2) insulin resistance (PPAR agonists), (3) insulin secretion (sulfonylureas); (4) incretin hormone mimetics (GLP-I derivatives and analogs, such as exenatide and luraglitide); and (5) inhibitors of incretin hormone degradation (DPP-4 inhibitors). The biguanides belong to a class of drugs that are widely used to treat Type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nPhenformin and metformin are the two best known biguanides and do cause some correction of hyperglycemia. The biguanides act primarily by inhibiting hepatic glucose production, and they also are believed to modestly improve insulin sensitivity. The biguanides can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic drugs, such as insulin or insulin secretagogues, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. However, phenformin and metformin can induce lactic acidosis, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. Metformin has a lower risk of side effects than phenformin and is widely prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. \n\n The glitazones (e.g., 5-benzylthiazolidine-2,4-diones) are a class of compounds thai can ameliorate hyperglycemia and other symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. The glitazones that are currently marketed (rosiglitazone and pioglilazone) are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma subtype. The PPAR-gamma agonists substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of Type 2 diabetes, resulting in partial or complete correction of elevated plasma glucose levels without the occurrence of hypoglycemia. PPAR-gamma agonism is believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensititization that is observed in human patients who are treated with the glitazones. New PPAR agonists are currently being developed. Many of the newer PPAR compounds are agonists of one or more of the PPAR alpha, gamma and delta subtypes. The currently marketed PPAR gamma agonists are modestly effective in reducing plasma glucose and hemoglobinAlC. The currently marketed compounds do not greatly improve lipid metabolism and may actually have a negative effect on the lipid profile. Thus, the PPAR compounds represent an important advance in diabetic therapy. Another widely used drug treatment involves the administration of insulin secretagogues, such as the sulfonylureas (e.g., tolbutamide, glipizide, and glimepiride). These drugs increase the plasma level of insulin by stimulating the pancreatic β-cells to secrete more insulin. Insulin secretion in the pancreatic β-cell is under strict regulation by glucose and an array of metabolic, neural and hormonal signals. Glucose stimulates insulin production and secretion through its metabolism to generate ATP and other signaling molecules, whereas other extracellular signals act as potentiators or inhibitors of insulin secretion through GPCR's present on the plasma membrane. Sulfonylureas and related insulin secretagogues act by blocking the ATP-dependent K+ channel in β-cells, which causes depolarization of the cell and the opening of the voltage- dependent Ca2+ channels with stimulation of insulin release. This mechanism is non-glucose dependent, and hence insulin secretion can occur regardless of the ambient glucose levels. This can cause insulin secretion even if the glucose level is low, resulting in hypoglycemia, which can be fatal in severe cases. The administration of insulin secretagogues must therefore be carefully controlled. The insulin secretagogues are often used as a first-line drug treatment for Type 2 diabetes. Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (0PP-4) inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, and alogliptin) provide a new route to increase insulin secretion in response to food consumption. Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP-I) levels increase in response to the increases in glucose present after eating and glucagon stimulates the production of insulin. The serine proteinase enzyme DPP-4 which is present on many cell surfaces degrades GLP-I. DPP-4 inhibitors reduce degradation of GLP-I , thus potentiating its action and allowing for greater insulin production in response to increases in glucose through eating. \n\n There has been a renewed focus on pancreatic islet-based insulin secretion that is controlled by glucose-dependent insulin secretion. This approach has the potential for stabilization and restoration of β-cell function. In this regard, the present application claims compounds that are antagonists of the somatostatin subtype receptor 3 (SSTR3) as a means to increase insulin secretion in response to rises in glucose resulting from eating a meal. These compounds may also be used as ligands for imaging (e.g., PET, SPECT) for assessment of beta cell mass and islet function. A decrease in β-cell mass can be determined with respect to a particular patient over the course of time.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is directed to compounds of structural formula I, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0)\n\n\nThese bicyclic beta-carboline derivatives are effective as antagonists of SSTR3.

Glucose stimulated insulin secretion was found to be stimulated by abrogating the expression of SSTR3 and through the use of an SSTR3 selective antagonist. An important physiological action of insulin is to decrease blood glucose levels. As disclosed in the present application, targeting the SSTR3 has different uses including therapeutic applications, diagnostic applications, and evaluation of potential therapeutics.\n\n\nSomatostatin is a hormone that exerts a wide spectrum of biological effects mediated by a family of seven transmembrane (TM) domain G-protein-coupled receptors. (Lahlou et al, Ann. K Y. Acad. ScI. 1014:121-131, 2004, Reisine et al, Endocrine Review 16 :427-442, 1995.) The predominant active forms of somatostatin are somatostatin- 14 and somatostatin-28. Somatostatin- 14 is a cyclic tetradecapeptide. Somatostatin-28 is an extended form of somatostatin- 14. Somatostatin subtype receptor 3 (SSTR3) is the third, of five, related G-protein receptor subtypes responding to somatostatin. The other receptors are the somatostatin subtype receptor 1 (SSTRl), somatostatin subtype receptor 2 (SSTR2), somatostatin subtype receptor 4 (SSTR4) and somatostatin subtype receptor 5 (SSTR5). The five distinct subtypes are encoded by separate \n\n genes segregated on different chromosomes. (Patel et al, Neuroendocrinal. 20:157-198, 1999.) All five receptor subtypes bind somatostatin- 14 and somatostatin-28, with low nanomolar affinity. The ligand binding domain for somatostatin is made up of residues in TMs III— VII with a potential contribution by the second extracellular loop. Somatostatin receptors are widely expressed in many tissues, frequently as multiple subtypes that coexist in the same cell.\n\n\nThe five different somatostatin receptors all functionally couple to inhibition of adenylate cyclase by a pertussin-toxin sensitive protein (G\nα\nil-3). (Lahlou et al, Ann. N. Y. Acad. ScL\n\n\n/0/4:121-131, 2004.) Somatostatin-induced inhibition of peptide secretion results mainly from a decrease in intracellular Ca^+. Among the wide spectrum of somatostatin effects, several biological responses have been identified with different receptor subtypes selectivity. These include growth hormone (GH) secretion mediated by SSTR2 and SSTR5, insulin secretion mediated by SSTRl and SSTR5, glucagon secretion mediated by SSTR2, and immune responses mediated by SSTR2. (Patel et al, Neuroendocrinal 20:157-198, 1999; Crider et al, Expert Opin. Ther. Patents /5:1427-1441, 2003.)\n\n\nDifferent somatostatin receptor sequences from different organisms are well known in the art. (See for example, Reisine et al, Endocrine Review 16 :427-442, 1995.) Human, rat, and murine SSTR3 sequences and encoding nucleic acid sequences are provided in SEQ ID NO: 3 (human SSTR3 cDNA gi|44890055|ref|NM_001051.2| CDS 526..1782); SEQ ID NO: 4 (human SSTR3 AA gii4557861|ref)NP_001042.1|); SEQ ID NO: 5 (mouse SSTR3 cDNA gi|6678040|ref|NM_009218J| CDS 1..1287); SEQ ID NO: 6 (mouse SSTR3 AA gi|6678041|ref|NP_033244.1j); SEQ ID NO: 7 (rat SSTR3 cDNA gi|19424167|rer]NM_133522.1| CDS 656..1942); SEQ ID NO: 8 (rat SSTR3 A gi|19424168jref]NP\nm\n598206.1|).\n\n\nSSTR3 antagonists can be identified using SSTR3 and nucleic acid encoding for SSTR3. Suitable assays include detecting compounds competing with a SSTR3 agonist for binding to SSTR3 and determining the functional effect of compounds on a SSTR3 cellular or physiologically relevant activity. SSTR3 cellular activities include cAMP inhibition, phospholipase C increase, tyrosine phsophatases increase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) decrease, K\n+\n channel increase, Na+/H\n+\n exchange decrease, and ERK decrease. (Lahlou et al, Ann. N. Y. Acad. Set /0/4:121-131, 2004.) Functional activity can be determined using cell lines expressing SSTR3 and determining the effect of a compound on one or more SSTR3 activities (e.g., Poitout et al, J. Med. Chem. ¥4:29900-3000, 2001; Hocart et al, J. Med. Chem. 41:1146-1154, 1998).\n\n\nSSTR3 binding assays can be performed by labeling somatostatin and determining the ability of a compound to inhibit somatostatin binding. (Poitout et al, J. Med. Chem. 44:29900- 3000, 2001; Hocart et al, J. Med. Chem. 41 :1146-1154, 1998.) Additional formats for measuring binding of a compound to a receptor are well-known in the art. \n\n A physiologically relevant activity for SSTR3 inhibition is stimulating insulin secretion. Stimulation of insulin secretion can be evaluated in vitro or in vivo.\n\n\nSSTR3 antagonists can be identified experimentally or based on available information. A variety of different SSTR3 antagonists are well known in the art. Examples of such antagonists include peptide antagonists, β-carboline derivatives, and a decahydroisoquinoline derivative, (Poitout ef α/., J Med Chem. 44:29900-3000, 2001, Hocart ef α/., J Med.

Chem. ¥4:29900-3000, 2001 and described herein.\n\n\nA selective SSTR3 antagonist binds SSTR3 at least 10 times stronger than it binds SSTRl, SSTR2, SSTR4, and SSTR5. In different embodiments concerning selective SSTR3 binding, the antagonist binds to each of SSTRl , SSTR2, SSTR4, and SSTR5 with a Ki greater than 1000, or preferably greater than 2000 nM and/or binds SSTR3 at least 40 times, more preferably at least 100 times, or more preferably at least 500 times, greater than it binds to SSTRl\n9\n SSTR2, SSTR4, and SSTR5.\n\n\nIn different embodiments concerning SSTR3 activity, the antagonist has an IC50 (nM) less than 600, preferably less than 100, more preferably less than 50, or more preferably less than 10 nM. IC50 can be determined by measuring inhibition of somatostatin- 14 induced reduction of cAMP accumulation due to forskolin (1 μM) in CHO-Kl cells expressing SSTR3, as described by Poitout et al, J Med. Chem 44:29900-3000, 2001.\n\n\nPreferred antagonists have a preferred or more preferred Ki, a preferred or more preferred IC50, and a preferred or more preferred selectivity. More preferred antagonists have a Ki (nM) less than 25; are at least 100 times selective for SSTR3 compared to SSTRl, SSTR2, SSTR4 and SSTR5; and have a IC50 (nM) less than 50.\n\n\nThe β-carboline compounds of the present invention wherein the oxadiazole ring system is substituted with a R\n12\n substitutuent have been found to have much lower affinity for sodium, as well as other ion channels, and thus are more selective antagonists of SSTR3. This selectivity is expected to reduce potential cardiovascular and other side effects of the compounds of the present invention, \n\n US Patent No. 6,586,445 discloses β-carboline derivatives as somatostatin receptor antagonists and sodium channel blockers denoted as being useful for the treatment of numerous diseases.\n\n\nUS Patent No. 6,861,430 also discloses β-carboline derivatives as SSTR3 antagonists for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorders.\n\n\nAnother set of examples are imidazolyl tetrahydro-β-carboline derivatives based on the compounds provided in Poitout et ah, J.

The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of the compounds of structural formula I. Compounds of structural formula I may be separated into their individual diastereoisomers by, for example, fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent, for example methanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture thereof, or via chiral chromatography using an optically active stationary phase. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.\n\n\nAlternatively, any stereoisomer or isomers of a compound of the general structural formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known absolute configuration.\n\n\nIf desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereoisomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereoisomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.\n\n\nSome of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.\n\n\nSome of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers which have different points of attachment of hydrogen accompanied by one or more double bond shifts. For example, \n\n a ketone and its enol form are keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of the present invention. Examples of tautomers which are intended to be encompassed within the compounds of the present invention are illustrated below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the compounds of structural formula I\n5\n the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominately found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of structural formula I. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (\n1\nH) and deuterium (\n2\nH). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within structural formula I, can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and/or intermediates. Salts:\n\n\nIt will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of structural formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and also salts that are \n\n not pharmaceutically acceptable when they are used as precursors to the free compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or in other synthetic manipulations.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids. Salts of basic compounds encompassed within the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" refer to non-toxic salts of the compounds of this invention which are generally prepared by reacting the free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid. Representative salts of basic compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, the following: acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, bromide, camsylate, carbonate, chloride, clavulanate, citrate, dihydrochloride, edetate, edisylate, estolate, esylate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glutamate, glycollylarsanilate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroxynaphthoate, iodide, isothionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methylbromide, methylnilrate, methylsulfate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, N- methylglucamine ammonium salt, oleate, oxalate, pamoate (embonate), palmitate, pantothenate, phosphate/diphosphate, polygalacturonate, salicylate, stearate, sulfate, subacetate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate, triethiodide and valerate. Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include, but are not limited to, salts derived from inorganic bases including aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, mangamous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion-exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N\n5\nN- dibenzylethylenediamϊne, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylammoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine\n;\n N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine, and the like.\n\n\nAlso, in the case of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) or alcohol group being present in the compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable esters of carboxylic acid derivatives, such as methyl, ethyl, or pivaloyloxymethyl, or acyl derivatives of alcohols, such as 0-acetyI, 0-pivaloyl, 0-benzoyl, and Oaminoacyl, can be employed. Included are those esters and acyl groups known in the art for modifying the solubility or hydrolysis characteristics for use as sustained-release or prodrug formulations. \n\n Solvates, including but not limited to the ethyl acetate solvate, and in particular, the hydrates of the compounds of structural formula I are included in. the present invention as well.\n\n\nExemplifying the invention is the use of the compounds disclosed in the Examples and herein.\n\n\nUtilities:\n\n\nThe compounds described herein are potent and selective antagonists of the somatostatin subtype receptor 3 (SSTR3). The compounds are efficacious in the treatment of diseases that are modulated by SSTR3 ligands, which are generally antagonists. Many of these diseases are summarized below.\n\n\nOne or more of the following diseases may be treated by the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to a patient in need of treatment. Also, the compounds of Formula I may be used for the manufacture of a medicament for treating one or more of these diseases: (1) non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 2 diabetes);\n\n\n(2) hyperglycemia;\n\n\n(3) Metabolic Syndrome;\n\n\n(4) obesity;\n\n\n(5) hypercholesterolemia; (6) hypertriglyceridemia (elevated levels of triglyceride-rich-lipoproteins);\n\n\n(7) mixed or diabetic dyslipϊdemia;\n\n\n(8) low HDL cholesterol;\n\n\n(9) high LDL cholesterol;\n\n\n(10) hyperapoBlipoproteinemia; and (11) atherosclerosis.\n\n\nOne embodiment of the uses of the compounds is directed to the treatment of one or more of the following diseases by administering a therapeutically effective amount to a patient in need of treatment. The compounds may be used for manufacturing a medicament for use in the treatment of one or more of these diseases: (1) Type 2 diabetes;\n\n\n(2) hyperglycemia;\n\n\n(3) Metabolic Syndrome;\n\n\n(4) obesity; and\n\n\n(5) hypercholesterolemia. The compounds are expected to be effective in lowering glucose and lipids in diabetic patients and in non-diabetic patients who have impaired glucose tolerance and/or are in a pre- diabetic condition. The compounds may ameliorate hyperinsulinemia, which often occurs in \n\n diabetic or pre-dϊabetic patients, by modulating the swings in the level of serum glucose that often occurs in these patients. The compounds may also be effective in treating or reducing insulin resistance. The compounds may be effective in treating or preventing gestational diabetes. The compounds, compositions, and medicaments as described herein may also be effective in reducing the risks of adverse sequelae associated with metabolic syndrome, and in reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, delaying the onset of atherosclerosis, and/or reducing the risk of sequelae of atherosclerosis. Sequelae of atherosclerosis include angina, claudication, heart attack, stroke, and others. By keeping hyperglycemia under control, the compounds may also be effective in delaying or preventing vascular restenosis and diabetic retinopathy.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention may also have utility in improving or restoring β-cell function, so that they may be useful in treating type 1 diabetes or in delaying or preventing a . patient with Type 2 diabetes from needing insulin therapy. The compounds generally may be efficacious in treating one or more of the following diseases: (1) Type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, or NIDDM), (2) hyperglycemia, (3) impaired glucose tolerance, (4) insulin resistance, (5) obesity, (6) lipid disorders, (7) dyslipidemia, (8) hyperlipidemia, (9) hypertriglyceridemia, (10) hypercholesterolemia, (11) low HDL levels, (12) high LDL levels, (13) atherosclerosis and its sequelae, (14) vascular restenosis, (15) abdominal obesity, (16) retinopathy, (17) metabolic syndrome, (18) high blood pressure (hypertension), and (19) insulin resistance.\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention provides a method for the treatment and control of mixed or diabetic dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, low HDL levels, high LDL levels, hyperlipidemia, and/or hypertriglyceridemia, which comprises administering to a patient in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound having formula I. The compound may be used alone or advantageously may be administered with a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor, particularly an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor such as lovastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rivastatin, itavastatin, or ZD-4522. The compound may also be used advantageously in combination with other lipid lowering drugs such as cholesterol absorption inhibitors (for example stanol esters, sterol glycosides such as tiqueside, and azetidinones such as ezetimibe), ACAT inhibitors (such as avasimibe), CETP inhibitors (for example torcetrapib and those described in published applications WO2005/100298, WO2006/014413, and WO2006/014357), niacin and niacin receptor agonists, bile acid sequestrants, microsomal triglyceride transport inhibitors, and bile acid reuptake inhibitors. These combination treatments may be effective for the treatment or control of one or more related conditions selected from the group consisting of: hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidemia, high LDL\n5\n and low HDL. \n\n Administration and Dose Ranges:\n\n\nAny suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dose of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. Preferably compounds of Formula I are administered orally.\n\n\nThe effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration, the condition being treated and the severity of the condition being treated. Such dosage may be ascertained readily by a person skilled in the art.\n\n\nWhen treating or controlling diabetes mellitus and/or hyperglycemia or hypertriglyceridemia or other diseases for which compounds of Formula I are indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 100 milligram per kilogram of animal body weight, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1 ,0 milligrams to about 1000 milligrams. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 1 milligram to about 500 milligrams. For a particularly potent compound, the dosage for an adult human may be as low as 0, 1 mg. In some cases, the daily dose may be as high as one gm. The dosage regimen may be adjusted within this range or even outside of this range to provide the optimal therapeutic response.\n\n\nOral administration will usually be carried out using tablets or capsules. Examples of doses in tablets and capsules are 0.1 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg. Other oral forms may also have the same or similar dosages.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions:\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient, as well as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and unsubstituted or other therapeutic ingredients. The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids. A pharmaceutical composition may also comprise a prodrug, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, if a prodrug is administered. \n\n The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\nIn practical use, the compounds of Formula I can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions as oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.\n\n\nBecause of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.\n\n\nSuch compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 percent of active compound. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. The active compounds can also be administered intranasally as, for example, liquid drops or spray.\n\n\nThe tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.\n\n\nIn some instances, depending on the solubility of the compound or salt being administered, it may be advantageous to formulate the compound or salt as a solution in an oil such as a triglyceride of one or more medium chain fatty acids, a lipophilic solvent such as triacetin, a hydrophilic solvent (e.g. propylene glycol), or a mixture of two or more of these, also unsubstituted or including one or more ionic or nonionic surfactants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, polysorbate 80, polyethoxylated triglycerides, and mono and/or diglycerides of one or \n\n more medium chain fatty acids. Solutions containing surfactants (especially 2 or more surfactants) will form emulsions or microemulsions on contact with water. The compound may also be formulated in a water soluble polymer in which it has been dispersed as an amorphous phase by such methods as hot melt extrusion and spray drying, such polymers including hydroxylpropylmethylcellulose acetate (HPMCAS), hydroxylpropylmethyl cellulose (HPMCS), and polyvinylpyrrolidinones, including the homopolymer and copolymers.\n\n\nVarious other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.\n\n\nCompounds of formula I may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant or mixture of surfactants such as hydroxypropylcellulose, polysorbate 80, and mono and diglycerides of medium and long chain fatty acids. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.\n\n\nCombination Therapy:\n\n\nCompounds of Formula I may be used in combination with other drugs that may also be useful in the treatment or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which compounds of Formula I are useful. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of Formula I. hi the treatment of patients who have Type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and co-morbidities that accompany these diseases, more than one drug is commonly administered. The compounds of this invention may generally be administered to a patient who is already taking one or more other drugs for these conditions. Often the compounds will be administered to a patient who is already being treated with one or more antidiabetic compound, such as metformin, sulfonylureas., and/or PPAR agonists, when the patient's glycemic levels are not adequately responding to treatment. \n\n When a compound of Formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula I is preferred. However, the combination therapy also includes therapies in which the compound of Formula I and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compound of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of Formula I. Examples of other active ingredients that may be administered in combination with a compound of Formula I, and either administered separately or in the same pharmaceutical composition, include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n(a) PPAR gamma agonists and partial agonists, including both glitazones and non- glitazones (e.g. troglitazone, pioglitazone, englitazone, MCC-555, rosiglitazone, balaglitazone, netoglitazone, T-131, LY-300512, LY-818, and compounds disclosed in WO02/08188, WO2004/020408, and WO2004/020409.\n\n\n(b) biguanides, such as metformin and phenformin;\n\n\n(c) protein tyrosine phosphatase- IB (PTP-IB) inhibitors;\n\n\n(d) dipeptidyl ρeρtidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, and alogliptin;\n\n\n(e) insulin or insulin mimetics;\n\n\n(f) sulfonylureas such as tolbutamide, glimepiride, glipizide, and related materials;\n\n\n(g) α-glucosidase inhibitors (such as acarbose);\n\n\n(h) agents which improve a patient's lipid profile, such as (i) HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rivastatin, itavastatin, ZD-4522 and other statins), (ii) bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, colestipol, and dialkylaminoalkyl derivatives of a cross-linked dextran), (iii) niacin receptor agonists, nicotinyl alcohol, nicotinic acid, or a salt thereof, (iv) PP ARa agonists, such as fenofibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil, clofϊbrate, fenofibrate and bezafibrate), (v) cholesterol absorption inhibitors, such as ezetimibe, (vi) acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors, such as avasimibe, (vii) CETP inhibitors, such as torcetrapib, and (viii) phenolic antioxidants, such as probucol; (i) PPARα/γ dual agonists, such as muraglitazar, tesaglitazar, farglitazar, and JT-501; Q) PPARδ agonists, such as those disclosed in WO97/28149; (k) anti-obesity compounds, such as fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, phentiramine, subitramine, orlistat, neuropeptide Y Y5 inhibitors, MC4R agonists, carmabinoid receptor 1 (CB- 1) antagonists/inverse agonists (e.g., rimonabant and taranabant), and β3 adrenergic receptor agonists; \n\n (1) ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors;\n\n\n(m) agents intended for use in inflammatory conditions, such, as aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, azulfidine, and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) selective inhibitors; (n) glucagon receptor antagonists;\n\n\n(o) GLP-I ;\n\n\n(p) GIP-I;\n\n\n(q) GLP-I analogs and derivatives, such as exendins, (e.g., exenatide and liruglatide), and (r) 1 lβ-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase- 1 (HSD-I) inhibitors.\n\n\nThe above combinations include combinations of a compound of the present invention not only with one other active compound, but also with two or more other active compounds. Non-limiting examples include combinations of compounds having Formula I with two or more active compounds selected from biguanides, sulfonylureas, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, other PPAR agonists, PTP-IB inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CBl) inverse agonists/antagonists.\n\n\nBIOLOGICAL ASSAYS\n\n\nSomatostatin Subtype Receptor 3 Production SSTR3 can be produced using techniques well known in the art including those involving chemical synthesis and those involving recombinant production. (See e.g., Vincent, Peptide and Protein Drug Delivery, New York, N. Y., Decker, 1990; Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley, 1987-2002, and Sambrook et al. , Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2\nn\n Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989.) Recombinant nucleic acid techniques for producing a protein involve introducing, or producing, a recombinant gene encoding the protein in a cell and expressing the protein. A purified protein can be obtained from cell. Alternatively, the activity of the protein in a cell or cell extract can be evaluated.\n\n\nA recombinant gene contains nucleic acid encoding a protein along with regulatory elements for protein expression. The recombinant gene can be present in a cellular genome or can be part of an expression vector.\n\n\nThe regulatory elements that may be present as part of a recombinant gene include those naturally associated with the protein encoding sequence and exogenous regulatory elements not naturally associated with the protein encoding sequence. Exogenous regulatory elements such as an exogenous promoter can be useful for expressing a recombinant gene in a particular host or increasing the level of expression. Generally, the regulatory elements that are present in a recombinant gene include a transcriptional promoter, a ribosome binding site, a terminator, and \n\n an unsubstituted or present operator. A preferred element for processing in eukaryotic cells is a polyadenylation signal.\n\n\nExpression of a recombinant gene in a cell is facilitated through the use of an expression vector. Preferably, an expression vector in addition to a recombinant gene also contains an origin of replication for autonomous replication in a host cell, a selectable marker, a limited number of useful restriction enzyme sites, and a potential for high copy number. Examples of expression vectors are cloning vectors, modified cloning vectors, specifically designed plasrmds and viruses.\n\n\nIf desired, expression in a particular host can be enhanced through codon optimization. Codon optimization includes use of more preferred codons. Techniques for codon optimization in different hosts are well known in the art.\n\n\nEnhancement of Glucose Dependent Insulin Secretion (GDIS) by SSTR3 antagonists in Isolated Mouse Islet Cells:\n\n\nPancreatic islets of Langerhans were isolated from the pancreas of normal C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Maine) by collagenase digestion and discontinuous Ficoll gradient separation, a modification of the original method of Lacy and Kostianovsky (Lacy et al, Diabetes 16:35-39, 1967). The islets were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 medium (11 mM glucose) before GDIS assay.\n\n\nTo measure GDIS, islets were first preincubated for 30 minutes in the Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer with 2 mM glucose (in petri dishes). The KRB medium contains\n\n\n143.5 mM Na\n+\n, 5.8 mM K\n+\n, 2.5 mM Ca\n2+\n, 1.2 mM Mg\n2+\n, 124.1 mM Cl\n\"\n, 1.2 mM PO\n4\n \n3\"\n, 1.2 mM SO\n4\n \n2+\n, 25 mM CO\n3\n \n2\"\n, 2 mg/raL bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). The islets were then transferred to a 96-well plate (one islet/well) and incubated at 37 \n0\nC for 60 minutes in 200 μl of KRB buffer with 2 or 16 mM glucose, and other agents to be tested such as octreotide and a SST3 antagonist. (Zhou et al., J. Biol. Chem. 275:51316-51323, 2003.) Insulin was measured in aliquots of the incubation buffer by ELISA with a commercial kit (ALPCO Diagnostics, Windham, NH).\n\n\nSSTR Binding Assays:\n\n\nThe receptor-ligand binding assays of all 5 subtype of SSTRs were performed with membranes isolated from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-Kl cells stably expressing the cloned human somatostatin receptors in 96-well format as previous reported. (Yang et al. PNAS 05:10836-10841, 1998, Birzin et al. Anal. Biochem.307ύ59-\\66, 2002.)\n\n\nThe stable cell lines for SSTRl -SSTR5 were developed by stably transfecting with DNA for all five SSTRs using Lipofectamine. Neomycin-resistant clones were selected and maintained in medium containing 400 μg/mL G418 (Rohxer et al. Science 282:737-740, 1998). Binding assays were performed using (3- I-Tyrl I)-SRIF- 14 as the radioligand (used at 0.1 nM) and The Packard Unifϊlter assay plate. The assay buffer consisted of 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.8) with 1 mM \n\n EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, leupeptin (10 μg/mL) , pepstatin (10 μg/rnL), bacitracin (200 μg/mL), and aprotinin (0.5 μg/mL). CHO-Kl cell membranes, radiolabeled somatostatin, and unlabeled test compounds were resuspended or diluted in this assay buffer. Unlabeled test compounds were examined over a range of concentrations from 0.01 nM to 10,000 nM. The K\n1\n values for compounds were determined as described by Cheng and Prusoff Biochem Pharmacol. 22:3099- 3108 (1973).\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention, particularly the compounds of Examples 1-59, were tested in the SSTR3 binding assay and found to have Kj values in the range of 600 nM to 0.1 nM against SSTR3, as shown in Table 1, and were found to have Kj values greater than 100 nM against SSTRl, SSTR2, SSTR4, and SSTR5 receptors. Preferred compounds of the present invention were found to have K| values in the range of 100 nM to 0.1 nM against SSTR3, and K\n1\n values greater than 100 nM against SSTRl, SSTR2, SSTR4, and SSTR5 receptors.\n\n\nFunctional Assay to Assess the Inhibition of SSTR3 Mediated Cyclic AMP Production: The effects of compounds that bind to human and murine SSTR3 with various affinities on the functional activity of the receptor were assessed by measuring cAMP production in the presence of Forskolin (FSK) along or FSK plus SS-H in SSTR3 expressing CHO cells. FSK acts to induce cAMP production in these cells by activating adenylate cyclases, whereas SS- 14 suppresses cAMP production in the SSTR3 stable cells by binding to SSTR3 and the subsequent inhibition of adenylate cyclases via an alpha subunit of GTP-binding protein (Gαi).\n\n\nTo measure the agonism activity of the compounds, we pre-incubated the human or mouse SSTR3 stable CHO cells with the compounds for 15 min, followed by a one-hour incubation of the cells with 3.5 μM FSK (in the continuous presence of the compounds). The amount of cAMP produced during the incubation was quantified with the Lance cAMP assay kit (PerkinElmer, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Majority of the compounds described in this application show no or little agonism activity. Therefore we used %Activation to reflect the agonism activity of each compound. The %Activation which was calculated with the following formula:\n\n\n%Activation = [(FSK - Unknown) / (FSK - SS-14] x 100\n\n\nTo measure the antagonism activity of the compounds, we pre-incubated the human or mouse SSTR3 stable CHO cells with the compounds for 15 min, followed by a one- hour incubation of the cells with a mixture of 3.5 μM FSK + 100 nM SS-14 (in the continuous presence of the compounds). The amount of cAMP produced during the incubation was also quantified with the Lance cAMP assay. The antagonism activity of each compound was reflected both by % Inhibition (its maximum ability to block the action of SS-14) and an EC\n50\n value which \n\n is the concentration of the test compound required to suppress the effect of 100 nM SS- 14 by 50%. The % Inhibition of each compound was calculated using the following formula:\n\n\n% Inhibition = [1 - (unknown cAMP /FSK+SS-14 cAMP)] x 100\n\n\nIn some case, 20% of human serum was included in the incubation buffer during the antagonism mode of the function assay to estimate the serum shift of the potency.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention, particularly the compounds of Examples 1-59, were tested in the SSTR3 functional antagonist assay and found to have EC\n50\n values of less than 2.5 micromolar, as shown in Table 1, and were found to have greater than 80 % Inhibition. Preferred compounds of the present invention were found to have EC\n50\n values of less than 0.5 micromolar in the SSTR3 antagonist assay, and greater than 80 % Inhibition. More preferred compounds of the present invention were found to have EC\n50\n values of less than 0.1 micromolar in the SSTR3 antagonist assay, and greater than 85 % Inhibition.\n\n\nGlucose Tolerance Test in Mice:\n\n\nMale C57BL/6N mice (7-12 weeks of age) are housed 10 per cage and given access to normal diet rodent chow and water ad libitum. Mice are randomly assigned to treatment groups and fasted 4 to 6 h. Baseline blood glucose concentrations are determined by glucometer from tail nick blood. Animals are then treated orally with vehicle (0.25% methylcellulose) or test compound. Blood glucose concentration is measured at a set time point after treatment (t = 0 min) and mice are then challenged with dextrose intraperitoneally- (2-3 g/kg) or orally (3-5 g/kg). One group of vehicle-treated mice is challenged with saline as a negative control. Blood glucose levels are determined from tail bleeds taken at 20, 40, 60 minutes after dextrose challenge. The blood glucose excursion profile from t = 0 to t = 60 min is used to integrate an area under the curve (AUC) for each treatment. Percent inhibition values for each treatment are generated from the AUC data normalized to the saline-challenged controls. A similar assay may be performed in rats. Compounds of the present invention are active after an oral dose in the range of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg.\n\n\nAbbreviations used in the following Schemes and Examples: aq.: aqueous; API-ES: atmospheric pressure ionization-electrospray (mass spectrum term); Ac: acetate; AcCN: acetonitrile; Boc: tørt-butyloxycarbonyl; Celite™: diatomaceous earth; CDI: carbonyl diimidazole; d: day(s); DCM: dichloromethane; DEAD: diethyl azodicarboxylate; DIPEA: AζA^diisopropylethylamine (Hunig's base); DMAP: 4-dimethylammopyridine; DMF: \n\n N,N-dimethylformamide; DMSO: dimethylsulfoxide; EDC: l-elhyl-3-(3- dimethylaminoproρyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride; EPA: ethylene polyacrylamide (a plastic); eq: equivalents); EtOAc: ethyl acetate; EtOH: ethanol; g: gram(s); h or hr: hour(s); Hex: hexane; HOBt: 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; HPLC: high pressure liquid chromatography; HPLC/MS: high pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectrum; in vacuo: rotary evaporation under diminished pressure; IBX: 2-iodosobenzoic acid; iPrOH or IPA: isopropyl alcohol; IPAC or IPAc: isopropyl acetate; KHMDS: potassium hexamethyldisilazide; L: liter; LC: Liquid chromatography; LC-MS: liquid cliromatography-mass spectrum; LDA: lithium diisopropylamide; M: molar; Me: methyl; MeCN: methylcyanide; MeI: methyl iodide; MeOH: methanol; MHz: megahertz; mg: milligram; min: minute(s); ml or mL: milliliter; mmol: millimole; MPLC: medium-pressure liquid chromatography; MS or ms: mass spectrum; MTBE: methyl tert-bvάyl ether; N: normal; NaHMDS: sodium hexamethyldisilazide; nm: nanometer; NMR: nuclear magnetic resonance; NMM: N- methylmorpholine; PyBOP: (benzotriazol-1 -yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafiuorophosphate; R^: retention time; rt or RT: room temperature; satd.: saturated; SFC: super critical fluid chromatography; TEA: triethylamine; TFA: trifluoroacetic acid; TFAA: trifluoroacetic acid anhydride; THF: tetrahydrofuran; TLC or tic: thin layer chromatography; Ts: toluene sulfonyl; and TsOH: toluene sulfonic acid.\n\n\nSeveral methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are illustrated in the following Schemes and Examples.

Reaction of B with ammonium acetate affects cyclization to substituted imidazole C. Then the protecting group is removed; in this example the N-Boc group is removed with tosic acid to yield the his-tosylate D.

The mixture was heated to reflux overnight. The mixture was then diluted with CH2CI2, washed with saturated NaHCθ3, dried and concentrated to give a dark oil. HCl gas was bubbled into EtOH (25 mL) for about 45 seconds (the EtOH absorbed 2.9 g of HCl to give a 10% solution of HCl in EtOH). This EtOH/HCl solution was added to the dark oil obtained above. After stirring for 6 hours, the reaction was concentrated and the resulting residue was diluted with EtOAc and concentrated again. The resulting dark liquid was purified on a flash column using 30-70% EtOAc-hexane to give the title compound. \n\n Step B: Ethyl (3RV3-f4-r5-Fluoropyridin-2-yl)-lH-imidazol-2-vl)-l-(5-methvl-l,2,4- oxadiazol-3-γl)- 2.3 A9-tetrahydro- 1 H-β-carboline- 1 -carboxylate.

After 30 minutes, the reaction was cooled, diluted with EtOAc and filtered through a pad of Celtic™. The filtrate was concentrated to give a liquid. To this liquid, were added (lR)-2-(lf/-indol-3-yI)-l- (4-(5-fluoro-pyridin-2-yl)-l/i-imidazol-2-yl)-ethylamine ditosylate (0.8 g, 1.202 mmol) and sodium acetate (0.1 g, 1.219 mmol), followed by the addition of EtOH (1 mL). The mixture was heated in 80 \n0\nC bath for 2 hours. The reaction was then allowed to cool overnight, and quenched with aqueous Na2CO3. The mixture was extracted with ether-EtO Ac. The organic layer was separated, washed with water, brine, dried and concentrated. The resulting residue was purified on a flash column with a gradient of 10-30% of solvent B in CH2C12, where solvent B is 78:10:2 CH2Cl2/MeOH/NB4OH, to give the desired product as a mixture of two isomers.

The molecules display high affinity for MOR and, because they do not include amino acids, they are relatively stable in vivo. The ligands carry structural features that enable them to interact with the aromatic binding locus built by the amino acid residues which form the extracellular part of MOR, and may also satisfy hydrogen binding requirements from the binding locus. The molecules wHl find use in methods for identifying MOR agonists, hi addition, the molecules themselves may be used to treat addiction symptoms, such as heroin or prescription opioid drug addiction.\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the invention, then the compounds are C- 14 substituted compounds represented by Formula 1 :\n\n\nFormula 1:\n\n\n \n\n where Z is a spacer element and R is an aromatic or aliphatic moiety, which may be substituted or unsubstituted. Z may be present or absent. IfZ is present, Z may be: aliphatic (e.g. short aliphatic chain (CH\n2\n)n where n = 1-5); NH; CO; (NHCO)n where n = 1-5; (CONH)n where n = 1-5; (NHCO)(CH\n2\n)n(NHCO), where n = 1-5; (C0NH)(CH\n2\n)n(C0NH), where n = 1-5;\n\n\n(NHCO)(CH\n2\n)n where n =1 -5; (C0NH)(CH\n2\n)n where n =1-5; (CH\n2\n)n(NHCO), where n = 1 -5; (CH\n2\n)n(CONH), where n = 1 -5; O (in which case Z is a single atom); CxHy (x = 1 -5, y = 0 - 10).\n\n\nExamples of unsubstituted aromatic moieties that may be R include but are not limited to phenyl or naphthalene. The aromatic substitutent R may be a substituted aromatic (i.e. a heteroaromatic) and may be substituted at one or more positions, either within the ring, or bonded or attached to the ring.

For example, n may be 0 (i.e. Y is absent), or n may be 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, or more, and is preferably 0, 1 , 2 or 3. Other possible Y equivalents include but are not limited to CxHy (x = 1-5, y = 0 - 10).\n\n\nWith respect to Formula 4, when X = O, the resulting compound is represented as in Formula 5:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand when X = NH, the compounds are represented as in Formula 6: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 6.\n\n\nFor Formulas 5 and 6, Y and R are as represented in Formula 4.\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the invention, the compounds substituted at C6 may be represented as in Formula 7:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula ? where X = O or NH; Y = an aliphatic moiety (as defined for Formula 4 above), or, in some embodiments, absent; and R is defined as for Formula 2, with the caveat that if X = NH and Y is absent, then R cannot be phenyl or naphthalene.\n\n\nWith respect to Formula 7, when X = O, the compounds may be represented as in Formula 8: \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 8\n\n\nand when X = NH, they are represented as in Formula 9:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 9.\n\n\nFor Formulas 8 and 9, Y and R are as described for Formula 7. For Formula 9, if Y is absent, then R cannot be phenyl or naphthalene.\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the invention, the R group is phenyl or naphthalene or a substituted phenyl or naphthalene (for example, N substituted phenyl or naphthalene, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticular embodiments of the compounds of the invention include: \n\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\n9. \n\n The compounds of the invention display selectivity for MOR in comparison to other receptors, e.g. other related receptors of interest such as one or both or DOR and KOR. By \"selective\" or \"selectivity\" we mean that the compounds of the invention display at least a 10- fold greater binding affinity for MOR than for one or more other receptors (at least one other receptor) of interest. In some cases, the compounds display binding affinities that are about 10, about 50, about 100, about 500 or about 1000-fold or greater for MOR than for other receptors, as measured by standard techniques that are known to those of skill in the art, and described, for example, in the Examples section herein. Further, in some embodiments, the antagonists may be used to identify or characterize other receptors as well.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention are generally MOR antagonists. By \"antagonist\" we mean a receptor ligand that does not provoke a biological response upon binding to a receptor, but which blocks or dampens (decreases, lessens, etc.) agonist-mediated responses. (An \"agonist\" is a ligand that binds to a receptor and triggers a response, i.e. an agonist produces an action, often mimicking the action of a naturally occurring substance.) Antagonists thus have affinity but no efficacy for their cognate receptors, and binding of an antagonist to a receptor will disrupt the interaction and. inhibit the function of an agonist or inverse agonist at receptors. Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonist-receptor complex, which, in turn, depends on the nature of antagonist receptor binding.\n\n\nThe MOR opioid antagonists of the invention have a variety of applications. For example, they may be used in competitive assays to identify MOR agonists. MOR agonists are, in fact, defined as opoid agonists only if their effect is competitively inhibited by a known opioid antagonist. The application thus provides methods of identifying a substance as a MOR opioid agonist by analyzing the results of competitive binding assays. Those of'skill in the art are familiar with such competition experiments, which are typically carried out under controlled conditions in the absence of antagonist (to establish a baseline of binding by the possible agonist) and also in the presence of antagonist at a variety of concentrations of antagonist while \n\n the concentration of candidate agonist is held constant. Levels of binding of the candidate agonist in the absence of the antagonist and at increasing concentrations of antagonist are measured by any suitable means, and may be measured directly or indirectly. If the presence of the antagonist interferes with (inhibits) the binding of the test substance to the receptor (i.e. if the presence of antagonist prevents or decreases binding of the test substance to the receptor), then the substance being tested is deemed to be a receptor agonist. Variations of competitive assays, the mathematical and statistical analysis of results obtained in this manner, and the interpretation of such analyses, are well known.\n\n\nFurther testing of the compounds of the invention may reveal agonist activity on the part of one or more compounds, in which case the compounds may be used and administered as agonists or partial agonists of MOR.\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the invention, the selective antagonists of the invention may be used, for example, in medical applications. For example, the antagonists of the invention may be administered to a subject or patient in need of treatment for addictions that involve the MOR receptor, such as drug and alcohol addictions. MOR is the receptor that is accessed by heroin and by several other opioids (e.g. commercial or prescription opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, oxymophone, etc.). Other naturally occurring opiates and semi-synthetic opiods also access this receptor Several such substances are known and patients to whom they are prescribed and/or more frequently subjects who obtain them illegally for recreational use are liable to become addicted, and to exhibit symptoms of addiction. Symptoms of addiction which may be lessened or treated by the administration of the antagonists of the invention include but are not limited to craving for the addictive substance, physical and psychological dependence, CNS-mediated respiration depression, dysphoria, sweating, nausea, rhinorrea, depression, severe fatigue, vomiting and pain, insomnia, etc. The MOR selective antagonists of the invention may be used to treat such addictions, e.g. to lessen or alleviate symptoms of withdrawal, e.g. during addiction treatment.\n\n\nIn addition, the MOR antagonists of the invention may be used to treat conditions such as pain, neuropathic pain, alcoholism, cocaine addiction, Parkinson's disease, gambling addiction, obesity, epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective \n\n disorder, inflammation, gastrointestinal tract disturbance, ADDS, etc.\n\n\nThe invention thus also provides compositions and formulations comprising the antagonists. The compositions include one or more substantially purified antagonists and a pharmacologically suitable carrier. The preparation of such compositions is well known to those of skill in the art. Typically, such compositions are prepared either as liquid solutions or suspensions, however solid forms such as tablets, pills, powders and the like are also contemplated. Solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquids prior to administration may also be prepared. The preparation may also be emulsified. The active ingredients may be mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredients. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like, or combinations thereof. In addition, the composition may contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, and the like. If it is desired to administer an oral form of the composition, various thickeners, flavorings, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders and the like may be added. The composition of the present invention may contain any such additional ingredients so as to provide the composition in a form suitable for administration. The final amount of antagonist in the formulations may vary. However, in general, the amount in the formulations will be from about 1 to about 99%.\n\n\nThe antagonist compositions (preparations) of the present invention may be administered by any of the many suitable means which are well known to those of skill in the art, including but not limited to by injection, inhalation, orally, intranasally, by ingestion of a food product containing the antagonist, topically, as eye drops, via sprays, etc. In preferred embodiments, the mode of administration is orally or by injection. In addition, the compositions may be administered in conjunction with other treatment modalities such as other medicaments, other types of therapy (e.g. psychological or psychiatric treatment), and the like.\n\n\nThe amount of antagonist that is administered to an individual (who is usually a mammal, typically a human) will vary based on several factors, as will be understood by those of skill in the art. For example, the dose and frequency of administration may vary according to the gender, age, weight, general physical condition, ethnic background, etc. of the individual, as \n\n well as whether or not the individual has other diseases or conditions that might impinge on the treatment. Generally, the dose will be in the range of from about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight.\n\n\nThe ensuing Examples are intended to further illustrate the present invention, but should not be interpreted as limiting in any way.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1. H-O-Heterocyclic-Substituted Naltrexone Derivatives as Non-Peptide Mu Opioid Receptor Selective Antagonists: Design, Synthesis and Biological Studies Abstract: Mu opioid receptor antagonists have clinical utility and are important research tools. In order to develop non-peptide and highly selective mu opioid receptor antagonist, a series of 14-O-heterocyclic substituted naltrexone derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated. These compounds showed subnanomolar to nanomolar binding affinity for the mu opioid receptor. Among them, compound 1 exhibited the highest selectivity for the mu opioid receptor over the delta and kappa receptors. These results implicated an alternative \"address\" domain in the extracellular loops of the mu opioid receptor.\n\n\nOpioid receptors were generally classified into three subtypes based on the pharmacological, behavioral, and biochemical studies. \nU3\n Opioid antagonists have played very important roles in the study of opioid receptors. In fact, an agonist is characterized as opioid- receptor-mediated only if its effect is competitively inhibited by an opioid antagonist.\n4 5\n It is important to have receptor-selective opioid antagonists as tools to identify the receptor types related to the interaction with opioid agonists.\n4\"6\n The mu opioid receptor (MOR) is the major type that mediates opioid analgesic effects of morphine, although all three opioid receptors can be involved in analgesia. The characterization of the MOR structure-function relationship is essential because it has been found that morphine's analgesic effect, addictive properties, and other major side effects are abolished in MOR knock-out mice.\n7\n'\n8\n Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the analgesic effects and the adverse side effects (including addiction and abuse liability) of morphine are primarily due to its interaction with the M0R.4 In fact, naltrexone, an opioid antagonist with moderate selectivity for the MOR, has been shown to \n\n block relapse and curb drug craving in post-dependent opiate addicts.\n9\n'\n10\n Recent research results also indicate that MOR antagonists can be used in the treatment of obesity, psychosis and Parkinson's disease.\" Furthermore, highly selective MOR antagonists can be used as probes to characterize the MOR binding pocket. Yet the lack of a non-peptidyl, highly selective, and potent MOR antagonist limits our understanding of the structure-function relationship of the MOR, the interaction of non-peptidyl MOR agonists with the receptor, and more specifically, the activation mechanism of the receptor related to its role in drug abuse and addiction.\n\n\nSchwyzer et al proposed the \"message-address\" concept in his analysis of the structure- activity relationship of ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and related hormones.12 By applying the \"message-address\" concept, highly selective non-peptide antagonists for the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) (e.g. norbinaltorphimine (norBNI) and 5'-guanidinonaltrindole (GNTI)),\n13\n'\n14\n and for the delta opioid receptor (DOR) (e.g. naltrindole (NTI))\n15\n were designed and synthesized several years ago. (Figure 1) Thus far no potent and highly selective antagonist derived from morphinan's structural skeleton has been developed for the MOR, although some moderately potent ligands, e.g. cyprodime,\n16\n are available. Compared with the high selectivity of GNTI for the KOR (Ki value ratios are mu/kappa~120, delta/kappa~250)\n14\n and NTI for the DOR (Ki value ratios are mu/delta~152, kappa/delta=276),\n15\n cyprodime only has a moderate selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and KOR (Ki value ratios are kappa/mu=45, deIta/mu~40).\n17\n At the same time, β -funaltrexamine (β-FNA), clocinnamox, and other compounds, act as selective but irreversible antagonists for the MOR.\n18\n Therefore the development of a highly selective, non-peptidyl, and reversible MOR antagonist is highly desired.\n\n\nIt was reported that the extracellular loop (EL) domains of the MOR are critical for the binding of MOR selective agonists, such as morphine, sufentanil, lofentanil and DAMGO.\n19\n At the same time, site-directed mutagenesis studies have revealed that certain amino acid residues in this domain may be essential for ligand (including agonist and antagonist) selectivity for the MOR over the other two opioid receptor types.\n20\n Therefore, a non-peptide ligand with potential interaction with the EL domains of the MOR, would be favorable for its selectivity for the MOR. \n\n Due to the lack of the crystal structure of the MOR, so far most molecular design efforts directed toward development of selective opioid ligands have been based on structure-activity- relationship studies. As a matter of fact, in the entire superfamily of GPCRs, only the X-ray crystal structures of bovine rhodopsin,\n21\"24\n opsin,\n25\n and the human β 2-\n26\"29\n and β 1-adrenergic receptor\n30\n have been successfully obtained with high resolution. Thus far, most of the molecular models of other GPCRs have been constructed using rhodopsin's structure as a template via homology modeling. Homology modeling of GPCRs has been successfully applied to further understand ligand-protein interactions, and to identify new and potent ligands. It is believed that with all the lessons learned from previous experience, GPCR homology modeling based on the bovine rhodopsin X-ray crystal structure can aid in structure-based drug design and virtual screening for therapeutic applications.\n31'38\n For example, a homology model of the Angiotensin II Type 1 (ATI) receptor was used to further explore the binding sites of several non-peptide ATI receptor antagonists.\n39\n A homology model of the Ml muscarinic acetylcholine receptor was applied to understand the mechanism by which the agonist-receptor complex activates G\n\n\n40 proteins.\n\n\nRecently, we reported the construction of a MOR homology model based on the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin.\n41\n This model contained not only the transmembrane helical domains, but also the extracellular and intracellular loops so that the model we obtained was integrated and complete. This model was further optimized in a membrane-aqueous system by molecular dynamics simulations. Similar homology models of the DOR and KOR were then constructed (see supplementary information for details). Naltrexone is an ideal template for the design of selective MOR antagonists, because it has subnanomolar to nanomolar affinity for all three opioid receptor types and shows moderate selectivity for the MOR over the other two opioid receptor types. Figure 2 shows that in a representative binding mode of naltrexone in the MOR, the 14-hydroxyl group of naltrexone is pointing to the EL3 loop and the upper-level region of TM6/7. Compared to the amino acid residues in the corresponding domains of the KOR and DOR, some non-conserved residues, e.g. Tyr212 and Trp320, in MOR could act as hydrogen bonding donor/acceptors. This unique feature in the MOR antagonist binding locus might form an alternative \"address\" domain to differentiate the antagonist binding mode of the \n\n MOR over the DOR and KOR. Therefore, a new compound containing specific structural features to interact with these amino acid residues might have increased selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and KOR.\n\n\nBased on this hypothesis, a series of novel 14-0-substituted naltrexone derivatives (Figure 3) have been designed and synthesized. The ester bond in these novel ligands was assumed to provide a flexible conformation for the whole side chain. The nitrogen atom in the hetero-aromatic moiety on the 14-0-position of naltrexone was introduced to provide an opportunity for hydrogen bonding and/or aromatic stacking interaction with the amino acid residues Tyr212 and Trp320 in the MOR binding pocket (compound 1-3 and 5-7). Compound 4 and 8 were designed as control compounds to test this hypothesis. These ligands could also be considered as derivatives of clocinnamox without the Michael acceptor character.\n\n\nUsing naltrexone as the starting material, the syntheses of these 14-O-heterocyclic substituted derivatives was straightforward (Figure 4). To be noticed, in the second step of the synthesis route, K\n2\nCO\n3\n aqueous solution was used to prepare the control compounds 4 and 8 instead of using the acidic condition. AU the final compounds were obtained with reasonable yield and characterized with NMR, IR, MS, and HPLC (See supplementary information). The primary biological studies of these ligands included competitive radioligand-binding assays using mono-cloned opioid receptors expressed in CHO cell lines. [\n3\nH]DAMGO, [\n3\nH] NTI and [\n3\nH] norBNI were used to label the MOR, DOR and KOR respectively. The binding affinities of these ligands for the MOR, DOR and KOR, and comparative selectivities were' summarized in Table 1. These compounds showed binding affinities in the subnanomolar to nanomolar range for the MOR.\n\n\nTable 1.

The averages were reported along with their standard error of the means, SEM, for each compound. The comparison to percent stimulation of DAMGO was the Emax of the compound compared to the Emax of DAMGO (normalized to 100%). The DAMGO EC\n50\n value was 45.1 ± 6.63 nM and its Emax value was 366 ± 23% stimulation over basal using a [\n35\nS] GTPγS functional assay. Naltrexone, β-FNA and CTAP were tested along as positive controls under the same conditions. \n\n Also as shown above, all of these compounds exhibited different levels of selectivity for the MOR over the KOR and DOR. Among these, compound 1 had approximately 800-fold selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and nearly 200-fold selectivity over the KOR. Compound 5 also showed over 100-fold selectivity for the MOR over the other two receptor types, although its binding affinity for the MOR was significantly lower than compound 1. In addition, all of these compounds acted as MOR antagonists in \n35\n[S]GTPγS functional assays except for compound 7, which was a partial agonist.\n\n\nCompared to the control compounds 4 and 8, the MOR selectivity over DOR and KOR had been enhanced greatly in all of the other compounds. This result suggested that the 14-0- substitutions introduced onto the naltrexone skeleton might interact with the proposed alternative \"address\" domain in the MOR, and the nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring might act as a hydrogen bond acceptor and play an important role for the selectivity. Among all of these ligands, compound 1 showed the highest selectivity, which suggested that it had the most favorable orientation of its side chain towards this plausible \"address\" binding domain in the MOR. For compound 5, its side chain might confer selectivity for the MOR, whereas the bulkiness of its side chain also might have reduced its binding affinity for the MOR. To further characterize compound 1 as the lead for our next generation molecular design, its antagonism was evaluated against DAMGO in \n35\n[S]GTPγS functional assay. The concentration of compound 1 was 1.5 nM while DAMGO was in the range of 10 nM to 10,000 nM. The Ke value of compound was 0.20 ± 0.04 nM and apparent pA2 value was 9.72 ± 0.10. This observation was consistent with the binding affinity results and further verified that compound 1 could be used as the lead for future molecular design.\n\n\nIt has been reported by Schmidhammer et al., that 14-alkoxymorphinans showed very high opioid receptor affinity. These compounds exhibited significantly increased binding affinities at all opioid receptors without any specific preference for any one receptor type.\n42\"44\n Recently, Husbands et al. investigated the SAR of the analogs of clocinnamox, 14- \n\n aminodihydromorphinones and 14-aminodihydrocodeinones, in order to explore the effect of changing the chain linking and substitution in the aromatic ring of cinnanioylaminomoφhinones and codeinones.\n45\"47\n These authors found that a modest selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and KOR was achieved when the side chain on the 14 positions was comparably rotatable in these 14-aminiodihydromorphinone compounds.\n\n\nComparing to the compounds reported by Schmidhammer and Husbands, the compounds reported here showed similar affinity for the MOR, but much higher selectivity over the DOR and KOR. One possible explanation might be that the introduction of a shorter side chain and a more flexible ester bond in our compounds might lead to a more favorable conformation and orientation of the side chain to target, the \"address\" locus and thereby improve selectivity for the MOR. Certainly this \"address\" locus needs to be further verified, e.g. by site- directed mutagenesis, in future studies.\n\n\nIn summary, a series of 14-0-heterocyclic substituted naltrexone derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as selective MOR antagonists. Most of these novel ligands exhibited subnanomolar to nanomolar binding affinity for the MOR, with compound 1 showing the highest selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and KOR. These results implicated a plausible \"address\" domain in the extracellular loops of. the MOR. The knowledge gained from these studies will enrich the \"message-address\" concept that has been applied successfully in opioid research and may lead to the identification of potent MOR selective non-peptide antagonists.\n\n\nReferences for Example 1\n\n\n1.

Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 60,-and 6β-N-Heterocyclic Substituted Naltrexamine Derivatives as Mu Opioid Receptor Selective Antagonists Abstract\n\n\nOpioid receptor selective antagonists are important pharmacological probes in opioid receptor structural characterization and opioid agonist functional study. Thus far a nonpeptidyl, \n\n highly selective, and reversible mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist is unavailable. Based on our modeling studies, a series of novel naltrexamine derivatives have been designed and synthesized. Among them, two compounds were identified as leads based on the results of in vitro and in vivo assays. Both of them displayed high binding affinity for the MOR (Ki = 0.37 nM and 0.55 nM). Compound 6 (NAP) showed over 700-fold selectivity for the MOR over the delta receptor (DOR) and more than 150-fold selectivity over the kappa receptor (KOR). Compound 9 (NAQ) showed over 200-fold selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and approximately 50-fold selectivity over the KOR. Thus these two novel ligands will serve as leads to further develop more potent and selective antagonists for the MOR. Introduction\n\n\nOpioid antagonists have played very important roles in the study of opioid receptors. In fact, the action of an agonist is characterized as opioid-receptor-mediated only if it is competitively antagonized by an opioid antagonist.\n1\n'\n2\n Receptor-selective opioid antagonists are important tools to identify the receptor types that mediate the effects of opioid agonists.\n3\n The characterization of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) is essential because the analgesic function and addiction/abuse liability of many clinically available opiates are primariJy due to their interaction with the MOR.\n1\n\"\n2\n'\n4\n Thus,.MOR selective antagonists are essential for the study of MOR function in drug abuse and addiction. In fact, some antagonists with relatively low selectivity for MOR, e.g. naltrexone, have been shown to inhibit relapse and curb drug craving in opiate addicts.\n5\"7\n \n\n\nBased on the \"message-address concept\", highly selective non-peptide antagonists for the kappa opioid receptor (e.g. norbinaltorphimine (norBNT) and 5'-guanidinonaltrindole (GNTr)),\n8\n'\n9\n and for the delta receptor (e.g. naltrindole (NTI))\n10\n (Figure 5) were designed and synthesized several years ago. These compounds are widely used as selective ligands in pharmacological studies.\n\n\nThus far, however, no optimal non-peptide antagonist has been developed for the MOR, although some moderately potent ligands, e.g. cyprodime\" are available. Compared with the high selectivity of GNTI for the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) (Ki values ratios are mu/kappa~120, \n\n\n and NTI for the delta opioid receptor (DOR) (Ki values \n\n ratios are mu/delta~l 52, kappa/delta~276),\n10\n cyprodime only has a moderate selectivity of the MOR over the DOR and KOR (Ki values ratios are kappa/τnu«45, delta/mu=40).\n12\n Another drawback of cyprodime is that it has much lower affinity for the MOR than naloxone and naltrexone,\" which limits its utility. Further structure-activity relationship studies of cyprodime derivatives did not generate any additional antagonist with significantly improved affinity or selectivity for the MOR.\n13\"17\n Although β-funaltrexamine (β -FNA), clocinnamox, and others (Figure 6), have been reported as selective and irreversible non-peptide antagonists for MOR,'\n8'\n \n21\n the fact that they bind covalently with the receptor largely limits their utility. In most cases, a reversible antagonist would be preferred because it can inhibit the receptors temporarily for pharmacological study and then can be washed out from the binding locus to \"revive\" the receptors afterwards:\n\n\nMost highly selective and reversible mu opioid receptor antagonists currently available are conformation-constrained peptides, e.g. CTOP and CTAP. \n22'28\n They are relatively metabolically stable and have been used to target the MOR in in vitro and in vivo studies while their limited bioavailability may not be suitable for many types of in vivo studies and for medical applications. Optimal utility of antagonists as pharmacological tools requires both in vitro and in vivo activity. Non-peptide ligands are preferred due to their ability to penetrate the CNS and lesser vulnerability to metabolic inactivation compared to the peptide agents. Therefore, the development of a non-peptide, potent, selective and reversible antagonist for the mu opioid receptor is highly desirable.\n\n\nNaltrexone is a promising template for the design of the opioid receptor selective ligands. The successful modification of naltrexone in the synthesis of NTI, norBNI and GNTI are good examples. While naltrexone has nanomolar affinity for all three opioid receptors, it also shows moderate selectivity for the MOR over DOR and KOR. Some chemical structure features are essential for its high affinity for the opioid receptors and should not be abolished. For example, the addition of a 3-hydroxyl group onto cyprodime and its derivatives will \"'markedly enhance affinity at all three opioid receptors\".\n13\n In addition, the chemistry related to the structural modification of naltrexone has been thoroughly studied. This information will be beneficial to the synthetic route design of naltrexone derivatives. \n\n In this Example, we report the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of two series of novel naltrexone-derived ligands as selective MOR antagonists. Molecular modeling of the naltrexone binding pocket in the homology models of the three opioid receptors led to the identification of an alternative \"address\" domain in the MOR that may enhance selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and KOR. Two series of ligands were designed and synthesized as proof-of-concept. Biological evaluation of these two series of compounds revealed some ligands with high affinity and selectivity for the MOR. Based on these results, two exemplary compounds have been identified for future optimization. Results and Discussion Molecular modeling\n\n\nTo facilitate ligand design, homology models of all three opioid receptors were constructed. To date, in the whole superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), only the X-ray crystal structures of bovine rhodopsin,\n29\"32\n opsin,\n33\n and the human β2- and βl- adrenergic receptor \n34\"38\n have been successfully obtained with high resolution. Most molecular models of other GPCRs have been constructed using the rhodopsin structure as a template. Therefore, homology models of the mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors were constructed based on the X-ray crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin after sequence alignment (Figure 7). Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to optimize the conformation of the models. The models contain not only the transmembrane helices, but also the extracellular and intracellular domains so that these models were integrated and complete. The MOR model was also optimized in a membrane-aqueous system.\n39\n The DOR and KOR models were also optimized following the same method. All amino acid residues in these three models have reasonable bond lengths and bond angles. The analysis of φ, ψ, χl, χ2 angles of the resulting protein conformations was further conducted with Procheck 4.1. Because naltrexone is a universal antagonist at all three opioid receptors with moderate selectivity for the MOR, we decided to use it as a probe molecule to identify the antagonist binding site in all three opioid receptors. By comparison of the differences among these three binding pockets, we attempted to identify the amino acid residues that are critical to ligand selectivity for the MOR. Three steps were involved in the identification of the critical amino \n\n acid residues that differentiate the binding affinity\n'\nof naltrexone in the three opioid receptors. The first step was the interactive docking of naltrexone into the binding locus of the receptor to form the ligand-receptor complex. The second step was energy minimization and molecular dynamics carried out for the ligand-receptor system to relax and optimize binding interactions between the ligand and amino acid residues in the binding cavity. The third step is the identification and comparison of the naltrexone binding locus in all the three receptors. The ligand-receptor complex structure obtained after 11 ps of molecular dynamics simulation is depicted in Figure 8A-C. In these complexes, the distance between the protonated nitrogen atom in the 17-amino group of NTX and the carboxyl group of Aspl47 (D3.32) was initially anchored at 4.0 A and retained at this value by a weak harmonic restraint (2 kcal/A) during the molecular dynamics simulation to represent the putative salt bridge that has been inferred from experimental studies.\n53\n In the lowest energy conformation of the complex extracted from the last 5 ps molecular dynamics simulation, the distance (4.1 A) was compatible with the initial setting. As shown in Figure 8A, the binding pocket of naltrexone the entire molecule in the MOR was mainly composed of aliphatic amino acid residues. The positively charged amino moiety of the ligand was within the range of an ionic interaction with Aspl47 (D3.32). We also noticed that the carbonyl group on C(6) of naltrexone was orientating towards an aromatic binding pocket formed mainly by amino acid residues from the extracellular loops (ELs) of the receptor, including Tyr210 (Yxl2.43) and Phe221 (Fxl2.54) from EL2 and Trp318 (W7.35) at the border of EL3 and Helix 7.\n\n\nIn Figure 8B, the naltrexone's binding pocket in the DOR was very similar to that in the MOR except that there existed no aromatic binding locus formed by multiple amino acid residues to which the C(6) carbonyl group of naltrexone pointed. At the conserved region, only Phe202 (Fxl2.54) from EL2 was in the vicinity while Prol91 (Pxl2.43) and Leu300 (L7.35) are not aromatic ones. This difference might be applicable in the design of ligands that are selective for the MOR over the DOR.\n\n\nFurther study of the naltrexone binding pocket in the KOR (Figure 8C) showed that there was an aromatic/aliphatic binding pocket formed with the contribution of Phe214 (Fxl2.54) from EL2, Phe231 (F5.37) on Helix 5, and Tyr313 (Y7.35) from Helix 7. However, only one \n\n residue Tyr313 (Y7.35) may form hydrogen bond with the ligand, while in the MOR binding locus at least two of them are available to be considered.\n\n\nTherefore, our molecular modeling study of the MOR antagonist binding pocket using naltrexone as the probe has revealed an aromatic binding locus at the extracellular loop region. Further comparison with the DOR and KOR antagonist binding pockets indicated that the existence of amino acid residues acting as potential hydrogen bonding donors and/or acceptors may be a unique structural feature of this aromatic binding locus in the MOR. Therefore, this binding domain may serve as an alternate \"address\" motif in the MOR that contributes to ligand recognition of the MOR selectively over DOR and KOR. Molecular design targeting to this \"address\" domain could lead to the identification of selective MOR antagonists. To be noticed, accumulated evidence has shown that the extracellular loops of GPCRs may play a critical role in the binding pocket of their small molecule ligands, including a number of opioid receptor agonists and antagonists.\n39\"46\n It has been found that EL3 of the MOR is critical for the binding of MOR-selective agonists by comparing their binding affinities for M0R/D0R and MOR/KOR chimeric receptors with those for the wild-type MOR, DOR and KOR.\n43 44\n Site-directed mutagenesis studies have revealed that certain amino acid residues in EL3 could be essential for ligand (including agonist and antagonist) selectivity for the MOR.\n45\"47\n More specifically, Trp318 from EL3 has been identified as an important residue for the binding affinity and selectivity of varies ligands for the MOR.\n40\n'\n41\n '\n43\n'\n48\n These reports are consistent with the observation from our modeling studies. Molecular design\n\n\nBased on the molecular modeling study, two series of ligands were designed as MOR selective antagonists (Table 2). None of them have been discussed in the literature as selective opioid receptor ligands. \n\n\n\n\nTable 2. The ligands designed as the mu opioid receptor selective antagonists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound R C6- Compound R C6- configuration configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 α 13 α\n\n\n6 -€ > β 14 β\n\n\n7 α 1\n'\n5 α\n\n\nV=\n\n\n8 β 16 β\n\n\nIn the structure of these ligands, we introduced a hetero-aromatic moiety onto the 6- position of naltrexone. An amide bond was adopted as the linkage of the side chain moiety to the morphinan skeleton. Therefore, these ligands can be considered derivatives of naltrexamine. The configuration of C(6) will be either α or β. Such a stereochemical arrangement could play an important role for the affinity and the selectivity of the ligand, as has been demonstrated by β-FNA and β-FNA.49 The aromatic character of this side chain was designed to have aromatic stacking interaction with the aromatic binding locus in the MOR in order to differentiate from the DOR. The nitrogen atom Ln the aromatic system will act as a hydrogen bond acceptor to probe for the potential formation of a hydrogen bond with Tyr210 or Trp318 in the binding \n\n locus from the ELs of the MOR in order to possibly differentiate from the KOR. Compounds with phenyl and naphthalenyl substitutions were designed as control compounds to test our hypothesis. These two series of ligands served as proof-of-concept to test the identification of the alternate \"address\" domain in MOR. Chemical synthesis\n\n\nFor the synthesis of these 6-substituted derivatives of naltrexamine, the starting material was naltrexone. The stereoselective synthesis of α - and β -naltrexamine has been applied successfully in the synthesis of their derivatives in the literature.\n50\n \n\n\nIn our case, α -naltrexamine was obtained with a yield of 60% in three steps, while β - naltrexamine was obtained with a yield of63% in three steps. The amide bond formation between the naltrexamine and the side chain moiety was straightforward. Depending on the commercial availability of the aromatic moiety, either in acyl chloride or acid form, condition 1 or 2 was adopted. Under mild basic condition, the intermediate, 3,6-disubstituted naltrexamine, was converted to the 6-mono-substituted target compound (Figure 9) with reasonable yield. All the ligands were fully characterized before submitting for biological studies. Biological evaluation\n\n\nBiological screening for the synthesized ligands was focused on in vitro radioligand binding assay and functional assays, and in vivo behavioral tests. Basically, the radioligand binding assay was adopted to characterize the affinity and selectivity of new ligands for the MOR, DOR and KOR, whereas the \n35\nS-GTP[γ S]-binding functional assay was applied to determine whether each new ligand acted as an agonist, partial agonist or antagonist of the MOR by determining its efficacy for G-protein activation relative to a full agonist at the MOR. Agonist efficacy were measured at the level of G-protein activation because efficacy is most accurately determined at this proximal level of signal transduction.\n51'53\n The use of cell lines heterologously expressing each of the cloned receptors has'become standard practice because it provides a pure source of each opioid receptor type free of other opioid receptor types. Furthermore, these systems express the receptor at high density to provide optimal signal-to- noise ratios in the radioligand and \n35\nS-GTP[γS] binding assays. The in vivo tests were focused on the inhibition of morphine's antinociception activity and behavioral properties of those \n\n compounds showing high selectivity and low agonist efficacy at the MOR. In vitro pharmacological study\n\n\nThe primary testing of these ligands included the competitive radioligand binding assay using the mono-cloned opioid receptors expressed in CHO cell lines. [\n3\nH]naloxone, [3H]NTI and [\n3\nH]norBNI were used to label the MOR, DOR and KOR, respectively. The binding affinities of these ligands to the mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors are summarized in Table 3. Most of these ligands showed sub-nanomolar affinity for the MOR and significant selectivity for the MOR over DOR and KOR.

The averages are reported along with their standard error of the means, SEM, for each compound. The comparison to percent stimulation of DAMGO is the Emax of the compound compared to the Emax of DAMGO (normalized to 100%). Naltrexone, β-FNA and CTAP were tested along as positive controls under the same conditions.\n\n\nAs shown in Table 4, target compound 1 to 6 all have sub-nanomolar or nanomolar affinity for the MOR while much lower affinity for the DOR and KOR. Specifically, compound 4 showed over 1, 000-fold selectivity for the MOR over DOR, whereas compound 6 showed over 700-fold selectivity for the MOR over DOR, and over 150- fold selectivity for the MOR over KOR. The control compound 7 and 8 showed somewhat lower affinity for MOR and lower \n\n selectivity for MOR over KOR. These results suggest the possibility of hydrogen bonding or other polar interactions between the target compounds and the MOR because the only unique chemical structure in the target compounds is the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring. Similarly, target compounds 9 to 14 all showed high sub-nanomolar affinity for MOR whereas compound 9 and 11 exhibited the highest selectivity for the MOR over both the DOR and KOR. Again we observed significantly lower affinity and selectivity of the control compounds 15 and 16 for the MOR. This finding further supported the possibility of hydrogen bonding or some other polar interaction between the target compounds and the MOR because of the existence of a quinoline or isoquinoline ring in the target compounds verses the pure aromatic ring system of the naphthalene moiety in the control compounds.\n\n\nTable 4.

The \n35\nS-GTP[γS] binding results were analyzed in such a way as to normalize the stimulation produced by each novel ligand to that obtained with the full agonist DAMGO, which provided a measurement of relative efficacy. These results demonstrated that all of the novel ligands showed partial agonism.\n\n\nSpecifically, compounds 6 and 9 showed the lowest relative efficacy, with approximately 20% of the maximal stimulation produced by DAMGO. Compounds 6 and 9 produced stimulation similar to nalbuphine, a ligand with very low efficacy to activate the MOR. As the main goal of this project is to develop a neutral antagonist of the MOR, their high affinity and selectivity for the MOR and very low agonism at the MOR shed light on our future molecular design. In order to further characterize their pharmacological profile, we conducted in vivo study of these compounds. In vivo pharmacological evaluation\n\n\nThe potential MOR selective antagonists were evaluated for acute agonistic and antagonistic effects in mice. In detail, they were tested for their ability to produce antinociception and to antagonize the antinociceptive effects of morphine in the mouse tail immersion test. The data are summarized in Table 5. As shown, both compounds 6 and 9 Figure 10), were found to be potent antagonists of morphine. Their antagonist AD50 values were 4.51 and 0.45 nM, and neither of these ligands produced any agonist effect in this test at doses up to 100 mg/kg. This is in agreement with our original molecular design hypothesis as well as the in vitro functional assays. Therefore, these two compounds may be applied as leads for our next generation of molecular design and synthesis to identify pure, potent and highly selective antagonists for the MOR. hi addition, compounds 1 and 2 had similar ED50 values to compound \n\n 9 and compounds 4, 5 and 13 were equally potent to compound 6 as a morphine antagonist. On the other hand, compound 12 was more potent than morphine and compounds 10 and 1 1 were equally potent to morphine in producing antinociception in this test.\n\n\nTable 5.

Agonist, ED\n50\n 0.04 mg/kg. \n\n Interestingly, some of the target compounds did not show parallel functional activity between the in vitro and the in vivo studies. For example, both compounds 6 and 9 showed partial agonism in the \n35\nS-GTP[γS] binding assay while acting as full antagonists in the warm- water tail immersion test. On the other hand, compounds 10, 1 1 and 12 showed only moderately higher partial agonism in the \n35\nS-GTP[γS] binding assay but acted as full agonists in the in vivo assays. To our understanding, there are several factors that might have contributed to these observations. First, it has been reported that- the level of antinociception produced by an opioid is dependent on both the intrinsic efficacy of the drug and the,stimulus intensity. Some low efficacy MOR partial agonists, such as butorphanol, produced maximal levels of antinociception at a lower temperature nociceptive stimulus (50 \n0\nC) but not at a higher temperature (56 \n0\nC) stimulus.\n54\n On the other hand, butorphanol acted as an antagonist and shifted the dose-effect curveof the high-efficacy opioid alfentanil to the right in a competitive manner at a higher temperature (55 \n0\nC) stimulus.\n55\n This may explain why the two exemplary compounds did not show any efficacy at the higher temperature (56 \n0\nC) stimulus and thereby acted as full antagonists in the in vivo study. Second, some ligands could have significant intrinsic efficacy at the DOR or KOR, while acting as low efficacy partial agonists at the MOR which might explain why compounds 10, 11 and 12 acted as full agonists in vivo. Further Molecular Modeling Study\n\n\nIn order to verify that the two compounds that acted as selective MOR ligands utilized the alternate \"address\" domain identified from the previous modeling study, further molecular modeling study was conducted. First, compound 6 and 9 were built using the InsightU/Discover program and their conformation energy minimization was conducted. Then, as we have described for the docking study of naltrexone in the three opioid receptor homology models, they were docked into the homology model of MOR interactively. The orientation of the newly introduced C(6) side chain was not deliberately considered originally. The lowest energy conformation after the minimization and the dynamics simulation of the ligand/receptor complex is illustrated in Figures 1 IA and B.\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 1 IA, the C(6) side chain in compound 6 pointed to the aromatic binding locus at the extracellular loop region of the MOR. The pyridinyl moiety was in the \n\n vicinity of Tyr210 (Yxl2.43) while the distance between the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring and the oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group of Tyr210 (Yxl2.43) was 3.37 A. Similarly, the C(6) side chain in compound 9 also pointed to the aromatic binding locus at the extracellular loop region of the MOR while the isoquinolinyl moiety in 9 was in the vicinity of Trp318 (W7.35) (Figure 1 IB). The distance between the nitrogen atom in the isoquinoline ring and the nitrogen atom in the indole ring of Trp318 (W7.35) was 3.64 A. Both distances could be plausible for hydrogen bonding interaction between the C(6) side chains in the ligands and the specified amino acid residue.\n\n\nBecause these two residues (Tyr210 (Yxl2.43) and Trp318 (W7.35)) are not conserved in the DOR and KOR, it seems that these two residues could act as an alternate \"address\" domain in MOR, and this plausible hydrogen bonding could contribute to the selectivity of the exemplary compounds 6 and 9 for the MOR. As our molecular models are based on homology modeling of these opioid receptors and are preliminary, site-directed mutagenesis and radioligand binding analysis with the mutated MOR will be conducted in future studies to confirm this hypothesis.\n56\n Conclusions\n\n\nIn summary, based on the molecular modeling study of the opioid receptor antagonist binding pocket using naltrexone as a probe molecule, an alternative \"address\" binding domain has been identified in the MOR antagonist binding pocket. Two series of novel ligands have been designed and synthesized to target on this \"address\" domain as proof-of-concept.\n\n\nCompetition binding and in vitro functional assays have identified two compounds with sub- nanomolar affinity for the MOR and high selectivity over the DOR and KOR. Both compounds showed partial agonism in the in vitro G-protein activation test and potent antagonism in the in vivo antinociceptive test. Further molecular modeling study has implicated that the selectivity of these two ligands for the MOR could be the result of potential hydrogen bonding between the ligand and the \"address\" binding locus in the MOR. Moreover, we have also observed that some of the compounds in these series showed a range of efficacies as MOR partial agonists. These ligands would serve as pharmacological tools to obtain information on MOR activation mechanisms and on structural parameters that affect ligand efficacy at the MOR. \n\n Experimental Section Molecular modeling\n\n\nA Silicon Graphics Octane 2 workstation, equipped with two parallel R 12000 processors, was used for all computational studies. Insightπ (Accelrys) \n57\n package was used for modeling. Insightπ/Homology module was used to construct the homology models of three opioid receptors based on the X-ray crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin, as reported previously.\n39\n Insightll/Discover module was applied to construct all the small molecules in their nitrogen- protonated form. Minimization with the steepest descent and then the conjugate gradient algorithm were performed to generate the lowest energy conformation for each ligand studied. Then a molecular dynamics simulation was performed (an equilibration phase of 1,000 fs at 300 K, followed by a collection phase of 5,000 fs at the same temperature) to further study the small molecule conformation. The lowest energy conformation of the molecule from the last 2 ps molecular dynamics simulation was extracted and applied as the initial configuration for docking into the proposed binding site of the opioid receptors. The docking of the small molecule was conducted interactively using Insightll/Discover. Experimental studies\n47\n suggest that the protonated nitrogen moiety interacts with the carboxyl group of Asp 147 to form a putative salt bridge. In detail, the molecule was docked in the upper level of transmembrane part in each receptor. The orientation of the molecule skeleton in the binding locus was mainly decided by: first, the putative ionic interaction between the tertiary amino group in naltrexone and the carboxylic group of aspartate on the transmembrane helix 3 in each opioid receptor (Aspl47 in mu, Aspl28 in delta and Aspl38 in kappa); Second, the hydrophobic portion of the ligand intend to face the hydrophobic transmembrane helices while the hydrophilic portion to the more polar extracellular loop region. The ligand-receptor complex was minimized in gas phase first with the backbone of the receptor fixed, but all the side chain atoms were left unconstrained. The optimized conformation was then used as the initial configuration for the molecular dynamics simulations. A short-term steepest descent energy minimization (5,000 iterations) and dynamics simulation (10,000 step, 1 fs each step) was conducted to validate the docking primarily followed by a more vigorous minimizations (50,000 iterations) and dynamics simulation (100,000 steps) was conducted with 2000 steps equilibration for the initial dynamics. \n\n The total simulation time was 102 ps. In both processes, the backbone of the receptor was fixed to prevent the disruption of the α-helical bundle of the receptor and a generic distance constraint (4 to 4.2 A) was applied between the negatively charged oxygen atom in aspartate on TM3 and the positively charged nitrogen atom in the ligand. After the dynamics simulation, the lowest energy conformation of the complex was extracted and saved for analysis. Chemical Synthesis\n\n\nGeneral Methods: All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or as otherwise states. Melting points were obtained with a Fisher scientific micro melting point apparatus and were uncorrected. All IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IR Instruments. Proton (300 MHz) and Carbon- 13 (75 MHz) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded at ambient temperature with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard on either a Varian Gemini-300MHz \"Tesla\" spectrometer or Varian Mercury-300MHz NMR spectrometer. GC/MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett Packard 6890 (Palo Alto, CA). TLC analyses were carried out on the Analtech Uniplate F254 plates. Chromatographic purification was carried out on silica gel columns (230-400 mesh, Merck). Yields were not maximized. The final target compounds' purity was tested by HPLC and elemental analysis, and satisfying purity of > 95% was achieved from both methods. Varian ProStar HPLC System was used on Microsorb-MV 100-5 Cl 8 column (250 x 4.6mm) with injection volume at 10 μL and sample concentrations at 1 - 2 mg/0.5mL in 100% acetonitrile; The sample was detected at single wavelength of 210 nm with eluent system of acetonitrile: water (75: 25) at 1 mL/min over 50 min. Elemental analysis was conducted in Atlantic Microlab, Inc. All spectral data reported here were obtained from the hydrochloride salt form of the products while compound 1-6 and 9-14 were dihydrochloride salts, and compound 7, 8, 15 and 16 monohydrochloride salts.\n\n\nGeneral procedure 1 : A solution of 6α-naltrexamine or 6β-naltrexamine (1 equivalent) in CH\n2\nCI\n2\n was added acyl chloride (2 equivalent), and triethylamine (4 equivalent) on an ice-water bath under N\n2\n protection. The mixture was allowed to stir overnight at room temperature. After concentrated to remove CH\n2\nCI\n2\n, the resulting residue was dissolved in MeOH and added potassium carbonate (2 equivalents). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. After concentrated, the residue was partitioned between water and CH\n2\nCI\n2\n. The \n\n water layer was extracted with CH\n2\nCI\n2\n. The combined CH\n2\nCI\n2\n solution was washed with brine, dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n. After concentrated, the residue was purified by silica gel column with a CH\n2\nCI\n2\n/ MeOH (100:1) (1 % NH\n3\nH\n2\nO) solvent system as eluent to give the aim product. The product was then transferred into the hydrochloride salt using 1.25 M hydrochloride acid methanol solution at 0 \n0\nC.\n\n\nGeneral procedure 2: A solution of carboxylic acid (3 equivalent) in DMF was added N-(3- Dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI, 2.5 equivalent), hydrobenzotriazole (HOBt, 2.5 equivalent), 4 A Molecular sieve, and triethylamine (5 equivalent) on an ice-water bath under N\n2\n protection. After 15 min, a solution of 6β- naltrexamine (1 equivalent) in DMF was added. The reaction mixture was filtered over celite after stirring overnight at room temperature. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuum to remove DMF. The residue was dissolved in MeOH and added potassium carbonate (2 equivalent). The resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. After concentrated, the residue was partitioned between water and CH\n2\nCh. The water layer was extracted with CH\n2\nC1\n2\n. The combined CH\n2\nCI\n2\n solution was washed with H\n2\nO, brine, dried with Na\n2\nSO\n4\n. After concentrated, the residue was purified by silica gel column with a CH\n2\nCl\n2\n/Me0H (100:1) (1 % NH\n3\nH\n2\nO) solvent system as eluent to give the aim product. Then the product was transferred into a hydrochloride salt. 17-Cyclopropylmethyl-3,14β-dihydroxy-4,5α-epoxy-6αr[(2'- pyridyl)acetamido]morphinan (1) was prepared by following the general procedure 1 in 58% yield.

Aliquots of a membrane preparation were incubated with the radioligands in the presence of different concentrations of the drug under investigation at 30 \n0\nC for 1 h. Specific (i.e. opioid receptor related) binding was determined as the difference in binding obtained in the absence and presence of 10 μM naltrexone. The potency of the drugs in displacing the specific binding of the radioligand was determined from data using linear regression analysis of Hill plots. The IC\n50\n values will then be determined and corrected to K, values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Functional assays, including \n35\nS-GTP[γS]-binding assay were conducted in the same cell membranes used for the receptor binding assays. 3 μM of DAMGO was included in the assay for a maximally effective concentration of a full agonist for the mu opioid receptor. In vivo acute function test procedure\n\n\nAnimals. Male Swiss Webster mice (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 25-30 g were housed 6 to a cage in animal care quarters and maintained at 22 + 2°C on a 12 hr light-dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. The mice were brought to a test room (22 ± 2 \n\n \n0\nC, 12 hr light-dark cycle), marked for identification and allowed 18 hr to recover from transport and handling. Protocols and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center and comply with the recommendations of the IASP (International Association for the Study of Pain). Tail immersion test. The warm-water tail immersion test was performed according to Coderre and Rollman\n58\n using a water bath with the temperature maintained at 56 ± 0.1\n0\nC. Before injecting the mice, a base-line (control) latency was determined. Only mice with a control reaction time from 2 to 4 second were used. The average baseline latency for these experiments was 3.0 ± 0.1 sec. The test latency after drug treatment was assessed at the appropriate time, and a 10 second maximum cut-off time was imposed to prevent tissue damage. Antinociception was quantified according to the method of Harris and Pierson\n59\n as the percentage of maximum possible effect (% MPE) which was calculated as: %MPE = [(test latency - control latency) / (10 - control latency)] X 100. Percent MPE was calculated for each mouse using at least 6 mice per drug. Drugs. Morphine sulfate was purchased from Mallinckrodt, St. Louis, MO, USA. Naloxone was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All drugs and test compounds were dissolved in pyrogen-free isotonic saline (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL) and were administered to mice subcutaneously (s.c.)\n\n\nExperimental design and statistical analysis. To test for agonist properties, mice, with pre- determined tail immersion baseline, were injected s.c. with morphine (10 mg/kg; a dose that produces maximal antinociception) or the test compound at increasing doses and were reassessed for their tail immersion reaction time 20 min later. To test for antagonist properties, mice, with pre-determined tail immersion baseline, were injected s.c. with either naloxone (1 mg/kg; a dose that totally block the antinociception induce by 10 mg/kg morphine) or the test compound at various doses and 5 min later they were administered morphine (10 mg/kg; s.c). Mice were re-assessed for their tail immersion reaction time 20 min later. Effective dose-50 (ED50) values were calculated using least-squares linear regression analysis followed by calculation of 95% confidence limits (95% CL.) by the method of Bliss.\n60\n \n\n Data are expressed as mean values ± S.E.M. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the post hoc \"Student-Newman-Keuls\" test were performed to assess significance using the Instat 3.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.)- P < 0.05 was considered significant.\n\n\nReferences for Example 2\n\n\n1.

To further verify the role of Tyr210 and Trp318 in the binding of two leads to MOR, we conducted an initial site-directed mutagenesis study with CHO cells transiently transfected with \n\n the wild type and mutant MORs (Y210A and W318A). Naltrexone was used as control ligand and its binding affinity did not change much in both wild-type (wt) and mutant MORs (IC\n50\n values were 3.90 ± 2.96 nM (wt), 0.95 ± 0.49 nM (Y210A), and 10.35 ± 1.64 nM (W318A) respectively). Both compound 6 and 9 bound to the Y210A mutant MOR with comparable affinities (IC50, 6, 1.61± 0.17 nM; 9, 3.31 ± 1.71 nM) as to the wild-type MOR (IC50, 6, 2.29 ± 0.15 nM; 9, 5.42 ± 0.70 nM), whereas their affinities were dramatically lower in binding to the W318A mutant (IC50, 6, >l,000 nM; 9, >l ,000 nM). We will revisit these studies with wider concentration range in order to define the IC50 and Ki values for this mutant. These results indicate that these two leads could recognize an \"address\" locus with potential hydrogen bonding property in the MOR, which could confer their selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and KOR.\n\n\n57.

Exemplary compound derivatives: from compound 6 defined above in Examples 2 (referred to as compound 1 in this Example)\n\n\nNew ligands based on exemplary compound 1 are used to further explore the structure- activity-relationships of these naltrexamine derivatives. The major morphinan skeleton and the C(6)-heterocyclic ring system are retained because they provided very high affinity for the MOR. Some adjustments are introduced to influence the orientation and the distance between these two moieties and to strengthen interactions (e.g. hydrogen bonding) between the ligand and the aromatic amino acid residues in the MOR. These interactions are believed to be important not only to the ligand binding affinity/selectivity for the receptor, but also to the optimization of the antagonism of the ligand. These compounds are synthesized and characterized by NMR, IR, Mass Spectrometry, elemental analysis and biological screening \n\n essentially as described in Examples I and 2. MOR antagonists based on exemplary compound 1 are depicted in Figure 12. In addition, for compound 18, (Figure 13A) various side chain substitutions are made as described in Table 6.\n\n\nTable 6.

Therefore, new synthetic routes have been designed as shown in Figure 14. As shown, the reaction condition to prepare compound 24 might be too harsh for the opiate starting material [Bailey DM, DeGrazia CG, Hoff SJ, Schulenberg PL, O'Connor JR, Paris DA, Slee AMJournal of Medicinal Chemistry 1984, 27(1 1), 1457-64]. Alterntively, NaOH is used as the base and the reaction is conducted in dioxane under high-pressure [Kotsuki H, Sakai H, Shinohara T. High- \n\n pressure organic chemistry. Part 23. Synlett 2000, (I)\n5\n 1 16-118]. For compound 25, the enantioselective reduction of the double bond is challenging. Because the substrate carries a ''largely unsubstituted\" double bond [Cui X, Burgess K. Chemical Reviews, 2005, 105(9), 3272-96], one of the most reliable methods is the adoption of a cationic Indium complex catalyst [Lightfoot A, Schnider P, Pfaltz A. Angewandte Chemie, International Edition, 1998,\n\n\n37(20), 2897-2899; Blackmond DG, Lightfoot A, Pfaltz A, Rosner T, Schnider P, Zimmermann • N. Chirality 2000, 12(5-6), 442-9; Blankenstein J, Pfaltz A. Angewandte Chemie, Internationa] Edition, 2001, 40(23), 4445-4447; Menges F, Pfaltz A. Advanced Synthesis & Catalysis 2002, 344(1), 40-44; Pfaltz A, Blankenstein J, Hilgraf R, Hormann E, Mclntyre S, Menges F, Schonleber M, Smidt SP, Wustenberg B, Zimmermann N. Advanced Synthesis & Catalysis 2003, 345(1+2), 33-44]. Such a catalyst leads to up to 99% stereoselectivity. The absolute stereochemistry of the new chiral center in the opioid ligand is assigned by \n1\nHNMR. Alternatively, D-serine, instead of L-serine, is adopted to prepare the enantiomer of the listed catalyst in four steps to give the desired chirality of the designed ligand 25 [Blankenstein, supra]. The starting material to synthesize compound 26 is protected β-naltrexol. It is prepared predominantly by adopting formamidinesulfinic acid under alkaline conditions with approximately 90% yield [Chatterjie N, Inturrisi CE. J Med Chem. 1975, 18(5), 490-2.]. For purposes of example and not limitation, nineteen new compounds have been designed as compound 1 derivatives. The syntheses of these 19 ligands include the multiple-step chemical synthesis of eight essential side chains as the starting material.\n\n\nCharacterization and biological testing of these compounds is carried out as described in Examples 1 and 2.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4. Derivatives of exemplary compound 9 defined above in Example 2 (referred to as compound 2 in this Example) Derivatives of compound 1 are depicted in Figure 15. Similar to the derivatives of compound 1, compound 29 and 30 are designed to test the necessity of the aromatic system in the side chain for the affinity and selectivity of exemplary compound 2. Structure 30 actually represents two isomers because of the introduction of a new chiral center on the side chain. Both of these isomers are synthesized individually because optically pure side chain moieties \n\n can be prepared from commercially available optically pure starting material (Table 8, where references for each step are known to those of skill in the art).\n\n\nCompound 31 (Figure 16) has a totally saturated side chain moiety. Compound 31 actually is related to the synthesis of eight different isomers because there are three chiral centers in the side chain. At least two isomers can be synthesized following reported procedures [Repala RT, Lavagnino ER, Shepard ER, Farkas E. Journal of the American Chemical Society 1957, 79, 3770-2; Roberts NA, Martin JA, Kinchington D, Broadhurst AV, Craig JC, Duncan IB, Galpin SA, Handa BK, Kay J, Krδhn A, et al.

J Med Chem. 1995, 38(22), 4446-53.]. Depending on the affinity of compound 29 and 30 for the MOR, these two isomers are prepared and their affinity for the MOR is checked to verify the importance of aromaticity of the side chain (Figure 17).\n\n\nTable 8.

HCI, H\n2\nO \"CH\n3\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor compounds 29 to 36, their synthetic routes will be the same as in Figure 5. For compounds 37, 38 and 39, new synthetic routes have been designed (Figure 14). Compound 37 can be synthesized under acidic conditions [Zdrojewski T, Jonczyk A. Tetrahedron 1995, 51 (45), 12439-44; Jonczyk A, Lipiak D, Sienkiewicz K. Synlett 1991, (7), 493-6.]. Similar to the preparation of compound 25, the preparation of compound 38 involves the stereoselective reduction of a double bond intermediate [Lightfoot A, Schnider P, Pfaltz A. Angewandte Chemie, International Edition, 1998, 37(20), 2897-2899; Blackmond DG, Lightfoot A, Pfaltz A, Rosner T, Schnider P, Zimmermann N. Chirality 2000, 12(5-6), 442-9; Blankenstein J, Pfaltz A. Angewandte Chemie, International Edition, 2001 , 40(23), 4445-4447; Menges F, Pfaltz A. Advanced Synthesis & Catalysis 2002, 344(1), 40-44; Pfaltz A, Blankenstein J, Hilgraf R, Hormann E, Mclntyre S, Menges F, Schonleber M, Smidt SP, Wustenberg B, Zimmermann N. Advanced Synthesis & Catalysis 2003, 345(1+2), 33-44]. The starting material to synthesize compound 39 is TES-protected β-naltrexol, and it can be prepared stereoselectively using NaBH4 reduction under low temperature [Uwai K, Uchiyama H, Sakurada S, Kabuto C, Takeshita M. Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry 2004, 12(2), 417-21 ]. The rest of the steps are \n\n similar to the preparation of compound 26.\n\n\nFor purposes of example and no limitation, thirteen new compounds as derivatives of exemplary compound 2 have been proposed. The synthesis of these thirteen ligands includes the multiple-step preparation of at least nine of side chain moieties as starting material (Table 8). Characterization and biological testing of these compounds is carried out essentially as described in Examples 1 and 2.\n\n\nWhile the invention has been described in terms of its preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. Accordingly, the- present invention should not be limited to the embodiments as described above, but should further include all modifications and equivalents thereof within the spirit and scope of the description provided herein."
