The entire teachings of the above application are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nInterleukin-4 (IL-4) is a pleiotropic cytokine that has a broad spectrum of biological effects on B cells, T cells, and many non-lymphoid cells including monocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. For example, IL-4 stimulates the proliferation of several IL-2- and IL-3-dependent cell lines, induces the expression of class II major histocompatability complex molecules on resting B cells, and enhances the secretion of IgG4 and IgE by human B cells. IL-4 is associated with a Th2-type immune response, and is produced by and promotes differentiation of Th2 cells. IL-4 has been implicated in a number of disorders, such as allergy and asthma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterleukin-13 (IL-13) is a pleiotropic cytokine that induces immunoglobulin isotype switching to IgG4 and IgE, CD23 up regulation, VCAM-1 expression, and directly activates eosinphils and mast cells, for example. IL-13 is mainly produced by Th2 cells and inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF, IL-8) by LPS-stimulated monocytes, IL-13 is closely related to IL-4 with which it shares 20-25% sequence similarity at the amino acid level. (Minty et. al., \nNature, \n363 (6417):248-50 (1993)). Although many activities of IL-13 are similar to those of IL-4, IL-13 does not have growth promoting effects on activated T cells or T cells clones as IL-4 does. (Zurawski et al., \nEMBO J. \n12:2663 (1993)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cell surface receptors and receptor complexes bind IL-4 and/or IL-13 with different affinities. The principle components of receptors and receptor complexes that bind IL-4 and/or IL-13 are IL-4Rα, IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2. These chains are expressed on the surface of cells as monomers or heterodimers of IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 or IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα2. IL-4rα monomer binds IL-4, but not IL-13. IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 monomers bind IL-13, but do not bind IL-4. IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα2 heterodimers bind both IL-4 and IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTh2-type immune responses promote antibody production and humoral immunity, and are elaborated to fight off extracellular pathogens. Th2 cells are mediators of Ig production (humoral immunity) and produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-13 (Tanaka, et, al., Cytokine Regulation of Humoral Immunity, 251-272, Snapper, ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York (1996)). Th2-type immune responses are characterized by the generation of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) and specific types of antibodies (IgE, IgG4) and are typical of allergic reactions, which may result in watery eyes and asthmatic symptoms, such as airway inflammation and contraction of airway muscle cells in the lungs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth IL-4 and IL-13 are therapeutically important proteins based on their biological functions. IL-4 has been shown to be able to inhibit autoimmune disease and IL-4 and IL-13 have both shown the potential to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. Since both cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, inhibitors of these cytokines could provide therapeutic benefits. However, inhibiting only IL-4 or IL-13 using conventional agents may not provide desired therapeutic results because many of the activities and functions of these cytokines are similar. Accordingly, a need exists for improved agents that inhibit IL-4, inhibit IL-13, and single agents that inhibit both IL-4 and IL-13\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to ligands that have binding specificity for IL-4 (e.g., human IL-4), ligands that have binding specificity for IL-13 (e.g., human IL-13), and to ligands that have binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13 (e.g., human IL-4 and human IL-13). For example, the ligand can comprise a polypeptide domain having a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4, a polypeptide domain having a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13, or comprise a polypeptide domain having a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 and a polypeptide domain having a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention relates to a ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4 and for IL-13. Such ligands comprise a protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 and a protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13. The protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 and the protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 can be any suitable binding moiety. The protein moieties can be a peptide moiety, polypeptide moiety or protein moiety. For example, the protein moieties can be provided by an antibody fragment that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 or IL-13, such as an immunoglobulin single variable domain that has binding specificity for IL-4 or IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand can comprise a protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 that competes for binding to IL-4 with IL-4Rα, an IL-4-binding portion of IL-4Rα or an anti-IL-4 domain antibody (dAb). In some embodiments, the ligand comprises a protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 (e.g., an immunoglobulin single variable domain) that competes for binding to IL-4 with an anti-IL-4 dAb selected from the group consisting of the anti-IL-4 dAbs disclosed herein (i.e., DOM9-15 (SEQ ID NO:175), DOM9-17 (SEQ ID NO:176), DOM9-23 (SEQ ID NO:177), DOM9-24 (SEQ ID

The ligands according to the invention preferably comprise immunoglobulin variable domains which have different binding specificities, and do not contain variable domain pairs which together form a binding site for target compound (i.e., do not comprise an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain that together form a binding site for IL-4 or IL-13). Preferably each domain which has a binding site that has binding specificity for a target is an immunoglobulin single variable domain (e.g., immunoglobulin single heavy chain variable domain (e.g., V\nH\n, V\nHH\n), immunoglobulin single light chain variable domain (e.g., V\nL\n)) that has binding specificity for a desired target (e.g., IL-4, IL-13). Each polypeptide domain which has a binding site that has binding specificity for a target (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) can also comprise one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of an antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., an immunoglobulin single variable domain) that has binding specificity for a desired target (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) in a suitable format, such that the binding domain has binding specificity for the target. For example, the CDRs can be grafted onto a suitable protein scaffold or skeleton, such as an affibody, a SpA scaffold, an LDL receptor class A domain, or an EGF domain. Further, the ligand can be bivalent (heterobivalent) or multivalent (heteromultivalent) as described herein. Thus, “ligands” include polypeptides that comprise two dAbs wherein each dAb binds to a different target (e.g., IL-4, IL-13). Ligands also include polypeptides that comprise at least two dAbs that bind different targets (or the CDRs of dAbs) in a suitable format, such as an antibody format (e.g., IgG-like format, scFv, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n) or a suitable protein scaffold or skeleton, such as an affibody, a SpA scaffold, an LDL receptor class A domain, an EGF domain, avimer and multispecific ligands as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptide domain which has a binding site that has binding specificity for a target (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) can also be a protein domain comprising a binding site for a desired target, e.g., a protein domain is selected from an affibody, a SpA domain, an LDL receptor class A domain, an avimer (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005/0053973, 2005/0089932, 2005/0164301). If desired, a “ligand” can further comprise one or more additional moieties, that can each independently be a peptide, polypeptide or protein moiety or a non-peptidic moiety (e.g., a polyalkylene glycol, a lipid, a carbohydrate). For example, the ligand can further comprise a half-life extending moiety as described herein (e.g., a polyalkylene glycol moiety, a moiety comprising albumin, an albumin fragment or albumin variant, a moiety comprising transferrin, a transferrin fragment or transferrin variant, a moiety that binds albumin, a moiety that binds neonatal Fc receptor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase “target” refers to a biological molecule (e.g., peptide, polypeptide, protein, lipid, carbohydrate) to which a polypeptide domain which has a binding site can bind. The target can be, for example, an intracellular target (e.g., an intracellular protein target), a soluble target (e.g., a secreted protein such as IL-4, IL-13), or a cell surface target (e.g., a membrane protein, a receptor protein). Preferably, the target is IL-4 or IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “immunoglobulin single variable domain” refers to an antibody variable region (V\nH\n, V\nHH\n, V\nL\n) that specifically binds a target, antigen or epitope independently of other V domains; however, as the term is used herein, an immunoglobulin single variable domain can be present in a format (e.g., hetero-multimer) with other variable regions or variable domains where the other regions or domains are not required for antigen binding by the single immunoglobulin variable domain (i.e., where the immunoglobulin single variable domain binds antigen independently of the additional variable domains). Each “immunoglobulin single variable domain” encompasses not only an isolated antibody single variable domain polypeptide, but also larger polypeptides that comprise one or more monomers of an antibody single variable domain polypeptide sequence. A “domain antibody” or “dAb” is the same as an “immunoglobulin single variable domain” polypeptide as the term is used herein. An immunoglobulin single variable domain polypeptide, is preferably a mammalian immunoglobulin single variable domain polypeptide, more preferably human, and includes rodent immunoglobulin single variable domains (for example, as disclosed in WO 00/29004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety) and camelid V\nHH \ndAbs. As used herein, camelid dAbs are immunoglobulin single variable domain polypeptides which are derived from species including camel, llama, alpaca, dromedary, and guanaco, and comprise heavy chain antibodies naturally devoid of light chain (V\nHH\n). Similar dAbs, can be obtained from single chain antibodies from other species, such as nurse shark. Preferred ligands comprises at least two different immunoglobulin single variable domain polypeptides or at least two different dAbs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe immunoglobulin single variable domains (dAbs) described herein contain complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). The locations of CDRs and frame work (FR) regions and a numbering system have been defined by Kabat et al. (Kabat, E. A. et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Government Printing Office (1991)). The amino acid sequences of the CDRs (CDR1, CDR2, CDR3) of the V\nH \nand V\nκ\n dAbs disclosed herein will be readily apparent to the person of skill in the art based on the well known Kabat amino acid numbering system and definition of the CDRs. According to the Kabat numbering system V\nL \n(V\nκ\n or V\nλ\n) CDR1 is from position 24-34, V\nL \nCDR2 is from position 50-56, V\nL \nCDR3 is from position 89-97, and V\nH \nCDR1 is from position 31-35, V\nH \nCDR2 is from position 50-65 and V\nH \nCDR3 is from position 95-102. Heavy chain CDR-H3 have varying lengths, insertions are numbered between residue H100 and H101 with letters up to K (i.e. H100, H100A . . . H100K, H101). Residue 103 which is the start of FR4 is almost always a W.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “interleukin-4” (IL-4) refers to naturally occurring or endogenous mammalian IL-4 proteins and to proteins having an amino acid sequence which is the same as that of a naturally occurring or endogenous corresponding mammalian IL-4 protein (e.g., recombinant proteins, synthetic proteins (i.e., produced using the methods of synthetic organic chemistry)). Accordingly, as defined herein, the term includes mature IL-4 protein, polymorphic or allelic variants, and other isoforms of an IL-4 and modified or unmodified forms of the foregoing (e.g., lipidated, glycosylated). Naturally occurring or endogenous IL-4 includes wild type proteins such as mature IL-4, polymorphic or allelic variants and other isoforms and mutant forms which occur naturally in mammals (e.g., humans, non-human primates). Such proteins can be recovered or isolated from a source which naturally produces IL-4, for example. These proteins and proteins having the same amino acid sequence as a naturally occurring or endogenous corresponding IL-4, are referred to by the name of the corresponding mammal. For example, where the corresponding mammal is a human, the protein is designated as a human IL-4. Several mutant IL-4 proteins are known in the art, such as those disclosed in WO 03/038041.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “interleukin-13” (IL-13) refers to naturally occurring or endogenous mammalian IL-13 proteins and to proteins having an amino acid sequence which is the same as that of a naturally occurring or endogenous corresponding mammalian IL-13 protein (e.g., recombinant proteins, synthetic proteins (i.e., produced using the methods of synthetic organic chemistry)). Accordingly, as defined herein, the term includes mature IL-13 protein, polymorphic or allelic variants, and other isoforms of IL-13 (e.g., produced by alternative splicing or other cellular processes), and modified or unmodified forms of the foregoing (e.g., lipidated, glycosylated). Naturally occurring or endogenous IL-13 include wild type proteins such as mature IL-13, polymorphic or allelic variants and other isoforms and mutant forms which occur naturally in mammals (e.g., humans, non-human primates). For example, as used herein IL-13 encompasses the human IL-13 variant in which Arg at \nposition\n 110 of mature human IL-13 is replaced with Gln (\nposition\n 110 of mature IL-13 corresponds to position 130 of the precursor protein) which is associated with asthma (atopic and nonatopic asthma) and other variants of IL-13. (Heinzmann et al., \nHum Mol. Genet. \n9:549-559 (2000).) Such proteins can be recovered or isolated from a source which naturally produces IL-13, for example. These proteins and proteins having the same amino acid sequence as a naturally occurring or endogenous corresponding IL-13, are referred to by the name of the corresponding mammal. For example, where the corresponding mammal is a human, the protein is designated as a human IL-13. Several mutant IL-13 proteins are known in the art, such as those disclosed in WO 03/035847.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Affinity” and “avidity” are terms of art that describe the strength of a binding interaction. With respect to the ligands of the invention, avidity refers to the overall strength of binding between the targets (e.g., first cell surface target and second cell surface target) on the cell and the ligand. Avidity is more than the sum of the individual affinities for the individual targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “toxin moiety” refers to a moiety that comprises a toxin. A toxin is an agent that has deleterious effects on or alters cellular physiology (e.g., causes cellular necrosis, apoptosis or inhibits cellular division).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “dose” refers to the quantity of ligand administered to a subject all at one time (unit dose), or in two or more administrations over a defined time interval. For example, dose can refer to the quantity of ligand (e.g., ligand comprising an immunoglobulin single variable domain that binds IL-4 and an immunoglobulin single variable domain that binds IL-13) administered to a subject over the course of one day (24 hours) (daily dose), two days, one week, two weeks, three weeks or one or more months (e.g., by a single administration, or by two or more administrations). The interval between doses can be any desired amount of time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “complementary” refers to when two immunoglobulin domains belong to families of structures which form cognate pairs or groups or are derived from such families and retain this feature. For example, a V\nH \ndomain and a V\nL \ndomain of an antibody are complementary; two V\nH \ndomains are not complementary, and two V\nL \ndomains are not complementary. Complementary domains may be found in other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, such as the V\nα\n and V\nβ\n (or γ and δ) domains of the T-cell receptor. Domains which are artificial, such as domains based on protein scaffolds which do not bind epitopes unless engineered to do so, are non-complementary. Likewise, two domains based on (for example) an immunoglobulin domain and a fibronectin domain are not complementary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “immunoglobulin” refers to a family of polypeptides which retain the immunoglobulin fold characteristic of antibody molecules, which contains two 13 sheets and, usually, a conserved disulphide bond. Members of the immunoglobulin superfamily are involved in many aspects of cellular and non-cellular interactions in vivo, including widespread roles in the immune system (for example, antibodies, T-cell receptor molecules and the like), involvement in cell adhesion (for example the ICAM molecules) and intracellular signaling (for example, receptor molecules, such as the PDGF receptor). The present invention is applicable to all immunoglobulin superfamily molecules which possess binding domains. Preferably, the present invention relates to antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “domain” refers to a folded protein structure which retains its tertiary structure independently of the rest of the protein. Generally, domains are responsible for discrete functional properties of proteins, and in many cases may be added, removed or transferred to other proteins without loss of function of the remainder of the protein and/or of the domain. By single antibody variable domain is meant a folded polypeptide domain comprising sequences characteristic of antibody variable domains. It therefore includes complete antibody variable domains and modified variable domains, for example in which one or more loops have been replaced by sequences which are not characteristic of antibody variable domains, or antibody variable domains which have been truncated or comprise N- or C-terminal extensions, as well as folded fragments of variable domains which retain at least in part the binding activity and specificity of the full-length domain. Thus, each ligand comprises at least two different domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Repertoire” A collection of diverse variants, for example polypeptide variants which differ in their primary sequence. A library that encompasses a repertoire of polypeptides preferably comprises at least 1000 members.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Library” The term library refers to a mixture of heterogeneous polypeptides or nucleic acids. The library is composed of members, each of which have a single polypeptide or nucleic acid sequence. To this extent, library is synonymous with repertoire. Sequence differences between library members are responsible for the diversity present in the library. The library may take the form of a simple mixture of polypeptides or nucleic acids, or may be in the form of organisms or cells, for example bacteria, viruses, animal or plant cells and the like, transformed with a library of nucleic acids. Preferably, each individual organism or cell contains only one or a limited number of library members. Advantageously, the nucleic acids are incorporated into expression vectors, in order to allow expression of the polypeptides encoded by the nucleic acids. In a preferred aspect, therefore, a library may take the form of a population of host organisms, each organism containing one or more copies of an expression vector containing a single member of the library in nucleic acid form which can be expressed to produce its corresponding polypeptide member. Thus, the population of host organisms has the potential to encode a large repertoire of genetically diverse polypeptide variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an antibody refers to IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD or IgE or a fragment (such as a Fab, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, disulphide linked Fv, scFv, closed conformation multispecific antibody, disulphide-linked scFv, diabody) whether derived from any species naturally producing an antibody, or created by recombinant DNA technology; whether isolated from serum, B-cells, hybridomas, transfectomas, yeast or bacteria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described herein an “antigen.” is a molecule that is bound by a binding domain according to the present invention. Typically, antigens are bound by antibody ligands and are capable of raising an antibody response in vivo. It may be a polypeptide, protein, nucleic acid or other molecule: Generally, the dual-specific ligands according to the invention are selected for target specificity against two particular targets (e.g., antigens). In the case of conventional antibodies and fragments thereof, the antibody binding site defined by the variable loops (L1, L2, L3 and H1, H2, H3) is capable of binding to the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “epitope” is a unit of structure conventionally bound by an immunoglobulin V\nH\n/V\nL \npair. Epitopes define the minimum binding site for an antibody, and thus represent the target of specificity of an antibody. In the case of a single domain antibody, an epitope represents the unit of structure bound by a variable domain in isolation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Universal framework” refers to a single antibody framework sequence corresponding to the regions of an antibody conserved in sequence as defined by Kabat (“Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest”, US Department of Health and Human Services) or corresponding to the human germline immunoglobulin repertoire or structure as defined by Chothia and Lesk, (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:910-917. The invention provides for the use of a single framework, or a set of such frameworks, which has been found to permit the derivation of virtually any binding specificity through variation in the hypervariable regions alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase, “half-life,” refers to the time taken for the serum concentration of the ligand to reduce by 50%, in vivo, for example due to degradation of the ligand and/or clearance or sequestration of the dual-specific ligand by natural mechanisms. The ligands of the invention are stabilized in vivo and their half-life increased by binding to molecules which resist degradation and/or clearance or sequestration. Typically, such molecules are naturally occurring proteins which themselves have a long half-life in viva. The half-life of a ligand is increased if its functional activity persists, in viva, for a longer period than a similar ligand which is not specific for the half-life increasing molecule. Thus a ligand specific for HSA and two target molecules is compared with the same ligand wherein the specificity to HSA is not present, that is does not bind HSA but binds another molecule. For example, it may bind a third target on the cell. Typically, the half-life is increased by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% or more. Increases in the range of 2×, 3×, 4×, 5×, 10×, 20×, 30×, 40×, 50× or more of the half-life are possible. Alternatively, or in addition, increases in the range of up to 30×, 40×, 50×, 60×, 70×, 80×, 90×, 100×, 150× of the half life are possible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs referred to herein, the term “competes” means that the binding of a first target to its cognate target binding domain is inhibited when a second target is bound to its cognate target binding domain. For example, binding may be inhibited sterically, for example by physical blocking of a binding domain or by alteration of the structure or environment of a binding domain such that its affinity or avidity for a target is reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “low stringency,” “medium stringency,” “high stringency,” or “very high stringency conditions” describe conditions for nucleic acid hybridization and washing. Guidance for performing hybridization reactions can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Aqueous and nonaqueous methods are described in that reference and either can be used. Specific hybridization conditions referred to herein are as follows: (1) low stringency hybridization conditions in 6× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45 C, followed by two washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at least at 50 C (the temperature of the washes can be increased to 55 C for low stringency conditions); (2) medium stringency hybridization conditions in 6×SSC at about 45 C, followed by one or more washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 C.; (3) high stringency hybridization conditions in 6×SSC at about 45 C, followed by one or more washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 C; and preferably (4) very high stringency hybridization conditions are 0.5M sodium phosphate, 7% SDS at 65 C, followed by one or more washes at 0.2×SSC, 1% SDS at 65 C. Very high stringency conditions (4) are the preferred conditions and the ones that should be used unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequences similar or homologous (e.g., at least about 70% sequence identity) to the sequences disclosed herein are also part of the invention. In some embodiments, the sequence identity at the amino acid level can be about 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or higher. At the nucleic acid level, the sequence identity can be about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or higher. Alternatively, substantial identity exists when the nucleic acid segments will hybridize under selective hybridization conditions (e.g., very high stringency hybridization conditions), to the complement of the strand. The nucleic acids may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or in a partially purified or substantially pure form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalculations of “homology” or “sequence identity” or “similarity” between two sequences the terms are used interchangeably herein) are performed as follows. The sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid “homology” is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid “identity”). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid and nucleotide sequence alignments and homology, similarity or identity, as defined herein are preferably prepared and determined using the \nalgorithm BLAST\n 2 Sequences, using default parameters (Tatusova, T. A. et al., FEMS Microbiol Lett, 174:187-188 (1999)). Alternatively, the BLAST algorithm (version 2.0) is employed for sequence alignment, with parameters set to default values. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search. Tool) is the heuristic search algorithm employed by the programs blastp, blastn, blastx, tblastn, and tblastx; these programs ascribe significance to their findings using the statistical methods of Karlin and Altschul, 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87(6):2264-8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., in cell culture, molecular genetics, nucleic acid chemistry, hybridization techniques and biochemistry). Standard techniques are used for molecular, genetic and biochemical methods (see generally, Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d ed. (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology (1999) 4th Ed, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. which are incorporated herein by reference) and chemical methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention relates to ligands that have binding specificity for IL-4 (e.g., human IL-4), ligands that have binding specificity for IL-13 (e.g., human IL-13), and to ligands that have binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13 (e.g., human IL-4 and human IL-13). For example, the ligand can comprise a polypeptide domain having a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4, a polypeptide domain having a binding site with binding specificity IL-13, or comprise a polypeptide domain having a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 and a polypeptide domain having a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to ligands that have cross-reactivity with human IL-4 and a non-human IL-4 (e.g., rhesus IL-4, cynomolgous IL-4), ligands that have cross-reactivity with human IL-13 and a non-human IL-13 (e.g., rhesus IL-13, cynomolgous IL-13), and to ligands that have binding specificity for human IL-4, human IL-13, non-human IL-4 and non-human IL-13 (e.g., rhesus IL-4, rhesus IL-13, cynomolgous IL-4 and cynomolgous IL-13).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of the invention provide several advantages. For example, as described herein, the ligand can be tailored to have a desired in vivo serum half-life. Domain antibodies are much smaller than conventional antibodies, and can be administered to achieve better tissue penetration than conventional antibodies. Thus, dAbs and ligands that comprise a dAb provide advantages over conventional antibodies when administered to treat disease, such as Th2-mediated disease, asthma, allergic diseases, cancer (e.g., renal cell cancer). For example, asthma (e.g. allergic asthma) can be IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated, and ligands that have binding specificity for IL-4, IL-13 or IL-4 and IL-13 can be administered to treat both IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated asthma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, due to the overlap and similarity in the biological activity of IL-4 and IL-13, therapy with agents that bind and inhibit only one of these cytokines may not produce the desired effects in all circumstances. Accordingly, ligands that have binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13 can be administered to a patient (e.g., a patient with allergic disease (e.g., allergic asthma)) to provide superior therapy using a single therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the ligand has binding specificity for IL-4 and comprises an (at least one) immunoglobulin single variable domain with binding specificity for IL-4. In other embodiments, the ligand has binding specificity for IL-13 and comprises an (at least one) immunoglobulin single variable domain with binding specificity for IL-13. In certain embodiments, the ligand has binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13, and comprises an (at least one) immunoglobulin single variable domain with binding specificity for IL-4 and an (at least one) immunoglobulin single variable domain with binding specificity for IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand of the invention can be formatted as described herein. For example, the ligand of the invention can be formatted to tailor in vivo serum half-life. If desired, the ligand can further comprise a toxin or a toxin moiety as described herein. In some embodiments, the ligand comprises a surface active toxin, such as a free radical generator (e.g., selenium containing toxin) or a radionuclide. In other embodiments, the toxin or toxin moiety is a polypeptide domain (e.g., a dAb) having a binding site with binding specificity for an intracellular target. In particular embodiments, the ligand is an IgG-like format that has binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13 (e.g., human IL-4 and human IL-13).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention relates to a ligand that has binding specificity for interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) comprising a protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4; and a protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13. The ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13 of this aspect of the invention, can be further characterized by any one or any combination of the following: (1) the proviso that said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is not an IL-4 receptor or IL-4-binding portion thereof, and said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 is not an IL-13 receptor or IL-13-binding portion thereof; (2) the proviso that said binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 and said binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 each consist of a single amino acid chain; (3) the proviso that neither said binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 nor said binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 comprise an immunoglobulin heavy chain, variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain; and (4) the proviso that said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is not an antibody that binds IL-4 or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain that together form a binding site for IL-4, and said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 is not an antibody that binds IL-13 or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain that together form a binding site for IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention relates to a ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4, comprising a protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4. The ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4 of this aspect of the invention, can be further characterized by any one or any combination of the following: (1) the proviso that said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is not an antibody that binds IL-4 or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain that together form a binding site for IL-4; (2) the proviso that said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is not an IL-4 receptor or IL-4-binding portion thereof; (3) the proviso that said binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 consists of a single amino acid chain; and (4) the proviso that said binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 does not consist of an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention relates to a ligand that has binding specificity for IL-13, comprising a protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13. The ligand that has binding specificity for IL-13 of this aspect of the invention, can be further characterized by any one or any combination of the following: (1) the proviso that said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 is not an antibody that binds IL-13 or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain that together form a binding site for IL-13; (2) the proviso that said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 is not an IL-13 receptor or IL-13-binding portion thereof; (3) the proviso that said binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 consists of a single amino acid chain; and (4) the proviso that said binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 does not consist of an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain.\n\n\n \nLigand Formats\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ligand of the invention can be formatted as a monospecific, dual specific or multispecific ligand as described herein. See, also WO 03/002609, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference, regarding ligand formatting. Such dual specific ligands comprise immunoglobulin single variable domains that have different binding specificities. Such dual specific ligands can comprise combinations of heavy and light chain domains. For example, the dual specific ligand may comprise a V\nH \ndomain and a V\nL \ndomain, which may be linked together in the form of an scFv (e.g., using a suitable linker such as Gly\n4\nSer), or formatted into a bispecific antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof (e.g. F(ab′)\n2\n, Fab′, Fab fragment). The dual specific ligands do not comprise complementary V\nH\n/V\nL \npairs which form a conventional two chain antibody antigen-binding site that binds antigen or epitope co-operatively. Instead, the dual format ligands can comprise a V\nH\n/V\nL \ncomplementary pair, wherein the V domains have different binding specificities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand (e.g., monospecific, dual specific ligands) may comprise one or more C\nH \nor C\nL \ndomains if desired. A hinge region domain may also be included if desired. Such combinations of domains may, for example, mimic natural antibodies, such as IgG or IgM, or fragments thereof, such as Fv, scFv, Fab or F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecules. Other structures, such as a single arm of an IgG molecule comprising V\nH\n, V\nL\n, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and C\nL \ndomains, are envisaged. The ligand can comprise a heavy chain constant region of an immunoglobulin (e.g., IgG (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) IgM, IgA, IgD or IgE) or portion thereof (e.g., Fc portion) and/or a light chain constant region (e.g., C\nλ\n, C\nκ\n). For example, the ligand can comprise CH1 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), CH1 and CH2 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), CH1, CH2 and CH3 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), CH2 and CH3 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), or CH1 and CH3 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a dual specific ligand of the invention comprises only two variable domains although several such ligands may be incorporated together into the same protein, for example two such ligands can be incorporated into an IgG or a multimeric immunoglobulin, such as IgM. Alternatively, in another embodiment a plurality of dual specific ligands are combined to form a multimer. For example, two different dual specific ligands are combined to create a tetra-specific molecule. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the light and heavy variable regions of a dual-specific ligand of the present invention may be on the same polypeptide chain, or alternatively, on different polypeptide chains. In the case that the variable regions are on different polypeptide chains, then they may be linked via a linker, generally a flexible linker (such as a polypeptide chain), a chemical linking group, or any other method known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands can be formatted as bi- or multispecific antibodies or antibody fragments or into bi- or multispecific non-antibody structures. Suitable formats include, any suitable polypeptide structure in which an antibody variable domain or one or more of the CDRs thereof can be incorporated so as to confer binding specificity for antigen on the structure. A variety of suitable antibody formats are known in the art, such as, bispecific IgG-like formats (e.g., chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, single chain antibodies, heterodimers of antibody heavy chains and/or light chains, antigen-binding fragments of any of the foregoing (e.g., a Fv fragment (e.g., single chain Fv (scFv), a disulfide bonded Fv), a Fab fragment, a Fab′ fragment, a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment), a single variable domain (e.g., V\nH\n, V\nL\n, V\nHH\n), a dAb, and modified versions of any of the foregoing (e.g., modified by the covalent attachment of polyalkylene glycol (e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polybutylene glycol) or other suitable polymer). See, PCT/GB03/002804, filed Jun. 30, 2003, which designated the United States, (WO 2004/081026) regarding PEGylated of single variable domains and dAbs, suitable methods for preparing same, increased in vivo half life of the PEGylated single variable domains and dAb monomers and multimers, suitable PEGs, preferred hydrodynamic sizes of PEGs, and preferred hydrodynamic sizes of PEGylated single variable domains and dAb monomers and multimers. The entire teaching of PCT/GB03/002804 (WO 2004/081026), including the portions referred to above, are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand can be formatted using a suitable linker such as (Gly\n4\nSer)\nn\n, where n=from 1 to 8, (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7). If desired, ligands, including dAb monomers, dimers and trimers, can be linked to an antibody Fc region, comprising one or both of \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains, and optionally a hinge region. For example, vectors encoding ligands linked as a single nucleotide sequence to an Fc region may be used to prepare such polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands and dAb monomers can also be combined and/or formatted into non-antibody multi-ligand structures to form multivalent complexes, which bind target molecules with the same antigen, thereby providing superior avidity. For example natural bacterial receptors such as SpA can been used as scaffolds for the grafting of CDRs to generate ligands which bind specifically to one or more epitopes. Details of this procedure are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,831,012. Other suitable scaffolds include those based on fibronectin and affibodies. Details of suitable procedures are described in WO 98/58965. Other suitable scaffolds include lipocallin and CTLA4, as described in van den Beuken et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol, \n310:591-601 (2001), and scaffolds such as those described in WO 00/69907 (Medical Research Council), which are based for example on the ring structure of bacterial GroEL or other chaperone polypeptides. Protein scaffolds may be combined; for example, CDRs may be grafted on to a CTLA4 scaffold and used together with immunoglobulin V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomains to form a ligand. Likewise, fibronectin, lipocallin and other scaffolds may be combined\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of suitable methods for preparing any desired format are known in the art. For example, antibody chains and formats (e.g., monospecific, bispecific, trispecific or tetraspecific IgG-like formats, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, single chain antibodies, hornodimers and heterodimers of antibody heavy chains and/or light chains) can be prepared by expression of suitable expression constructs and/or culture of suitable cells (e.g., hybridomas, heterohybridomas, recombinant host cells containing recombinant constructs encoding the format). Further, formats such as antigen-binding fragments of antibodies or antibody, chains (e.g., bispecific binding fragments, such as a Fv fragment (e.g., single chain Fv (scFv), a disulfide bonded Fv), a Fab fragment, a Fab′ fragment, a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment), can be prepared by expression of suitable expression constructs or by enzymatic digestion of antibodies, for example using papain or pepsin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand can be formatted as a multispecific ligand, for example as described in WO 03/002609, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Such multispecific ligand possesses more than one epitope binding specificity. Generally, the multi-specific ligand comprises two or more epitope binding domains, such dAbs or non-antibody protein domain comprising a binding site for an epitope, e.g., an affibody, a SpA domain, an LDL receptor class A domain, an EGF domain, an avimer. Multispecific ligands can be formatted further as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the ligand is an IgG-like format. Such formats have the conventional four chain structure of an IgG molecule (2 heavy chains and two light chains), in which one or more of the variable regions (V\nH \nand or V\nL\n) have been replaced with a dAb or immunoglobulin single variable domain of a desired specificity. Preferably, each of the variable regions (2 V\nH \nregions and 2 V\nL \nregions) is replaced with a dAb or immunoglobulin single variable domain. The dAb(s) or immunoglobulin single variable domain(s) that are included in an IgG-like format can have the same specificity or different specificities. In some embodiments, the IgG-like format is tetravalent and can have one, two, three or four specificities. The IgG-like format can be bispecific and comprise, for example, a first and second dAb that have the same specificity, a third dAb with a different specificity and a fourth dAb with a different specificity from the first, second and third dAbs; or tetraspecific and comprise four dAbs that each have a different specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IgG-like format can be monospecific and comprise 4 dAbs that have the specificity for IL-4 or for IL-13. The IgG-like format can be bispecific and comprise, for example, 3 dAbs that have specificity for IL-4 and another dAb that has specificity for IL-13, or bispecific and comprise, for example two dAbs that have specificity for IL-4 and two dAbs that have specificity for IL-13. The IgG-like format can be bispecific and comprise, for example, 3 dAbs that have specificity for IL-13 and another dAb that has specificity for IL-14. When the IgG-like format contains two or more dAbs that bind IL-4, the dAbs can bind to the same or different epitopes. For example, the IgG-like format can comprise two, three or four dAbs that have binding specificity for IL-4 that bind the same or different epitopes on IL-4. Similarly, when the IgG-like format contains two or more dAbs that bind IL-13, the dAbs can bind to the same or different epitopes. For example, the IgG-like format can comprise two, three or four dAbs that have binding specificity for IL-13 that bind the same or different epitopes on IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the IgG-like format is a tetravalent IgG-like ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4 or IL-13 comprising two heavy chains and two light chains, wherein said heavy chains comprise the constant region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain and a single immunoglobulin variable domain that has binding specificity for IL-4 or IL-13; and said light chains comprise the constant region of an immunoglobulin light chain and a single immunoglobulin variable domain that has binding specificity for IL-4 or IL-13. The IgG-like format of this example can be further characterized by the proviso that when said heavy chains comprise a single immunoglobulin variable domain that has binding specificity for IL-4, said light chains comprise a single immunoglobulin variable domain that has binding specificity for IL-13; and when said heavy chains comprise a single immunoglobulin variable domain that has binding specificity for IL-13, said light chains comprise a single immunoglobulin variable domain that has binding specificity for IL-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen-binding fragments of IgG-like formats (e.g., Fab, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fab′, Fv, scF\nV\n) can be prepared. In addition, a particular constant region or Fc portion (e.g., constant region or Fc portion of an IgG, such as IgG1. (e.g., CH1, CH2 and CH3; CH2 and CH3)), variant or portion thereof can be selected in order to tailor effector function. For example, if complement activation and/or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) function is desired, the ligand can be an IgG1-like format. If desired, the IgG-like format can comprise a mutated constant region (variant IgG heavy chain constant region) to minimize binding to Fc receptors and/or ability to fix complement. (see e.g. Winter et al, GB 2,209,757 B; Morrison et al., WO 89/07142; Morgan et al., WO 94/29351, Dec. 22, 1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of the invention can be formatted as a fusion protein that contains a first immunoglobulin single variable domain that is fused directly (e.g., through a peptide bond) or through a suitable linker (amino acid, peptide, polypeptide) to a second immunoglobulin single variable domain. If desired such a format can further comprise, for example, one or more immunoglobulin domains (e.g., constant region, Fc portion) and/or a half life extending moiety as described herein. For example, the ligand can comprise a first immunoglobulin single variable domain that is fused directly to a second immunoglobulin single variable domain that is fused directly to an immunoglobulin single variable domain that binds serum albumin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the ligand comprises a first single immunoglobulin single variable domain, a second immunoglobulin single variable domain and an Fc portion or an immunoglobulin constant region. The first and second immunoglobulin single variable domains can each have binding specificity for IL-4 or IL-13. Accordingly, this type of ligand can contain two binding sites (be bivalent) wherein each binding site binds IL-4, each binding site binds IL-13 or wherein one binding site binds IL-4 and one binding site binds IL-13. For example, the ligands can have the structure V domain-V domain-IgG constant region or V domain-V domain-IgG Fc portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally the orientation of the polypeptide domains that have a binding site with binding specificity for a target and whether the ligand comprises a linker is a matter of design choice. However, some orientations, with or without linkers, may provide better binding characteristics than other orientations. All orientations (e.g., dAb1-linker-dAb2; dAb2-linker-dAb1) are encompassed by the invention, and ligands that contain an orientation that provides desired binding characteristics can be easily identified by screening.\n\n\n \nHalf-Life Extended Formats\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ligand, and dAb monomers disclosed herein, can be formatted to extend its in vivo serum half life. Increased in vivo half-life is useful in in vivo applications of immunoglobulins, especially antibodies and most especially antibody fragments of small size such as dAbs. Such fragments (Fvs, disulphide bonded Fvs, Fabs, says, dAbs) are rapidly cleared from the body, which can limit clinical applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA ligand can be formatted as a larger antigen-binding fragment of an antibody or as an antibody (e.g., formatted as a Fab, Fab′, F(ab)\n2\n, F(ab′)\n2\n, IgG, scFv) that has larger hydrodynamic size. Ligands can also be formatted to have a larger hydrodynamic size, for example, by attachment of a polyalkyleneglycol group (e.g. polyethyleneglycol (PEG) group, polypropylene glycol, polybutylene glycol), serum albumin, transferrin, transferrin receptor or at least the transferrin-binding portion thereof, an antibody Fc region, or by conjugation to an antibody domain. In some embodiments, the ligand (e.g., dAb monomer) is PEGylated. Preferably the PEGylated ligand (e.g., dAb monomer) binds IL-4 and/or IL-13 with substantially the same affinity or avidity as the same ligand that is not PEGylated. For example, the ligand can be a PEGylated ligand comprising a dAb that binds IL-4 or IL-13 with an affinity or avidity that differs from the avidity of ligand in unPEGylated form by no more than a factor of about 1000, preferably no more than a factor of about 100, more preferably no more than a factor of about 10, or with affinity or avidity substantially unchanged relative to the unPEGylated form. See, PCT/GB03/002804, filed Jun. 30, 2003, which designated the United States, (WO 2004/081026) regarding PEGylated single variable domains and dAbs, suitable methods for preparing same, increased in vivo half-life of the PEGylated single variable domains and dAb monomers and multimers, suitable PEGs, preferred hydrodynamic sizes of PEGs, and preferred hydrodynamic sizes of PEGylated single variable domains and dAb monomers and multimers. The entire teaching of PCT/GB03/002804 (WO 2004/081026), including the portions referred to above, are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHydrodynamic size of the ligands (e.g., dAb monomers and multimers) of the invention may be determined using methods which are well known in the art. For example, gel filtration chromatography may be used to determine the hydrodynamic size of a ligand. Suitable gel filtration matrices for determining the hydrodynamic sizes of ligands, such as cross-linked agarose matrices, are well known and readily available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe size of a ligand format (e.g., the size of a PEG moiety attached to a dAb monomer), can be varied depending on the desired application. For example, where a ligand is intended to leave the circulation and enter into peripheral tissues, it is desirable to keep the hydrodynamic size of the ligand low to facilitate diffusion from the blood stream. Alternatively, where it is desired to have the ligand remain in the systemic circulation for a longer period of time the size of the ligand can be increased, for example by formatting as an IgG-like protein or by addition of a 30 to 60 kDa PEG moiety (e.g., linear or branched 30 kDa PEG to 40 kDa PEG, such as addition of two 20 kDa PEG moieties.) The size of the ligand format can be tailored to achieve a desired in vivo serum half-life. For example, the size of the ligand format can be tailored to control exposure to a toxin and/or to reduce side effects of toxic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hydrodynamic size of a ligand (e.g., dAb monomer) and its serum half-life can also be increased by conjugating or linking the ligand to a binding domain (e.g., antibody or antibody fragment) that binds an antigen or epitope that increases half-life in vivo, as described herein. For example, the ligand (e.g., dAb monomer) can be conjugated or linked to an anti-serum albumin or anti-neonatal Fc receptor antibody or antibody fragment, (e.g., an anti-SA or anti-neonatal Fc receptor dAb, Fab, Fab′ or scFv), or to an anti-SA affibody or anti-neonatal Fc receptor affibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable albumin, albumin fragments or albumin variants for use in a ligand according to the invention are described in WO 2005/077042A2, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In particular, the following albumin, albumin fragments or albumin variants can be used in the present invention:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:1 (as disclosed in WO 2005/077042A2, this sequence being explicitly incorporated into the present disclosure by reference);\n \nAlbumin fragment or variant comprising or consisting of amino acids 1-387 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2;\n \nAlbumin, or fragment or variant thereof, comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: (a) amino acids 54 to 61 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (b) amino acids 76 to 89 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (c) amino acids 92 to 100 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (d) amino acids 170 to 176 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (e) amino acids 247 to 252 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (f) amino acids 266 to 277 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (g) amino acids 280 to 288 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (h) amino acids 362 to 368 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (i) amino acids 439 to 447 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2 (j) amino acids 462 to 475 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (k) amino acids 478 to 486 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; and (l) amino acids 560 to 566 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nFurther examples of suitable albumin, fragments and analogs for use in a ligand according to the invention are described in WO 03/076567A2, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In particular, the following albumin, fragments or variants can be used in the present invention:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nHuman serum albumin as described in WO 03/076567A2, (e.g., in \nFIG. 3\n) (this sequence information being explicitly incorporated into the present disclosure by reference);\n \nHuman serum albumin (HA) consisting of a single non-glycosylated polypeptide chain of 585 amino acids with a formula molecular weight of 66,500 (See, Meloun, et al., \nFEBS Letters \n58:136 (1975); Behrens, et al., \nFed. Proc. \n34:591 (1975); Lawn, et al., \nNucleic Acids Research \n9:6102-6114 (1981); Minghetti, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n261:6747 (1986));\n \nA polymorphic variant or analog or fragment of albumin as described in Weitkamp, et al., \nAnn. Hum. Genet. \n37:219 (1973);\n \nAn albumin fragment or variant as described in EP 322094, (e.g., HA(1-373), HA(1-388), HA(1-389), HA(1-369), and HA(1-419) and fragments between 1-369 and 1-419);\n \nAn albumin fragment or variant as described in EP 399666, (e.g., HA(1-177) and HA(1-200) and fragments between HA(1-X), where X is any number from 178 to 199).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nWhere a (one or more) half-life extending moiety (e.g., albumin, transferrin and fragments and analogs thereof) is used in the ligands of the invention, it can be conjugated to the ligand using any suitable method, such as, by direct fusion to the target-binding moiety (e.g., dAb or antibody fragment), for example by using a single nucleotide construct that encodes a fusion protein, wherein the fusion protein is encoded as a single polypeptide chain with the half-life extending moiety located N- or C-terminally to the cell surface target binding moieties. Alternatively, conjugation can be achieved by using a peptide linker between moieties, (e.g., a peptide linker as described in WO 03/076567A2 or WO 2004/003019) (these linker disclosures being incorporated by reference in the present disclosure to provide examples for use in the present invention).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo is a polypeptide which occurs naturally in vivo and which resists degradation or removal by endogenous mechanisms which remove unwanted material from the organism (e.g., human). For example, a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo can be selected from proteins from the extracellular matrix, proteins found in blood, proteins found at the blood brain barrier or in neural tissue, proteins localized to the kidney, liver, lung, heart, skin or bone, stress proteins, disease-specific proteins, or proteins involved in Fc transport.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life in vivo include, for example, transferrin receptor specific ligand-neuropharmaceutical agent fusion proteins (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,307, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference), brain capillary endothelial cell receptor, transferrin, transferrin receptor (e.g., soluble transferrin receptor), insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) receptor, insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF 2) receptor, insulin receptor, blood coagulation factor X, α1-antitrypsin and HNF 1α. Suitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life also include alpha-1 glycoprotein (orosomucoid; AAG), alpha-1 antichymotrypsin (ACT), alpha-1 microglobulin (protein HC; AIM), antithrombin III (AT III), apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), ceruloplasmin (Cp), complement component C3 (C3), complement component C4 (C4), C1 esterase inhibitor (C1 INH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin (FER), hemopexin (HPX), lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), mannose-binding protein (MBP), myoglobin (Myo), prealbumin (transthyretin; PAL), retinol-binding protein (RBP), and rheumatoid factor (RF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins from the extracellular matrix include, for example, collagens, laminins, integrins and fibronectin. Collagens are the major proteins of the extracellular matrix. About 15 types of collagen molecules are currently known, found in different parts of the body, e.g. type I collagen (accounting for 90% of body collagen) found in bone, skin, tendon, ligaments, cornea, internal organs or type II collagen found in cartilage, vertebral disc, notochord, and vitreous humor of the eye.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins from the blood include, for example, plasma proteins (e.g., fibrin, α-2 macroglobulin, serum albumin, fibrinogen (e.g., fibrinogen A, fibrinogen B), serum amyloid protein A, haptoglobin, profilin, ubiquitin, uteroglobulin and β-2-microglobulin), enzymes and enzyme inhibitors (e.g., plasminogen, lysozyme, cystatin C, alpha-1-antitrypsin and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor), proteins of the immune system, such as immunoglobulin proteins (e.g., IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM, immunoglobulin light chains (kappa/lambda)), transport proteins (e.g., retinol binding protein, α-1 microglobulin), defensins (e.g., beta-\ndefensin\n 1, \nneutrophil defensin\n 1, \nneutrophil defensin\n 2 and neutrophil defensin 3) and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins found at the blood brain barrier or in neural tissue include, for example, melanocortin receptor, myelin, ascorbate transporter and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life in vivo also include proteins localized to the kidney (e.g., polycystin, type IV collagen, organic anion transporter K1, Heymann's antigen), proteins localized to the liver (e.g., alcohol dehydrogenase, G250), proteins localized to the lung (e.g., secretory component, which binds IgA), proteins localized to the heart (e.g., \nHSP\n 27, which is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy), proteins localized to the skin (e.g., keratin), bone specific proteins such as morphogenic proteins (BMPs), which are a subset of the transforming growth factor β superfamily of proteins that demonstrate osteogenic activity (e.g., BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-8), tumor specific proteins (e.g., trophoblast antigen, herceptin receptor, oestrogen receptor, cathepsins (e.g., cathepsin B, which can be found in liver and spleen)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable disease-specific proteins include, for example, antigens expressed only on activated T-cells, including LAG-3 (lymphocyte activation gene), osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL; see \nNature \n402, 304-309 (1999)), OX40 (a member of the TNF receptor family, expressed on activated T cells and specifically up-regulated in human T cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-I)-producing cells; see \nImmunol. \n165 (1):263-70 (2000)). Suitable disease-specific proteins also include, for example, metalloproteases (associated with arthritis/cancers) including CG6512 \nDrosophila\n, human paraplegia, human FtsH, human AFG3L2, murine ftsH; and angiogenic growth factors, including acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), angiogenin, interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-8 (IL-8), platelet-derived endothelial growth factor (PD-ECGF), placental growth factor (P1GF), midkine platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF), and fractalkine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life in vivo also include stress proteins such as heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs are normally found intracellularly. When they are found extracellularly, it is an indicator that a cell has died and spilled out its contents. This unprogrammed cell death (necrosis) occurs when as a result of trauma, disease or injury, extracellular HSPs trigger a response from the immune system. Binding to extracellular HSP can result in localizing the compositions of the invention to a disease site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins involved in Fc transport include, for example, Brambell receptor (also known as FcRB). This Fc receptor has two functions, both of which are potentially useful for delivery. The functions are (1) transport of IgG from mother to child across the placenta (2) protection of IgG from degradation thereby prolonging its serum half-life. It is thought that the receptor recycles IgG from endosomes. (See, Holliger et al, \nNat Biotechnol \n15(7):632-6 (1997).)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for pharmacokinetic analysis and determination of ligand half-life will be familiar to those skilled in the art. Details may be found in Kenneth, A. et al: Chemical Stability of Pharmaceuticals: A Handbook for Pharmacists and in Peters et al, Pharmacokinetic Analysis: A Practical Approach (1996). Reference is also made to “Pharmacokinetics”, M Gibaldi & D Perron, published by Marcel Dekker, 2\nnd \nRev. ex edition (1982), which describes pharmacokinetic parameters such as t alpha and t beta half lives and area under the curve (AUC).\n\n\n \n \nLigands that Contain a Toxin Moiety or Toxin\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to ligands that comprise a toxin moiety or toxin. Suitable toxin moieties comprise a toxin (e.g., surface active toxin, cytotoxin). The toxin moiety or toxin can be linked or conjugated to the ligand using any suitable method. For example, the toxin moiety or toxin can be covalently bonded to the ligand directly or through a suitable linker. Suitable linkers can include noncleavable or cleavable linkers, for example, pH cleavable linkers that comprise a cleavage site for a cellular enzyme (e.g., cellular esterases, cellular proteases such as cathepsin B). Such cleavable linkers can be used to prepare a ligand that can release a toxin moiety or toxin after the ligand is internalized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of methods for linking or conjugating a toxin moiety or toxin to a ligand can be used. The particular method selected will depend on the toxin moiety or toxin and ligand to be linked or conjugated. If desired, linkers that contain terminal functional groups can be used to link the ligand and toxin moiety or toxin. Generally, conjugation is accomplished by reacting toxin moiety or toxin that contains a reactive functional group (or is modified to contain a reactive functional group) with a linker or directly with a ligand. Covalent bonds formed by reacting a toxin moiety or toxin that contains (or is modified to contain) a chemical moiety or functional group that can, under appropriate conditions, react with a second chemical group thereby forming a covalent bond. If desired, a suitable reactive chemical group can be added to ligand or to a linker using any suitable method. (See, e.g., Hermanson, G. T., \nBioconjugate Techniques\n, Academic Press: San Diego, Calif. (1996).) Many suitable reactive chemical group combinations are known in the art, for example an amine group can react with an electrophilic group such as tosylate, mesylate, halo (chloro, bromo, fluoro, iodo), N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (NHS), and the like. Thiols can react with maleimide, iodoacetyl, acrylolyl, pyridyl disulfides, 5-thiol-2-nitrobenzoic acid thiol (TNB-thiol), and the like. An aldehyde functional group can be coupled to amine- or hydrazide-containing molecules, and an azide group can react with a trivalent phosphorous group to form phosphoramidate or phosphorimide linkages. Suitable methods to introduce activating groups into molecules are known in the art (see for example, Hermanson, G. T., \nBioconjugate Techniques\n, Academic Press: San Diego, Calif. (1996)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable toxin moieties and toxins include, for example, a maytansinoid (e.g., maytansinol, e.g., DM1, DM4), a taxane, a calicheamicin, a duocarmycin, or derivatives thereof. The maytansinoid can be, for example, maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue. Examples of maytansinol analogs include those having a modified aromatic ring (e.g., C-19-decloro, C-20-demethoxy, C-20-acyloxy) and those having modifications at other positions (e.g., C-9-CH, C-14-alkoxymethyl, C-14-hydroxymethyl or aceloxymethyl, C-15-hydroxy/acyloxy, C-15-methoxy, C-18-N-demethyl, 4,5-deoxy). Maytansinol and maytansinol analogs are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020 and 6,333,410, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Maytansinol can be coupled to antibodies and antibody fragments using, e.g., an N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)proprionate (also known as N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (or SPP), 4-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyl-a-(2-pyridyldithio)-toluene (SMPT), N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)butyrate (SDPB), 2 iminothiolane, or S-acetylsuccinic anhydride. The taxane can be, for example, a taxol, taxotere, or novel taxane (see, e.g., WO 01/38318). The calicheamicin can be, for example, a bromo-complex calicheamicin (e.g., an alpha, beta or gamma bromo-complex), an iodo-complex calicheamicin (e.g., an alpha, beta or gamma iodo-complex), or analogs and mimics thereof. Bromo-complex calicheamicins include I1-BR, I2-BR, I3-BR, I4-BR, J1-BR, J2-BR and K1-BR. Iodo-complex calicheamicins include I1-I, I2-I, I3-I, J1-I, J2-I, L1-I and K1-BR. Calicheamicin and mutants, analogs and mimics thereof are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,970,198; 5,264,586; 5,550,246; 5,712,374, and 5,714,586, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. Duocarmycin analogs (e.g., KW-2189, DC88, DC89 CBI-TMI, and derivatives thereof are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,092, U.S. Pat. No. 5,187,186, U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,780, U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,780, U.S. Pat. No. 4,923,990, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,101,038, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of other toxins include, but are not limited to antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, CC-1065 (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,475,092, 5,585,499, 5,846,545), melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclophosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, mitomycin, puromycin anthramycin (AMC)), duocarmycin and analogs or derivatives thereof, and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, taxol, auristatins (e.g., auristatin E) and maytansinoids, and analogs or homologs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe toxin can also be a surface active toxin, such as a toxin that is a free radical generator (e.g. selenium containing toxin moieties), or radionuclide containing moiety. Suitable radionuclide containing moieties, include for example, moieties that contain radioactive iodine (\n131\nI or \n125\nI), yttrium (\n90\nY), lutetium (\n177\nLu), actinium (\n225\nAc), praseodymium, astatine (\n211\nAt), rhenium (\n186\nRe), bismuth (\n212\nBi or \n213\nBi), indium (\n111\nIn), technetium (\n99\nmTc), phosphorus (\n32\nP), rhodium (\n188\nRh), sulfur (\n35\nS), carbon (\n14\nC), tritium (\n3\nH), chromium (\n51\nCr), chlorine (\n36\nCl), cobalt (\n57\nCo or \n58\nCo), iron (\n59\nFe), selenium (\n75\nSe), or gallium (\n67\nGa).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe toxin can be a protein, polypeptide or peptide, from bacterial sources, e.g., diphtheria toxin, pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) and plant proteins, e.g., the A chain of ricin (RTA), the ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPS) gelonin, pokeweed antiviral protein, saporin, and dodecandron are contemplated for use as toxins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntisense compounds of nucleic acids designed to bind, disable, promote degradation or prevent the production of the mRNA responsible for generating a particular target protein can also be used as a toxin. Antisense compounds include antisense RNA or DNA, single or double stranded, oligonucleotides, or their analogs, which can hybridize specifically to individual mRNA species and prevent transcription and/or RNA processing of the mRNA species and/or translation of the encoded polypeptide and thereby effect a reduction in the amount of the respective encoded polypeptide.

Suitable photoactive agents include porphyrin-based materials such as porfimer sodium, the green porphyrins, chlorin E6, hematoporphyrin derivative itself, phthalocyanines, etiopurpurins, texaphrin, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe toxin can be an antibody or antibody fragment that binds an intracellular target, such as a dAb that binds an intracellular target (an intrabody). Such antibodies or antibody fragments (dAbs) can be directed to defined subcellular compartments or targets. For example, the antibodies or antibody fragments (dAbs) can bind an intracellular target selected from erbB2, EGFR, BCR-ABL, p21Ras, Caspase3, Caspase7, Bcl-2, p53, Cyclin E, ATF-1/CREB, HPV16 E7, HP1, Type IV collagenases, cathepsin L as well as others described in Kontermann, R.

In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide domain (e.g., dAb) binds to IL-4 with an affinity (KD; KD=K\noff\n(kd)/K\non\n(ka)) of 300 nM to 1 pM (i.e., 3×10\n−7 \nto 5×10\n−12\nM), preferably 50 nM to 1 pM, more preferably 5 nM to 1 pM and most preferably 1 nM to 1 pM, for example a K\nD \nof 1×10\n−7\nM or less, preferably 1×10\n−8 \nM or less, more preferably 1×10\n−9 \nM or less, advantageously 1×10\n−10 \nM or less and most preferably 1×10\n−11 \nM or less; and/or a K\noff \nrate constant of 5×10\n−1 \ns\n−1 \nto 1×10\n−7 \ns\n−1\n, preferably 1×10\n−2 \ns\n−1 \nto 1×10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, more preferably 5×10\n−3 \ns\n−1 \nto 1×10\n−5 \ns\n−1\n, for example 5×10\n−1 \ns\n−1 \nor less, preferably 1×10\n−2 \ns\n−1 \nor less, advantageously 1×10\n−3 \ns\n−1 \nor less, more preferably 1×10\n4 \ns\n−1 \nor less, still more preferably 1×10\n−5 \ns\n1 \nor less, and most preferably 1×10\n−6 \ns\n−1 \nor less as determined by surface plasmon resonance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 competes for binding to IL-4 with a dAb selected from the group consisting of DOM9-15 (SEQ ID NO:175), DOM9-17(SEQ ID

Preferably, the CDR or CDRs of the ligand of these embodiments is a CDR or CDRs of an anti-IL-4 dAb described herein. Preferably, the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises one, two, or three of the CDRs of one of the anti-IL-4 dAbs disclosed herein. In other embodiments, the ligand (e.g., ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13, ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4) comprises only CDR3 of a V\nH\n, V\nL \nor V\nHH \nthat binds IL-4. The non-immunoglobulin domain can comprise an amino acid sequence that has one or more regions that have sequence identity to one, two or three of the CDRs of an anti-IL-4 dAb described herein. For example, the non-immunoglobulin domain can have an amino acid sequence that contains at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% sequence identity with CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 of an anti-IL-4 dAb disclosed herein. Even more preferably, the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises one, two, or three of the CDRs of DOM9-44-502 (SEQ ID NO:512), DOM9-155-5 (SEQ ID NO:605), DOM9-155-25 (SEQ ID NO:617), DOM9-112-155 (SEQ ID NO:292), DOM9-112-168 (SEQ ID NO:305), DOM9-112-174 (SEQ ID NO:311), DOM9-112-199 (SEQ ID NO:336), and DOM9-112-200 (SEQ ID NO:337).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is substantially resistant to aggregation. For example, in some embodiments, less than about 10%, less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2% or less than about 1% of the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 aggregates when a 1-5 mg/ml, 5-10 mg/ml, 10-20 mg/ml, 20-50 mg/ml, 50-100 mg/ml, 100-200 mg/ml or 200-500 mg/ml solution of ligand or dAb in a solvent that is routinely used for drug formulation such as saline, buffered saline, citrate buffer saline, water, an emulsion, and, any of these solvents with an acceptable excipient such as those approved by the FDA, is maintained at about 22° C., 22-25° C., 25-30° C., 30-37° C., 37-40° C., 40-50° C., 50-60° C., 60-70° C., 70-80° C., 15-20° C., 10-15° C., 5-10° C., 2-5° C., 0-2° C., −10° C. to 0° C., −20° C. to −10° C., −40° C. to −20° C., −60° C. to −40° C., or −80° C. to −60° C., for a period of about time, for example, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 8 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAggregation can be assessed using any suitable method, such as, by microscopy, assessing turbidity of a solution by visual inspection or spectroscopy or any other suitable method. Preferably, aggregation is assessed by dynamic light scattering. Polypeptide domains that have a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 that are resistant to aggregation provide several advantages. For example, such polypeptide domains that have a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 can readily be produced in high yield as soluble proteins by expression using a suitable biological production system, such as \nE. coli\n, and can be formulated and/or stored at higher concentrations than conventional polypeptides, and with less aggregation and loss of activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 that is resistant to aggregation can be produced more economically than other antigen- or epitope-binding polypeptides (e.g., conventional antibodies). For example, generally, preparation of antigen- or epitope-binding polypeptides intended for in vivo applications includes processes (e.g., gel filtration) that remove aggregated polypeptides. Failure to remove such aggregates can result in a preparation that is not suitable for in vivo applications because, for example, aggregates of an antigen-binding polypeptide that is intended to act as an antagonist can function as an agonist by inducing cross-linking or clustering of the target antigen. Protein aggregates can also reduce the efficacy of therapeutic polypeptide by inducing an immune response in the subject to which they are administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast, the aggregation resistant polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 of the invention can be prepared for in vivo applications without the need to include process steps that remove aggregates, and can be used in in vivo applications without the aforementioned disadvantages caused by polypeptide aggregates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 unfolds reversibly when heated to a temperature (Ts) and cooled to a temperature (Tc), wherein Ts is greater than the melting temperature (Tm) of the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4, and Tc is lower than the melting temperature of the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4. For example, a polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 can unfold reversibly when heated to 80° C. and cooled to about room temperature. A polypeptide that unfolds reversibly loses function when unfolded but regains function upon refolding. Such polypeptides are distinguished from polypeptides that aggregate when unfolded or that improperly refold (misfolded polypeptides), i.e., do not regain function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptide unfolding and refolding can be assessed, for example, by directly or indirectly detecting polypeptide structure using any suitable method. For example, polypeptide structure can be detected by circular dichroism (CD) (e.g., far-UV CD, near-UV CD), fluorescence (e.g., fluorescence of tryptophan side chains), susceptibility to proteolysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), or by detecting or measuring a polypeptide function that is dependent upon proper folding (e.g., binding to target ligand, binding to generic ligand). In one example, polypeptide unfolding is assessed using a functional assay in which loss of binding function (e.g., binding a generic and/or target ligand, binding a substrate) indicates that the polypeptide is unfolded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe extent of unfolding and refolding of a polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 can be determined using an unfolding or denaturation curve. An unfolding curve can be produced by plotting temperature as the ordinate and the relative concentration of folded polypeptide as the abscissa. The relative concentration of folded polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 can be determined directly or indirectly using any suitable method (e.g., CD, fluorescence, binding assay). For example, a polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 solution can be prepared and ellipticity of the solution determined by CD. The ellipticity value obtained represents a relative concentration of folded ligand or dAb monomer of 100%. The polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 in the solution is then unfolded by incrementally raising the temperature of the solution and ellipticity is determined at suitable increments (e.g., after each increase of one degree in temperature). The polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 in solution is then refolded by incrementally reducing the temperature of the solution and ellipticity is determined at suitable increments. The data can be plotted to produce an unfolding curve and a refolding curve. The unfolding and refolding curves have a characteristic sigmoidal shape that includes a portion in which the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 molecules is folded, an unfolding/refolding transition in which the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 molecules is unfolded to various degrees, and a portion in which polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is unfolded. The y-axis intercept of the refolding curve is the relative amount of refolded polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 recovered. A recovery of at least about 50%, or at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, or at least about 75%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 95% is indicative that the ligand or dAb monomer unfolds reversibly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, reversibility of unfolding of polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is determined by preparing a polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 solution and plotting heat unfolding and refolding curves. The polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 solution can be prepared in any suitable solvent, such as an aqueous buffer that has a pH suitable to allow polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 to dissolve (e.g., pH that is about 3 units above or below the isoelectric point (pI)). The polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 solution is concentrated enough to allow unfolding/folding to be detected. For example, the ligand or dAb monomer solution can be about 0.1 μM to about 100 μM, or preferably about 1 μM to about 10 μM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the melting temperature (Tm) of the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is known, the solution can be heated to about ten degrees below the Tm (Tm-10) and folding assessed by ellipticity or fluorescence (e.g., far-UV CD scan from 200 nm to 250 nm, fixed wavelength CD at 235 nm or 225 nm; tryptophan fluorescent emission spectra at 300 to 450 nm with excitation at 298 nm) to provide 100% relative folded ligand or dAb monomer. The solution is then heated to at least ten degrees above Tm (Tm+10) in predetermined increments (e.g., increases of about 0.1 to about 1 degree), and ellipticity or fluorescence is determined at each increment. Then, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is refolded by cooling to at least Tm-10 in predetermined increments and ellipticity or fluorescence determined at each increment. If the melting temperature of the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is not known, the solution can be unfolded by incrementally heating from about 25° C. to about 100° C. and then refolded by incrementally cooling to at least about 25° C., and ellipticity or fluorescence at each heating and cooling increment is determined. The data obtained can be plotted to produce an unfolding curve and a refolding curve, in which the y-axis intercept of the refolding curve is the relative amount of refolded protein recovered. In some embodiments, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for VEGF does not comprise a Camelid immunoglobulin variable domain, or one or more framework amino acids that are unique to immunoglobulin variable domains encoded by Camelid germline antibody gene segments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is secreted in a quantity of at least about 0.5 mg/L when expressed in \nE. coli \nor in \nPichia \nspecies (e.g., \nP. pastoris\n). In other preferred embodiments, polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is secreted in a quantity of at least about 0.75 mg/L, at least about 1 mg/L, at least about 4 mg/L, at least about 5 mg/L, at least about 10 mg/L, at least about 15 mg/L, at least about 20 mg/L, at least about 25 mg/L, at least about 30 mg/L, at least about 35 mg/L, at least about 40 mg/L, at least about 45 mg/L, or at least about 50 mg/L, or at least about 100 mg/L, or at least about 200 mg/L, or at least about 300 mg/L, or at least about 400 mg/L, or at least about 500 mg/L, or at least about 600 mg/L, or at least about 700 mg/L, or at least about 800 mg/L, at least about 900 mg/L, or at least about 1 g/L when expressed in \nE. coli \nor in \nPichia \nspecies (e.g., \nP. pastoris\n). In other preferred embodiments, a polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is secreted in a quantity of at least about 1 mg/L to at least about 1 g/L, at least about 1 mg/L to at least about 750 mg/L, at least about 100 mg/L to at least about 1 g/L, at least about 200 mg/L to at least about 1 g/L, at least about 300 mg/L to at least about 1 g/L, at least about 400 mg/L to at least about 1 g/L, at least about 500 mg/L to at least about 1 g/L, at least about 600 mg/L to at least about 1 g/L, at least about 700 mg/L to at least about 1 g/L, at least about 800 mg/L to at least about 1 g/L, or at least about 900 mg/L to at least about 1 g/L when expressed in \nE, coli \nor in \nPichia \nspecies (e.g., \nP. pastoris\n). Although, polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 described herein can be secretable when expressed in \nE. coli \nor in \nPichia \nspecies (e.g., \nP. pastoris\n), they can be produced using any suitable method, such as synthetic chemical methods or biological production methods that do not employ \nE. coli \nor \nPichia \nspecies.\n\n\n \n \nPolypeptide Domains that Bind IL-13\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides polypeptide domains (e.g., dAb) that have a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide domain (e.g., dAb) binds to IL-13 with an affinity (KD; KD=K\noff\n(kd)/K\non \n(ka)) of 300 nM to 1 pM (i.e., 3×10\n−7 \nto 5×10\n−12\nM), preferably 100 nM to 1 pM, or 50 nM to 10 pM, more preferably 10 nM to 100 pM and most preferably about 1 nM, for example a K\nD \nof 1×10\n−7 \nM or less, preferably 1×10\n−8 \nM or less, more preferably about

for IL-13 (e.g., a dAb) comprises an amino acid sequence that has at least about 90%, at least about 91%, at least about 92%, at least about 93%, at least about 94%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% amino acid sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of DOM-10-53 (SEQ ID NO:967) or DOM10-176-535 (SEQ ID NO:1587). For example, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 can comprise the amino acid sequence of DOM10-176-535 (SEQ ID NO:1587), DOM10-53-223 (SEQ ID NO:1090), DOM10-53-234 (SEQ ID NO:1101), DOM10-53-316 (SEQ ID NO:1182), DOM10-53-339 (SEQ ID NO:1203), DOM10-53-344 (SEQ ID NO:1208), DOM10-53-396 (SEQ ID NO:1260), DOM10-53-474 (SEQ ID NO:2369) and DOM10-275-1 (SEQ ID NO:2241).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 competes with any of the dAbs disclosed herein for binding to IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 is an immunoglobulin single variable domain. The polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 can comprise any suitable immunoglobulin variable domain, and preferably comprises a human variable domain or a variable domain that comprises human framework regions. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 comprises a universal framework, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand of the invention (e.g., ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13, ligand that has binding specificity for IL-13) can comprise a non-immunoglobulin binding moiety that has binding specificity for IL-13 and inhibits a function of IL-13 (e.g., binding to receptor), wherein the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises one, two or three of the CDRs of a V\nH\n, V\nL\n., or V\nHH \nthat binds IL-13 and a suitable scaffold. In certain embodiments, the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises CDR3 but not CDR1 or CDR2 of a V\nH\n, V\nL\n, or V\nHH \nthat binds IL-13 and a suitable scaffold. In other embodiments, the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises CDR1 and CDR2, but not CDR3 of a V\nH\n, V\nL \nor V\nHH \nthat binds IL-13 and a suitable scaffold. In other embodiments, the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 of a V\nH\n, V\nL \nor V\nHH \nthat binds IL-13 and a suitable scaffold. Preferably, the CDR or CDRs of the ligand of these embodiments is a CDR or CDRs of an anti-IL-13 dAb described herein. Preferably, the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises one, two, or three of the CDRs of one of the anti-IL-13 dAbs disclosed herein. In other embodiments, the ligand (e.g., ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13, ligand that has binding specificity for IL-13) comprises only CDR3 of a V\nH\n, V\nL \nor V\nHH \nthat binds IL-13. The non-immunoglobulin domain can comprise an amino acid sequence that has one or more regions that have sequence identity to one, two or three of the CDRs of an anti-IL-13 dAb described herein. For example, the non-immunoglobulin domain can have an amino acid sequence that contains at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% sequence identity with CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 of an anti-IL13 dAb disclosed herein. Even more preferably, the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises one, two, or three of the CDRs of DOM10-176-535 (SEQ ID NO:1587), DOM10-53-223 (SEQ ID NO:1090), DOM10-53-234 (SEQ ID NO:1101), DOM10-53-316 (SEQ ID NO:1182), DOM10-53-339 (SEQ ID NO:1203), DOM10-53-344 (SEQ ID NO:1208) and DOM10-53-396 (SEQ ID NO:1260).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 resists aggregation, unfolds reversibly, comprises a framework region and/or is secreted as described above for the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4\n\n\n \n \ndAb Monomers that Bind Serum Albumin\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of the invention can further comprise a dAb monomer that binds serum albumin (SA) with a K\nd \nof 1 nM to 500 μM (i.e., ×10\n−9 \nto 5×10\n−4\n), preferably 100 nM to 10 μM. Preferably, for a ligand comprising an anti-SA dAb, the binding (e.g. K\nd \nand/or K\noff \nas measured by surface plasmon resonance, (e.g., using BiaCore)) of the ligand its target(s) is from 1 to 100000 times (preferably 100 to 100000, more preferably 1000 to 100000, or 10000 to 100000 times) stronger than for SA.

acid molecule of the invention. In certain embodiments, the vector is an expression vector comprising one or more expression control elements or sequences that are operably linked to the recombinant nucleic acid of the invention The invention also provides a recombinant host cell comprising a recombinant nucleic acid molecule or vector of the invention. Suitable vectors (e.g., plasmids, phagmids), expression control elements, host cells and methods for producing recombinant host cells of the invention are well-known in the art, and examples are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable expression vectors can contain a number of components, for example, an origin of replication, a selectable marker gene, one or more expression control elements, such as a transcription control element (e.g., promoter, enhancer, terminator) and/or one or more translation signals, a signal sequence or leader sequence, and the like. Expression control elements and a signal sequence, if present, can be provided by the vector or other source. For example, the transcriptional and/or translational control sequences of a cloned nucleic acid encoding an antibody chain can be used to direct expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA promoter can be provided for expression in a desired host cell. Promoters can be constitutive or inducible. For example, a promoter can be operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding an antibody, antibody chain or portion thereof, such that it directs transcription of the nucleic acid. A variety of suitable promoters for prokaryotic (e.g., lac, tac, T3, T7 promoters for \nE. coli\n) and eukaryotic (e.g., Simian Virus 40 early or late promoter, Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter, cytomegalovirus promoter, adenovirus late promoter) hosts are available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, expression vectors typically comprise a selectable marker for selection of host cells carrying the vector, and, in the case of a replicable expression vector, an origin of replication. Genes encoding products which confer antibiotic or drug resistance are common selectable markers and may be used in prokaryotic (e.g. lactamase gene (ampicillin resistance), Tet gene for tetracycline resistance) and eukaryotic cells (e.g., neomycin (G418 or geneticin), gpt (mycophenolic acid), ampicillin, or hygromycin resistance genes). Dihydrofolate reductase marker genes permit selection with methotrexate in a variety of hosts. Genes encoding the gene product of auxotrophic markers of the host (e.g., LEU2, URA3, HIS3) are often used as selectable markers in yeast. Use of viral (e.g., baculovirus) or phage vectors, and vectors which are capable of integrating into the genome of the host cell, such as retroviral vectors, are also contemplated. Suitable expression vectors for expression in mammalian cells and prokaryotic cells (\nE. coli\n), insect cells (Drosophila Schnieder S2 cells, Sf9) and yeast (\nP. inethanolica, P. pastoris, S. cerevisiae\n) are well-known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable host cells can be prokaryotic, including bacterial cells such as \nE. coli, B. subtilis \nand/or other suitable bacteria; eukaryotic cells, such as fungal or yeast cells (e.g., \nPichia pastoris, Aspergillus \nsp., \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Neurospora crassa\n), or other lower eukaryotic cells, and cells of higher eukaryotes such as those from insects (e.g., \nDrosophila \nSchnieder S2 cells, Sf9 insect cells (WO 94/26087 (O'Connor)), mammals (e.g., COS cells, such as COS-1 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1650) and COS-7 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1651), CHO (e.g., ATCC Accession No. CRL-9096, CHO DG44 G. and Chasin, L A., \nProc. Natl. Acac. Sci. USA, \n77(7):4216-4220 (1980))), 293 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1573), HeLa (ATCC Accession No. CCL-2), CV1 (ATCC Accession No. CCL-70), WOP (Dailey, L., et al., \nJ. Virol., \n54:739-749 (1985), 3T3, 293T (Pear, W. S., et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U.S.A., \n90:8392-8396 (1993)) NS0 cells, SP2/0, HuT 78 cells and the like, or plants (e.g., tobacco). (See, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al., eds. \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, Greene Publishing Associates and John Wiley & Sons Inc. (1993).) In some embodiments, the host cell is an isolated host cell and is not part of a multicellular organism (e.g., plant or animal). In preferred embodiments, the host cell is a non-human host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method for producing a ligand (e.g., dual-specific ligand, multispecific ligand) of the invention, comprising maintaining a recombinant host cell comprising a recombinant nucleic acid of the invention under conditions suitable for expression of the recombinant nucleic acid, whereby the recombinant nucleic acid is expressed and a ligand is produced. In some embodiments, the method further comprises isolating the ligand.\n\n\n \nPreparation of Immunoglobulin Based Ligands\n\n\n \n \n \nLigands (e.g., dual specific ligands, multispecific) according to the invention can be prepared according to previously established techniques, used in the field of antibody engineering, for the preparation of scFv, “phage” antibodies and other engineered antibody molecules. Techniques for the preparation of antibodies are for example described in the following reviews and the references cited therein: Winter & Milstein, (1991) \nNature \n349:293-299; Pluckthun (1992) \nImmunological Reviews \n130:151-188; Wright et al., (1992) \nCrit.

Immunother. 45, 128-130.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable techniques employed for selection of antibody variable domains with a desired specificity employ libraries and selection procedures which are known in the art. Natural libraries (Marks et al. (1991)\nJ. Mol. Biol., \n222: 581; Vaughan et al. (1996) \nNature Biotech., \n14: 309) which use rearranged V genes harvested from human B cells are well known to those skilled in the art. Synthetic libraries (Hoogenboom & Winter (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol\n., 227: 381; Barbas et al. (1992) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n89: 4457; Nissim et al. (1994) \nEMBO J, \n13: 692; Griffiths et al. (1994) \nEMBO J., \n13: 3245; De Kruif et al. (1995) \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n248: 97) are prepared by cloning immunoglobulin V genes, usually using PCR. Errors in the PCR process can lead to a high degree of randomisation. V\nH \nand/or V\nL \nlibraries may be selected against target antigens or epitopes separately, in which case single domain binding is directly selected for, or together.\n\n\n \nLibrary Vector Systems\n\n\n \n \n \nA variety of selection systems are known in the art which are suitable for use in the present invention. Examples of such systems are described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBacteriophage lambda expression systems may be screened directly as bacteriophage plaques or as colonies of lysogens, both as previously described (Huse et al. (1989) \nScience, \n246: 1275; Caton and Koprowski (1990) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., \n87; Mullinax et al. (1990) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., \n87: 8095; Persson et al. (1991) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., \n88: 2432) and are of use in the invention. Whilst such expression systems can be used to screen up to 10\n6 \ndifferent members of a library, they are not really suited to screening of larger numbers (greater than 10\n6 \nmembers). Of particular use in the construction of libraries are selection display systems, which enable a nucleic acid to be linked to the polypeptide it expresses. As used herein, a selection display system is a system that permits the selection, by suitable display means, of the individual members of the library by binding the generic and/or target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelection protocols for isolating desired members of large libraries are known in the art, as typified by phage display techniques. Such systems, in which diverse peptide sequences are displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage (Scott and Smith (1990) \nScience, \n249: 386), have proven useful for creating libraries of antibody fragments (and the nucleotide sequences encoding them) for the in vitro selection and amplification of specific antibody fragments that bind a target antigen (McCafferty et al., WO 92/01047). The nucleotide sequences encoding the variable regions are linked to gene fragments which encode leader signals that direct them to the periplasmic space of \nE. coli \nand as a result the resultant antibody fragments are displayed on the surface of the bacteriophage, typically as fusions to bacteriophage coat proteins (e.g., pIII or pVIII). Alternatively, antibody fragments are displayed externally on lambda phage capsids (phagebodies). An advantage of phage-based display systems is that, because they are biological systems, selected library members can be amplified simply by growing the phage containing the selected library member in bacterial cells. Furthermore, since the nucleotide sequence that encodes the polypeptide library member is contained on a phage or phagemid vector, sequencing, expression and subsequent genetic manipulation is relatively straightforward.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for the construction of bacteriophage antibody display libraries and lambda phage expression libraries are well known in the art (McCafferty et al. (1990) \nNature, \n348: 552; Kang et al. (1991) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., \n88: 4363; Clackson et al. (1991) \nNature, \n352: 624; Lowman et al. (1991) \nBiochemistry, \n30: 10832; Burton et al. (1991) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., \n88: 10134; Hoogenboom et al. (1991) \nNucleic Acids Res., \n19: 4133; Chang et al. (1991) \nJ. Immunol., \n147: 3610; Breitling et al. (1991) \nGene, \n104: 147; Marks et al. (1991) supra; Barbas et al. (1992) supra; Hawkins and Winter (1992) \nJ. Immunol., \n22: 867; Marks et al., 1992\n, J. Biol. Chem., \n267: 16007; Lerner et al. (1992) \nScience, \n258: 1313, incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne particularly advantageous approach has been the use of scFv phage-libraries (Huston et al., 1988\n, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., \n85: 5879-5883; Chaudhary et al. (1990) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., \n87: 1066-1070; McCafferty et al. (1990) supra; Clackson et al. (1991) \nNature, \n352: 624; Marks et al. (1991) \nJ Mol. Biol., \n222: 581; Chiswell et al. (1992) Trends Biotech., 10: 80; Marks et al. (1992) \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n267). Various embodiments of scFv libraries displayed on bacteriophage coat proteins have been described. Refinements of phage display approaches are also known, for example as described in WO96/06213 and WO92/01047 (Medical Research Council et al.) and WO97/08320 (Morphosys), which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther systems for generating libraries of polypeptides involve the use of cell-free enzymatic machinery for the in vitro synthesis of the library members. In one method, RNA molecules are selected by alternate rounds of selection against a target and PCR amplification (Tuerk and Gold (1990) \nScience, \n249: 505; Ellington and Szostak (1990) \nNature, \n346: 818). A similar technique may be used to identify DNA sequences which bind a predetermined human transcription factor (Thiesen and Bach (1990) \nNucleic Acids Res., \n18: 3203; Beaudry and Joyce (1992) \nScience, \n257: 635; WO92/05258 and WO92/14843). In a similar way, in vitro translation can be used to synthesise polypeptides as a method for generating large libraries. These methods which generally comprise stabilised polysome complexes, are described further in WO88/08453, WO90/05785, WO90/07003, WO91/02076, WO91/05058, and WO92/02536. Alternative display systems which are not phage-based, such as those disclosed in WO95/22625 and WO95/11922 (Affymax) use the polysomes to display polypeptides for selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA still further category of techniques involves the selection of repertoires in artificial compartments, which allow the linkage of a gene with its gene product. For example, a selection system in which nucleic acids encoding desirable gene products may be selected in microcapsules formed by water-in-oil emulsions is described in WO99/02671, WO00/40712 and Tawfik & Griffiths (1998) \nNature Biotechnol \n16(7), 652-6. Genetic elements encoding a gene product having a desired activity are compartmentalised into microcapsules and then transcribed and/or translated to produce their respective gene products (RNA or protein) within the microcapsules. Genetic elements which produce gene product having desired activity are subsequently sorted. This approach selects gene products of interest by detecting the desired activity by a variety of means.\n\n\n \nLibrary Construction\n\n\n \n \n \nLibraries intended for selection, may be constructed using techniques known in the art, for example as set forth above, or may be purchased from commercial sources, Libraries which are useful in the present invention are described, for example, in WO99/20749. Once a vector system is chosen and one or more nucleic acid sequences encoding polypeptides of interest are cloned into the library vector, one may generate diversity within the cloned molecules by undertaking mutagenesis prior to expression; alternatively, the encoded proteins may be expressed and selected, as described above, before mutagenesis and additional rounds of selection are performed. Mutagenesis of nucleic acid sequences encoding structurally optimized polypeptides is carried out by standard molecular methods. Of particular use is the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, (Mullis and Faloona (1987) \nMethods Enzymol., \n155: 335, herein incorporated by reference). PCR, which uses multiple cycles of DNA replication catalyzed by a thermostable, DNA-dependent DNA polymerase to amplify the target sequence of interest, is well known in the art. The construction of various antibody libraries has been discussed in Winter et al. (1994) \nAnn. Rev. Immunology \n12, 433-55, and references cited therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCR is performed using template DNA (at least 1 fg; more usefully, 1-1000 ng) and at least 25 pmol of oligonucleotide primers; it may be advantageous to use a larger amount of primer when the primer pool is heavily heterogeneous, as each sequence is represented by only a small fraction of the molecules of the pool, and amounts become limiting in the later amplification cycles. A typical reaction mixture includes: 2 μl of DNA, 25 pmol of oligonucleotide primer, 2.5 μl of 10×PCR buffer 1 (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, Calif.), 0.4 μl of 1.25 μM dNTP, 0.15 μl (or 2.5 units) of Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, Calif.) and deionized water to a total volume of 25 μl. Mineral oil is overlaid and the PCR is performed using a programmable thermal cycler. The length and temperature of each step of a PCR cycle, as well as the number of cycles, is adjusted in accordance to the stringency requirements in effect. Annealing temperature and timing are determined both by the efficiency with which a primer is expected to anneal to a template and the degree of mismatch that is to be tolerated; obviously, when nucleic acid molecules are simultaneously amplified and mutagenised, mismatch is required, at least in the first round of synthesis. The ability to optimise the stringency of primer annealing conditions is well within the knowledge of one of moderate skill in the art. An annealing temperature of between 30° C. and 72° C. is used. Initial denaturation of the template molecules normally occurs at between 92° C. and 99° C. for 4 minutes, followed by 20-40 cycles consisting of denaturation (94-99° C. for 15 seconds to 1 minute), annealing (temperature determined as discussed above; 1-2 minutes), and extension (72° C. for 1-5 minutes, depending on the length of the amplified product). Final extension is generally for 4 minutes at 72° C., and may be followed by an indefinite (0-24 hour) step at 4° C.\n\n\n \nCombining Single Variable Domains\n\n\n \n \n \nDomains useful in the invention, once selected, may be combined by a variety of methods known in the art, including covalent and non-covalent methods. Preferred methods include the use of polypeptide linkers, as described, for example, in connection with scFv molecules (Bird et al., (1988) Science 242:423-426). Discussion of suitable linkers is provided in Bird et al. \nScience \n242, 423-426; Hudson et al, \nJournal Immunol Methods \n231 (1999) 177-189; Hudson et al, \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n85, 5879-5883. Linkers are preferably flexible, allowing the two single domains to interact. One linker example is a (Gly\n4 \nSer)\nn \nlinker, where n=1 to 8, e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5 or 7. The linkers used in diabodies, which are less flexible, may also be employed (Holliger et al., (1993) \nProc. Nat, Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n90:6444-6448). In one embodiment, the linker employed is not an immunoglobulin hinge region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariable domains may be combined using methods other than linkers. For example, the use of disulphide bridges, provided through naturally-occurring or engineered cysteine residues, may be exploited to stabilize V\nH\n-V\nH\n, V\nL\n-V\nL \nor V\nH\n-V\nL\n, dimers (Reiter et al., (1994) \nProtein Eng. \n7:697-704) or by remodelling the interface between the variable domains to improve the “fit” and thus the stability of interaction (Ridgeway et al., (1996) \nProtein Eng. \n7:617-621; Zhu et al., (1997) \nProtein Science \n6:781-788). Other techniques for joining or stabilizing variable domains of immunoglobulins, and in particular antibody V\nH \ndomains, may be employed as appropriate.\n\n\n \nCharacterisation of Ligands\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding of a dual-specific ligand to the cell or the binding of each binding domain to each specific target can be tested by methods which will be familiar to those skilled in the art and include RASA. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, binding is tested using monoclonal phage ELISA. Phage ELISA may be performed according to any suitable procedure: an exemplary protocol is set forth below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPopulations of phage produced at each round of selection can be screened for binding by ELISA to the selected antigen or epitope, to identify “polyclonal” phage antibodies. Phage from single infected bacterial colonies from these populations can then be screened by ELISA to identify “monoclonal” phage antibodies. It is also desirable to screen soluble antibody fragments for binding to antigen or epitope, and this can also be undertaken by ELISA using reagents, for example, against a C- or N-terminal tag (see for example Winter et al. (1994) \nAnn. Rev. Immunology \n12, 433-55 and references cited therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diversity of the selected phage monoclonal antibodies may also be assessed by gel electrophoresis of PCR products (Marks et al. 1991\n, supra\n; Nissim et al. 1994 \nsupra\n), probing (Tomlinson et al., 1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol\n. 227, 776) or by sequencing of the vector DNA.\n\n\n \nStructure of Ligands\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the case that each variable domain is selected from V-gene repertoires selected for instance using phage display technology as herein described, then these variable domains comprise a universal framework region, such that is they may be recognized by a generic ligand as herein defined. The use of universal frameworks, generic ligands and the like is described in WO99/20749.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere V-gene repertoires are used, variation in polypeptide sequence is preferably located within the structural loops of the variable domains. The polypeptide sequences of either variable domain may be altered by DNA shuffling or by mutation in order to enhance the interaction of each variable domain with its complementary pair. DNA shuffling is known in the art and taught, for example, by Stemmer, 1994\n, Nature \n370: 389-391 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,297,053, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Other methods of mutagenesis are well known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, nucleic acid molecules and vector constructs required for selection, preparation and formatting dual-specific ligands may be constructed and manipulated as set forth in standard laboratory manuals, such as Sambrook et al. (1989) \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor, USA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe manipulation of nucleic acids useful in the present invention is typically carried out in recombinant vectors. As used herein, vector refers to a discrete element that is used to introduce heterologous DNA into cells for the expression and/or replication thereof. Methods by which to select or construct and, subsequently, use such vectors are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Numerous vectors are publicly available, including bacterial plasmids, bacteriophage, artificial chromosomes and episomal vectors. Such vectors may be used for simple cloning and mutagenesis; alternatively a gene expression vector is employed. A vector of use according to the invention may be selected to accommodate a polypeptide coding sequence of a desired size, typically from 0.25 kilobase (kb) to 40 kb or more in length. A suitable host cell is transformed with the vector after in vitro cloning manipulations. Each vector contains various functional components, which generally include a cloning (or “polylinker”) site, an origin of replication and at least one selectable marker gene. If the given vector is an expression vector, it additionally possesses one or more of the following: an enhancer element, a promoter, transcription, termination and signal sequences, each positioned in the vicinity of the cloning site, such that they are operatively linked to the gene encoding a dual-specific ligand according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth cloning and expression vectors generally contain nucleic acid sequences that enable the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Typically in cloning vectors, this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2 micron plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (e.g. SV 40, adenovirus) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication is not needed for mammalian expression vectors unless these are used in mammalian cells able to replicate high levels of DNA, such as COS cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdvantageously, a cloning or expression vector may contain a selection gene also referred to as selectable marker. This gene encodes a protein necessary for the survival or growth of transformed host cells grown in a selective culture medium. Host cells not transformed with the vector containing the selection gene will therefore not survive in the culture medium. Typical selection genes encode proteins that confer resistance to antibiotics and other toxins, (e.g. ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate or tetracycline), complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or supply critical nutrients not available in the growth media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the replication of vectors encoding a dual-specific ligand according to the present invention is most conveniently performed in \nE. coli\n, an \nE. coli\n-\nselectable \nmarker, for example, the β-lactamase gene that confers resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin, is of use. These can be obtained from \nE. coli \nplasmids, such as pBR322 or a pUC plasmid such as pUC18 or pUC19.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognised by the host organism and is operably linked to the coding sequence of interest. Such a promoter may be inducible or constitutive. The term “operably linked” refers to a juxtaposition wherein the components described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. A control sequence “operably linked” to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include, for example, the β-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, the tryptophan (trp) promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. Promoters for use in bacterial systems will also generally contain a Shine-Delgarno sequence operably linked to the coding sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preferred vectors are expression vectors that enable the expression of a nucleotide sequence corresponding to a polypeptide library member. Thus, selection with the first and/or second antigen or epitope can be performed by separate propagation and expression of a single clone expressing the polypeptide library member or by use of any selection display system. As described above, the preferred selection display system is bacteriophage display. Thus, phage or phagemid vectors may be used., (e.g., pIT1 or pIT2). Leader sequences useful in the invention include pelB, stII, ompA, phoA, bla and pelA. One example is phagemid vectors, which have an \nE. coli \norigin of replication (for double stranded replication) and also a phage origin of replication (for production of single-stranded DNA). The manipulation and expression of such vectors is well known in the art (Hoogenboom and Winter (1992) supra; Nissim et al. (1994) supra). Briefly, the vector contains a β-lactamase gene to confer selectivity on the phagemid and a lac promoter upstream of an expression cassette that consists (N to C terminal) of a pelB leader sequence (which directs the expressed polypeptide to the periplasmic space), a multiple cloning site (for cloning the nucleotide version of the library member), optionally, one or more peptide tags (for detection), optionally, one or more TAG stop codon and the phage protein pill. Thus, using various suppressor and non-suppressor strains of \nE. coli \nand with the addition of glucose, iso-propyl thio-β-D-galactoside (IPTG) or a helper phage, such as VCS M13, the vector is able to replicate as a plasmid with no expression, produce large quantities of the polypeptide library member only or produce phage, some of which contain at least one copy of the polypeptide-pIII fusion on their surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConstruction of vectors encoding dual-specific ligands according to the invention employs conventional ligation techniques. Isolated vectors or DNA fragments are cleaved, tailored, and religated in the form desired to generate the required vector. If desired, analysis to confirm that the correct sequences are present in the constructed vector can be performed in a known fashion. Suitable methods for constructing expression vectors, preparing in vitro transcripts, introducing DNA into host cells, and performing analyses for assessing expression and function are known to those skilled in the art. The presence of a gene sequence in a sample is detected, or its amplification and/or expression quantified by conventional methods, such as Southern or Northern analysis, Western blotting, dot blotting of DNA, RNA or protein, in situ hybridisation, immunocytochemistry or sequence analysis of nucleic acid or protein molecules. Those skilled in the art will readily envisage how these methods may be modified, if desired.\n\n\n \nSkeletons\n\n\n \n \n \nSkeletons may be based on immunoglobulin molecules or may be non-immunoglobulin in origin as set forth above. Each domain of a ligand (e.g., dual-specific ligand) may be a different skeleton. Preferred immunoglobulin skeletons as herein defined includes any one or more of those selected from the following: an immunoglobulin molecule comprising at least (i) the CL (kappa or lambda subclass) domain of an antibody; or (ii) the CH1 domain of an antibody heavy chain; an immunoglobulin molecule comprising the CH1 and CH2 domains of an antibody heavy chain; an immunoglobulin molecule comprising the CH1, CH2 and CH3 domains of an antibody heavy chain; or any of the subset (ii) in conjunction with the CL (kappa or lambda subclass) domain of an antibody. A hinge region domain may also be included. For example, the ligand can comprise a heavy chain constant region of an immunoglobulin (e.g., IgG (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) IgM, IgA, IgD or IgE) or portion thereof (e.g., Fc portion) and/or a light chain constant region (e.g., C\nλ\n., C\nκ\n). For example, the ligand can comprise CH1 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), CH1 and CH2 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), CH1, CH2 and CH3 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), CH2 and CH3 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), or CH1 and CH3 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1). Such combinations of domains may, for example, mimic natural antibodies, such as IgG or IgM, or fragments thereof, such as Fv, say, Fab or F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecules. Those skilled in the art will be aware that this list is not intended to be exhaustive.\n\n\n \nProtein Scaffolds\n\n\n \n \n \nEach binding domain can comprise a protein scaffold and one or more CDRs (e.g., of the dAbs disclosed herein) which are involved in the specific interaction of the domain with one or more epitopes. Advantageously, an epitope binding domain according to the present invention comprises three CDRs. Suitable protein scaffolds include any of those selected from the group consisting of the following: those based on immunoglobulin domains, those based on fibronectin, those based on affibodies, those based on CTLA4, those based on chaperones such as GroEL, those based on lipocallin and those based on the bacterial Fc receptors SpA and SpD. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that this list is not intended to be exhaustive. The binding domains can also comprise a protein scaffold that has a binding site that has binding specificity for a target (e.g., IL-4, IL-13), but does not contain one or more CDRs (e.g., of the dAbs disclosed herein). For example, the binding domain can be a protein scaffold that has a binding site that has binding specificity for a target selected from an affibody, an SpA domain, based on CTLA4, those based on chaperones such as GroEL, those based on lipocallin and those based on the bacterial Fc receptors SpA and SpD, an LDL receptor class A domain, an avimer (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005/0053973, 2005/0089932, 2005/0164301).\n\n\n \nScaffolds for Use in Constructing Ligands\n\n\nSelection of the Main-Chain Conformation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe members of the immunoglobulin superfamily all share a similar fold for their polypeptide chain. For example, although antibodies are highly diverse in terms of their primary sequence, comparison of sequences and crystallographic structures has revealed that, contrary to expectation, five of the six antigen binding loops of antibodies (H1, H2, L1, L2, L3) adopt a limited number of main-chain conformations, or canonical structures (Chothia and Lesk (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n196: 901; Chothia et al. (1989) \nNature, \n342: 877). Analysis of loop lengths and key residues has therefore enabled prediction of the main-chain conformations of H1, H2, L1, L2 and L3 found in the majority of human antibodies (Chothia et al. (1992) J. Mol. Biol., 227: 799; Tomlinson et al. (1995) \nEMBO J., \n14: 4628; Williams et al. (1996) \nJ. Mol. \n13101., 264: 220), Although the H3 region is much more diverse in terms of sequence, length and structure (due to the use of D segments), it also forms a limited number of main-chain conformations for short loop lengths which depend on the length and the presence of particular residues, or types of residue, at key positions in the loop and the antibody framework (Martin et al, (1996) \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n263: 800; Shirai et al. (1996) \nFEBS Letters, \n399: 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLibraries of ligands and/or binding domains can be designed in which certain loop lengths and key residues were chosen to ensure that the main-chain conformation of the members is known. Advantageously, these are real conformations of immunoglobulin superfamily molecules found in nature, to minimize the chances that they are non-functional, as discussed above. Germline V gene segments serve as one suitable basic framework for constructing antibody or T-cell receptor libraries; other sequences are also of use. Variations may occur at a low frequency, such that a small number of functional members may possess an altered main-chain conformation, which does not affect its function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCanonical structure theory is also of use to assess the number of different main-chain conformations encoded by ligands, to predict the main-chain conformation based on dual-specific ligand sequences and to choose residues for diversification which do not affect the canonical structure. It is known that, in the human V\nκ\n domain, the L1 loop can adopt one of four canonical structures, the L2 loop has a single canonical structure and that 90% of human V\nκ\n domains adopt one of four or five canonical structures for the L3 loop (Tomlinson et al. (1995) supra); thus, in the V\nκ\n domain alone, different canonical structures can combine to create a range of different main-chain conformations. Given that V\nλ\n the domain encodes a different range of canonical structures for the L1, L2 and L3 loops and that V\nκ\n and V\nλ\n domains can pair with any V\nH \ndomain which can encode several canonical structures for the H1 and H2 loops, the number of canonical structure combinations observed for these five loops is very large. This implies that the generation of diversity in the main-chain conformation may be essential for the production of a wide range of binding specificities. However, by constructing an antibody library based on a single known main-chain conformation it has been found, contrary to expectation, that diversity in the main-chain conformation is not required to generate sufficient diversity to target substantially all antigens. Even more surprisingly, the single main-chain conformation need not be a consensus structure—a single naturally occurring conformation can be used as the basis for an entire library. Thus, in a preferred aspect, the ligands of the invention possess a single known main-chain conformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe single main-chain conformation that is chosen is preferably commonplace among molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily type in question. A conformation is commonplace when a significant number of naturally occurring molecules are observed to adopt it. Accordingly, in a preferred aspect of the invention, the natural occurrence of the different main-chain conformations for each binding loop of an immunoglobulin domain are considered separately and then a naturally occurring variable domain is chosen which possesses the desired combination of main-chain conformations for the different loops. If none is available, the nearest equivalent may be chosen. It is preferable that the desired combination of main-chain conformations for the different loops is created by selecting germline gene segments which encode the desired main-chain conformations. It is more preferable that the selected germline gene segments are frequently expressed in nature, and most preferable that they are the most frequently expressed of all natural germline gene segments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn designing ligands (e.g., ds-dAbs), or libraries thereof, the incidence of the different main-chain conformations for each of the six antigen binding loops may be considered separately. For H1, H2, L1, L2 and L3, a given conformation that is adopted by between 20% and 100% of the antigen binding loops of naturally occurring molecules is chosen. Typically, its observed incidence is above 35% (i.e. between 35% and 100%) and, ideally, above 50% or even above 65%. Since the vast majority of H3 loops do not have canonical structures, it is preferable to select a main-chain conformation which is commonplace among those loops which do display canonical structures. For each of the loops, the conformation which is observed most often in the natural repertoire is therefore selected. In human antibodies, the most popular canonical structures (CS) for each loop are as follows: H1-CS 1 (79% of the expressed repertoire), H2-CS 3 (46%), L1-CS 2 of V\nκ\n (39%), L2-CS 1 (100%), L3-CS 1 of V\nκ\n (36%) (calculation assumes a κ:λ ratio of 70:30, Hood et al. (1967) \nCold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol., \n48: 133). For H3 loops that have canonical structures, a CDR3 length (Kabat et al, (1991) \nSequences of proteins of immunological interest\n, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) of seven residues with a salt-bridge from residue 94 to residue 101 appears to be the most common. There are at least 16 human antibody sequences in the EMBL data library with the required H13 length and key residues to form this conformation and at least two crystallographic structures in the protein data bank which can be used as a basis for antibody modelling (2cgr and 1tet). The most frequently expressed germline gene segments with this combination of canonical structures are the V\nH \nsegment 3-23 (DP-47), the J\nH \nsegment JH4b, the V\nκ\n segment O2/O12 (DPK9) and the J\nκ\n segment J\nκ\n1. V\nH \nsegments DP45 and DP38 are also suitable. These segments can therefore be used in combination as a basis to construct a library with the desired single main-chain conformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, instead of choosing the single main-chain conformation based on the natural occurrence of the different main-chain conformations for each of the binding loops in isolation, the natural occurrence of combinations of main-chain conformations is used as the basis for choosing the single main-chain conformation. In the case of antibodies, for example, the natural occurrence of canonical structure combinations for any two, three, four, five or for all six of the antigen binding loops can be determined. Here, it is preferable that the chosen conformation is commonplace in naturally occurring antibodies and most preferable that it observed most frequently in the natural repertoire. Thus, in human antibodies, for example, when natural combinations of the five antigen binding loops, H1, H2, L1, L2 and L3, are considered, the most frequent combination of canonical structures is determined and then combined with the most popular conformation for the H3 loop, as a basis for choosing the single main-chain conformation.\n\n\n \nDiversification of the Canonical Sequence\n\n\n \n \n \nHaving selected several known main-chain conformations or, preferably a single known main-chain conformation, dual-specific ligands (e.g., ds-dAbs) or libraries for use in the invention can be constructed by varying each binding site of the molecule in order to generate a repertoire with structural and/or functional diversity. This means that variants are generated such that they possess sufficient diversity in their structure and/or in their function so that they are capable of providing a range of activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe desired diversity is typically generated by varying the selected molecule at one or more positions. The positions to be changed can be chosen at random or are preferably selected. The variation can then be achieved either by randomisation, during which the resident amino acid is replaced by any amino acid or analogue thereof, natural or synthetic, producing a very large number of variants or by replacing the resident amino acid with one or more of a defined subset of amino acids, producing a more limited number of variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious methods have been reported for introducing such diversity. Error-prone PCR (Hawkins et al. (1992)\nJ. Mol. Biol., \n226: 889), chemical mutagenesis (Deng et al. (1994) \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n269: 9533) or bacterial mutator strains (Low et al. (1996) \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n260: 359) can be used to introduce random mutations into the genes that encode the molecule. Methods for mutating selected positions are also well known in the art and include the use of mismatched oligonucleotides or degenerate oligonucleotides, with or without the use of PCR. For example, several synthetic antibody libraries have been created by targeting mutations to the antigen binding loops. The H3 region of a human tetanus toxoid-binding Fab has been randomised to create a range of new binding specificities (Barbas et al. (1992) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n89: 4457). Random or semi-random H3 and L3 regions have been appended to germline V gene segments to produce large libraries with unmutated framework regions (Hoogenboom & Winter (1992) J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381; Barbas et al. (1992) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Set. USA, \n89: 4457; Nissim et al. (1994) \nEMBO J, \n13: 692; Griffiths et al. (1994) \nEMBO J., \n13: 3245; De Kruif et al. (1995) \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n248: 97). Such diversification has been extended to include some or all of the other antigen binding loops (Crameri et al. (1996) Nature Med., 2: 100; Riechmann et al. (1995) \nBio/Technology, \n13: 475; Morphosys, WO97/08320, supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince loop randomization has the potential to create approximately more than 10\n15 \nstructures for H3 alone and a similarly large number of variants for the other five loops, it is not feasible using current transformation technology or even by using cell free systems to produce a library representing all possible combinations. For example, in one of the largest libraries constructed to date, 6×10\n10 \ndifferent antibodies, which is only a fraction of the potential diversity for a library of this design, were generated (Griffiths et al. (1994) supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, only the residues that are directly involved in creating or modifying the desired function of each domain of the dual-specific ligand molecule are diversified. For many molecules, the function of each domain will be to bind a target and therefore diversity should be concentrated in the target binding site, while avoiding changing residues which are crucial to the overall packing of the molecule or to maintaining the chosen main-chain conformation.\n\n\n \nDiversification of the Canonical Sequence as it Applies to Antibody Domains\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the case of antibody based ligands (e.g., ds-dAbs), the binding site for each target is most often the antigen binding site. Thus, preferably only those residues in the antigen binding site are varied. These residues are extremely diverse in the human antibody repertoire and are known to make contacts in high-resolution antibody/antigen complexes. For example, in L2 it is known that positions 50 and 53 are diverse in naturally occurring antibodies and are observed to make contact with the antigen. In contrast, the conventional approach would have been to diversify all the residues in the corresponding Complementarity Determining Region (CDR1) as defined by Kabat et al. (1991, supra), some seven residues compared to the two diversified in the library for use according to the invention. This represents a significant improvement in terms of the functional diversity required to create a range of antigen binding specificities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn nature, antibody diversity is the result of two processes: somatic recombination of germline V, D and J gene segments to create a naive primary repertoire (so called germline and junctional diversity) and somatic hypermutation of the resulting rearranged V genes. Analysis of human antibody sequences has shown that diversity in the primary repertoire is focused at the centre of the antigen binding site whereas somatic hypermutation spreads diversity to regions at the periphery of the antigen binding site that are highly conserved in the primary repertoire (see Tomlinson et al. (1996) \nJ. Mol. Biol\n., 256: 813). This complementarity has probably evolved as an efficient strategy for searching sequence space and, although apparently unique to antibodies, it can easily be applied to other polypeptide repertoires. The residues which are varied are a subset of those that form the binding site for the target. Different (including overlapping) subsets of residues in the target binding site are diversified at different stages during selection, if desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the ease of an antibody repertoire, an initial ‘naive’ repertoire can be created where some, but not all, of the residues in the antigen binding site are diversified. As used herein in this context, the term “naive” refers to antibody molecules that have no pre-determined target. These molecules resemble those which are encoded by the immunoglobulin genes of an individual who has not undergone immune diversification, as is the case with fetal and newborn individuals, whose immune systems have not yet been challenged by a wide variety of antigenic stimuli. This repertoire is then selected against a range of antigens or epitopes. If required, further diversity can then be introduced outside the region diversified in the initial repertoire. This matured repertoire can be selected for modified function, specificity or affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNaive repertoires of binding domains for the construction of dual-specific ligands in which some or all of the residues in the antigen binding site are varied are known in the art. (See, WO 2004/058821, WO 2004/003019, and WO 03/002609). The “primary” library mimics the natural primary repertoire, with diversity restricted to residues at the center of the antigen binding site that are diverse in the germline V gene segments (germline diversity) or diversified during the recombination process (junctional diversity). Those residues which are diversified include, but are not limited to, H50, H52, H52a, H53, H55, H56, H58, H95, H-96, H97, H98, L50, L53, L91, L92, L93, L94 and L96. In the “somatic” library, diversity is restricted to residues that are diversified during the recombination process (junctional diversity) or are highly somatically mutated. Those residues which are diversified include, but are not limited to: H31, H33, H35, H95, H96, H97, H98, L30, L31, L32, L34 and L96. All the residues listed above as suitable for diversification in these libraries are known to make contacts in one or more antibody-antigen complexes. Since in both libraries, not all of the residues in the antigen binding site are varied, additional diversity is incorporated during selection by varying the remaining residues, if it is desired to do so. It shall be apparent to one skilled in the art that any subset of any of these residues (or additional residues which comprise the antigen binding site) can be used for the initial and/or subsequent diversification of the antigen binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the construction of libraries for use in the invention, diversification of chosen positions is typically achieved at the nucleic acid level, by altering the coding sequence which specifies the sequence of the polypeptide such that a number of possible amino acids (all 20 or a subset thereof) can be incorporated at that position. Using the IUPAC nomenclature, the most versatile codon is NNK, which encodes all amino acids as well as the TAG stop codon. The NNK codon is preferably used in order to introduce the required diversity. Other codons which achieve the same ends are also of use, including the NNN codon, which leads to the production of the additional stop codons TGA and TAA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA feature of side-chain diversity in the antigen binding site of human antibodies is a pronounced bias which favors certain amino acid residues. If the amino acid composition of the ten most diverse positions in each of the V\nH\n, V\nκ\n and V\nλ\n regions are summed, more than 76% of the side-chain diversity comes from only seven different residues, these being, serine (24%), tyrosine (14%), asparagine (11%), glycine (9%), alanine (7%), aspartate (6%) and threonine (6%). This bias towards hydrophilic residues and small residues which can provide main-chain flexibility probably reflects the evolution of surfaces which are predisposed to binding a wide range of antigens or epitopes and may help to explain the required promiscuity of antibodies in the primary repertoire.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince it is preferable to mimic this distribution of amino acids, the distribution of amino acids at the positions to be varied preferably mimics that seen in the antigen binding site of antibodies. Such bias in the substitution of amino acids that permits selection of certain polypeptides (not just antibody polypeptides) against a range of target antigens is easily applied to any polypeptide repertoire. There are various methods for biasing the amino acid distribution at the position to be varied (including the use of tri-nucleotide mutagenesis, see WO97/08320), of which the preferred method, due to ease of synthesis, is the use of conventional degenerate codons. By comparing the amino acid profile encoded by all combinations of degenerate codons (with single, double, triple and quadruple degeneracy in equal ratios at each position) with the natural amino acid used it is possible to calculate the most representative codon. The codons (AGT)(AGC)T, (AGT)(AGC)C and (AGT)(AGO(CT)—that is, DVT, DVC and DVY, respectively using IUPAC nomenclature—are those closest to the desired amino acid profile: they encode 22% serine and 11% tyrosine, asparagine, glycine, alanine, aspartate, threonine and cysteine. Preferably, therefore, libraries are constructed using either the DVT, DVC or DVY codon at each of the diversified positions.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic and Diagnostic Compositions and Uses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides compositions comprising the ligands of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient, and therapeutic and diagnostic methods that employ the ligands or compositions of the invention. The ligands according to the method of the present invention may be employed in in vivo therapeutic and prophylactic applications, in vivo diagnostic applications and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic and prophylactic uses of ligands of the invention involve the administration of ligands according to the invention to a recipient mammal, such as a human. The ligands bind to targets with high affinity and/or avidity. In some embodiments, such as IgG-like ligands, the ligands can allow recruitment of cytotoxic cells to mediate killing of cancer cells, for example by antibody dependent cellular cytoxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantially pure ligands of at least 90 to 95% homogeneity are preferred for administration to a mammal, and 98 to 99% or more homogeneity is most preferred for pharmaceutical uses, especially when the mammal is a human. Once purified, partially or to homogeneity as desired, the ligands may be used diagnostically or therapeutically (including extracorporeally) or in developing and performing assay procedures, immunofluorescent stainings and the like (Lefkovite and Pernis, (1979 and 1981) Immunological Methods, Volumes I and II, Academic Press, NY).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the instant application, the term “prevention” involves administration of the protective composition prior to the induction of the disease. “Suppression” refers to administration of the composition after an inductive event, but prior to the clinical appearance of the disease, “Treatment” involves administration of the protective composition after disease symptoms become manifest. Treatment includes ameliorating symptoms associated with the disease, and also preventing or delaying the onset of the disease and also lessening the severity or frequency of symptoms of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the ligands, of the present invention will typically find use in preventing, suppressing or treating disease states. For example, ligands can be administered to treat, suppress or prevent a chronic inflammatory disease, allergic hypersensitivity, cancer, bacterial or viral infection, autoimmune disorders (which include, but are not limited to, Type I diabetes, asthma, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, spondylarthropathy (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis), systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), myasthenia gravis and Behcet's syndrome, psoriasis, endometriosis, and abdominal adhesions (e.g., post abdominal surgery).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of the invention may be used to treat, suppress or prevent disease, such as an allergic disease, a Th2-mediated disease, IL-13-mediated disease, IL-4-mediated disease, and/or IL-4/IL-13-mediated disease. Examples of such diseases include, Hodgkin's disease, asthma, allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, atopic allergy, ulcerative colitis, scleroderma, allergic rhinitis, COPD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic graft rejection, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary granuloma, progressive systemic sclerosis, schistosomiasis, hepatic fibrosis, renal cancer, Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkins disease, non-Hodgkins disease, Sezary syndrome, asthma, septic arthritis, dermatitis herpetiformis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, ulcerative colitis, scleroderma, hypertrophic scarring, Whipple's Disease, benign prostate hyperplasia, a lung disorder in which IL-4 receptor plays a role, condition in which IL-4 receptor-mediated epithelial barrier disruption plays a role, a disorder of the digestive system in which IL-4 receptor plays a role, an allergic reaction to a medication, Kawasaki disease, sickle cell disease, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Grave's disease, pre-eclampsia, Sjogren's syndrome, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Barrett's esophagus, autoimmune uveitis, tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bleomycin-induced pneumopathy and fibrosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, sarcoidosis, hyper IgE syndrome, idiopathic hypereosinophil syndrome, an autoimmune blistering disease, pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, myasthenia gravis, chronic fatigue syndrome, nephrosis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “allergic disease” refers to a pathological condition in which a patient is hypersensitized to and mounts an immunologic reaction against a substance that is normally nonimmunogenic. Allergic disease is generally characterized by activation of mast cells by IgE resulting in an inflammatory response (e.g., local response, systemic response) that can result in symptoms as benign as a runny nose, to life-threatening anaphylactic shock and death. Examples of allergic disease include, but are not limited to, allergic rhinitis (e.g., hay fever), asthma (e.g., allergic asthma), allergic dermatitis (e.g., eczema), contact dermatitis, food allergy and urticaria (hives).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “Th2-mediated disease” refers to a disease in which pathology is produced (in whole or in part) by an immune response (Th2-type immune response) that is regulated by CD4\n+\n Th2 T lymphocytes, which characteristically produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. A Th2-type immune response is associated with the production of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) and of certain classes of antibodies (e.g., IgE), and is associate with humor immunity. Th2-meidated diseases are characterized by the presence of elevated levels of Th2 cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) and/or certain classes of antibodies (e.g., IgE) and include, for example, allergic disease (e.g., allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, asthma (e.g., atopic asthma), allergic airways disease (AAD), anaphylactic shock, conjunctivitis), autoimmune disorders associated with elevated levels of IL-4 and/or IL-13 (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, host-versus-graft disease, renal disease (e.g., nephritic syndrome, lupus nephritis)), and infections associated with elevated levels of IL-4 and/or IL-13 (e.g., viral, parasitic, fungal (e.g., \nC. albicans\n) infection).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain cancers are associated with elevated levels of IL-4 and/or IL-13 or associated with IL-4-induced and/or IL-13-induced cancer cell proliferation (e.g., B cell lymphoma, T cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, head and neck cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer). These cancers can be treated, suppressed or prevented using the ligand of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the present ligands will be utilized in purified form together with pharmacologically appropriate carriers. Typically, these carriers include aqueous or alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, and include saline and/or buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride and lactated Ringer's. Suitable physiologically-acceptable adjuvants, if necessary to keep a polypeptide complex in suspension, may be chosen from thickeners such as carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin and alginates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers and electrolyte replenishers, such as those based on Ringer's dextrose. Preservatives and other additives, such as antimicrobials, antioxidants, chelating agents and inert gases, may also be present (Mack (1982) \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n16th Edition). A variety of suitable formulations can be used, including extended release formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand of the present invention may be used as separately administered compositions or in conjunction with other agents. The ligands can be used in combination therapy with existing IL-13 therapeutics (e.g., existing IL-13 agents (for example, anti-IL-13Rα1, IL-4/13 Trap, anti-IL-13) plus IL-4 dAb, and existing IL-4 agents (for example, anti-IL-4R, IL-4 Mutein, IL-4/13 Trap) plus IL-13 dAb) and IL-13 and IL-4 antibodies (for example, WO05/0076990 (CAT), WO03/092610 (Regeneron), WO00/64944 (Genetic Inst.) and WO2005/062967 (Tanox)). The ligands can be administered and or formulated together with one or more additional therapeutic or active agents. When a ligand is administered with an additional therapeutic agent, the ligand can be administered before, simultaneously with or subsequent to administration of the additional agent. Generally, the ligand and additional agent are administered in a manner that provides an overlap of therapeutic effect. Additional agents that can be administered or formulated with the ligand of the invention include, for example, various immunotherapeutic drugs, such as cylcosporine, methotrexate, adriamycin or cisplatinum, antibiotics, antimycotics, anti-viral agents and immunotoxins. For example, when the antagonist is administered to prevent, suppress or treat lung inflammation or a respiratory disease (e.g., asthma), it can be administered in conjunction with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4), bronchodilators (e.g., beta2-agonists, anticholinergerics, theophylline), short-acting beta-agonists (e.g., albuterol, salbutamol, bambuterol, fenoterol, isoetherine, isoproterenol, levalbuterol, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, terbutaline and tornlate), long-acting beta-agonists (e.g., formoterol and salmeterol), short acting anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium bromide and oxitropium bromide), long-acting anticholinergics (e.g., tiotropium), theophylline (e.g. short acting formulation, long acting formulation), inhaled steroids (e.g., beclomethasone, beclometasone, budesonide, flunisolide, fluticasone propionate and triamcinolone), oral steroids (e.g., methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisolon and prednisone), combined short-acting beta-agonists with anticholinergics albuterol/salbutamol/ipratopium, and fenoterol/ipratopium), combined long-acting beta-agonists with inhaled steroids (e.g., salmeterol/fluticasone, and formoterol/budesonide) and mucolytic agents (e.g., erdosteine, acetylcysteine, bromheksin, carbocysteine, guiafenesin and iodinated glycerol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable co-therapeutic agents that can be administered with a ligand of the invention to prevent, suppress or treat asthma (e.g., allergic asthma), include a corticosteroid (e.g., beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone), cromoglycate, nedocromil, beta-agonist (e.g., salbutamol, terbutaline, bambuterol, fenoterol, reproterol, tolubuterol, salmeterol, fomtero), zafirlukast, salmeterol, prednisone, prednisolone, theophylline, zileutron, montelukast, and leukotriene modifiers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of the invention can be coadministered with a variety of co-therapeutic agents suitable for treating diseases (e.g., a Th-2 mediated disease, IL-4-mediated disease, IL-13-mediated disease, IL-4 and IL-13-mediated disease, cancer), including cytokines, analgesics/antipyretics, antiemetics, and chemotherapeutics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCytokines include, without limitation, a lymphokine, tumor necrosis factors, tumor necrosis factor-like cytokine, lymphotoxin, interferon, macrophage inflammatory protein, granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor, interleukin (including, without limitation, interleukin-1, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-12, interleukin-15, interleukin-18), growth factors, which include, without limitation, (e.g., growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF), platelet derived growth factor (PGDF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and agents for erythropoiesis stimulation, e.g., recombinant human erythropoietin (Epoetin alfa), EPO, a hormonal agonist, hormonal antagonists (e.g., flutamide, tamoxifen, leuprolide acetate (LUPRON)), and steroids (e.g., dexamethasone, retinoid, betamethasone, cortisol, cortisone, prednisone, dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, estrogen, testosterone, progestin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalgesics/antipyretics can include, without limitation, (e.g., aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, buprenorphine hydrochloride, propoxyphene hydrochloride, propoxyphene napsylate, meperidine hydrochloride, hydromorphone hydrochloride, morphine sulfate, oxycodone hydrochloride, codeine phosphate, dihydrocodeine bitartrate, pentazocine hydrochloride, hydrocodone bitartrate, levorphanol tartrate, diflunisal, trolamine salicylate, nalbuphine hydrochloride, mefenamic acid, butorphanol tartrate, choline salicylate, butalbital, phenyltoloxamine citrate, diphenhydramine citrate, methotrimeprazine, cinnamedrine hydrochloride, meprobamate, and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntiemetics can also be coadministered to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting, e.g., suitable antiemetics include meclizine hydrochloride, nabilone, prochlorperazine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine hydrochloride, thiethylperazine, scopolamine, and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemotherapeutic agents, as that term is used herein, include, but are not limited to, for example antimicrotubule agents, (e.g., taxol (paclitaxel)), taxotere (docetaxel); alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, carmustine, lomustine, and chlorambucil); cytotoxic antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin, doxorubicin, mitomycin-C, and bleomycin; antimetabolites (e.g., cytarabine, gemcitatin, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil); antimiotics (e.g., vincristine vinca alkaloids (e.g., etoposide, vinblastine, and vincristine)); and others such as cisplatin, dacarbazine, procarbazine, and hydroxyurea; and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions can include “cocktails” of various cytotoxic or other agents in conjunction with ligands of the present invention, or even combinations of ligands according to the present invention having different specificities, such as ligands selected using different target antigens or epitopes, whether or not they are pooled prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe route of administration of pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be any suitable route, such as any of those commonly known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For therapy, including without limitation immunotherapy, the ligands of the invention can be administered to any patient in accordance with standard techniques. The administration can be by any appropriate mode, including parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, transdermally, intrathecally, intraarticularly, via the pulmonary route, or also, appropriately, by direct infusion (e.g., with a catheter). The dosage and frequency of administration will depend on the age, sex and condition of the patient, concurrent administration of other drugs, counterindications and other parameters to be taken into account by the clinician. Administration can be local (e.g., local delivery to the lung by pulmonary administration, (e.g., intranasal administration) or local injection directly into a tumor) or systemic as indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of this invention can be lyophilised for storage and reconstituted in a suitable carrier prior to use. This technique has been shown to be effective with conventional immunoglobulins and art-known lyophilisation and reconstitution techniques can be employed. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that lyophilisation and reconstitution can lead to varying degrees of antibody activity loss (e.g. with conventional immunoglobulins, IgM antibodies tend to have greater activity loss than IgG antibodies) and that use levels may have to be adjusted upward to compensate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions containing the ligands can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In certain therapeutic applications, an adequate amount to accomplish at least partial inhibition, suppression, modulation, killing, or some other measurable parameter, of a population of selected cells is defined as a “therapeutically-effective dose”. Amounts needed to achieve this dosage will depend upon the severity of the disease and the general state of the patient's health, but generally range from 0.005 to 5.0 mg of ligand per kilogram of body weight, with doses of 0.05 to 2.0 mg/kg/dose being more commonly used. For prophylactic applications, compositions containing the present ligands or cocktails thereof may also be administered in similar or slightly lower dosages, to prevent, inhibit or delay onset of disease (e.g., to sustain remission or quiescence, or to prevent acute phase). The skilled clinician will be able to determine the appropriate dosing interval to treat, suppress or prevent disease. When a ligand is administered to treat, suppress or prevent a disease, it can be administered up to four times per day, twice weekly, once weekly, once every two weeks, once a month, or once every two months, at a dose of for example, about 10 μg/kg to about 80 mg/kg, about 100 μg/kg to about 80 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 80 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 70 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 60 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 40 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, about 10 μg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, about 10 μg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, about 10 μg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg, about 3 mg/kg, about 4 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 6 mg/kg, about 7 mg/kg, about 8 mg/kg, about 9 mg/kg or about 10 mg/kg. In particular embodiments, the ligand is administered to treat, suppress or prevent a chronic allergic disease once every two weeks or once a month at a dose of about 10 μg/kg to about 10 mg/kg (e.g., about 10 μg/kg, about 100 μg/kg, about 1 mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg, about 3 mg/kg, about 4 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 6 mg/kg, about 7 mg/kg, about 8 mg/kg, about 9 mg/kg or about 10 mg/kg.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, the ligand is administered to treat, suppress or prevent asthma each day, every two days, once a week, once every two weeks or once a month at a dose of about 10 μg/kg to about 10 mg/kg (e.g., about 10 μg/kg, about 100 μg/kg, about 1 mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg, about 3 mg/kg, about 4 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 6 mg/kg, about 7 mg/kg, about 8 mg/kg, about 9 mg/kg or about 10 mg/kg). The ligand can also be administered at a daily dose or unit dose (e.g., to treat, suppress or prevent asthma) at a daily dose or unit dose of about 10 mg, about 9 mg, about 8 mg, about 7 mg, about 6 mg, about 5 mg, about 4 mg, about 3 mg, about 2 mg or about 1 mg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, the ligand of the invention is administered at a dose that provides saturation of IL-4 and/or IL-13 or a desired serum concentration in vivo. The skilled physician can determine appropriate dosing to achieve saturation, for example by titrating ligand and monitoring the amount of free binding sites on IL-4 and/or IL-13 or the serum concentration of ligand. Therapeutic regiments that involve administering a therapeutic agent to achieve target saturation or a desired serum concentration of agent are common in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment or therapy performed using the compositions described herein is considered “effective” if one or more symptoms are reduced (e.g., by at least 10% or at least one point on a clinical assessment scale), relative to such symptoms present before treatment, or relative to such symptoms in an individual (human or animal model) not treated with such composition or other suitable control. Symptoms will obviously vary depending upon the disease or disorder targeted, but can be measured by an ordinarily skilled clinician or technician. Such symptoms can be measured, for example, by monitoring the level of one or more biochemical indicators of the disease or disorder (e.g., levels of an enzyme or metabolite correlated with the disease, affected cell numbers, etc.), by monitoring physical manifestations (e.g., inflammation, tumor size, etc.), or by an accepted clinical assessment scale, for example; Juniper's Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (American Thoracic Society's 32 item assessment evaluates the quality of life with respect to activity limitations, symptoms, emotional function and exposure to environmental stimuli; Juniper, et. al., “Health-related Quality of Life in Moderate Asthma,” Chest, 116:1297-1303 (1999).), the Expanded Disability Status Scale (for multiple sclerosis), the Irvine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (32 point assessment evaluates quality of life with respect to bowel function, systemic symptoms, social function and emotional status—score ranges from 32 to 224, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life), the Quality of Life Rheumatoid Arthritis Scale, or other accepted clinical assessment scale as known in the field. A sustained (e.g., one day or more, preferably longer) reduction in disease or disorder symptoms by at least 10% or by one or more points on a given clinical scale is indicative of “effective” treatment. Similarly, prophylaxis performed using a composition as described herein is “effective” if the onset or severity of one or more symptoms is delayed, reduced or abolished relative to such symptoms in a similar individual (human or animal model) not treated with the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition containing ligands according to the present invention may be utilized in prophylactic and therapeutic settings to aid in the alteration, inactivation, killing or removal of a select target cell population in a mammal. In addition, the ligands and selected repertoires of polypeptides described herein may be used extracorporeally or in vitro selectively to kill, deplete or otherwise effectively remove a target cell population from a heterogeneous collection of cells. Blood from a mammal may be combined extracorporeally with the ligands, e.g. antibodies, cell-surface receptors or binding proteins thereof whereby the undesired cells are killed or otherwise removed from the blood for return to the mammal in accordance with standard techniques.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nGeneral Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nFor primary selections against human IL-13, libraries of VH dAbs and Vk dAbs were panned against biotinylated human IL-13 protein (R&D systems, Minneapolis, US). The IL-13 was biotinylated using a five fold molar excess of EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin reagent (Pierce, Rockford, USA). Round 1 was performed with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Norway) and either 100 nM or 20 nM antigen; round 2 with neutravidin-coated beads and either 20 nM or 4 nM antigen (Henderikx et al., 2002, Selection of antibodies against biotinylated antigens. Antibody Phage Display: Methods and protocols, Ed. O'Brien and Atkin, Humana Press).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the second primary selection, the same VH and Vk dAb phage display libraries were panned while maintaining the antigen concentration at 100 nM, in the final volume of 1 ml PBS, containing 2% Marvel. In the first and third rounds, 4 mg of M280 Streptavidin Dynabeads (Dynal, Norway) were used to capture antigen-phage complexes. In the second round, 4 mg of Neutravidin-coated M270 Carboxy Dynabeads (Dynal, Norway) were used instead.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nM270 Carboxy Dynabeads (Dynal, Norway) were coated with Neutravidin by standard cabodiimined chemistry as follows. 1 ml of Carboxy M-270 Dynabeads (30 mg/ml, 2×10\n6 \nbeads/μl) were washed twice with 1 ml 0.01M NaOH allowing four minutes capture between washes. Sodium hydroxide was removed by two washes with water, followed by activation of the carboxy groups with 1 ml of 40 mg/ml 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (Sigma, U.K) for 30 minutes at room temperature, with rotational mixing. EDC-activated beads were washed twice with water and 1 ml of 1 mg/ml Neutravidin (Pierce, U.S.A.) in 10 mM 2-Morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES, Sigma, U.K.) buffer pH5 was added to the activated beads. The coupling reaction was allowed to proceed with rotation for 30 minutes at room temperature. After coupling, the beads were captured, the unreacted Neutravidin was removed and the unreacted amine-reactive groups on the beads were quenched by incubation with 1 ml of 0.05 M tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) buffer pH7.4 for fifteen minutes at room temperature. The coated and quenched beads were washed four times in PBS containing 0.1% BSA, resuspended in 1 ml of the same. Sodium azide (Sigma, U.K.) was added to 0.02% for preservation and the beads were stored at 4 C until required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selection process for VH and Vk dAb phage libraries is described in

analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor primary selections against human IL-4, libraries of VII dAbs and libraries of Vk dAbs were panned against biotinylated human IL-4 protein (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, USA). The IL-4 was biotinylated as described above. Round 1 was performed with neutravidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Norway) and 100 nM antigen; round 2 with streptavidin-coated beads and 20 nM antigen. Neutravidin-coated beads were prepared by incubating tosylactivated Dyna beads (Dynal, Norway) in 5 mg/ml Immunopure neutravidin biotin-binding protein/0.1 M borate buffer pH9.5 for 16 hours at 37° C., followed by incubation in 0.1% (w/v) BSA/PBS for 5 minutes at 4° C., followed by incubation in 0.1% (w/v) BSA/0.2 M Tris pH 8.5 for 16 hours at 4° C. Elution at each stage was with 1 mg/ml trypsin-PBS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor affinity maturation selections, the above method was used but with the following modifications: two to four rounds of selection were performed using streptavidin-coated beads and decreasing concentrations of antigen (in the range of 1 nM to 50 pM), Phage vector from selection outputs (rounds 2 and 3) was isolated by plasmid prep (Qiagen) and dAb insert released by restriction digest with Sal I and Not I. This insert was ligated into Sal I/Not I cut pDOM5 and used to transform \nE. coli \nstrain HB2151 for soluble expression and screening of dAbs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \npDOM5 is a pUC119-based expression vector under control of the LacZ promoter. Expression of dAbs into the supernatant was ensured by fusion to the universal GAS leader signal peptide at the N-terminal end. In addition, a myc-tag was appended at the C-terminal end of the dAbs. After transformation of \nE. coli \nHB2151 cells, colonies were used to inoculate 50 to 500 mL of Terrific Broth medium supplemented with carbenicillin (100 μg per mL). Induction was performed with the OVERNIGHT EXPRESS™ SYSTEM 1 (high-level protein expression system, Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cultures were incubated at 30° C. for 24-48 hours with shaking at 250 rpm. After cell pelleting by centrifugation (4,000 rpm for 20 min), the supernatants were filtered using a 0.45 μm filter and incubated overnight at 4° C. with Streamline-protein A beads (Arnersham Biosciences, binding capacity: 5 mg of dAb per mL of beads) for the V\nH \ndAbs, or Protein L-sepharose beads (Affitech, binding capacity: 2 mg of dAb per mL of beads) for the V\nL\n, dAbs. The beads were then packed into drip columns, washed with 10 column volumes of PBS, and bound dAbs were eluted in 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.0 or 3.0 for the V\nH \nand V\nL\n, dAbs, respectively. After neutralisation with 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, the protein samples were dialyzed in PBS and concentrated on Vivaspin 5-kDa concentrators (Vivascience) before storage at 4° C. Protein purity was estimated by visual analysis after SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen). Protein concentrations and yields (in mg per L of bacterial culture) were measured at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients calculated from the amino acid compositions.\n\n\n \nAffinity Maturation Using Phage Libraries\n\n\n \n \n \nMaturation was performed using error prone mutagenesis, site-directed mutagenesis of multiple residues and single residue screening technologies. For error-prone maturation libraries, plasmid DNA encoding the dAb to be matured was amplified by PCR, using the GENEMORPH® II RANDOM MUTAGENESIS KIT (random, unique mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). The product was digested with Sal I and Not I and used in a ligation reaction with cut phage vector pDOM4. For the site-directed mutagenesis and single residue libraries, PCR reactions were performed using degenerate oligonucleotides containing NNK or NNS codons to diversify the required positions in the dAb to be affinity matured. Assembly PCR was then used to generate a full length diversified insert. The insert was digested with Sal I and Not I and used in a ligation reaction with pDOM4 for mutagenesis of multiple residues and pDOM5 for mutagenesis of single residues. The ligation produced by either method was then used to transform \nE. coli \nstrain TB1 by electroporation and the transformed cells plated on 2×TY agar containing 15 μg/ml tetracycline, yielding library sizes of >1×10\n7 \nclones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \npDOM4, is a derivative of the Fd phage vector in which the gene III signal peptide sequence is replaced with the yeast glycolipid anchored surface protein (GAS) signal peptide. It also contains a e-myc tag between the leader sequence and gene III, which puts the gene III back in frame. This leader sequence functions well both in phage display vectors but also in other prokaryotic expression vectors and can be universally used.\n\n\n \nAffinity Maturation Using Emulsification\n\n\nLibrary Construction.\n\n\n \n \n \nOne pg of template DNA of either DOM10-176 (SEQ ID NO:1285), DOM9-155 (SEQ ID NO:451), or DOM9-44 (SEQ ID NO:358) Vk dAb was PCR amplified using GENEMORPH II for 35 cycles with the primer set OA16 (ATACCATGGGGTCGACGGACATCCAG; SEQ ID NO:1797) and OA17n (TTCTTTIGCGGCCGCCCGTTTGATTTCCACC; SEQ ID NO:1798), followed by a restriction digest with SalI and NotI. The clean DOM10-176 (SEQ ID NO:1285), DOM9-155 (SEQ ID NO:451), and DOM9-44 (SEQ ID NO:358) fragments were ligated in either of the vectors pIE2aA or pIE7t3T using T4 DNA ligase in 20 μl volume. All vectors are derived from the pIVEX2.2b Nde vector from Roche. 0.5 μl aliquots of the ligation product were amplified in the presence of competitor DNA or real-time PCR on BioRad Mini-Opticon thermal cycler to establish that the number of ligation events exceeded 10\n9 \nper reaction. The libraries were PCR amplified from the ligation reaction using either SuperTaq and primers AS11 (TTCGCTATTACGCCAGCTGG; SEQ ID NO:1799) and AS17 (CAGTCAGGCACCGTGTATG; SEQ ID NO:1800)(scArc libraries) or Platinum pfx and primers AS12 (AAAGGGGGATGTGCTGCAAG; SEQ ID NO:1801) and AS18 (AACAATGCGCTCATCGTCATC; SEQ ID NO:1802) (Tus libraries). For targeted diversification libraries, oligonucleotides containing NNS codons at the indicated positions were used and the dAb was assembled by overlap PCR. The assembly reaction was PCR amplified with OA16/17n oligonucleotides using PfuUltra DNA polymerase and cloned SalI/NotI in the scArc or Tus in vitro translation (IVT) vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTen pg of template DNA of either DOM10-416 (SEQ ID NO:1834), DOM10-273 (SEQ ID NO:1818), DOM10-275 (SEQ ID NO:1871) or DOM10-276 (1872) VH dAb was PCR amplified using GenemorphII for 35 cycles with the primer set AS9 (SEQ ID NO:1916) and AS65 (SEQ ID NO:1917), followed by a restriction digest with SalI and NotI. The clean DOM10-416 (SEQ ID NO:1834), DOM10-273 (DOM10-273), DOM10-275 (SEQ ID NO:1871) or DOM10-276 (SEQ ID NO:1872) fragments were ligated into pIE2a\n2\nA vector (SEQ ID:2015), a derivative of pIE2aA with twoArc operators per gene and potentially tetravalent display capability, using T4 DNA ligase in 20 μl volume. 0.5 μl aliquots of the ligation product were amplified using real-time PCR on BioRad Mini-Opticon thermal cycler to establish that the number of ligation events exceeded 10\n9 \nper reaction.\n\n\n \n \nIn vitro Expression and Emulsification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following reaction mixture was used for in vitro transcription/translation of the library of PCR fragments: 1.5 μl 100 mM oxidized glutathione, 2 μl 5 mM Methionine, 0.5 μl DNA (5.0×10\n8 \nmolecules), 10 μl H\n2\nO, 0.25 μl of 50 mg/ml anti-HA mAb 3F10 (used only with scArc), biotinylated antigen at varying concentrations, and 35 μl of EcoPro T7 coupled transcription-translation extract. Immediately after mixing, the extract was added to 0.7 ml of light white mineral oil containing 4.5% (v/v) Span-80 and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Emulsification was carried out by spinning a magnetic stirrer for 5 min at 2000 rpm in a S ml glass vial. Microscopic analysis of droplet formation confirmed that droplets were ˜2 μm in diameter. The emulsion was incubated for 60 (Tus) to 180 (scArc) min at 25° C. to allow expression and formation of the protein-DNA complex to take place. Breaking of the emulsion was performed by adding 0.25 ml of PBS/1% BSA/biotinylated antigen and 0.5 ml hexane/20% (v/v) mineral oil, followed by brief vortexing and centrifugation for 1 min at 13,000 rpm. After removal of the oil phase, 1 ml of hexane/mineral oil was added and the procedure repeated three times. The last extraction was performed using only hexane.\n\n\n \nSelection and Amplification.\n\n\n \n \n \nSelection for binders was performed by incubating the extracted aqueous phase for 30 min in the presence 50-5 nM of biotinylated antigen (See below for exact conditions used per round). If off-rate selections were performed, this incubation was followed by addition of an excess of unbiotinylated antigen, or the parent VH dAb at 1 μM concentration, and incubation in the 5-100 min range. Each emulsion reaction was then divided over 5 wells of a streptavidin coated PCR plate (50 μl/well), incubated for 15 min at 25° C., and washed 4 times with PBS/BSA. Fifty μl of PCR mix containing either OA16/17n primers, PfuUltra buffer, dNTPs, 2.5 u PfuUltra DNA polymerase (Tus) or successive pairs of nested primers, dNTPs, KOD polymerase buffer and 2.5u KOD polymerase (scArc) was added to each well. PCR was performed for 25 (scArc) or 30 (Tus) cycles. For Tus selections, the PCR product was cleaned and digested with SalI/NotI. The fragment was then ligated in pIE7t\n3\nT vector and amplified as described in library construction. For scArc, the PCR product was gel purified and used directly for a next round of selection.\n\n\n \nPEGylation Using Aldehyde and NHS Activated PEGs\n\n\n \n \n \nUnder appropriate conditions, proteins can be specifically PEGylated via the N-terminus using PEG-aldehyde (PEG-ALD). This has the advantage in that the protein does not require any further engineering to introduce a specific amino acid for modification such as cysteine when using PEG-maleimide. Under non-optimized buffer conditions it is still possible for some of the protein to become modified via lysine residues when using PEG-ALD. An alternative method is to use NHS or SPA activated PEGs which react specifically with surface lysine residues.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nLigands that Bind IL-4\n\n\nIL-4 Receptor Binding Assay (RBA)\n\n\n \n \n \nA MAXISORP™ plate (high protein binding ELISA plate, Nunc, Denmark) was coated overnight with 0.5 μg/ml recombinant human IL-4R/Fc (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). The wells were washed three times with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS, followed by three washes with PBS, before blocking with 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS. The plates were washed again before the addition of 10 ng/ml biotinylated-IL-4 (R&D Systems) mixed with a dilution series of anti-IL-4 dAbs or IL-4. IL-4 binding was detected with peroxidase labelled anti-biotin antibody (Stratech, Soham, UK) and then developed with TBM substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, USA). The reaction was stopped by the addition of HCl and the absorbance read at 450 nm. Anti-IL-4 dAb activity caused a decrease in IL-4 binding to the receptor and therefore a decrease in absorbance compared with the IL-4 only control.\n\n\n \nIL-4 Cell Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nIsolated dAbs were tested for their ability to inhibit IL-4 induced proliferation in cultured TF-1 cells (ATCC® catalogue no. CRL-2003). Briefly, 40000 TF-1 cells in phenol red free RPMI media (Gibco, Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK) were placed in the well of a tissue culture microtitre plate and mixed with 1 ng/ml final concentration IL-4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) and a dilution of the dAb to be tested. The mixture was incubated for 72 hours at 37° C. 5% CO\n2\n. CELLTITER 96® reagent (colorometric reagent for determining viability, Promega, Madison, USA) was then added and the number of cells per well was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm. Anti-IL-4 dAb activity caused a decrease in cell proliferation and a corresponding lower A\n490 \nthan IL-4 alone.\n\n\n \n \nCompetition BIACOR® with Anti IL-4 dAbs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese experiments were performed on a BIACOR® 3000 instrument, using a streptavidin coated SA chip (surface plasmon resonance system, Biacore) coupled with ˜400 RU of biotinylated IL-4 (R&D Systems). Analytes were passed over the antigen-coated flow-cell, with in-line referencing against a blank flow-cell, at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in HBS-EP running buffer (Biacore). The first dAb was injected, followed immediately by injection of the second dAb using the Biacore's co-inject function. For this experiment dAbs DOM9-44 (SEQ ID NO:358), DOM9-155-1 (SEQ ID NO:452) and DOM9-112-22 (SEQ ID NO:47) were used. This competition protocol can generally be used to assess competition of a test antibody or fragment with a known dAb (or other antibody polypeptide) for binding to IL-4.\n\n\n \nAllergen Induced Cell Proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \nBlood was collected from donors allergic to house dust mite (HDM). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were then isolated using a Ficoll gradient. Cells were seeded at 4×10\n6\n/ml in a 96 well plate and stimulated with HDM at 20-50 ug/ml. Anti-IL-4 dAbs were added at 100 nM at the start of the culture (1.4 ug/ml). Cells were incubated for 5 days, with the addition of 3 [H] thymidine for the final 18 hours. Cells were then harvested and proliferation was assessed by determining the amount of 3H incorporated into the cellular DNA.\n\n\n \n \nPrimary Selection and Screening for Anti-IL-4 dAbs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary phage selections were performed using the VH and Vk dAb libraries and outputs sub-cloned into the soluble expression vector pDOM5. dAb clones that inhibit binding of IL-4 to IL-4R were identified by supernatant receptor binding assay (RBA). Clones were then expressed, purified by protein A or protein L and tested as a dose-response in the RBA to estimate the potency with which the clones inhibited the binding of IL-4 to IL-4R. Table 3 shows the results for anti-IL-4 dAbs DOM9-44 (SEQ ID NO:358), DOM9-112 (SEQ ID NO:25), and DOM9-155 (SEQ ID NO:451) in such an RBA assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIL-4 receptor binding assay\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndAb\n \nIC50 (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDOM9-44\n \n122\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM9-155\n \n100\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM9-112\n \n 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAffinity Maturation of Anti-IL-4 dAbs\n\n\n\n \nDOM9-44 Lineage\n\n\n \n \n \nThe DOM9-44 lineage was affinity matured using in vitro expression and emulsification.

The most potent dAb from this lineage was DOM9-44-502 (SEQ ID NO:361), which had a potency of 5.5 nM in the IL-4 RBA (Table 4) and 4.5 nM in the IL-4 cell assay (Table 5).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIL-4 receptor binding\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nassay\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndAb\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM9-155-25\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 1\n\n\n0.73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 2\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\naverage\n\n\n0.86\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM9-44-502\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 1\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 2\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 3\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 4\n\n\n8.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\naverage\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM9-112-168\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 1\n\n\n1.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 2\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\naverage\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM9-112-210\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt n = 8\n\n\n144 pM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIL-4 Induced TF-1 Cell\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProliferation\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndAb\n\n\nND50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM9-155-25\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 1\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 2\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\naverage\n\n\n0.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM9-44-502\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 1\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM9-112-210\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt n = 8\n\n\n270 pM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDOM9-155 Lineage\n\n\n \n \n \nThe DOM9-155 lineage was affinity matured using in vitro expression and emulsification. The DOM9-155 dAb (SEQ ID NO:451) was PCR amplified under error-prone conditions and ligated into the Tus vector, followed by a second PCR to amplify the IVT cassette. The libraries were then subjected to sequential rounds of selection against biotinylated IL-4. Ten rounds of selection were performed followed by cloning into the expression vector and overnight supernatant expression. Improved clones were identified by screening on the Biacore and were subsequently used as a template for libraries diversifying residues of the CDR1 by NNS mutagenesis. Output clones were expressed, purified and tested in the IL-4 receptor binding assay and the IL-4 cell assay. The most potent dAbs from the DOM9-155 lineage identified using these methods was DOM9-155-25 (SEQ ID NO:466) with an IC50 of 0.86 nM in the RBA (Table 4) and 0.83 nM in the cell assay (Table 5). Further screening of this output identified two additional dAbs with sub nanomolar potencies: DOM9-155-77 (SEQ ID NO: 2393) and DOM9-155-78 (SEQ ID NO: 2394).\n\n\n \nDOM9-112 Lineage\n\n\n \n \n \nThe DOM9-112 lineage was affinity matured by phage display using an error-prone maturation library, libraries diversifying multiple residues of CDR 1 and 2 libraries diversifying individual residues of the CDR1 and 2. The resulting phage libraries were used in selections against biotinylated IL-4. Outputs were cloned into vector pDOM5 and expression supernatants were screened for improved off-rates compared to the parent. dAbs with improved off-rates were expressed, purified and tested in the IL-4 receptor binding assay (RBA) and cell assay. The most potent dAbs identified using these methods were DOM9-112-155 (SEQ ID NO:118), DOM9-112-168 (SEQ ID NO:131), DOM9-112-174 (SEQ ID NO:137), DOM9-112-199 (SEQ ID NO:162), DOM9-112-200 (SEQ ID NO:163), DOM9-112-202 (SEQ ID NO:165) and DOM9-112-210 (SEQ ID NO:2401) with IC50 values in the range of 0.9 to 3 nM, as measured in the IL-4 RBA (Table 4).\n\n\n \n \nEpitope Mapping of Anti IL-4 dAbs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine the epitope specificity of the anti-IL-4 dAbs, BIACOR® (surface plasmon resonance, Biacore) competition experiments were performed. DOM9-44 (SEQ ID NO:358) dAb was injected over an IL-4 coupled chip, followed by injection of DOM9-155-1 (SEQ ID NO:452) dAb which could not bind to IL-4 after DOM9-44 (SEQ ID NO:358) was bound (\nFIG. 13\n). Similarly, DOM9-44 (SEQ ID NO:358) could not bind after DOM9-155-1 (SEQ ID NO:452) was bound. However dAb DOM9-112-22 (SEQ ID NO:47) could bind IL-4 after dAb DOM9-44 (SEQ ID NO:358) was bound and also after dAb 9-155-1 (SEQ ID NO:452) was bound. The results indicated that dAbs DOM9-44 (SEQ ID NO:358) and DOM9-155-1 (SEQ ID NO:452) bound to the same epitope and that DOM9-112-22 (SEQ ID NO:47) bound to a different epitope from DOM9-44 (SEQ ID NO:358) and DOM9-155-1 (SEQ ID NO:452). This competition protocol can generally be used to assess competition (and epitope mapping) of a test antibody or fragment with a known dAb (or other antibody polypeptide) for binding to IL-4.\n\n\n \nAllergen Induced Cell Proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \nPBMC from all allergic donors showed a dose-dependent proliferation when incubated with HDM (house dust mite). The addition of anti-IL-4 dAbs resulted in an inhibition of allergen induced proliferation in the majority of donors. dAb DOM9-44-502 (SEQ ID NO:361) inhibited proliferation of PBMC from 10 out of 12 donors (\nFIG. 14A\n), DOM9-155-11 (SEQ ID NO:457) inhibited proliferation of PBMC from 10 out of 12 donors (\nFIG. 14B\n) and DOM9-112-22 (SEQ ID NO:47) inhibited proliferation of PBMC from 2 out of 2 donors. The average inhibition in all responding donors was 38%, 34% and 23% inhibition for dAb DOM9-44-502 (SEQ ID NO:361), DOM9-155-11 (SEQ ID NO:457) and DOM9-112-22 (SEQ ID NO:47), respectively. The reason that maximal responses of only 30-40% are observed is most likely because this allergen induced response is not only dependent on IL-4, but is also dependent on other interleukins such as IL-2.\n\n\n \nIL-4 Induced B Cell Proliferation\n\n\n \n \n \nBlood was collected from normal blood donors. PBMC were isolated using Ficoll gradient. B cells were then isolated using a negative B cell isolation kit (EasySep Negative isolation kit, Stem Cell Technologies Inc). Purity was in excess of 98% as determined by flow cytometry and staining with CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD14, CD19 and CD23. B cells were then plated at 1×10\n5 \ncells/well in the presence of IL-4 (10 ng/ml) in plates coated with irradiated CD40 L\n+\nL cells. Cultures were incubated for 5 days with the addition of 3[H]thymidine for the final 18 hours. Anti-IL-4 dAbs were added at the start of the culture at 10 nM or 100 nM.\n\n\n \n \nCross-Reactivity with Rhesus and Cynomolgous IL-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA desired requirement of these dAbs would be cross-reactivity with rhesus and cynomolgous IL-4. To that end, DOM9-112-210 (SEQ ID NO:2401), DOM9-155-5 (SEQ ID NO:454), DOM9-155-25 (SEQ ID NO:466), DOM9-155-77 (SEQ ID NO:2393) and DOM9-155-78 (SEQ ID NO:2394) were tested in the TF-1 cell proliferation assay (see above for description in more detail) in which cells are stimulated with human IL-4 (0.5 ng/ml, Peprotech), rhesus IL-4 (0.5 ng/ml, R&D systems) or cynomolgous IL-4 (1:25000 dilution of supernatant containing in-house expressed cynomolgous IL-4). A dose-response of the dAb will determine the ND50 in this set up. A summary of the values obtained is given in the table below (Table 6) and demonstrates cross-reactivity.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHuman IL-4\n\n\nRhesus IL-4\n\n\nCyno IL-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndAb\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM9-155-5\n\n\n0.3-0.5\n\n\n1.8-2.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM9-155-77\n\n\n1.1-1.7\n\n\n3.6-5.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM9-155-78\n\n\n0.5-0.7\n\n\n1.3-2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM9-155-25\n\n\n0.75-1.1 \n\n\n2.7-4.1\n\n\n2.6-3.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM9-112-210\n\n\n0.27\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nLigands that Bind IL-13\n\n\nIL-13 Sandwich ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nA MAXISORP™ plate (high protein binding ELISA plate, Nunc, Denmark) was coated overnight with 2.5 μg/ml coating antibody (Module Set, Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria), then washed once with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS before blocking with 0.5% (w/v) BSA 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS. The plates were washed again before the addition of 25 pg/ml IL-13 (Bender MedSystems) mixed with a dilution series of DOM10 dAb (i.e., an anti-IL-13 dAb) or IL-13. The plates were washed again before binding of IL-13 to the capture antibody was detected using biotin conjugated detection antibody (Module Set, Bender Medsystems), followed by peroxidase labelled Streptavidin (Module Set, Bender MedSystems). The plate was then incubated with TMB substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, USA), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of HCl and the absorbance read at 450 nm. Anti-IL-13 dAb activity caused a decrease in IL-13 binding and therefore a decrease in absorbance compared with the IL-13 only control.\n\n\n \nIL-13 Receptor Binding Assay (RBA) Using the 8200 Cellular Detection System\n\n\n \n \n \nSPHERO™ goat anti-human IgG (H&L) polystyrene particles (0.5% w/v) (goat-anti-human particles, Spherotech, Libertyville, USA) were coated overnight with 20 μg IL-13R alpha 1/Fc chimera or IL-13R alpha 2/Fc chimera (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). The following reagents were then combined in a 384-well black sided clear bottomed FMAT plate (Applied. Biosystems, Foster City, USA): dilution series of DOM-10 dAb or 0.1% (w/v) BSA in PBS; 0.5 μg/ml biotinylated anti-IL-13 antibody (R&D Systems); 0.25 μg/ml STREPTAVIDIN ALEXA FLUOR® 647 conjugate (fluorescent probe, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK); 10 ng/ml recombinant human IL-13 (R&D Systems); and 1:10 dilution of IL-13R2/Fc coated particles. The plate was incubated for seven hours before being read in the 8200 cellular detection system (Applied Biosystems). Binding of IL-13 to the receptor coated particle causes a complex to form which is detected as a fluorescent event by the 8200. Anti-IL-13 dAb activity causes a decrease in IL-13 binding and thus a decrease in fluorescent events compared with the IL-13 only control.\n\n\n \nIL-13 Cell Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nIsolated dAbs were tested for their ability to inhibit IL-13 induced proliferation in cultured TF-1 cells (ATCC® catalogue no. CRL-2003). Briefly, 40000 TF-1 cells in phenol red free RPMI media (Gibco, Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK) were placed in the well of a tissue culture microtitre plate and mixed with 5 ng/ml final concentration IL-13 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) and a dilution of the dAb to be tested. The mixture was incubated for 72 hours at 37° C. 5% CO\n2\n. CELLTITER. 96® reagent (colorometric reagent for determining viability, Promega, Madison, USA) was then added and the number of cells per well was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm. Anti-IL-13 dAb activity caused a decrease in cell proliferation and a corresponding lower A\n490 \nthan IL-13 alone.\n\n\n \nBIACOR™ Off-Rate Screening\n\n\n \n \n \nA streptavidin coated SA chip (Biacore) was coated with approximately 500 RU of biotinylated IL-13 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). Supernatant containing soluble dAb was diluted 1:5 in running buffer. 50 to 100 ul of the diluted supernatant was injected (kininject) at 50 ul/min flow rate, followed by a 5 minute dissociation phase. Clones with improved off-rates compared to parent were identified by eye, or by measurement using BIAevaluation software v4.1 (Biacore).\n\n\n \n \nCompetition BIACOR® With Anti IL-13 dAbs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese experiments were performed on a BIACOR® 3000 instrument (surface plasmon resonance instrument, Biacore), using a streptavidin coated SA chip (Biacore) coupled with ˜400 RU of biotinylated IL-13 (R&D Systems). Analytes were passed over the antigen-coated flow-cell, with in-line referencing against a blank flow-cell, at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in HBS-EP running buffer (Biacore). The first dAb DOM10-176-535 (SEQ ID NO:1362) was injected, followed immediately by injection of dAb DOM10-53-99 (SEQ ID NO:738), using the Biacore's co-inject function. This competition protocol can generally be used to assess competition of a test antibody or fragment with a known dAb (or other antibody polypeptide) for binding to IL-13.\n\n\n \nCompetition and Epitope Mapping\n\n\n \n \n \nEpitope Mapping of Anti IL-13 dAbs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine the epitope specificity of the anti-IL-13 dAbs, Biacore competition experiments were performed. dAb DOM10-176-535 (SEQ ID NO:1362) was injected, followed immediately by injection of dAb DOM10-53-99 (SEQ ID NO:738). dAb DOM10-53-99 (SEQ ID NO:738) did not bind to IL-13 to which dAb DOM10-176-535 (SEQ ID NO:1362) has already bound. This indicates that these dAbs bound to the same epitope. This competition protocol can generally be used to assess competition (and epitope mapping) of a test antibody or fragment with a known dAb (or other antibody polypeptide) for binding to IL-13. The epitopes for a second set of dAbs was determined using a slightly modified BIAcore protocol in which first dAbs were injected over an IL-13 surface, then a high affinity binding dAb (DOM10-53-386 (SEQ ID NO:934)) was injected at high concentration (5 μM) saturating the IL-13 surface and finally the dAbs were again injected. If there is a difference between binding prior and post saturation with DOM10-53-386 (SEQ ID NO:934), the epitopes are at least partially overlapping. Using this experimental setup, it was determined that the Vk dAbs DOM10-212 (SEQ ID NO:2016), DOM10-270 (SEQ ID NO:1915), DOM10-213 (SEQ ID NO:1904) and DOM10-215 (SEQ ID NO:1906) share the same epitope as DOM10-53-386 (SEQ ID NO:934), whereas DOM10-208 (SEQ ID NO:1886): and DOM10-224 (SEQ ID NO:1911) have a different epitope. The same BIAcore setup was used for the injection of the Vh dAbs DOM10-416 (SEQ ID NO:1834), DOM10-236 (SEQ ID NO:1804), DOM10-273 (SEQ ID NO:1818), DOM10-275 (SEQ ID NO:1871), DOM10-276 (SEQ ID NO:1872) and DOM10-277 (SEQ ID NO:1873). All these dAbs were shown to have at least partially overlapping epitopes with DOM10-53-386 (SEQ ID NO:934). This demonstrates that less dAb binds once DOM10-53-386 (SEQ ID NO:934) has been injected.\n\n\n \nIL-13 Induced B Cell Proliferation\n\n\n \n \n \nBlood was collected from normal blood donors. PBMC were isolated using Ficoll gradient. B cells were then isolated using a negative B cell isolation kit (EasySep Negative isolation kit, Stem Cell Technologies Inc). Purity was in excess of 98% as determined by flowcytometry and staining with CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19 and CD23. B cells were then plated at 1×10\n5 \ncells/well in the presence of IL-13 (10 ng/ml) in plates coated with irradiated CD40 L\n+\nL cells. Cultures were incubated for 5 days with the addition of 3 [H]thymidine for the final 18 hours. Anti-IL-13 dAbs were added at the start of the culture at 10 or 100 nM.\n\n\n \nFormatting:\n\n\nSite Specific PEGylation of DOM10-53-343 Using PEG-Maleimide\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-IL13 dAb DOM10-53-343 (SEQ ID NO:891) was engineered with a cysteine at the C-terminus of the protein. Expression and purification of the dAbs was performed as described above. The cysteine engineered dAb was specifically modified with a branched 40K PEG2-MAL to give monomeric modified protein. Other PEG formats are available such as linear PEG-MAL which may also be used to give PEGylated monomers, e.g. 30K or 40K linear PEG.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nmPEG-MAL formats may be used to PEGylate a monomeric dAb. The PEGs may be of MW from 500 to 60,000 (e.g., from 2,000 to 40,000) in size and either linear or branched in nature\n\n\n1 ml of 160 μM DOM10-53-343cys was reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol and left at room temperature for 20 minutes. The sample was then buffer exchanged using a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia), to remove the reducing agent. The column had been pre-equilibrated with 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM BIS-TRIS pH 6.5, 10% glycerol, and the sample applied and eluted following the manufacturer's guidelines. The sample (3.5 ml of ˜50 μM dAb) was then mixed directly with a three fold molar excess of 40K PEG-MAL (˜20 mg). The reaction was left to proceed at room temperature for 3 hours.\n\n\n\n \nPurification of PEGylated DOM10-53-343 cys Monomer by Anion Exchange\n\n\n \n \n \nThe sample was further purified using anion exchange chromatography (1 ml Resource Q column), to remove any unreacted PEG and protein. The sample was diluted 3-fold into equilibration buffer (50 mM TRIS pH 8.0), before being applied on to the column which had also been equilibrated in the same buffer. The PEGylated material was separated from the unmodified dAb by running a linear sodium chloride gradient from 0 to 500 mM, in 50 nM TRIS buffer over 20 column volumes. Fractions containing PEGylated dAb only were identified using SDS-PAGE and then pooled.\n\n\n \nN-terminal PEGylation Using 30K PEG-ALD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-IL13 dAb DOM10-53-338 (SEQ ID NO:886) was PEGylated via the N-terminus (α-amino group) using a 30K PEG-ALD. The dAb was buffer exchanged into 20 mM phosphate buffer pH6.0 to give a final protein concentration of 2 mg/ml (˜166 μM). A 5-fold molar excess of PEG-ALD (830 μM polymer) was added directly to the dAb solution followed by the addition of 2 mM sodium cyanoborohydride to reduce the transient imine linkage to an amine which is stable to hydrolysis. The reaction was then allowed to proceed overnight at room temperature. The sample was further purified using anion exchange chromatography as described above.\n\n\n \nPEGylation of Surface Lysine Residues Using 40K PEG2-NHS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-IL13 dAb DOM10-53-338 (SEQ ID NO:886) was PEGylated via surface lysine residues using 40K PEG2-NHS. The dAb was buffer exchanged into 20 mM phosphate buffer pH8.0 to give a final protein concentration of 2 mg/ml (˜166 μM). A 5-fold molar excess of PEG-NHS (830 μM polymer) was added directly to the dAb solution and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature overnight. The sample was further purified using anion exchange chromatography as described above.\n\n\n \n \nPrimary Selection and Screening for Anti-IL-13 dAbs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary phage selections were performed using VH and Vk dAb libraries and outputs sub-cloned into soluble expression vector pDOM5. dAb clones that inhibit binding of IL-13 to IL-13RI were identified by supernatant RBA. Clones were then expressed, purified by protein A or protein L and tested as a dose-response in the RBA to determine the potency with which the clones inhibited the binding of IL-13 to IL-13RI. Table 7 shows the results for anti-IL-13 dAbs DOM10-53 (SEQ ID NO:651) and DOM10-176 (SEQ ID NO:1285) in such an RBA assay, where their IC\n50 \nvalues are 150 and 100 nM, respectively, while the rest have 1050 values in micromolar range.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIL-13 receptor I binding assay\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndAb\n \nIC50 (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-53\n \n150\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-176\n \n100\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-416\n \n6000\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-273\n \n600\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-275\n \n1000\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-276\n \n3000\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAffinity Maturation of Anti-IL-13 dAbs\n\n\n\n \nDOM10-176 Lineage\n\n\n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid encoding dAb DOM10-176-535 (SEQ ID NO:1.362) was PCR amplified under error-prone conditions and ligated in the scArc vector, followed by a second PCR to amplify the IVT cassette.

The output clones were expressed as supernatants and screened for improved off-rates compared to the parent. dAbs with improved off-rates were expressed, purified and tested in the IL-13 sandwich ELISA and cell assay. The mutations from the best dAbs identified from both of these selections were combined, creating DOM10-176-535 (SEQ ID NO:1362). This was the most potent dAb of the DOM10-176 lineage, with an IC50 value in the RBA in the range of 0.5 nM and a value of 0.77 nM in the IL-13 cell assay (Tables 8 and 9).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-13 assays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-13 receptor I binding assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM10-176-535\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 1\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 2\n\n\n0.76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 3\n\n\n0.63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 4\n\n\n0.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\naverage\n\n\n0.59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-13 sandwich ELISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC50 (pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM10-53-234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 1\n\n\n87\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 2\n\n\n81\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 3\n\n\n87\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 4\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\naverage\n\n\n73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM10-53-396\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 1\n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpt. 2\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\naverage\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-13 Induced TF-1 Cell Proliferation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nND50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM10-176-535\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM10-53 lineage\n\n\nND50 (pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10-53-234\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10-53-344\n\n\n100 (n = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDOM10-53 Lineage\n\n\n \n \n \nThe DOM10-53 lineage was affinity matured by phage display using an error-prone maturation library, libraries diversifying multiple residues of \n \n \nCDR\n \n \n 1, 2 and 3 and libraries diversifying individual residues of the CDR1, 2 and 3. The resulting phage libraries were used in selections against biotinylated IL-13. Outputs were cloned into vector pDOM5 and expression supernatants were screened for improved off-rates compared to the parent. dAbs with improved off-rates were expressed, purified and tested in the IL-13 sandwich ELISA and cell assay. The most potent dAbs identified using these methods were DOM10-53-223 (SEQ ID NO:774), DOM10-53-234 (SEQ ID NO:785), DOM10-53-316 (SEQ ID NO:866), DOM10-53-339 (SEQ ID NO:887), DOM10-53-344 (SEQ ID NO:892) and DOM10-53-396 (SEQ ID NO:944), with potency values as estimated in the IL-13 sandwich ELISA and IL-13 cell assay in the range of 100 pM to 40 pM (Table 8 and 9).\n\n\n \nInhibition of IL-13 Binding to IL-13Rα2\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-IL-13 dAbs were tested for their ability to inhibit binding of IL-13 to IL13Rα2 in a competition assay.

Therefore it was determined whether the anti-IL-13 dAbs are able bind variant IL-13 (R130Q), the TF-1 proliferation assay was performed with variant IL-13 (R130Q), and increasing amounts of dAb. Table 11 shows that both DOM10-53-316 (SEQ ID NO:866) and DOM10-176-535 (SEQ ID NO:1362) were able to inhibit variant IL-13 induced TF-1 proliferation with ND50 values of approximately 0.5 nM and 8 nM respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 11\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVariant and human IL-13\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIC50 (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-53-316\n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \nHuman IL-13\n \n0.39\n \n \n \n \n \nVariant IL-13\n \n0.52\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-176-535\n \n \n \n \n \nHuman IL-13\n \n6\n \n \n \n \n \nVariant IL-13\n \n7.8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCross-Reactivity with Rhesus and Cynomolgous IL-13.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA desired requirement of these dAbs would be cross-reactivity with rhesus and cynomolgous IL-13.

Complete inhibition of the B cell proliferation was also observed with 3 μg/ml of positive control anti-IL 13 mAb (R&D). Control dAbs that did not bind IL-13 failed to inhibit this B cell proliferation.\n\n\n \nPEGylated Monomer\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-IL13 dAb DOM10-53-338 (SEQ ID NO:886) was PEGylated via the N-terminus using a 30K aldehyde PEG moiety or via surface lysines using the 40K PEG2-activated moiety. The anti-IL13 dAbs DOM10-53-343 (SEQ ID NO:891) was also cloned with a cysteine at the C-terminus of the protein. This molecule was PEGylated via the C terminus using PEG-Maleimide with a branched 40K PEG2-MAL moiety. To determine the effect of PEGylation the PEGylated DOM10-53-338 dAbs were tested for their ability to inhibit IL-13 binding in the IL-13 receptor binding assay and to inhibit IL-13 induced TF-1 cell proliferation. The potency of both the 30K PEGylated DOM10-53-338 dAb and the 40K PEGylated DOM10-53-338 dAb was maintained in the IL-13 receptor binding assay (Table 15) and in the IL-13 induced TF-1 cell proliferation assay (Table 15). To determine the effect of C-terminal PEGylation, the PEGylated (40K PEG2-MAL) DOM10-53-343 dAbs were tested for their ability to inhibit IL-13 binding in the IL-13 receptor binding assay (Table 15). The potency of the C-terminal PEGylated DOM10-53-343 dAb was slightly improved compared to the native DOM10-53-343 dAb in the IL-13 receptor binding assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 15\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPEGylated anti IL-13 dAbs\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIC50 (pM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIL-13 receptor I binding assay\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-53-338\n \n387\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-53-338 \n30K PEG ALD\n \n \n169\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-53-338 \n40K PEG2 NHS\n \n \n226\n \n \n \n \n \nIL-13 induced TF-1 proliferation\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-53-338\n \n423\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-53-338 \n30K PEG ALD\n \n \n181\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-53-338 \n40K PEG2 NHS\n \n \n231\n \n \n \n \n \nIL-13 receptor I binding assay\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-53-343\n \n136\n \n \n \n \n \nDOM10-53-343 40K PEG2 MAL\n \n33\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nBiophysical Properties of Anti-IL-13 dAbs\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to develop a product for pulmonary delivery it is desired that the molecule has good biophysical properties. Poor chemical stability and physical stability may reduce the biological activity. Pulmonary delivered proteins may be exposed to additional stress e.g shearing forces and increased temperatures in the nebulising device. The lungs can metabolise some of the delivered dose and in some disease indications high levels of proteases can be present that can affect the biological activity. To this end we investigated the solution state by Multi. Angle Light Scattering (MALS) and the melting temperature as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the DOM10-53 lineage molecules.\n\n\n \nSEC MALLS (Multi Angle LASER Light Scattering)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe in-solution properties of dAb proteins were determined by an initial separation on SEC (size exclusion chromatography; TSKgel G2000/3000SWXL, Tosoh Biosciences, Germany; BioSep-SEC-S2000/3000, Phenomenex, CA, USA) and subsequent on-line detection of eluting proteinaceous material by UV (Abs280 nm), RI (refractive index) and light scattering (laser at 685 nm). The proteins were at an initial concentration of 0.5-1 mg/mL, as determined by absorbance at 280 nm, and visually inspected for impurities by SDS-PAGE. The homogeneity of samples to be injected was usually >90%. 100 uL were injected onto the SEC column. The protein separation on SEC was performed at 0.5 mL/min for 45 minutes. PBS (phosphate buffered saline ±10% EtOH) was used as mobile phase. The ASTRA software (Wyatt Inc; CA; USA) integrated the signals of all three detectors and allowed for the determination of the molar masses in kDa of proteins from ‘first physical principles’. Self-association of proteins could reliably be determined as shown by orthogonal methods (i.e. AUC) for some characteristic dAbs. Inter-run variations and data quality was assessed by running a positive control of known in-solution state with every sample batch. For some DOM10-53 clones no reliable solution state could be assigned because the molecules bound aspecifically to the column matrix or could not be resolved using the size exclusion column. For those cases when the solution state was reliable (i.e. DOM10-53 (SEQ ID NO: 651), DOM10-53-531 (SEQ ID NO:2097), and DOM10-53-612 (SEQ ID NO:2044)) it was shown that the DOM10-53 (SEQ ID NO:651) molecule is mostly a monomer in solution.\n\n\n \nDSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry)\n\n\n \n \n \nProteins were dialysed overnight into PBS buffer (phosphate buffered saline), diluted and filtered to yield a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in PBS, as determined by absorbance at 280 nm. PBS buffer was used as a reference for all samples. DSC was performed using capillary cell microcalorimeter VP-DSC (Microcal, MA, USA), at a heating rate of 180° C./hour. A typical scan usually was from 25-90° C. for both the reference buffer and the protein sample. After each reference buffer and sample pair, the capillary cell was cleaned with a solution of 1% Decon in water followed by PBS. Resulting data traces were analysed using \nOrigin\n 7 Microcal software. The DSC trace obtained from the reference buffer was subtracted from the sample trace. The precise molar concentration of the sample was entered into the data analysis routine to yield values for appTm, enthalpy (ΔH) and van't Hoff enthalpy (ΔHv) values. Data usually were fitted to a non-2-state model. The DSC experiments showed that some DOM10-53 molecules (e.g. 10-53-472 (SEQ ID NO:2103) and 10-53-474 (SEQ ID NO:2105)) have higher melting temperatures compared to others (e.g. 10-53-344 and 10-53-434), whilst they maintain their potency. Such properties are indicative of increased stability and are useful for pulmonary delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 16\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPotency\n \n \n \nMolecule\n \nTm (° C.)\n \nMw\n \nSEC MALLS\n \nIC50 (pM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10-53-344\n \n52.6/54.2\n \n—\n \nn.d.\n \n100\n \n \n \n10-53-434\n \n53.4\n \n17 kDa/27 kDa\n \nMonomer/\ndimer\n \n \n290\n \n \n \n10-53-531\n \n62.7\n \n15.5 \nkDa\n \n \nMonomer\n \n \n \n340\n \n \n \n10-53\n \n62.7\n \n \n \n \nMonomer\n \n \n100 nM\n \n \n \n10-53-612\n \n63.6\n \n \n \n \nMonomer\n \n \n 20 nM\n \n \n \n10-53-472\n \n57.4\n \n \n \nn.d.\n \n 54\n \n \n \n10-53-474\n \n57.5\n \n \n \nn.d.\n \nn.d.\n \n \n \n10-53-475\n \n55.3\n \n \n \nn.d.\n \n 46\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDetermination of the Pharmacokinetics of an Anti-IL-13 dAb delivered via the Pulmonary Route of Administration.\n\n\n\n \nTest Substance\n\n\n \n \n \nDOM10-53-613 (SEQ ID NO: 2022) binds human IL-13, but not murine IL-13. DOM10-53-613 (at 1.2 mg/ml) with an HA tag for detection was diluted in 20 mM sodium citrate pH6.0, 100 mM NaCl. It was warmed from its storage temperature to 37° C. prior to administration. DOM10-53-613 (at 1.2 mg/ml) was administered to 8 week old male BALB/c mice. Animals were lightly anaesthetised and 50 μl of the relevant dAb solution or vehicle dropped gently onto the nares. The animals were held in an upright position for a few seconds while spontaneously breathing in the solution before being allowed to recover and returned to their home cage. Thereafter mice were killed at the following time points at 10 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours and 16 hours. Serum, lung gavage and lung homogenate were collected from each mouse at each time point. Three mice were sampled at each time point\n\n\n \n \nELISA to Detect HA Tagged dAbs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 96-well Maxisorp (Nunc) assay plate was coated overnight at 4° C. with 100 μl per well of goat polyclonal anti HA tag antibody (Abeam) at 2 μg/ml in carbonate buffer. Wells were washed 3 times with 0.05% tween/PBS and 3 times with PBS. 200 μl per well of 2% BSA in PBS was added to block the plate. Wells were washed and then 100 μl of HA tagged dAb standard or sample was added. Wells were washed and then 100 μl of Protein A-HRP (1:5000 dilution; Amersham) was added to each well. Plates were developed with 100 μl of SureBlue 1-Component TMB MicroWell Peroxidase (KPL, Gaithersburg, USA) solution added to each well, and the plate was left at room temperature until a suitable signal had developed. The reaction was stopped by the addition of HCl and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. Data was plotted in GraphPad and then fitted in WinNonLin using a non-compartmental model.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe DOM10-53-613 (SEQ ID NO:2022) levels in the BAL show that the dAbs were delivered efficiently into the lung lumen. A maximum level of 19 μg/ml (˜7 μg in 0.4 ml) can be detected in the BAL at 1 hr. This means that at least 12% (7 μg of 60 μg total delivered) of the delivered dose was delivered in the lung lumen. It is likely that not all material can be recovered using the lavage procedure and this value is an underestimate. The levels in the BAL are maximal at 1 hour and dAbs are cleared with t\n1/2 \nof 4.4 hrs, resulting in greater than 10-fold reduced concentrations at 16 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDOM10-53-613 (SEQ ID NO:2022) levels in the lung show maximum levels at 2 hours of 3.4 μg/ml. This means that approximately 5-6% of the delivered dose was present in the lung tissue. The decline of levels in the lung shows a similar pattern as for the BAL. There was a maximum level at 10 minutes followed by a clearance rate with t\n1/2 \nof approximately 4.7 hours, resulting in greater than 10-fold reduced concentrations at 16 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDOM10-53-613 (SEQ ID NO:2022) serum levels were detected. Serum levels were at a maximum at 4 hours. At 4 hours a maximum level of 0.73 μg/ml was detected in the serum. This means that ˜1% (0.7 pg of 60 μg delivered) of the delivered material can be detected in the serum.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBAL\n\n\nLUNG\n\n\nSERUM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nT½ (hr)\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAUC0-∞ (μg * hr/mL)\n\n\n103.2\n\n\n29.7\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClearance (mL/hr/kg)\n\n\n29.1\n\n\n101.1\n\n\n455.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC Max (μg/mL)\n\n\n19.0\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nT Max (hr)\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.167\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nLigands that Bind IL-4 and IL-13\n\n\nA. Fusion Proteins\n\n\nCloning and Production of Anti-IL-4 and Anti-IL-13 Dual Specificity Dimer\n\n\n \n \n \nNucleic acids encoding the anti-IL-4 dAb DOM9-112 and anti-IL-13 dAb DOM10-53-343 (SEQ ID N10:891) were cloned into a construct that encoded an in-line fusion protein with a C-terminal cysteine. The amino acid sequence AST was present between the two dAbs, this sequence is the natural CH sequence present in natural antibodies. The construct was cloned in the \nPichia pastoris \nvector pPICZα (Invitrogen). Electrocompetent cells (X-33 or KM711-1) were transformed with the construct and transformants were selected on 100 g/ml Zeocin. 500 ml cultures were grown on BMGY media at 30° C., 250 rpm for 24 hrs until the OD\n600 \nhad reached ˜15-20. The cells were then spun down and resuspended in BMMY media (containing 0.5% (v/v) methanol) to induce protein expression. The cultures were maintained at 30° C. with shaking at 250 rpm. At 24 hour intervals the cultures were fed with the following incremental increase in the methanol concentration; 1%, 1.5% and 2% (v/v) using a 50% methanol solution. The cultures were then harvested by centrifugation and the supernatant containing the expressed protein stored at 4° C. until required. The protein was purified from the supernatant using PrA streamline using the standard purification protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PrA purified protein was found to contain both dimer and monomer species. Therefore chromatofocusing was used to separate the two proteins. A \nMono P\n 5/20 column was used (GE Healthcare) for the separation, using a pH gradient of 6 to 4. The poly-buffers used were as described by the manufacturer to make the 6 to 4 pH range. The sample was applied at pH6 and the pH gradient generated by using 100% buffer B over 35 column volumes run at 1 ml/min. Dimer containing fractions were identified using SDS-PAGE and pooled for PEGylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protein was then PEGylated using 40K PEG2-MAL using the method outlined above. This material was purified using anion exchange chromatography up to a purity >95%. The potency of the resulting dual specific ligand (PEGylated DOM9-112 (AST) DOM10-53-344) was determined in an IL-4 RBA (\nFIG. 16A\n) and an IL-13RBA (\nFIG. 16B\n). The potency of the anti-IL-4 arm of the dual specific ligand (13 nM) was slightly reduced compared with the potency of the dAb DOM9-112 monomer (3.5 nM), whereas the potency of the anti-IL-13 arm was maintained (310 pM for the dual specific ligand vs 230 pM for the dAb monomer).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-4 and anti-IL-13 dAbs DOM9-112 (SEQ ID NO:25) and DOM10-53-344 (SEQ ID NO:892) were also cloned as an in-line fusion with the amino acid sequence ASTKGPS (SEQ ID NO:1803) present between the two dAbs, this sequence is the start of the CH sequence present in natural antibodies. The potency of the resulting purified dual specific ligand (DOM9-112 (ASTKGPS) DOM10-53-344) was determined in an IL-4 RBA (\nFIG. 17A\n) and an IL-13 sandwich ELISA (\nFIG. 17B\n). The potency of the anti-IL-4 arm was maintained (1 nM) whereas the potency of the anti-IL-13 arm was only slightly reduced compared with the dAb monomer (40 pM for the dAb monomer vs 120 pM for the dual specific ligand).\n\n\n \n \nAdditional Dual Targeting in-Line Fusions for IL-4 and IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further understand the behaviour of dual targeting in-line fusions of IL4 and IL13 binding dAbs, a series of new in-line fusions and in-line fusion libraries were constructed. The DOM10-53 lineage was affinity matured using phage display using libraries diversifying triplet residues of FR1, CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3. The libraries were cloned in a phage vector and displayed as fusion protein to the gene3 protein as an (dAb1 linker dAb2) in-line fusion with dAb1 being DOM9-112-210 (SEQ ID NO: 2401), the linker being amino acid residues ASTKGPS (SEQ ID NO:1803) and dAb2 being the DOM10-53 library. The selection method, subcloning and expression in \nE coli \nand screening method were essentially performed as described above, except that in-line fusion constructs were used instead of single dAbs. Outputs were cloned into vector pDOM5 and expression supernatants were screened for improved expression by binding to a protein A coated Biacore chip.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn-line fusions with improved expression levels were expressed, purified and tested in a IL-13 sandwich ELISA and cell assay. A number of variants were selected (including DOM9-112-210 ASTKGPS-DOM10-53-566). The most potent clones were DOM10-53-531 (SEQ ID NO:2097) and DOM10-53-546 (SEQ ID NO:2110) (see Table 18). Different protein preparations were made from these clones and these were tested in the IL-4 RBA and IL-13 sandwich assay as described above.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpression level\n\n\nIL-13 Sanwich\n\n\nIL-4 RBA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone name\n\n\n(mg/l)\n\n\nELISA (EC50 nM)\n\n\n(IC50 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM9-112-210-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM10-53-531\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPrep\n 1\n\n\n9.3\n\n\n1.1/1.9\n\n\n3.5/4.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPrep\n 2\n\n\n11.5\n\n\n  4.9\n\n\nn.d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPrep\n 3\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n  2/2.8\n\n\n13.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPrep\n 4\n\n\n10\n\n\n1\n\n\n5.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM9-112-210-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM10-53-546\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPrep\n 1\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n0.62/0.77\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPrep\n 2\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n1\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther in-line fusions were constructed by SOE PCR of the DNA fragments encoding a dAb linker which is either ASTKGPS (SEQ ID NO:1803), if the first dAb was a Vh, or TVAAPS (SEQ ID NO:2459) if the first dAb was a Vk. This PCR product was digested with SalI/NotI and ligated in the \nE. coli \nexpression vector pDOM5.

These in-line fusions were constructed and expressed as described above. In addition to testing in the mentioned IL-4 RBA and IL-13 sandwich ELISA, these in-line fusions were also tested for functionality in a TF-1 cell proliferation assay. In these assays the dAb was preincubated with a fixed amount of either IL-4 or IL-13, this mixture was added to the TF-1 cells and the cells were incubated for 72 hours. After this incubation, the level of cell proliferation was determined. The results of this assay are summarised below (Table 20) and demonstrate that both arms of the in-line fusion were active in the cell assay.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM9\n\n\nDOM10\n\n\nIl-4\n\n\nIL-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRBA\n\n\nRBA\n\n\ncell assay\n\n\ncell assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM9-112-210\n\n\n0.391\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM9-155-78\n\n\n0.456\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM10-275-1-\n\n\n6.238\n\n\n39.17\n\n\n5.1-7.6 \n\n\n31-46\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM9-155-78\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM9-112-210-\n\n\n4.189\n\n\n44.88\n\n\n6.8-10.2\n\n\n27-40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM10-275-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM10-275-1\n\n\n—\n\n\n31.30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nB. IgG-Like Formats\n\n\nCloning, Expression as Dual Specific IgG\n\n\n \n \n \nIgG-like formats that bound 11-4 and IL-13 were expressed using the vector pDOM30. This vector is based on the Invitrogen pBudCE4.1 backbone and has been modified to comprise a codon-optimised heavy chain cassette under control of the CMV promoter and a codon-optimised light chain cassette under control of the EF1-alpha promoter. dAbs were cloned into the heavy chain cassette using the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites, and into the light chain cassette using SalI and BsiWI restriction sites. This strategy resulted in native heavy and light chain N-termini and the following variable-constant domain junctions. IgG expression constructs were transformed into chemically competent MachI cells (Invitrogen) grown on low salt LB agar supplemented with 250 μg/L zeocin. For each construct, plasmid DNA was prepared from 3 or 4 randomly picked colonies and dAb sequences were verified using the primers CMV-F (CGCAAATGGGCGGTAGGCGTG) (SEQ ID NO:1795) and pIG(EF1-alpha) (TGAGTGGGTGGAGACTG) (SEQ ID NO:1796). Endotoxin-free plasmid DNA was prepared from 500 mL overnight cultures using the Qiagen endo-free Megaprep kit for verified clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specificity of the anti-IL-4 and anti-IL-13 specific IgG-like format was assessed in IL-4 receptor RBA, and the IL-13 sandwich ELISA. \nFIG. 18\n shows that the potency of the anti-IL-4 dAb monomer DOM9-44-502 (SEQ ID NO:361) was 3-4 fold reduced when formatted in the IgG-like format (4 nM for the dAb monomer vs. 13 nM for the IgG-like format), whereas the potency of the anti-IL-13 dAb DOM10-176-535 (SEQ ID NO:1362) was 1 nM for both the dAb monomer and the IgG-like format.\n\n\n \n \nDetermination of the Pharmacokinetics of [\n3\nH]-PEGylated Anti-IL13 dAbs and Anti-IL-4 and anti-IL 13 in-Line Fusions\n\n\nRadiolabelling of PEGylated Anti-IL13 dAbs and Anti-IL-4 and Anti-IL13 in-Line Fusions.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IL 13 dAbs and anti-IL-4 and anti-IL 13 in-line fusions were expressed and PEGylated using the N-terminus (α-amino group) or C-terminus using a 40K branched PEG as described above. The protein was radiolabelled with tritium using N-Succinimidyl[2,3-\n3\nH]propionate (NSP) in hexane:ethyl acetate (9:1). 400 μL of NSP was dispensed into a vial and the solvent was removed under a gentle stream of nitrogen at ≦30° C. The residue was then re-suspended in 100 μL of DMSO, 2.5 mL of DOM0910 40K branched PEG was then added to the NSP/DMSO and the mixture was incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. Following incubation, the solution was loaded onto a PD10 column that was pre-equilibrated with 25 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the eluate was discarded. Radiolabelled protein was then eluted off the PD10 column using 3.5 mL of PBS and the eluate was collected. The specific activity of the material was determined (assuming a 100% labelling efficiency and recovery of protein from the PD10 column) and the solution was used immediately or stored at approximately 4° C. until required.\n\n\n \nAnimal Work.\n\n\n \n \n \nFor each molecule, 3 female Spargue-Dawley rats received a single intravenous dose at 1 mg/kg. Serial blood samples were then collected from the tail vein after 2 minutes, 2 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours and 96 hours. The final blood sample was collected after 120 hours immediately prior to sacrifice by cardiac puncture under anaesthetic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo obtain serum, blood samples were collected and allowed to clot. Once clotted, samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 mins. Serum was then harvested and stored at −20° C. until analysis.\n\n\n \nDetermination of Radioactivity.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe radioactive content of each sample was determined by liquid scintillation counting with automatic quench correction. Serum samples were mixed with PBS prior to addition of scintillation fluid. Disintegration rates from appropriate blank sample vials were subtracted from sample disintegration rates to give net dpm for each sample. Gross radioactivity below twice background level was considered to be below the limit of reliable measurement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional weighed aliquots of serum obtained after 2 minutes and 48 and 120 hours post dose were lyophilised prior to determination of radioactivity concentration to determine any contribution to total counts from free tritium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData have been fitted using Winonlin fitting software and terminal half life values are determined and described in Table 21.

(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to the area of novel analogues of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds, and the use of said compounds as GIP-receptor agonists or antagonists for treatment of GIP-receptor mediated conditions, such as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nGlucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (“GIP”, also known as “gastric inhibitory polypeptide”; SEQ ID NO:1) is a 42-residue peptide secreted by enteroendorine K-cells of the small intestine into the bloodstream in response to oral nutrient ingestion. GIP inhibits the secretion of gastric acid, and it has been shown to be a potent stimulant for the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells after oral glucose ingestion (the “incretin effect”) (Creutzfeldt, W., et al., 1979, \nDiabetologia, \n16:75-85).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsulin release induced by the ingestion of glucose and other nutrients is due to both hormonal and neural factors (Creutzfeldt, W., et al., 1985\n, Diabetologia, \n28:565-573). Several gastrointestinal regulatory peptides have been proposed as incretins, and among these candidates, only GIP and glucagon-like peptide 1 (“GLP-1”) appear to fulfill the requirements to be considered physiological stimulants of postprandial insulin release (Nauck, et al., 1989,\nJ. Clin. Endorinol. Metab., \n69:654-662). It has been shown that the combined effects of GIP and GLP-1 are sufficient to explain the full incretin effect of the enteroinsular axis (Fehmann, H. C., et al., 1989\n, FEBS Lett., \n252:109-112).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is well known to those skilled in the art, the known and potential uses of GIP are varied and multitudinous. Thus, the administration of the compounds of this invention for purposes of eliciting an agonist effect can have the same effects and uses as GIP itself. These varied uses of GIP may be summarized as follows: treating a disease selected from the group consisting of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes (Visboll, T., 2004\n, Dan. Med. Bull., \n51:364-70), insulin resistance (WO 2005/082928), obesity (Green, B. D., et al., 2004\n, Current Pharmaceutical Design, \n10:3651-3662), metabolic disorder (Gault, V. A., et al., 2003\n, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., \n308:207-213), central nervous system disease, neurodegenerative disease, congestive heart failure, hypoglycemia, and disorders wherein the reduction of food intake and weight loss are desired. In pancreatic islets, GIP not only enhances insulin secretion acutely, but it also stimulates insulin production through enhancement of proinsulin transcription and translation (Wang, et al., 1996\n, Mol. Cell. Endocrinol., \n116:81-87) and enhances the growth and survival of pancreatic beta cells (Trumper, et al., 2003, \nDiabetes, \n52:741-750). In addition to effects on the pancreas to enhance insulin secretion, GIP also has effects on insulin target tissues directly to lower plasma glucose: enhancement of glucose uptake in adipose (Eckel, et al., 1979, Diabetes, 28:1141-1142) and muscle (O'Harte, et al., 1998\n, J. Endocrinol., \n156:237-243), and inhibition of hepatic glucose production (Elahi, D., et al., 1986\n, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., \n65:A18).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, a GIP receptor antagonist in accordance with the present invention inhibits, blocks or reduces glucose absorption from the intestine of an animal. In accordance with this observation, therapeutic compositions containing GIP antagonists may be used in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus to improve tolerance to oral glucose in mammals, such as humans, to prevent, inhibit or reduce obesity by inhibiting, blocking or reducing glucose absorption from the intestine of the mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of unmodified GIP as a therapeutic, however, is limited by the short in vivo half-life of about 2 minutes (Said and Mutt, 1970\n, Science, \n169:1217-1218). In serum, both incretins, GIP and GLP-1, are degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (“DPPIV”). Improving the stability of GIP to proteolysis not only maintains the activity of GIP at its receptor but, more importantly, prevents the production of GIP fragments, some of which act as GIP receptor antagonists (Gault, et al., 2002\n, J. Endocrinol., \n175:525-533). Reported modifications have included protection of the N-terminus of GIP from proteolysis by DPPIV through modification of the N-terminal tyrosine (O'Harte, et al., 2002\n, Diabetologia, \n45:1281-1291), mutation of the alanine at position 2 (Hinke, et al., 2002\n, Diabetes, \n51:656-661), mutation of glutamic acid at position 3 (Gault, et al., 2003\n, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., \n308:207-213), and mutation of alanine at position 13 (Gault, et al., 2003\n, Cell Biol. International, \n27:41-46),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following patent applications have been filed related to the effects of GIP analogues on the function of various target organs and their potential use as therapeutic agents:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT publication WO 00/58360 discloses peptidyl analogues of GIP which stimulate the release of insulin. In particular, this application discloses specific peptidyl analogues comprising at least 15 amino acid residues from the N-terminal end of GIP(1-42), e.g., an analogue of GIP containing exactly one amino acid substitution or modification at positions 1, 2 and 3, such as [Pro\n3\n](1-42).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT publication WO 98/24464 discloses an antagonist of GIP consisting essentially of a 24-amino acid polypeptide corresponding to positions 7-30 of the sequence of GIP, a method of treating non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and a method of improving glucose tolerance in a non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT publication WO 03/082898 discloses C-terminal truncated fragments and N-terminal modified analogues of GIP, as well as various GIP analogues with a reduced peptide bond or alterations of the amino acids close to the DPPIV-specific cleavage site. This application further discloses analogues with different linkers between potential receptor binding sites of GIP. The compounds of this application are alleged to be useful in treating GIP-receptor mediated conditions, such as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere exists a need for improved analogues of GIP, which are stable in formulation and have long plasma half-life in vivo resulting from decreased susceptibility to proteolysis and decreased clearance while maintaining binding affinity to a GIP receptor to elicit respective agonistic or antagonistic effects. Moreover, among other therapeutic effects of the compounds of the present invention as illustrated herein, tighter control of plasma glucose levels may prevent long-term diabetic complications, thereby providing an improved quality of life for patients.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention relates to peptide variants of GIP of the following formula

See, e.g., Stewart, J. M., et al., 1984\n, Solid Phase Synthesis\n, Pierce Chemical Co., 2d ed. If R\n1 \nis NH—X\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CONH\n2\n, i.e., Z\n0\n═CONH\n2\n, the synthesis of the peptide starts with Fmoc-HN—X\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CONH\n2 \nwhich is coupled to Rink amide MBHA resin. If R\n1 \nis NH—X\n2\n—CH\n2\n—COOH, i.e., Z\n0\n═COOH, the synthesis of the peptide starts with Fmoc-HN—X\n2\n—CH\n2\n—COOH which is coupled to Wang resin. For this particular step, 2 molar equivalents of Fmoc-HN—X\n2\n—COOH, HBTU and HOBt and 10 molar equivalents of DIPEA are used. The coupling time is about 8 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the synthesis of a GIP analogue of this invention containing A5c, A6c, and/or Aib, the coupling time is 2 hrs for these residues and the residue immediately following them.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe substituents R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nof the above generic formula can be attached to the free amine of the N-terminal amino acid A\n1 \nby standard methods known in the art. For example, alkyl groups, e.g., (C\n1\n-C\n30\n)alkyl, can be attached using reductive alkylation. Hydroxyalkyl groups, e.g., (C\n1\n-C\n30\n)hydroxyalkyl, can also be attached using reductive alkylation wherein the free hydroxy group is protected with a tert-butyl ester. Acyl groups, e.g., —C(O)X\n3\n, can be attached by coupling the free acid, e.g., —X\n3 \nCOOH, to the free amine of the N-terminal amino acid by mixing the completed resin with 3 molar equivalents of both the free acid and diisopropylcarbodiimide in methylene chloride for about one hour. If the free acid contains a free hydroxy group, e.g., 3-fluoro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, then the coupling should be performed with an additional 3 molar equivalents of HOBT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples describe synthetic methods for making a peptide of this invention, which methods are well-known to those skilled in the art. Other methods are also known to those skilled in the art.

One equivalent of TFFH (tetramethylfluoroformamidinium hexafluorophosphate; Perceptive Biosystems, Warrington, UK) was added to the coupling of Fmoc-A5c-OH and Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH in positions 10 and 11. The resin was double coupled successively according to the sequence of the title peptide. After the peptide chain was assembled the resin was washed completely by using N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dichloromethane (DCM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the end of the assembly of the peptide chain on the 433A, the peptide-resin was transferred to a reaction vessel on a shaker and the Fmoc was removed using 25% Pip/DMF for 30 minutes.

Assembly of Peptide Chain of (Gly\n2\n, A5c\n11, 41\n)hGIP(2-42)-OH\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was assembled using microwave-assisted Fmoc Chemistry on a Liberty Peptide Synthesizer (CEM; Matthews, NC, USA) at the 0.20 mmole scale. Pre-loaded Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-Wang resin (0.59 mmole/g; Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA) was used to generate the C-terminal acid peptide. The resin (0.423 g) was placed in a 50 ml conical tube along with 15 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) and loaded onto a resin position on the synthesizer. The resin was then quantitatively transferred to the reaction vessel via the automated process. The standard Liberty synthesis protocol for 0.25 mmole scale synthesis was used. This protocol involves deprotecting the N-terminal Fmoc moiety via an initial treatment with 7 ml of 20% piperidine, containing 0.1M N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), in DMF. The initial deprotection step was for 30 seconds with microwave power (45 watts, maximum temperature of 75° C.), and nitrogen bubbling (3 seconds on/7 seconds off). The reaction vessel was then drained and a second piperidine treatment, identical to the first treatment, except that it was for a 3-minute duration. The resin was then drained and thoroughly washed with DMF several times. Cycle 2 was coupling of Fmoc-A5c-OH, its 0.2M stock solution in DMF was then added (2.5 ml, 5 eq.), followed by 1.0 ml of 0.45M (4.5 eq.) HBTU [2-(1H-benzo-triazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosaphate] in DMF. This was followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of 2M (10 eq.) DIPEA (diisopropylethyl amine) in NMP(N-methylpyrrollidinone). The coupling step was performed for 5 minutes using 20 watts of microwave power at a max temperature of 75° C. and the same rate of nitrogen bubbling. Following the initial coupling step the reaction vessel was drained to waste and the coupling was repeated once. Cycle 3 following Fmoc A5c was used aggressive coupling in which coupling step was performed for 10 minutes using 20 watts of microwave power at a max temperature of 90° C. All amino acids were introduced similarly to those described at cycle 2 except that aggressive couplings were applied to Fmoc A5c-OH at Cycle 32 and its following Fmoc Tyr(tBu)-OH. A double-coupling strategy was employed throughout the entire sequence. Cycles 2, 4, 20, 21, 26, 27, 31, 36 37, 38, 39, 41 contained a capping procedure immediately following the coupling step. Capping was performed by adding 7 mL of 0.5M acetic anhydride, containing 0.015M HOBT in NMP, along with 2 mL of the 2M DIPEA solution using a multi-step microwave protocol: 50 watts of power for 30 seconds (65° C. max temperature), followed by 30 seconds of microwave power off, followed by a second round of 30 seconds of microwave power on (50 watts), and then again 30 seconds of no microwave power. The resin was then drained and thoroughly washed with DMF. The following amino acids (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, Ky., USA) were used: Cycle 2: Fmoc-A5c-OH; Cycle 3: Fmoc-Ile-OH; Cycle 4: Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH; Cycle 5: Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH; Cycle 6: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 7: Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH; Cycle 8: Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 9: Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH; Cycle 10: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 11: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 12: Fmoc-Gly-OH; Cycle 13: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 14: Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH; Cycle 15: Fmoc-Ala-OH; Cycle 16: Fmoc-Leu-OH; Cycle 17: Fmoc-Leu-OH; Cycle 18: Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH; Cycle 19: Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH; Cycle 20: Fmoc-Val-OH; Cycle 21: Fmoc-Phe-OH; Cycle 22: Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 23: Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH; Cycle 24: Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH; Cycle 25: Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH; Cycle 26: Fmoc-Ile-OH; Cycle 27: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 28: Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 29: Fmoc-Met-OH; Cycle 30: Fmoc-Ala-OH; Cycle 31: Fmoc-Ile-OH; Cycle 32:Fmoc-A5C—OH, Cycle 33: Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH, Cycle 34:Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 35: Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH; Cycle 36: Fmoc-Ile-OH; Cycle 37: Fmoc-Phe-OH; Cycle 38: Fmoc-Thr(oBu))-OH; Cycle 39: Fmoc-Gly-OH, Cycle 40: Fmoc-Glu(OtBu)-OH, and Cycle 41: Fmoc-Gly-OH. The coupling protocol for Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH was a slightly modified version of the standard protocol. The microwave power was off for the first 2 minutes, followed by 4 minutes with microwave power on (20 watts; max temperature of 50° C.). After assembly of peptide chain was finished, the resin was treated with 20% piperidine in DMF for 40 minutes to deprotect Fmoc at N-terminal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. Synthesis of Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-CHO\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH was converted to N-methoxy-N-methyl-α-(Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-carboxamide. Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH(4.6 g,10 mmol) in 100 ml DCM was mixed with O,N-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (1 g, 10 mmol), HOBT (1.37 g, 10.1 mmol, and DIPEA (5.25 ml, 30 mmol) at ice bath for 15 minutes, to which EDC (2.11 g, 11 mmol) was added. The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 15 hrs. It was diluted with DCM, which was successively washed by sat. NaHCO\n3 \n(50 ml×3), 10% citric acid (50 ml×3) and brine (50 ml×3). After all DCM layer was dried over Mg SO\n4\n, it was stripped down to give 4.62 g with MS 503.4 (MW 503.6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nN-methoxy-N-methyl-α-(Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-carboxamide was reduced to Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-CHO.

The reduction was finished in 20 minutes. The mixture was hydrolyzed with 100 ml of 0.5 N KHSO\n4 \nfor 0.5 hr. It was extracted with 200 ml ether. All organic layer was washed with 10% KHSO\n4 \n(50 ml×2), brine (50 ml×3) then dried over MgSO\n4\n. The solvent was evaporated to give crude aldehyde product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above crude Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-CHO (3.115 mmol) in 5 ml DMF was added into peptide (Gly\n2\n, A5c\n11, 41\n)hGIP(2-42)-resin (0.2 mmol) containing 5 ml DMF with 100 μl AcOH. It was treated with NaBH\n3\nCN (0.1957 g) for 1 hr, then second portion of NaBH\n3\nCN (0.1957 g) was added. It was repeated once again, then the resin was shaken overnight. After the resin was washed and cleaved Fmoc with 25% piperidine for 45 minutes. It was cleaved with a solution of TFA, H\n2\nO, TI and DTT (15 ml/1.28 ml/1.35 ml/0.75 g) for 3 hr and then was filtered into 140 ml of cold ether. The precipitate was obtained after centrifugalization. This crude product was dissolved in 20 ml of 50% AcOH, diluted with 180 ml water and purified on a reverse-phase preparative HPLC, using a column (4×43 cm) of C\n18 \nDYNAMAX-100 A\n0 \n(Varian, Walnut Creek, Calif., USA). The column was eluted with a linear gradient from 20% B to 45% B in 45 minutes, where A was 0.1% TFA in water and B was 0.1% TFA in CH\n3\nCN. After checked by MS and HPLC, all pure fractions were pooled and lyophilized to dryness. The purity was 98.93%. ESI mass analysis showed 4989.7 in agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 4989.67.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther peptides of the invention can be prepared by a person of ordinary skill in the art using synthetic procedures analogous to those disclosed in the foregoing examples.

In Vitro hGIP Receptor Binding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMembranes for in vitro receptor binding assays were prepared by homogenizing the CHO-K1 clonal cells expressing the human recombinant GIP receptor, with a Brinkman Polytron (setting 6, 15 sec), in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl and then subjected to two centrifugations at 39,000 g for 10 minutes, with a resuspension in fresh buffer in between. For the assay, aliquots of the washed membrane preparations were incubated (100 minutes at 25° C. with 0.05 nM [\n125\nI]GIP (˜2200 Ci/mmol) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, and 0.1% BSA. The final assay volume was 0.5 ml. The incubations were terminated by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (pre-soaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine) using a Brandel filtration manifold. Each tube and filter were then washed three times with 5-ml aliquots of ice-cold buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding was defined as the total radioligand bound minus that bound in the presence of 1000 nM GIP. In vitro hGIP receptor binding data for the compounds exemplified herein are given in Table 2.\n\n\n \nB. Human and Rat Plasma Half-Life Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nGIP peptide (50 μl 1 mg/ml) was added to 450 μl plasma (human or rat), vertexed briefly and incubated at 37° C. 50 μl was removed at various times, like at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 24, 32, 48, 56, 72 hours, mixed with 5 μl formic acid and 150 μL acetonitrile in a microcentrifuge tube, vertexed, and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10 K rpm. The supernatant was transferred to an injection vial and analyzed by LC-MS. The LC-MS system consisted of an API4000 mass spectrometer with an ESI probe.

Determination of Cyclic AMP Stimulation\n\n\n \n \n \n1×105 CH\n0\n-K\n1 \ncells expressing the human recombinant GIP receptor or RIN-5F insulinoma cells were seeded overnight into 24-well cell culture plates (Corning Incorporate, Corning, N.Y., USA). For the assay, the cells were preincubated in 500 μl of Hanks balanced salt solution (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA) with 0.55 mM IBMX (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA) adjusted to pH 7.3 for 10 minutes. GIP or its analogs was then added at a concentration of 100 nM. Following a 30-minute incubation at 37° C., the plates were placed on ice and 500 μl of ice-cold absolute ethanol was added to stop the reaction. The contents of the wells were collected, spun at 2,700 g for 20 minutes at 4° C. to remove cellular debris. The cAMP levels in the supernatants were determined by radioimmunoassay (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass., USA).\n\n\n \n \nD. Determination of in vivo Insulin Secretion in Normal Rats\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMale Sprague Dawley rats with a body weight of approximately 275-300 g were used as experimental subjects. The day prior to the treatment, right atrial cannulae were implanted via the jugular vein under chlorohydrate. Each cannula was filled with 100 u/ml heparin saline and tied. The rats were fasted for approximately 18 hours prior to dosing with the compound or the vehicle (saline/0.25% BSA). The day of the experiment, aliquots of compound were thawed, brought to room temperature and vortexed thoroughly. A careful check was made for any sign of compound coming out of solution. 10 minutes prior to compound/glucose injection, a 500 μl blood sample was withdrawn and replaced with an equal volume of heparinized saline (10 u/ml). At time 0, a 500 μl blood sample was withdrawn through the cannula. Next, either the vehicle or the appropriate dose of the compound was injected into the cannula and pushed in with the glucose (1 g/kg) or vehicle solution. Finally, 500 μl of volume of heparinized saline (10 u/ml) was used to push in the remaining glucose through the cannula. Additional 500 μl blood samples were withdrawn at 2.5, 5, 10, and 20-minute post-glucose dosing; each immediately followed by a bolus, iv injection of 500 μl heparinized saline (10 u/ml) through the cannula. The plasma was collected from the blood samples by centrifugation, and stored at −20° C. until assay for insulin content. Numerical values of the total insulin secretion, which show the in vivo effects of the compounds of Examples 14 and 28, are summarized in Table 3.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAUC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVehicle/Vehicle\n\n\n20.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVehicle/Glucose\n\n\n4.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 14\n\n\n189.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 28\n\n\n92.88\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdministration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptides of this invention can be provided in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of such salts include, but are not limited to, those formed with organic acids (e.g., acetic, lactic, maleic, citric, malic, ascorbic, succinic, benzoic, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, or pamoic acid), inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid), and polymeric acids (e.g., tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose, polylactic, polyglycolic, or copolymers of polylactic-glycolic acids). A typical method of making a salt of a peptide of the present invention is well known in the art and can be accomplished by standard methods of salt exchange. Accordingly, the TFA salt of a peptide of the present invention (the TFA salt results from the purification of the peptide by using preparative HPLC, eluting with TFA containing buffer solutions) can be converted into another salt, such as an acetate salt by dissolving the peptide in a small amount of 0.25 N acetic acid aqueous solution. The resulting solution is applied to a semi-prep HPLC column (Zorbax, 300 SB, C-8). The column is eluted with (1) 0.1N ammonium acetate aqueous solution for 0.5 hrs, (2) 0.25N acetic acid aqueous solution for 0.5 hrs, and (3) a linear gradient (20% to 100% of solution B over 30 minutes) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min (solution A is 0.25N acetic acid aqueous solution; solution B is 0.25N acetic acid in acetonitrile/water, 80:20). The fractions containing the peptide are collected and lyophilized to dryness.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be varied; however, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment. In general, an effective dosage for the activities of this invention is in the range of 1×10\n−7 \nto 200 mg/kg/day, preferably 1×10\n−4 \nto 100 mg/kg/day, which can be administered as a single dose or divided into multiple doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention can be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous injection, or implant), nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical routes of administration, and can be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to provide dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than such inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include, without limitation, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, elixirs, and the like, containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Besides such inert diluents, compositions can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations according to this invention for parenteral administration include, without limitation, sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, and the like. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain, in addition to the active substance, excipients such as coca butter or a suppository wax.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, a compound of this invention can be administered in a sustained release composition such as those described in the following patents and patent applications. U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,659 teaches sustained release compositions comprising a bioactive agent and a polyester. U.S. Pat.

(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to the area of novel analogues of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds, and the use of said compounds as GIP-receptor agonists or antagonists for treatment of GIP-receptor mediated conditions, such as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (“GIP”, also known as “gastric inhibitory polypeptide”) is a 42-residue peptide secreted by enteroendorine K-cells of the small intestine into the bloodstream in response to oral nutrient ingestion. GIP inhibits the secretion of gastric acid, and it has been shown to be a potent stimulant for the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells after oral glucose ingestion (the “incretin effect”) (Creutzfeldt, W., et al., 1979, \nDiabetologia, \n16:75-85).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsulin release induced by the ingestion of glucose and other nutrients is due to both hormonal and neural factors (Creutzfeldt, W., et al., 1985, \nDiabetologia, \n28:565-573). Several gastrointestinal regulatory peptides have been proposed as incretins, and among these candidates, only GIP and glucagon-like peptide 1 (“GLP-1”) appear to fulfill the requirements to be considered physiological stimulants of postprandial insulin release (Nauck, et al., 1989, \nJ. Clin. Endorinol. Metab., \n69:654-662). It has been shown that the combined effects of GIP and GLP-1 are sufficient to explain the full incretin effect of the enteroinsular axis (Fehmann, H. C., et al., 1989, \nFEBS Lett., \n252:109-112).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is well known to those skilled in the art, the known and potential uses of GIP are varied and multitudinous. Thus, the administration of the compounds of this invention for purposes of eliciting an agonist effect can have the same effects and uses as GIP itself. These varied uses of GIP may be summarized as follows: treating a disease selected from the group consisting of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes (Visboll, T., 2004, \nDan. Med. Bull., \n51:364-70), insulin resistance (WO 2005/082928), obesity (Green, B. D., et al., 2004, \nCurrent Pharmaceutical Design, \n10:3651-3662), metabolic disorder (Gault, V. A., et al., 2003, \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., \n308:207-213), central nervous system disease, neurodegenerative disease, congestive heart failure, hypoglycemia, and disorders wherein the reduction of food intake and weight loss are desired. In pancreatic islets, GIP not only enhances insulin secretion acutely, but it also stimulates insulin production through enhancement of proinsulin transcription and translation (Wang, et al., 1996, \nMol. Cell. Endocrinol., \n116:81-87) and enhances the growth and survival of pancreatic beta cells (Trumper, et al., 2003, \nDiabetes, \n52:741-750). In addition to effects on the pancreas to enhance insulin secretion, GIP also has effects on insulin target tissues directly to lower plasma glucose: enhancement of glucose uptake in adipose (Eckel, et al., 1979, \nDiabetes, \n28:1141-1142) and muscle (O'Harte, et al., 1998, \nJ. Endocrinol., \n156:237-243), and inhibition of hepatic glucose production (Elahi, D., et al., 1986, \nCan. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., \n65:A18).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, a GIP receptor antagonist in accordance with the present invention inhibits, blocks or reduces glucose absorption from the intestine of an animal. In accordance with this observation, therapeutic compositions containing GIP antagonists may be used in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus to improve tolerance to oral glucose in mammals, such as humans, to prevent, inhibit or reduce obesity by inhibiting, blocking or reducing glucose absorption from the intestine of the mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of unmodified GIP as a therapeutic, however, is limited by the short in vivo half-life of about 2 minutes (Said and Mutt, 1970, \nScience, \n169:1217-1218). In serum, both incretins, GIP and GLP-1, are degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (“DPPIV”). Improving the stability of GIP to proteolysis not only maintains the activity of GIP at its receptor but, more importantly, prevents the production of GIP fragments, some of which act as GIP receptor antagonists (Gault, et al., 2002, \nJ. Endocrinol., \n175:525-533). Reported modifications have included protection of the N-terminus of GIP from proteolysis by DPPIV through modification of the N-terminal tyrosine (O'Harte, et al., 2002, \nDiabetologia, \n45:1281-1291), mutation of the alanine at position 2 (Hinke, et al., 2002, \nDiabetes, \n51:656-661), mutation of glutamic acid at position 3 (Gault, et al., 2003, \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., \n308:207-213), and mutation of alanine at position 13 (Gault, et al., 2003, \nCell Biol. International, \n27:41-46),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following patent applications have been filed related to the effects of GIP analogues on the function of various target organs and their potential use as therapeutic agents:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT publication WO 00/58360 discloses peptidyl analogues of GIP which stimulate the release of insulin. In particular, this application discloses specific peptidyl analogues comprising at least 15 amino acid residues from the N-terminal end of GIP(1-42), e.g., an analogue of GIP containing exactly one amino acid substitution or modification at positions 1, 2 and 3, such as [Pro\n3\n]GIP(1-42).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT publication WO 98/24464 discloses an antagonist of GIP consisting essentially of a 24-amino acid polypeptide corresponding to positions 7-30 of the sequence of GIP, a method of treating non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and a method of improving glucose tolerance in a non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT publication WO 03/082898 discloses C-terminal truncated fragments and N-terminal modified analogues of GIP, as well as various GIP analogues with a reduced peptide bond or alterations of the amino acids close to the DPPIV-specific cleavage site. This application further discloses analogues with different linkers between potential receptor binding sites of GIP. The compounds of this application are alleged to be useful in treating GIP-receptor mediated conditions, such as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere exists a need for improved analogues of GIP, which are stable in formulation and have long plasma half-life in vivo resulting from decreased susceptibility to proteolysis and decreased clearance while maintaining binding affinity to a GIP receptor to elicit respective agonistic or antagonistic effects. Moreover, among other therapeutic effects of the compounds of the present invention as illustrated herein, tighter control of plasma glucose levels may prevent long-term diabetic complications, thereby providing an improved quality of life for patients.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention relates to peptide variants of GIP of the following formula

the present invention, a compound according to the present invention as summarized hereinabove and claimed in the appended claims may further comprise a covalently linked PEG moiety, in which said PEG moiety is covalently linked to the compound via a Cys(maleimide), hCys(maleimide), or Pen(maleimide) linker, to form Cys(succinimide-N-PEG), hCys(succinimide-N-PEG), or Pen(succinimide-N-PEG), wherein “succinimide-N-PEG” is either linear or branched as defined hereinbelow. Such PEG moiety has average molecular weight of from about 2,000 to about 80,000, and preferably such PEG moiety is selected from the group consisting of 5K PEG, 10K PEG, 20K PEG, 30K PEG, 40K PEG, 50K PEG, and 60K PEG, to form Cys(succinimide-N-5K PEG), Cys(succinimide-N-10K PEG), Cys(succinimide-N-20K PEG), Cys(succinimide-N-30K PEG), Cys(succinimide-N-40K PEG), Cys(succinimide-N-50K PEG), Cys(succinimide-N-60K PEG), hCys(succinimide-N-5K PEG), hCys(succinimide-N-10K PEG), hCys(succinimide-N-20K PEG), hCys(succinimide-N-30K PEG), hCys(succinimide-N-40K PEG), hCys(succinimide-N-50K PEG), hCys(succinimide-N-60K PEG), Pen(succinimide-N-5K PEG), Pen(succinimide-N-10K PEG), Pen(succinimide-N-20K PEG), Pen(succinimide-N-30K PEG), Pen(succinimide-N-40K PEG), Pen(succinimide-N-50K PEG), or Pen(succinimide-N-60K PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPEGylation occurs at any one of amino acid residue positions 16, 30, and 31-43, and preferably at any one of amino acid residue positions 32, 33 and 43, whereby Cys(succinimide-N-PEG), hCys(succinimide-N-PEG), or Pen(succinimide-N-PEG) is placed in any one of such amino acid residue positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the above formula (I) may be expanded to provide PEGylation sites at positions A\n44\n-A\n47\n.

See, e.g., Stewart, J. M., et al., 1984, \nSolid Phase Synthesis, \nPierce Chemical Co., 2d ed. If R\n1 \nis NH—X\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CONH\n2\n, i.e., Z\n0\n═CONH\n2\n, the synthesis of the peptide starts with Fmoc-HN—X\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CONH\n2 \nwhich is coupled to Rink amide MBHA resin. If R\n1 \nis NH—X\n2\n—CH\n2\n—COOH, i.e., Z\n0\n═COOH, the synthesis of the peptide starts with Fmoc-HN—X\n2\n—CH\n2\n—COOH which is coupled to Wang resin. For this particular step, 2 molar equivalents of Fmoc-HN—X\n2\n—COOH, HBTU and HOBt and 10 molar equivalents of DIPEA are used. The coupling time is about 8 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the synthesis of a GIP analogue of this invention containing A5c, A6c, and/or Aib, the coupling time is 2 hrs for these residues and the residue immediately following them.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe substituents R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nof the above generic formula can be attached to the free amine of the N-terminal amino acid A\n1 \nby standard methods known in the art. For example, alkyl groups, e.g., (C\n1\n—C\n30\n)alkyl, can be attached using reductive alkylation. Hydroxyalkyl groups, e.g., (C\n1\n-C\n30\n)hydroxyalkyl, can also be attached using reductive alkylation wherein the free hydroxy group is protected with a tert-butyl ester. Acyl groups, e.g., —C(O)X\n3\n, can be attached by coupling the free acid, e.g., —X\n3\nCOOH, to the free amine of the N-terminal amino acid by mixing the completed resin with 3 molar equivalents of both the free acid and diisopropylcarbodiimide in methylene chloride for about one hour. If the free acid contains a free hydroxy group, e.g., 3-fluoro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, then the coupling should be performed with an additional 3 molar equivalents of HOBT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples describe synthetic methods for making a peptide of this invention, which methods are well-known to those skilled in the art. Other methods are also known to those skilled in the art. The examples are provided for the purpose of illustration and are not meant to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n[Ac-A6c\n7\n, Cys(Psu)\n40\n]hGIP(7-42)-OH\n\n\n \n \n \nSolid-phase peptide synthesis was used to assemble the peptide using microwave-assisted Fmoc Chemistry on a Liberty Peptide Synthesizer (CEM; Matthews, N.C., USA) at the 0.1 mmole scale. Pre-loaded Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-Wang resin (0.59 mmole/g; Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA) was used to generate the C-terminal acid peptide. The resin (0.17 g) was placed in a 50 ml conical tube along with 15 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) and loaded onto a resin position on the synthesizer. The resin was then quantitatively transferred to the reaction vessel via the automated process. The standard Liberty synthesis protocol for 0.1 mmole scale synthesis was used. This protocol involves deprotecting the N-terminal Fmoc moiety via an initial treatment with 7 ml of 20% piperidine, containing 0.1M N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), in DMF. The initial deprotection step was for 30 seconds with microwave power (45 watts, maximum temperature of 75° C.), and nitrogen bubbling (3 seconds on/7 seconds off). The reaction vessel was then drained and a second piperidine treatment, identical to the first treatment, except that it was for a 3-minute duration. The resin was then drained and thoroughly washed with DMF several times. The protected amino acid, Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH, prepared as 0.2M stock solution in DMF, was then added (2.5 ml, 5 equivalents), followed by 1.0 ml of 0.45M (4.5 eq.) HBTU [2-(1H-benzo-triazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosaphate] in DMF. This was followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of 2M (10 eq.) DIPEA (diisopropylethylamine) in NMP (N-methylpyrrollidinone). The coupling step was performed for 5 minutes using 20 watts of microwave power, a max temperature of 75 ° C., and the same rate of nitrogen bubbling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing the initial coupling step, the reaction vessel was drained to waste and the coupling step repeated. Cycle 2 was then initiated similar to cycle 1. All amino acids were introduced similarly and a double-coupling strategy was employed throughout the entire sequence. Cycles 1-3, 19-20, 25-26, and 30-34 contained a capping procedure immediately following the coupling step. Capping was performed by adding 7 ml of 0.5M acetic anhydride, containing 0.015M HOBT in NMP, along with 2 ml of the 2M DIPEA solution using a multi-step microwave protocol: 50 watts of power for 30 seconds (65° C. max temperature), followed by 30 seconds of microwave power off, followed by a second round of 30 seconds of microwave power on (50 watts), and then again 30 seconds of no microwave power. The resin was then drained and thoroughly washed with DMF. The following amino acids (Advanced Chemtech; Louisville, Ky., USA) were used: Cycle 1: Fmoc-Thr(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 2: Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-OH; Cycle 3: Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH; Cycle 4: Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH; Cycle 5: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 6: Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH; Cycle 7: Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 8: Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH; Cycle 9: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 10: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 11: Fmoc-Gly-OH; Cycle 12: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 13: Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH; Cycle 14: Fmoc-Ala-OH; Cycle 15: Fmoc-Leu-OH; Cycle 16: Fmoc-Leu-OH; Cycle 17: Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH; Cycle 18: Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH; Cycle 19: Fmoc-Val-OH; Cycle 20: Fmoc-Phe-OH; Cycle 21: Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 22: Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH; Cycle 23: Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH; Cycle 24: Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH; Cycle 25: Fmoc-Ile-OH; Cycle 26: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 27: Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 28: Fmoc-Met-OH; Cycle 29: Fmoc-Ala-OH; Cycle 30: Fmoc-Ile-OH; Cycle 31: Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-Ser(psiMe,Me,Pro)-OH; Cycle 32: Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 33: Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH; and Cycle 34: Fmoc-A6c-OH. Once the peptide backbone was complete, the resin was treated with piperidine solution to remove the N-terminal Fmoc group, followed by treatment with the standard capping procedure in order to acetylate the N-terminus. The resin was then thoroughly washed with DMF and then transferred back to the 50 ml conical tube using DMF as the transfer solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resin was deprotected and cleaved from the resin via treatment with 5 ml of the following reagent; 5% TIS, 2% water, 5% (w/v) dithiothrieitol (DTT), 88% TFA, and allowed to mix for 3.5 hours. The filtrate was collected into 45 ml of cold anhydrous ethyl ether. The precipitate was pelleted for 10 minutes at 3500 RPM in a refrigerated centrifuge. The ether was decanted, and the peptide re-suspended in fresh ether. The ether workup was performed a total of 2 times. Following the last ether wash the peptide was allowed to air dry to remove residual ether. The peptide pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of acetonitrile (Acn) followed by 8 ml of de-ionized water, and allowed to fully dissolve. The peptide solution was then analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass analysis employing electrospray ionization identified a main product containing a mass of 4358.0 Daltons; corresponding to the acetylated,linear product. The crude product (approximately 500 mg) was analysed by HPLC, employing a 250×4.6 mm C18 column (Phenomenex; Torrance, Calif., USA) using a gradient of 2-80% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) over 30 minutes. Analytical HPLC identified a product with 38% purity. The crude peptide was then purified on a preparative HPLC equipped with a C18 reverse phase column using a 10-60% acetonirile (0.1% TFA) over 50 minutes at a 10 ml/min flowrate. The purified peptide was then lyophilized yielding 15 mg of peptide. The linear peptide was then derivatized with N-propylmaleimide (Pma) to generate the propylsuccinimide (Psu) derivative on the Cysteine side chain. The purified linear peptide was brought up in water, adjusted to pH 6.5 with ammonium carbonate, at 5 mg/ml. Five equivalents of Pma was added with constant stirring for 30 seconds. The derivatized peptide solution was then analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass analysis identified a main product containing a mass of 4498.6 Daltons; corresponding to the desired Psu derivatized product. The product was then re-purified via preparative HPLC using a similar gradient as before. The purified product was analyzed by HPLC for purity (95.2%) and mass spectrometry (4498.6 Daltons) and subsequently lyophilized. Following lyophillization, 4.3 mg of purified product was obtained representing a 1% yield.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 12 \n\n\n[Ac-Ac6c\n7\n, Orn(N—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\n12\n—CH\n3\n)\n31\n]hGIP(7-42)-OH \n\n\n \n \n \nSolid-phase peptide synthesis was used to assemble the peptide using microwave-assisted Fmoc Chemistry on a Liberty Peptide Synthesizer (CEM; Matthews, N.C., USA) at the 0.1 mmole scale.

In Vitro hGIP Receptor Binding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMembranes for in vitro receptor binding assays were prepared by homogenizing the CHO-K1 clonal cells expressing the human recombinant GIP receptor, with a Brinkman Polytron (setting 6, 15 sec), in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl and then subjected to two centrifugations at 39,000 g for 10 minutes, with a resuspension in fresh buffer in between. For the assay, aliquots of the washed membrane preparations were incubated (100 minutes at 25° C. with 0.05 nM [\n125\nI]GIP (approximately 2200 Ci/mmol) in 50mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mg,/mlbacitracin, and 0.1% BSA. The final assay volume was 0.5 ml. The incubations were terminated by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (pre-soaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine) using a Brandel filtration manifold. Each tube and filter were then washed three times with 5-ml aliquots of ice-cold buffer. Specific binding was defined as the total radioligand bound minus that bound in the presence of 1000 nM GIP. In vitro hGIP receptor binding data for the compounds exemplified herein are given in Table 2.\n\n\n \nB. Human and Rat Plasma Half-Life Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nGIP peptide (50 μL 1 mg/ml) was added to 450 μL plasma (human or rat), vertexed briefly and incubated at 37° C. 50 μl, was removed at various times, like at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 24, 32, 48, 56, 72 hours, mixed with 5 μL formic acid and 150 μL acetonitrile in a microcentrifuge tube, vertexed, and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10K rpm. The supernatant was transferred to an injection vial and analyzed by LC-MS. The LC-MS system consisted of an API4000 mass spectrometer with an ESI probe. Positive ion mode and full scan detection were used. HPLC separation was carried out on a Luna 3μ C8 (2), 2×30 mm column with a gradient from 90% A to 90% B in 10 minutes at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Buffer A was 1% formic acid in water and buffer B was 1% formic acid acetonitrile.

Determination of Cyclic AMP Stimulation\n\n\n \n \n \n1×105 CHO-K1 cells expressing the human recombinant GIP receptor or RIN-5F insulinoma cells were seeded overnight into 24-well cell culture plates (Corning Incorporate, Corning, N.Y., USA). For the assay, the cells were preincubated in 500 μl of Hanks balanced salt solution (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA) with 0.55 mM IBMX (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA) adjusted to pH 7.3 for 10 minutes. GIP or its analogs was then added at a concentration of 100 nM. Following a 30-minute incubation at 37° C., the plates were placed on ice and 500 μl of ice-cold absolute ethanol was added to stop the reaction. The contents of the wells were collected, spun at 2,700 g for 20 minutes at 4° C. to remove cellular debris. The cAMP levels in the supernatants were determined by radioimmunoassay (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass., USA).\n\n\n \nAdministration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptides of this invention can be provided in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of such salts include, but are not limited to, those formed with organic acids (e.g., acetic, lactic, maleic, citric, malic, ascorbic, succinic, benzoic, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, or pamoic acid), inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid), and polymeric acids (e.g., tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose, polylactic, polyglycolic, or copolymers of polylactic-glycolic acids). A typical method of making a salt of a peptide of the present invention is well known in the art and can be accomplished by standard methods of salt exchange. Accordingly, the TFA salt of a peptide of the present invention (the TFA salt results from the purification of the peptide by using preparative HPLC, eluting with TFA containing buffer solutions) can be converted into another salt, such as an acetate salt by dissolving the peptide in a small amount of 0.25 N acetic acid aqueous solution. The resulting solution is applied to a semi-prep HPLC column (Zorbax, 300 SB, C-8). The column is eluted with (1) 0.1N ammonium acetate aqueous solution for 0.5 hrs, (2) 0.25N acetic acid aqueous solution for 0.5 hrs, and (3) a linear gradient (20% to 100% of solution B over 30 minutes) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min (solution A is 0.25N acetic acid aqueous solution; solution B is 0.25N acetic acid in acetonitrile/water, 80:20). The fractions containing the peptide are collected and lyophilized to dryness.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be varied; however, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment. In general, an effective dosage for the activities of this invention is in the range of 1×10\n−7 \nto 200 mg/kg/day, preferably 1×10\n4 \nto 100 mg/kg/day, which can be administered as a single dose or divided into multiple doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention can be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous injection, or implant), nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical routes of administration, and can be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to provide dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than such inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include, without limitation, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, elixirs, and the like, containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Besides such inert diluents, compositions can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations according to this invention for parenteral administration include, without limitation, sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, and the like. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain, in addition to the active substance, excipients such as coca butter or a suppository wax.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, a compound of this invention can be administered in a sustained release composition such as those described in the following patents and patent applications.

No. 11/507,081 filed Aug. 17, 2006, now abandoned, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nINCORPORATION BY REFERENCE OF MATERIAL SUBMITTED BY EFS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe sequence listing in the present application was submitted by EFS entitled “0601US-UTL2_SeqListing_ST25.txt”, 442 kb in size, with date Jun. 29, 2010, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to peptide chemistry and pharmaceuticals, and more particularly to novel gastric inhibitory peptide (“GIP”) analog and GIP-containing hybrid polypeptides with selectable properties. It further relates to the use of these and other GIP compounds either alone or in adjunct with other compounds such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (“GLP1”), exendin-4, or amylin polypeptides, to treat metabolic disorders and conditions.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIncretin peptides are hormones and peptide mimetics that cause an increase in the amount of insulin released when glucose levels are normal or particularly when they are elevated. These incretin peptides have other actions beyond the initial incretin action defined by insulin secretion. For instance, they may also have actions to reduce glucagon production and delay gastric emptying. In addition, they may have actions to improve insulin sensitivity, and they may increase islet cell neogenesis—the formation of new islets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concept of the incretin effect developed from the observation that insulin responses to oral glucose exceeded those measured after intravenous administration of equivalent amounts of glucose. It was concluded that gut-derived factors, or incretins, influenced postprandial insulin release. Nutrient entry into the stomach and proximal gastrointestinal tract causes release of incretin hormones, which then stimulate insulin secretion. This insulinotropism, or ability to stimulate insulin secretion, can be quantified by comparing insulin or C-peptide responses to oral vs. intravenous glucose loads. In this way, it has been shown that the incretin effect is responsible for about 50% to 70% of the insulin response to oral glucose in healthy individuals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough many postprandial hormones have incretin-like activity, predominant incretin peptides include glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, also known as gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and exendin peptides (which are non-endogenous incretin mimetics). GIP and GLP-1 both belong to the glucagon peptide superfamily and thus share amino acid sequence homology. GIP and GLP-1 are secreted by specialized cells in the gastrointestinal tract and have receptors located on islet cells as well as other tissues. As incretins, both are secreted from the intestine in response to ingestion of nutrients, which results in enhanced insulin secretion. The insulinotropic effect of GIP and GLP-1 is dependent on elevations in ambient glucose. Both are rapidly inactivated by the ubiquitous enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNative human GIP is a single 42-amino acid peptide synthesized in and secreted by specialized enteroendocrine K-cells. These cells are concentrated primarily in the duodenum and proximal jejunum, although they also can be found throughout the intestine. The main stimulant for GIP secretion is ingestion of carbohydrate- and lipid-rich meals. Following ingestion, circulating plasma GIP levels increase 10- to 20-fold. The half-life of intact GIP is estimated to be approximately 7.3 minutes in healthy subjects and 5.2 minutes in diabetic subjects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe physiologic effects of GIP have been elucidated using GIP receptor antagonists, GIP peptide antagonists, and GIP receptor knockout mice, in addition to GIP infusion protocols. Blocking GIP binding to its receptor results in attenuated glucose-dependent insulin secretion following oral glucose load in rats and mice. Similarly, administration of GIP antagonists or GIP antisera markedly reduces the postprandial insulin release in rats. GIP receptor knockout mice demonstrate normal fasting glucose levels but mild glucose intolerance following oral glucose loads. Interestingly, they also exhibit resistance to diet-induced obesity following months of high-fat feeding. Additionally, in the leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse, the GIP receptor knockout genotype appears to decrease the extent of obesity that develops.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGIP infusion has consistently demonstrated stimulation of insulin secretion in isolated rat islets, isolated perfused rat pancreas, dogs, and humans. During stepwise euglycemic, mild hyperglycemic (54 mg/dL above basal), and moderate hyperglycemic (143 mg/dL above basal) clamps, it has been demonstrated that GIP infusion results in insulin secretion only in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that GIP is not glucagonotropic in normal humans during either euglycemic or hyperglycemic conditions. Thus, the effect of endogenously released GIP appears to be an important mechanism of postprandial insulin secretion and does not appear to play a role in the fasting state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGIP has many non-incretin effects as well. Unlike other insulin secretagogues, GIP stimulates beta-cell proliferation and cell survival in INS-1 islet cell-line studies. Furthermore, animal studies have suggested a role for GIP in lipid metabolism by stimulating lipoprotein lipase activity, inducing fatty acid incorporation into adipose tissue and stimulating fatty acid synthesis. However, in humans, there is no clear evidence for an effect of GIP on lipid metabolism. GIP also appears to stimulate glucagon secretion from the isolated perfused rat pancreas, although human studies have not demonstrated any significant influence on glucagon secretion. Furthermore, unlike GLP-1, GIP appears to act by accelerating emptying of the stomach rather than by inhibiting gastrointestinal motility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GIP-receptor, a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family has a high specificity for GIP and does not bind other peptides of the glucagon family. For this reason, GLP-1/GIP chimeric peptides show nearly no affinity for the GIP-receptor. From such studies it has been concluded that the GIP(1-30) sequence of the GIP(1-42) is sufficient for recognizing the receptor. GIP(6-30)-amide contains the high affinity binding region of GIP(1-42) but exhibits antagonist activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite potent glucoregulatory actions through glucose-dependant stimulation of insulin secretion, the insulinotropic effect of GIP is significantly reduced in diabetic subjects compared to normal individuals (16-18). Consequently, clinical use of GIP has not been significantly advanced. Further, there remains a need to develop additional diabetic treatment modalities as well as treatments for metabolic diseases, conditions, and disorders. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide GIP analog and GIP-containing hybrid polypeptides and methods for their use to treat or prevent metabolic diseases, conditions, and disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe issued patents, applications, and references that are cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference and as though fully set forth herein.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nProvided are methods for treating or preventing metabolic diseases and disorders including those which can be alleviated by control of plasma glucose levels, insulin levels, and/or insulin secretion, such as diabetes and diabetes-related conditions, and conditions and disorders including, but not limited to, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, eating disorders, insulin-resistance, obesity, and diabetes mellitus of any kind, including \ntype\n 1, \ntype\n 2, and gestational diabetes. The methods comprise administering a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a GIP or GIP analog, fragment or derivative thereof, or a GIP hybrid or derivatives thereof as described herein, alone (monotherapy) or in combination with another agent or therapy (adjunct therapy), for example a glucose lowering agent (e.g., antidiabetic) or agents or methods that inhibit or reduce gastric emptying (examples of such agents are presented herein), to a subject in need thereof. By providing a GIP bioactivity as part of a GIP hybrid having one or more other hormonal bio-activities, e.g., pramlintide, exendin, BNP, compounds with one or more selectable functions will have the additional benefit of a property of a GIP bio-activity such as lowering plasma glucose, increasing insulin secretion, without the side effects associated with other incretin molecules. For example, a GIP-sCT hybrid compound of the invention can have a selectable property of a salmon calcitonin, such as decreasing bone loss and bone resorption or reducing cartilage turnover (chondroprotection), and a property of a GIP, such as plasma glucose lowering (concomitant with an anti-catabolic aspect as described herein) and/or inhibiting bone resorption and maintaining or increasing bone density. A GIP hybrid with such selectable properties can enhance treatment of osteoporosis or conditions of high cartilage turnover, particularly in those who can also benefit from glycemic control, such as subjects with diabetes or under going critical care.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment are provided novel GIP analogs having one or more enhanced properties. The GIP analogs have increased resistance to DPP-IV or to other proteases, such as those found in human plasma and/or on kidney brush border membranes, which increases in vivo half-life. In a further embodiment the GIP analogs have at least one substitution, modification, insertion or deletion in amino acids 4-30. These changes can provide enhanced properties such as increased GIP receptor binding, increased receptor selectivity, and/or increased resistance to degradation by chemical and/or proteolytic means. In another embodiment the GIP analog further has least 50% sequence identity to native GIP(1-30), native GIP(1-14), native GIP(19-30) or native GIP(1-42) over the entire length of each molecule, and at least one biological property of a GIP. In certain embodiments, novel GIP analog polypeptides include unnatural amino acids, such as a D amino acid. In a further embodiment a GIP analog or hybrid is modified to have reduced renal clearance, such as by fatty acyl derivatization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment are provided novel GIP-containing hybrid polypeptides with selectable properties. The hybrid polypeptides exhibit at least one hormonal activity.

In one embodiment, the subject is an obese or overweight subject. While “obesity” is generally defined as a body mass index over 30, for purposes of this disclosure, any subject, including those with a body mass index of less than 30, who needs or wishes to reduce body weight is included in the scope of “obese.” Subjects who are insulin resistant, glucose intolerant, or have any form of diabetes mellitus (e.g., \n \ntype\n \n 1, 2 or gestational diabetes) can benefit from this method. Compounds of the invention can also be useful in treating or preventing other conditions associated with obesity including stroke, cancer (e.g., endometrial, breast, prostate, and colon cancer), gallbladder disease, sleep apnea, reduced fertility, and osteoarthritis, (see Lyznicki et al, \nAm. Fam. Phys. \n63:2185, 2001). Where conditions are associated with elevated glucose or hyperglycemia, the method comprises administering a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a GIP compound, alone or in combination with a glucose lowering agent (e.g., antidiabetic) or agent or method that inhibits or reduces gastric emptying.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another aspect, GIP compounds, particularly GIP hybrids of the invention, can be used in methods of reducing food intake, reducing appetite, inducing satiety, reducing nutrient availability, reducing caloric efficiency, causing weight loss, affecting body composition, altering body energy content or energy expenditure, and improving lipid profile (including reducing LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and/or changing HDL cholesterol levels) wherein the methods comprise administering to a subject an effective amount of a GIP compound, particularly a GIP hybrid compound, of the invention. In one embodiment, the methods of the invention are used to treat or prevent conditions or disorders which can be alleviated by reducing nutrient availability in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a GIP compound of the invention. Conditions and disorders include, but are not limited to, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, eating disorders, insulin-resistance, obesity, and diabetes mellitus of any kind, including \ntype\n 1, \ntype\n 2, and gestational diabetes, diabetes complications (neuropathy (based on, e.g., neurotrophic actions of exendin-4), neuropathic pain (based on, e.g., amylin action), retinopathy, nephropathy, conditions of insufficient pancreatic beta cell mass (based on, e.g., islet neogenesis actions of exendin-4 and GLP-1). Where conditions are associated with elevated glucose or hyperglycemia, the method comprises administering a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a GIP compound, alone or in combination with a glucose lowering agent (e.g., antidiabetic) or agent or method that inhibits or reduces gastric emptying.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the amelioration of hypertension in subjects in need thereof as a result of reduced food intake, weight loss, and/or treating obesity, compounds of the invention may be used to treat or prevent hypotension and conditions associated therewith.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect GIP analogs and hybrids are useful for decreasing or inhibiting bone resorption and maintaining or increasing bone density. When combined with an appropriate second hormonal module, GIP hybrids are useful to treat these conditions as well as decreasing plasma calcium, and/or inducing an analgesic effect, particularly to treat bone disorders such as osteopenia and osteoporosis, and treating painful neuropathy. In one embodiment such hybrids contain an exendin, GLP1, amylin and/or sCT portion. For example, a GIP-sCT or GIP-amylin/sCT hybrid compound of the invention can have a selectable property of a salmon calcitonin or amylin/sCT/Amylin chimera, such as decreasing bone loss and bone resorption or reducing cartilage turnover (chondroprotection), and a property of a GIP, such as plasma glucose lowering (concomitant with an anabolic aspect as described herein) and/or inhibiting bone resorption and maintaining or increasing bone density. A GIP hybrid with such selectable properties can enhance treatment of osteoporosis or conditions of high cartilage turnover, particularly in those who can also benefit from glycemic control, such as subjects with diabetes or under going critical care.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGIP compounds, particularly GIP analogs, extended half-life GIP hybrids (e.g. DPP-IV cleavage resistant (such as a D-Ala2, N-Acetyl or N-pyroglutamyl analogs) optionally further comprising a peptidic enhancer such as a heterologous C-terminal tail, and GIP hybrids comprising other hormone modules known to provide beneficial cardiovascular effects, are useful to treat cardiovascular disease and related conditions. As demonstrated herein GIP compounds increase cardiac contractility (dp/dt), decrease blood pressure (for example by acute vasodilatation), decrease systolic pressure, decrease diastolic pressure, and can provide a direct beneficial action on cardiac cells. GIP compounds also improve cardiac function via metabolic actions, e.g. glucose lowering, insulin secretion, beta cell proliferation. However, by also providing direct effects on cardiovascular system, the GIP compounds are surprisingly even more beneficial.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention can also be useful in the treatment or prevention of any number of gastrointestinal disorders that are associated with excess gastric secretion, excess intestinal electrolytes and water secretion as well as decreased absorption, e.g., infectious (e.g., viral or bacterial) diarrhea, inflammatory diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, or the diarrhea which typically occurs following surgical procedure, e.g., ileostomy (see e.g., Harrison's principles of Internal Medicine, McGraw Hill Inc., New York, 12th ed.). Examples of infectious diarrhea include, without limitation, acute viral diarrhea, acute bacterial diarrhea (e.g., \nsalmonella, campylobacter\n, and \nclostridium\n) or diarrhea due to protozoal infections, or travelers' diarrhea (e.g., Norwalk virus or rotavirus). Examples of inflammatory diarrhea include, without limitation, malabsorption syndrome, tropical spue, chronic pancreatitis, Crohn's disease, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome. GIP and GIP compounds of the invention can be used to treat or prevent an emergency or life-threatening situation involving a gastrointestinal disorder, e.g., after surgery or due to cholera. Furthermore, the compounds can be used to treat intestinal dysfunction in patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), especially during cachexia. The compounds may also be useful for inhibiting small intestinal fluid and electrolyte secretion, and augmenting nutrient transport, as well as increasing cell proliferation in the gastrointestinal tract, regulating lipolysis in, e.g., adipose tissue and regulating blood flow in a mammal. GIP compounds of the invention may also be useful for treating or preventing the above conditions by their gastrointestinal protective activity (e.g., inhibition of gastric secretion). Accordingly, a GIP compound of the invention may be used to treat gastrointestinal or mucosal damage. Exemplary types of damage include, but are not limited to, inflammatory bowel disease, bowel atrophy, conditions characterized by loss of bowel mucosa or bowel mucosal function, and other conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, including those which may be brought about by exposure to cytotoxic agents, radiation, toxicity, infection and/or injury. Moreover, these compounds of the invention may be combined with analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, growth hormone, heparin, or any other therapies that may be used to treat inflammatory bowel disease or other conditions listed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment GIP compounds can be useful for treating or preventing gastritis, pancreatitis, Barrett's esophagus, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and conditions associated therewith. Such conditions can include, but are not limited to, heartburn, heartburn accompanied by regurgitation of gastric/intestinal contents into the mouth or the lungs, difficulty in swallowing, coughing, intermittent wheezing and vocal cord inflammation (conditions associated with GERD), esophageal erosion, esophageal ulcer, esophageal stricture, Barrett's metaplasia (replacement of normal esophageal epithelium with abnormal epithelium), and pulmonary aspiration. GIP compounds can have anti-secretory properties, such as inhibition of gastric acids, inhibition of bile acids, and inhibition of pancreatic enzymes. Moreover, GIP compounds can also have gastroprotective effects. Accordingly, GIP compounds of the invention may be particularly useful in the treatment or prevention of gastritis, pancreatitis, Barrett's esophagus, and/or GERD and related or associated conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of at least one novel GIP analog or GIP hybrid polypeptide of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, preservatives, solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvants and/or carriers useful in the delivery of the GIP compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese and other aspects of the invention will be more clearly understood with reference to the following embodiments and detailed description.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 1A and 1B\n present views of the exendin-4 Trp-cage. \nFIG. 1A\n shows an NMR-derived ensemble structure of exendin-4 in 30% aqueous trifluoroethanol.

Consequently, these incretin hormones have attracted great interest as potential anti-diabetic agents with reduced risk for hypoglycemia. Whereas GLP-1, GLP-1 analogs and mimetics have been shown to be efficacious in controlling glucose levels in \ntype\n 2 diabetic patients, the insulinotropic effect of GIP is reportedly significantly reduced in diabetic subjects, compared to normal individuals (16-18). The preservation of insulinotropic action of GLP-1 but not of GIP in the same diabetic subjects suggests that GIP signal transduction is impaired in \ntype\n 2 diabetes. Reduced GIP receptor expression in pancreatic beta cells has been proposed to contribute to overall reduced incretin effects in diabetic subjects (19). Despite the reduced insulinotropic response to GIP in subjects with \ntype\n 2 diabetes, it is possible that administration of elevated pharmacological doses of GIP or analogues could have therapeutic utility. Of note, GIP lacks the gastrointestinal effects of GLP-1 (20) that has limited the latter peptide's therapeutic window, thus permitting the possibility of higher dosing regimens (21).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of the major hurdles in the therapeutic development of these incretin hormones is their short duration of action due to enzymatic degradation in vivo. The enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) plays a key role in the N-terminal cleavage of the peptides in vivo, and more recently, neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) has also be implicated in their degradation (22-26). Several studies have reported greater in vivo efficacy of DPP-IV resistant GIP analogues in rodent diabetic models (27-28).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProvided herein are novel GIP analogs and GIP-containing hybrid polypeptides, or derivatives thereof, which have enhanced or novel properties, including enhanced DPP-IV resistance, dual hormonal activity, and improved plasma half-life. Also provided are methods for treating or preventing metabolic diseases and disorders including those which can be alleviated by control of plasma glucose levels, insulin levels, and/or insulin secretion, such as diabetes and diabetes-related conditions, and conditions and disorders including, but not limited to, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, eating disorders, insulin-resistance, obesity, and diabetes mellitus of any kind, including \ntype\n 1, \ntype\n 2, and gestational diabetes. The methods comprise administering a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a GIP or GIP analog, fragment or derivative thereof or a novel GIP analog or GIP hybrid or derivatives thereof as described herein, alone (monotherapy) or in combination with another agent or therapy (adjunct therapy), for example a glucose lowering agent (e.g., antidiabetic) or agents or methods that inhibit or reduce gastric emptying (examples of such agents are presented herein), to a subject in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to novel GIP analogs and derivatives, the present invention relates to novel, GIP-containing selectable hybrid polypeptides useful as agents for the treatment and prevention of metabolic diseases and disorders which can be alleviated by control of plasma glucose levels, insulin levels, and/or insulin secretion, such as diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. Such conditions and disorders include, but are not limited to, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, eating disorders, insulin-resistance, obesity, and diabetes mellitus of any kind, including \ntype\n 1, \ntype\n 2, and gestational diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention involves the modular assembly of physiologically, metabolically, and/or pharmacokinetically active peptidic modules that may be selectable based on “bio-activities”, e.g., therapeutic efficacy, scope of function, duration of action, physicochemical properties, and/or other pharmacokinetic properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout intending to be limited by theory, the present invention relates at least in part to a “toolbox” approach, wherein bio-active peptide hormone modules are linked in binary, tertiary or higher order combinations to create novel, efficacious therapeutic agents with selectable properties. The “bio-active peptide hormone modules” may be peptide hormones, peptide fragments with hormonal activity, or structural motifs of peptide hormones that impart chemical, metabolic, and/or other pharmacokinetic stability. The peptide hormones can include native peptide hormones, as well as peptide hormone analogs and derivatives, as known in the art and described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, it has been found that the combination of certain physicochemical characteristics of two or more peptide hormones into a single modality can facilitate intervention at several points in a dysfunctional metabolic circuit. As such, in one aspect of the invention, rationally-designed hybrid polypeptides are provided that integrate selectable bio-activities into a single polypeptide agent. In one embodiment, the selectable hybrid polypeptides of the invention may involve the use of chemically stable linkers to covalently attach the bio-active modules. In another embodiment, the selectable hybrid polypeptides of the invention may involve the use of cleavable linkers, which themselves may be or form part of a bio-active module.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, without intending to be limited by theory, design of the hybrid polypeptides of the present invention may generally involve: (1) the identification, selection and pairing of bio-active peptide hormone modules for desired efficacy and therapeutic use, and (2) the covalent linking of the bio-active modules (e.g. native peptide hormones, peptide hormone analogs or derivatives with hormonal activity, peptide hormone fragments with hormonal activity, stabilizing motifs, etc.) either directly or via a linker without loss of bio-activity of the component modules. In certain embodiments, module selection criteria may include, but not be limited to: (a) desired in vivo efficacy for desired therapeutic or prophylactic indication, such as an additive or a synergistic effect; (b) optional synergism or dual action of the linked modules for multiple therapeutic or prophylactic indications; and/or (c) a desired chemical stability, conformational stability, metabolic stability, bioavailability, organ/tissue targeting, receptor interaction, protease inhibition, plasma protein binding, and/or other pharmacokinetic characteristic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGIP, GIP Analogs and Novel GIP Analogs.

Certain exemplary native peptides, peptide analogs and derivatives are described herein, however it should be recognized that any known GIP peptide that exhibits hormonal activity known in the art may be used either as a component of a novel GIP analog or hybrid herein or in the novel adjunct therapies disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the GIP peptide analogs and derivatives have at least one hormonal activity of a native GIP peptide. In certain embodiments, the GIP peptide analogs are agonists of a receptor that a native GIP peptide is capable of specifically binding. Exemplary GIP peptide analogs and derivatives include those described in the references herein, which are hereby incorporated by reference. While the present application describes GIP polypeptide compounds as GIP analogs, novel GIP analogs, and novel GIP hybrids for use in the methods and therapies described herein, it is further intended that any suitable GIP agonist can be administered in place of a GIP compound, such agonists include agonist antibodies and antibody fragments and derivatives, and small molecule GIP receptor agonists. Accordingly, when a GIP compound or polypeptide is indicated for use in a particular therapeutic method, in another embodiment it is intended that a GIP agonist be used, particularly an agonist antibody or fragment or derivative thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn serum, GIP is degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV).

Amino acid alterations include modifications of the first 3 or 4 residues of GIP and/or the bond between \n \nresidues\n \n 2 and 3, which is cleaved by DPP-IV. Modifications and substitutions include N-terminal modifications, L-amino acids, D-amino acids, proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids. Proteinogenic amino acids are defined as natural protein-derived alpha-amino acids. Non-proteinogenic amino acids are defined as all other amino acids, which are not building blocks of common natural proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf further interest are novel GIP analogs having one or more modifications as described herein and that exhibit at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95% or at least 98% sequence identity to a native GIP(1-30), native GIP(1-26), native GIP(1-14), native GIP(1-39), native GIP(19-30), native GIP(19-26), native GIP(19-39), native GIP(19-42) or native GIP(1-42) over the entire length of the GIP portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf particular interest are those GIP compounds comprising at least 11, 12, 13, 14 or . . . 15 amino acid residues from the N-terminal end of a GIP, e.g., GIP(1-42), having a least one amino acid substitution or modification at position 1-3 and being biologically active. This includes modification by fatty acid addition at an epsilon amino group of at least one lysine residue, either present in or introduced into the molecule. Particular modifications include Tyr1-glucitol of a GIP, for example Tyr1-Glucitol GIP(1-42) or Tyr1-glucitol GIP(1-30). GIP analogs of interest include those comprising a substitution or modification selected from the group comprising D-amino acid substitutions in 1, 2 and/or 3 positions and/or N-terminal glycation, alkylation, acetylation or acylation, or other N-terminal modifications described herein. Of further interest are analogs wherein the amino acid in the 2 or 3 position is substituted by lysine, serine, 4-amino butyric amino acid, Aib, D-alanine, Sarcosine or proline. Further exemplary substitutions in the 1, 2, or 3 position, and more particularly in the 2 position of GIP are dAla, Val, dnorVal, dSer, Abu, dAbu, homo-Ser, d-homoSer, dPro, cyclopropyl Ala, d-cyclopropyl Ala, cycloHexyl Ala, d-cyclohexyl Ala, A(NMe), Aib, and cyclpropGly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a GIP analog or hybrid has a serine at \nposition\n 2 in order to reduce DPP-IV cleavage, while retaining receptor binding and activation. Thus, specifically contemplated herein is a Ser2 analog of each of the GIP analogs and hybrids disclosed herein. By way of example, the analog of 0601GIP3794 having a serine substitution for the dAla at \nposition\n 2 is specifically contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther exemplary GIP analog compounds have a modification at the N-terminus, retaining their GIP Receptor binding, in which the N-terminus modification includes H, isocap, isoBuOCO, octylglycine, Y(NMe) and succinoyl. Further exemplary GIP compounds include those with fatty acid modifications or combinations of modifications as described herein, while retaining their GIP Receptor binding and receptor activation activity, For example, an N-terminus modification can be combined with a substitution or modification at \n \npositions\n \n 1, 2 or 3 (which imparts resistance to DPP-IV as described herein) or with a fatty acyl derivative modification (which can reduce renal clearance). In another example, a substitution or modification at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 1, 2 or 3 is combined with a fatty acyl derivative. For example an N-terminus octylglycine is combined with a d-amino acid at 1, 2, or, particularly a D-Ala at \nposition\n 2. In one embodiment a fatty acyl substitution is a octylglycine for lysine at \nposition\n 16 or methionine at \nposition\n 14. In other embodiments the methionine at \nposition\n 14 is deleted, and which, for example, can be further combined with a octylglycine for lysine at \n \nposition\n \n 16 or 30. Another substitution is acylation of the lysine at \n \nposition\n \n 16 or 30, for example with an octyl or palmitoyl group. Other embodiments include a fatty acyl substitution where an octylglycine is substituted for lysine at \n \nposition\n \n 16 or 30 or for methionine at \nposition\n 14. To eliminate or reduce oxidation, the methionine at \nposition\n 14 is deleted or substituted, for example with a leucine or other small hydrophobic amino acid, and/or the tryptophan at \nposition\n 25 is deleted or substituted, for example with a phenylalanine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment are analogs having at least one or two amino acid deletions in amino acids 1-30 of GIP, those having one or two deletions in \namino acids\n 4 to 30, and those having one or more deletions in amino acids 4-15, and those having one amino acid deletion in amino acids 1-30, 4-30 or 4-15 of a GIP. Of course it is intended that such a modification can be combined with at least one other change as described herein, such as a change that imparts DPP-IV resistance, reduces or eliminates oxidation, reduces renal clearance, improves receptor binding, or improves receptor activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther exemplary substitutions are those derived from GIP of other (non-human) species, for example the \nmethionine\n 14 replaced by leucine, the D at \n \nposition\n \n 9 or 21 replaced by E, the \nhistidine\n 18 replaced by alanine, arginine or lysine, the lysine at \nposition\n 30 replaced by alanine, arginine or histidine, the alanine at \nposition\n 13 replaced by leucine, and the alanine at \nposition\n 28 replaced by serine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the GIP analogs have one or more of the following modifications: dAla2 to Abu, Ala, Gly, or Ser; Met14 to Leu; His18 to Ala, Arg, or Lys; Asp21 to Glu; Lys30 to Arg or His; and/or an N-terminus as Gly(Oct).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther exemplary GIP modifications and combinations are shown in the following compounds:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO:\n\n\n \nSequence\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nYAEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n433\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIAQQEFVNWLLAQR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n434\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIRQQEFVNWLLAQR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n435\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIKQQEFVNWLLAQR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n436\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIAQQEFVNWLLAQH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n437\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIRQQEFVNWLLAQH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n438\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIKQQEFVNWLLAQH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n439\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQVKFVNWLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n440\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIRQQEFVNWLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n441\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIKQQEFVNWLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n442\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIAQQEFVNWLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n443\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIRQQEFVNWLLAQH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n444\n\n\nYaEGTFTADYSKALDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n445\n\n\nYaEGTFTSDYSKALDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n446\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSKAMDKIRQQEFVNWLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n447\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALEKIRQQKFVNWLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n448\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIRQQDFVEWLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n449\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIRQQEFVNWLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n450\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIRQQEFVNWLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n451\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQLFIEWLKNGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n452\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIRQQEFVNWLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n453\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNFLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nYAEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNFLLAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, it is intended that the modifications described herein can be combined with at least one other change as described herein, such as a change that imparts DPP-IV resistance, reduces or eliminates oxidation, reduces renal clearance, improves receptor binding, or improves receptor activation.

As discussed herein component peptide hormones useful in the present invention with a GIP or a novel GIP analog include amylin family peptide hormones including amylin, adrenomedullin (“ADM”), calcitonin (“CT”), calcitonin gene related peptide (“CGRP”), intermedin (also known as “AFP-6”) and related peptides. Native amylin family peptide hormones are known in art, as are functional peptide analogs and derivatives. Certain exemplary native peptides, peptide analogs and derivatives are described herein, however it should be recognized that any known amylin family peptides that exhibit hormonal activity known in the art may be used in conjunction with the present invention. Any amylin analog or derivative known in the art may be used in conjunction with the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother family of peptide hormones implicated in metabolic diseases and disorders is the amylin family of peptide hormones, including amylin, calcitonin, calcitonin gene related peptide, adrenomedullin, and intermedin (also known as “AFP-6”). Amylin is a 37-amino acid peptide hormone. It was isolated, purified and chemically characterized as the major component of amyloid deposits in the islets of pancreases of \nhuman Type\n 2 diabetics (Cooper et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 84:8628-8632 (1987)). The amylin molecule has two post-translational modifications: the C-terminus is amidated, and the cysteines in \n \npositions\n \n 2 and 7 are cross-linked to form an N-terminal loop. The sequence of the open reading frame of the human amylin gene shows the presence of the Lys-Arg dibasic amino acid proteolytic cleavage signal, prior to the N-terminal codon for Lys, and the Gly prior to the Lys-Arg proteolytic signal at the N-terminal position, a typical sequence for amidation by protein amidating enzyme, PAM (Cooper et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 1014:247-258 (1989)). By “adrenomedullin” or “ADM” is meant the human peptide hormone and species variants thereof. More particularly, ADM is generated from a 185 amino acid preprohormone through consecutive enzymatic cleavage and amidation. This process culminates in the liberation of a 52 amino acid bioactive peptide. By “calcitonin” or “CT” is meant the human peptide hormone and species variants thereof, including salmon calcitonin (“sCT”). More particularly, CT is a 32 amino acid peptide cleaved from a larger prohormone. It contains a single disulfide bond, which causes the amino terminus to assume the shape of a ring. Alternative splicing of the calcitonin pre-mRNA can yield a mRNA encoding calcitonin gene-related peptide; that peptide appears to function in the nervous and vascular systems. The calcitonin receptor has been cloned and shown to be a member of the seven-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor family. By “calcitonin gene related peptide” or “CGRP” is meant the human peptide hormone and species variants thereof, in any physiological form. By “intermedin” or “AFP-6” is meant the human peptide hormone and species variants thereof, in any physiological form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmylin is believed to regulate gastric emptying, and suppress glucagon secretion and food intake, thus regulating the rate of glucose appearance in the circulation. It appears to complement the actions of insulin, which regulates the rate of glucose disappearance from the circulation and its uptake by peripheral tissues. These actions are supported by experimental findings in rodents and humans, which indicate that amylin complements the effects of insulin in postprandial glucose control by at least three independent mechanisms, all of which affect the rate of glucose appearance. First, amylin suppresses postprandial glucagon secretion. Compared to healthy adults, patients with \ntype\n 1 diabetes have no circulating amylin and patients with \ntype\n 2 diabetes have diminished postprandial amylin concentrations. Furthermore, infusion of an amylin specific monoclonal antibody, which bound circulating amylin, again resulted in greatly elevated glucagon concentrations relative to controls. Both of these results point to a physiological role of endogenous amylin in the regulation of postprandial glucagon secretion. Second, amylin slows gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying. Finally, intrahypothalamic injections of rat amylin were shown to reduce feeding in rats and alter neurotransmitter metabolism in the hypothalamus. In certain studies, food intake was significantly reduced for up to eight hours following the intrahypothalamic injection of rat amylin and rat CGRP. In human trials, an amylin analog, pramlintide, has been shown to reduce weight or weight gain. Amylin may be beneficial in treating metabolic conditions such as diabetes and obesity. Amylin may also be used to treat pain, bone disorders, gastritis, to modulate lipids, in particular triglycerides, or to affect body composition such as the preferential loss of fat and sparing of lean tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hormone calcitonin (CT) was named for its secretion in response to induced hypercalcemia and its rapid hypocalcemic effect. It is produced in and secreted from neuroendocrine cells in the thyroid that have since been termed C cells. The best-studied action of CT(1-32) is its effect on the osteoclast. In vitro effects of CT include the rapid loss of ruffled borders and decreased release of lysosomal enzymes. Ultimately, the inhibition of osteoclast functions by CT results in a decrease in bone resorption. However, neither a chronic reduction of serum CT in the case of thyroidectomy nor the increased serum CT found in medullary thyroid cancer appears to be associated with changes in serum calcium or bone mass. It is thus most likely that a major function of CT(1-32) is to combat acute hypercalcemia in emergency situations and/or protect the skeleton during periods of “calcium stress” such as growth, pregnancy, and lactation. (Reviewed in Becker, JCEM, 89(4): 1512-1525 (2004) and Sexton, Current Medicinal Chemistry 6: 1067-1093 (1999)). Consistent with this is recent data from the calcitonin gene knockout mouse, which removes both the calcitonin and the CGRP-I peptides, that revealed that the mouse had normal levels of basal calcium-related values, but an increased calcemic response (Kurihara H, et al., Hypertens Res. 2003 February; 26 Suppl: S105-8).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCT has an effect on plasma calcium levels and inhibits osteoclast function and is widely used for the treatment of osteoporosis. Therapeutically, salmon CT (sCT) appears to increase bone density and decrease fracture rates with minimal adverse effects. CT has also been successfully used over the past 25 years as a therapy for Paget's disease of bone, which is a chronic skeletal disorder that may result in enlarged or deformed bones in one or more regions of the skeleton. CT is also widely used for its analgesic effect on bone pain experienced during osteoporosis, although the mechanism for this effect is not clearly understood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide whose receptors are widely distributed in the body, including the nervous system and the cardiovascular system. This peptide seems to modulate sensory neurotransmission and is one of the most potent endogenous vasodilatory peptide discovered to date. Reported biological effects for CGRP include: modulation of substance P in inflammation, nicotinic receptor activity at the neuromuscular junction, stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion, a reduction of gastric acid secretion, peripheral vasodilation, cardiac acceleration, neuro-modulation, regulation of calcium metabolism, osteogenic stimulation, insulin secretion, an increase in body temperature and a decrease in food intake. (Wimalawansa, Amylin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, calcitonin and ADM: a peptide superfamily. Crit. Rev Neurobiol. 1997; 11(2-3):167-239). An important role of CGRP is to control blood flow to various organs by its potent vasodilatory actions, as evidenced by a decrease of mean arterial pressure following intravenous administration of α-CGRP. The vasodilatory actions are also supported by recent analysis of homozygous knockout CGRP mice, which demonstrated elevated peripheral vascular resistance and high blood pressure caused by increased peripheral sympathetic activity (Kurihara H, et al., Targeted disruption of ADM and αCGRP genes reveals their distinct biological roles. Hypertens Res. 2003 February; 26 Suppl: S105-8). Thus, CGRP appears to elicit vasodilatory effects, hypotensive effects and an increase in heart rate among other actions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProlonged infusion of CGRP into patients with congestive cardiac failure has shown a sustained beneficial effect on hemodynamic functions without adverse effects, suggesting a use in heart failure. Other indications of CGRP use include renal failure, acute and chronic coronary artery ischemia, treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, other peripheral vascular disease such as Raynaud's phenomenon, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension. Preeclamptic toxemia of pregnancy and preterm labor are also potentially treatable. (Wimalawansa, 1997). Recent therapeutic uses include the use of CGRP antagonists for the treatment of migraine headaches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdrenomedullin (ADM) is almost ubiquitously expressed with many more tissues containing the peptide than not. A published review of ADM, (Hinson, J. P. et al., Endocrine Reviews (2000) 21(2): 138-167) details its effects on the cardiovascular system, cellular growth, the central nervous system and the endocrine system, with a range of biological actions including vasodilation, cell growth, regulation of hormone secretion, and natriuresis. Studies in rat, cat, sheep, and man confirm that intravenous infusion of ADM results in potent and sustained hypotension, and is comparable to that of CGRP. However, the hypotensive effect of ADM on mean arterial pressure in the anesthetized rat is not inhibited by the CGRP antagonist CGRP8-37 suggesting that this effect is not mediated via CGRP receptors. Acute or chronic administration of human ADM in rats, anesthetized, conscious or hypertensive, results in a significant decrease in total peripheral resistance accompanied by a fall in blood pressure, with a concomitant rise in heart rate, cardiac output and stroke volume.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nADM has also been proposed as an important factor in embryogenesis and differentiation and as an apoptosis survival factor for rat endothelial cells. This is supported by recent mouse ADM knockout studies, in which mice homozygous for loss of the ADM gene demonstrated defective vascular formation during embryogenesis and thus died mid-gestation. It was reported that ADM+/− heterozygous mice had high blood pressure along with susceptibility to tissue injury (Kurihara H, et al., Hypertens Res. 2003 February; 26 Suppl: S105-8).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nADM affects such endocrine organs as the pituitary, the adrenal gland, reproductive organs and the pancreas. The peptide appears to have a role in inhibiting ACTH release from the pituitary. In the adrenal gland, it appears to affect the secretory activity of the adrenal cortex in both rat and human and it increases adrenal blood flow, acting as a vasodilator in the adrenal vascular bed in intact rats. ADM has been shown to be present throughout the female reproductive tract and plasma levels are elevated in normal pregnancy. Studies in a rat model of preeclampsia show that ADM can reverse hypertension and decrease pup mortality when given to rats during late gestation. Because it did not have a similar effect in animals in early gestation or non-pregnant rats in the preeclampsia model, this suggests that ADM may play an important regulatory role in the utero-placental cardiovascular system. In the pancreas, ADM most likely plays an inhibitory role since it attenuated and delayed insulin response to an oral glucose challenge, resulting in initial elevated glucose levels. ADM can also affect renal function. A bolus administered peripherally can significantly lower mean arterial pressure and raise renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and urine flow. In some cases, there is also an increase in Na+ excretion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nADM also has other peripheral effects on bone and on the lung. For bone, studies have supported a role beyond the cardiovascular system and fluid homeostasis and have demonstrated that ADM acts on fetal and adult rodent osteoblasts to increase cell growth comparable to those of known osteoblast growth factors such as transforming growth factor-alpha. This is important clinically as one of the major challenges in osteoporosis research is to develop a therapy that increases bone mass via osteoblastic stimulation. In the lung, ADM not only causes pulmonary vasodilation, but also inhibits bronchoconstriction induced by histamine or acetylcholine. Recent studies using aerosolized ADM to treat pulmonary hypertension in a rat model indicate that inhalation treatment of this condition is effective, as evidenced by the fact that mean pulmonary arterial pressure and total pulmonary resistance were markedly lower in rats treated with ADM than in those given saline. This result was achieved without an alteration in systemic arterial pressure or heart rate (Nagaya N et al., Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol. 2003; 285:H2125-31).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn healthy volunteers, i.v. infusion of ADM has been shown to reduce arterial pressure and to stimulate heart rate, cardiac output, plasma levels of cAMP, prolactin, norepinephrine and rennin. In these patients, there was little or no increase in urine volume or sodium excretion observed. In patients with heart failure or chronic renal failure, i.v. ADM had similar effects to those seen in normal subjects, and also induced diuresis and natriuresis, depending on the dose administered (Nicholls, M G et al. Peptides. 2001; 22:1745-1752) Experimental ADM treatment has also been shown to be beneficial in arterial and pulmonary hypertension, septic shock and ischemia/reperfusion injury (Beltowski J., Pol J. Pharmacol. 2004; 56:5-27). Other indications for ADM treatment include: peripheral vascular disease, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypertension, preeclamptic toxemia of pregnancy and preterm labor, and osteoporosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression of AFP-6 (i.e., intermedin) is primarily in the pituitary and gastrointestinal tract. A specific receptor for AFP-6 has not been reported; however, binding studies indicate that AFP-6 binds to all the known receptors of the Amylin Family. AFP-6 has been shown to increase cAMP production in SK-N-MC and L6 cells expressing endogenous CGRP receptors and competes with labeled CGRP for binding to its receptors in these cells. In published in vivo studies, AFP-6 administration led to blood pressure reduction in both normal and spontaneously hypertensive rats, most likely via interactions with the CRLR/RAMP receptors. In vivo administration in mice led to a suppression of gastric emptying and food intake. (Roh et al. J Biol. Chem. 2004 Feb. 20; 279(8):7264-74.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been reported that the biological actions of amylin family peptide hormones are generally mediated via binding to two closely related type II G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the calcitonin receptor (CTR) and the calcitonin receptor like receptor (CRLR). Cloning and functional studies have shown that CGRP, ADM, and amylin interact with different combinations of CTR or the CRLR and the receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP). Many cells express multiple RAMPs. It is believed that co-expression of RAMPs and either the CTR or CRLR is required to generate functional receptors for calcitonin, CGRP, ADM, and amylin. The RAMP family comprises three members (RAMP1, -2, and -3), which share less then 30% sequence identity, but have a common topological organization. Co-expression of CRLR and RAMP1 leads to the formation of a receptor for CGRP. Co-expression of CRLR and RAMP2 leads to the formation of a receptor for ADM. Co-expression of CRLR and RAMP3 leads to the formation of a receptor for ADM and CGRP. Co-expression of hCTR2 and RAMP1 leads to the formation of a receptor for amylin and CGRP. Co-expression of hCTR2 and RAMP3 leads to the formation of a receptor for amylin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus a GIP hybrid comprising an amylin family hormone module can provide the functions and uses associated with the amylin family module, e.g. amylin, amylin/sCT/amylin, ADM, CGRP, as discussed, in addition to a GIP function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the amylin analogs and derivatives have at least one hormonal activity of native amylin.

CCKs, including hCCK (cholecystokinin) and species variants, and various analogs thereof are known in the art. Generally, CCK has a 33-amino acid sequence first identified in humans, and includes a 8-amino acid in vivo C-terminal fragment (“CCK-8”) that has been reportedly demonstrated in pig, rat, chicken, chinchilla, dog and humans. Other species variants include a 39-amino acid sequence found in pig, dog and guinea pig, and a 58-amino acid found in cat, dog and humans, and a 47-amino acid sequences homologous to both CCK and gastrin. The C-terminal tyrosine-sulfated octapeptide sequence (CCK-8) is relatively conserved across species, and may be the minimum sequence for biological activity in the periphery of rodents. Thus, the term CCK-33 will generally refer to human CCK(1-33), while CCK-8 (CCK(26-33)) will refer to the C-terminal octapeptide generically in both the sulfated and unsulfated unless otherwise specified. Further, pentagastrin or CCK-5 will refer to the C-terminal peptide CCK(29-33), and the CCK-4 will refer to the C-terminal tetrapeptide CCK(30-33).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCCK was reportedly identified in 1928 from preparations of intestinal extracts by its ability to stimulate gallbladder contraction. Other biological actions of CCK have since been reported, including stimulation of pancreatic secretion, delayed gastric emptying, stimulation of intestinal motility and stimulation of insulin secretion. See Lieverse et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 713: 268-272 (1994). The actions of CCK, also reportedly include effects on cardiovascular function, respiratory function, neurotoxicity and seizures, cancer cell proliferation, analgesia, sleep, sexual and reproductive behaviors, memory, anxiety and dopamine-mediated behaviors. Crawley and Corwin, Peptides 15: 731-755 (1994). Other reported effects of CCK include stimulation of pancreatic growth, stimulation of gallbladder contraction, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, pancreatic polypeptide release and a contractile component of peristalsis. Additional reported effects of CCK include vasodilation. Walsh, “Gastrointestinal Hormones,” In Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract (3d ed. 1994; Raven Press, New York).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been reported that injections of combinations of glucagon, CCK and bombesin potentiated the inhibition of intake of condensed milk test meals in nondeprived rats over the inhibitions observed with individual compounds. Hinton et al., Brain Res. Bull. 17:615-619 (1986). It has also been reported that glucagon and CCK synergistically inhibit sham feeding in rats. LeSauter and Geary, Am. J. Physiol. 253:R217-225 (1987); Smith and Gibbs, Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. 713:236-241 (1994). It has also been suggested that estradiol and CCK can have a synergistic effect on satiety. Dulawa et al., Peptides 15:913-918 (1994); Smith and Gibbs, supra. It has also been proposed that signals arising from the small intestine in response to nutrients therein may interact synergistically with CCK to reduce food intake. Cox, Behav. Brain Res. 38:35-44 (1990). Additionally, it has been reported that CCK induces satiety in several species. For example, it has been reported that feeding depression was caused by CCK injected intraperitoneally in rats, intraarterially in pigs, intravenously in cats and pigs, into the cerebral ventricles in monkeys, rats, dogs and sheep, and intravenously in obese and non-obese humans. See Lieverse et al., supra. Studies from several laboratories have reportedly confirmed the behavioral specificity of low doses of CCK on inhibition in feeding, by comparing responding for food to responding for nonfood reinforcers in both monkeys and rats and by showing that CCK elicits the sequence of behaviors normally observed after meal ingestion (i.e., the postprandial satiety sequence). Additionally, comparison of behavior after CCK to behavior after food ingestion, alone or in combination with CCK has reportedly revealed behavioral similarities between CCK and food ingestion. Crawley and Corwin, supra. It has also been reported that CCK in physiological plasma concentrations inhibits food intake and increases satiety in both lean and obese humans. See Lieverse et al., supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCCK was characterized in 1966 as a 33-amino acid peptide. Crawley and Corwin, supra. Species-specific molecular variants of the amino acid sequence of CCK have been identified. The 33-amino acid sequence and a truncated peptide, its 8-amino acid C-terminal sequence (CCK-8) have been reportedly identified in pig, rat, chicken, chinchilla, dog and humans. A 39-amino acid sequence was reportedly found in pig, dog and guinea pig. A 58-amino acid sequence was reported to have been found in cat, dog and humans. Frog and turtle reportedly show 47-amino acid sequences homologous to both CCK and gastrin. Very fresh human intestine has been reported to contain small amounts of an even larger molecule, termed CCK-83. In the rat, a principal intermediate form has been reportedly identified, and is termed CCK-22. Walsh, “Gastrointestinal Hormones,” In Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract (3d ed. 1994; Raven Press, New York). A non-sulfated CCK-8 and a tetrapeptide (termed CCK-4 (CCK(30-33)) have been reported in rat brain. The C-terminal pentapeptide (termed CCK-4 (CCK(29-33)) conserves the structural homology of CCK, and also homology with the neuropeptide, gastrin. The C-terminal sulfated octapeptide sequence, CCK-8, is reportedly relatively conserved across species. Cloning and sequence analysis of a cDNA encoding preprocholecystokinin from rat thyroid carcinoma, porcine brain, and porcine intestine reportedly revealed 345 nucleotides coding for a precursor to CCK, which is 115 amino acids and contains all of the CCK sequences previously reported to have been isolated. Crawley and Corwin, supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCCK is said to be distributed throughout the central nervous system and in endocrine cells and enteric nerves of the upper small intestine. CCK agonists include CCK itself (also referred to as CCK-33), CCK-8 (CCK(26-33)), non-sulfated CCK-8, pentagastrin (CCK-5 or CCK(29-33)), and the tetrapeptide, CCK-4 (CCK(30-33)). At the pancreatic CCK receptor, CCK-8 reportedly displaced binding with a 1000-5000 greater potency than unsulfated CCK-8 or CCK-4, and CCK-8 has been reported to be approximately 1000-fold more potent than unsulfated CCK-8 or CCK-4 in stimulating pancreatic amylase secretion. Crawley and Corwin, supra. In homogenates from the cerebral cortex, CCK receptor binding was said to be displaced by unsulfated CCK-8 and by CCK-4 at concentrations that were equimolar, 10-fold or 100-fold greater than sulfated CCK-8. Id. Receptors for CCK have been reportedly identified in a variety of tissues, and two primary subtypes have been described: type A receptors and type B receptors. Type A receptors have been reported in peripheral tissues including pancreas, gallbladder, pyloric sphincter and afferent vagal fibers, and in discrete areas of the brain. The type A receptor subtype (CCKA) has been reported to be selective for the sulfated octapeptide. The Type B receptor subtype (CCKB) has been identified throughout the brain and in the stomach, and reportedly does not require sulfation or all eight amino acids. See Reidelberger, J. Nutr. 124 (8 Suppl.) 1327S-1333S (1994); Crawley and Corwin, supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious in vivo and in vitro screening methods for CCK analogs are known in the art. Examples include in vivo assays involving the contraction of the dog or guinea pig gallbladder after rapid intravenous injection of the compound to be tested for CCK-like activity, and in vitro assays using strips of rabbit gallbladder.

Component peptide hormones useful in the present invention also include Pancreatic Polypeptide Family (PPF) peptide hormones, including PYY and chimeras of PPY-NPY. Native PPF peptide hormones are known in art, as are functional peptide analogs and derivatives. Certain exemplary native peptides, peptide analogs and derivatives are described herein, however it should be recognized that any known PYY family peptides that exhibit hormonal activity known in the art may be used in conjunction with the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another family of peptide hormones implicated in metabolic diseases and disorders is the pancreatic polypeptide family (“PPF”). Pancreatic polypeptide (“PP”) was discovered as a contaminant of insulin extracts and was named by its organ of origin rather than functional importance (Kimmel et al., Endocrinology 83: 1323-30 (1968)). PP is a 36-amino acid peptide containing distinctive structural motifs. A related peptide was subsequently discovered in extracts of intestine and named Peptide YY (“PYY”) because of the N- and C-terminal tyrosines (Tatemoto, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79: 2514-8 (1982)). A third related peptide was later found in extracts of brain and named Neuropeptide Y (“NPY”) (Tatemoto, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79: 5485-9 (1982); Tatemoto et al., Nature 296: 659-60 (1982)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese three related peptides have been reported to exert various biological effects. Effects of PP include inhibition of pancreatic secretion and relaxation of the gallbladder. Centrally administered PP produces modest increases in feeding that may be mediated by receptors localized to the hypothalamus and brainstem (reviewed in Gehlert, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 218: 7-22 (1998)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelease of PYY occurs following a meal. An alternate molecular form of PYY is PYY(3-36) (Eberlein et al., Peptides 10: 797-803 (1989); Grandt et al., Regul. Pept. 51: 151-9 (1994)). This fragment constitutes approximately 40% of total PYY-like immunoreactivity in human and canine intestinal extracts and about 36% of total plasma PYY immunoreactivity in a fasting state to slightly over 50% following a meal. It is apparently a dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4) cleavage product of PYY. PYY(3-36) is reportedly a selective ligand at the Y2 and Y5 receptors, which appear pharmacologically unique in preferring N-terminally truncated (i.e., C-terminal fragments of) NPY analogs. Peripheral administration of PYY reportedly reduces gastric acid secretion, gastric motility, exocrine pancreatic secretion (Yoshinaga et al., Am. J. Physiol. 263: G695-701 (1992); Guan et al., Endocrinology 128: 911-6 (1991); Pappas et al., Gastroenterology 91: 1386-9 (1986)), gallbladder contraction and intestinal motility (Savage et al., Gut 28: 166-70 (1987)). The effects of central injection of PYY on gastric emptying, gastric motility and gastric acid secretion, as seen after direct injection in or around the hindbrain/brainstem (Chen and Rogers, Am. J. Physiol. 269: R787-92 (1995); Chen et al., Regul. Pept. 61: 95-98 (1996); Yang and Tache, Am. J. Physiol. 268: G943-8 (1995); Chen et al., Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 9: 109-16 (1997)), may differ from those effects observed after peripheral injection. For example, centrally administered PYY had some effects opposite to those described herein for peripherally injected PYY(3-36) in that gastric acid secretion was stimulated, not inhibited. Gastric motility was suppressed only in conjunction with TRH stimulation, but not when administered alone, and was indeed stimulatory at higher doses through presumed interaction with PP receptors. PYY has been shown to stimulate food and water intake after central administration (Morley et al., Brain Res. 341: 200-3 (1985); Corp et al., Am. J. Physiol. 259: R317-23 (1990)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny PPF analog or derivative known in the art may be used in conjunction with a GIP component in the present invention. In one embodiment, the PPF analogs and derivatives have at least one hormonal activity of a native PPF polypeptide. In certain embodiments, the PPF analogs are agonists of a receptor which native PPF polypeptide is capable of specifically binding. Exemplary PPF analogs and derivatives include those described in WO 03/026591 and WO 03/057235, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, preferred PPF analogs and derivatives that exhibit at least one PPF hormonal activity generally comprise at least two PYY motifs including a polyproline motif and C-terminal tail motif. Such analogs are generally described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/543,406 filed Feb. 11, 2004, published as US 2006/013547A1 on Jun. 22, 2006, which are herein incorporated by reference. Other preferred PPF analogs are disclosed in PCT/US2005/004351, entitled “Pancreatic Polypeptide Family Motifs and Polypeptides Comprising the Same”, published as WO2005/077094 on Aug. 25, 2005, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Other preferred PPF analogs are disclosed in PCT/US2005/045471, entitled “Pancreatic Polypeptide Family Motifs, Polypeptides and Methods Comprising the Same”, published as WO2006/066024 on Jun. 22, 2006, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. By way of background, research has suggested that the differences in Y receptor binding affinities are correlated with secondary and tertiary structural differences. See, e.g., Keire et al., \n \nBiochemistry\n \n 2000, 39, 9935-9942. Native porcine PYY has been characterized as including two C-terminal helical segments from residues 17 to 22 and 25 to 33 separated by a kink at \n \n \nresidues\n \n \n 23, 24, and 25, a turn centered around residues 12-14, and the N-terminus folded near \n \nresidues\n \n 30 and 31. Further, full-length porcine PYY has been characterized as including the PP fold, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions among residues in the N- and C-termini. See id.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “PYY motif” is generally a structural component, primary, secondary, or tertiary, of a native PP family polypeptide that is critical to biological activity, i.e., biological activity is substantially decreased in the absence or disturbance of the motif. Preferred PYY motifs include the N-terminal polyproline type II motif of a native PP family polypeptide, the type II β-turn motif of native PP family polypeptide, the α-helical motif at the C-terminal end of native PP family polypeptide, and the C-terminal tail motif of native PP family polypeptide. More particularly, in the N-terminal polyproline region, amino acids corresponding to \n \nresidues\n \n 5 and 8 of a native PP family polypeptide are generally conserved as a proline. The type II β-turn motif will generally include amino acids corresponding to residues 12-14 of a native PP family polypeptide. The α-helical motif can generally extend from amino acids corresponding to approximately \nresidue\n 14 of a native PP family polypeptide to any point up to and including the C-terminal end, so long as the α-helical motif includes a sufficient number of amino acid residues such that an α-helical turn is formed in solution. The α-helical motif can also include amino acid substitutions, insertions and deletions to the native PP family sequence, so long as the α-helical turn is still formed in solution. The C-terminal tail motif generally includes amino acids corresponding to approximately the last 10 residues of a native PP family polypeptide, more preferably the last 7, 6, or 5 residues of a native PP family polypeptide, and more preferably amino acid residues 32-35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred PYY analogs include those with internal deletions, insertions, and substitutions in areas of the PYY molecule not corresponding to the polyproline motif and/or the C-terminal tail motif. For instance, internal deletions at \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n 4, 6, 7, 9, or 10 are envisioned.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of particular interest, the component hormone is a PPF polypeptide containing at least two PPF motifs including at least the N-terminal polyproline PPF motif and the C-terminal tail PPF motif. As used herein, “motif” refers to an amino acid sequence that is characteristic of a specific biochemical function or defines an independently folded domain. Additional PPF motifs can correspond to a motif of any of the PP family polypeptides, including PP, PYY and NPY, for example the type II beta-turn region motif of PYY, or the α-helical motif at the C-terminal end of PYY.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment the PPF family component module is a PPF chimeric polypeptide comprising a fragment of a PP, PYY or NPY polypeptide covalently linked to at least one additional fragment of a second PP, PYY or NPY polypeptide, wherein each PP, PYY or NPY fragment includes a PPF motif. Alternatively, the PPF chimeric can comprise a fragment of a PP family polypeptide linked to one, two, three, or four polypeptides segments, wherein at least one of the linked polypeptide segments is a fragment of a second PP family polypeptide. In certain embodiments, PPF polypeptides do not include an N-terminal PP fragment with a C-terminal NPY fragment. PPF chimeric polypeptide component module will exhibit at least 50% sequence identity to a native PYY(3-36) over the entire length of the PYY(3-36). In some embodiments, such PPF chimeric polypeptide can exhibit at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 92%, at least 94% or at least 97% sequence identity to a native PYY(3-36) over the entire length of the PYY(3-36). Such PPF chimeric polypeptides can exhibit at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 92%, at least 94% or at least 97% sequence identity to a native PP. In yet another embodiment, such PPF chimeric polypeptide can exhibit at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 92%, at least 94% or at least 97% sequence identity to a native NPY. In some embodiments, the PPF chimeric polypeptides can include at least the N-terminal polyproline PPF motif and the C-terminal tail PPF motif. These PPF chimeras as well as other PYY and PP analogs, are described in US 2006/013547A1 published Jun. 22, 2006. In one embodiment, any of the PPF family peptides, if not contained as a hybrid component, can be provided as a second agent, e.g. as a second anti-obesity agent, with a hybrid as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, the PPF chimeric polypeptide will generally retain, at least in part, a biological activity of native human PP, PYY, or NPY. In some embodiments, the PPF chimeric polypeptide exhibits a biological activity in the treatment and prevention of metabolic conditions and disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptide fragments of the PPF chimeras can be covalently linked together in any manner known in the art, including but not limited to direct amide bonds or chemical linker groups. Chemical linker groups may include peptide mimetics which induce or stabilize polypeptide conformation. PPF chimeric polypeptides include PYY-PP, PYY-NPY, PP-PYY, PP—NPY, NPY—PP, or NPY-PYY chimeras.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PPF chimera can be at least 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, or 34 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, the PYY analog polypeptides include only natural L amino acid residues and/or modified natural L amino acid residues. In some embodiments, the PYY analog polypeptides do not include unnatural amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the PPF chimeric polypeptides include: hPP(1-7)-pNPY, hPP(1-17)-pNPY, hPP(19-23)-pNPY, hPP(19-23)-Pro\n34\npNPY, hPP(19-23)-His\n34\npNPY, rPP(19-23)-pNPY, rPP(19-23)-Pro\n34\npNPY, rPP(19-23)-His\n34\npNPY, hPP(1-17)-His\n34\npNPY, pNPY(1-7)-hPP, pNPY(1-7, 19-23)-hPP, cPP(1-7)-pNPY(19-23)-hPP, cPP(1-7)-NPY(19-23)-His\n34\nhPP, hPP(1-17)-His\n34\npNPY, hPP(19-23)-pNPY, hPP(19-23)-Pro\n34\npNPY, pNPY(1-7)-hPP, pNPY(19-23)-hPP, pNPY(19-23)-Gln\n34\nhPP, pNPY(19-23)-His\n34\nhPP, pNPY(19-23)-Phe\n6\nGln\n34\nhPP, pNPY(19-23)-Phe\n6\nHis\n34\nhPP, pNPY(1-7, 19-23)-hPP, pNPY(1-7, 19-23)-Gln\n34\nhPP, cPP(20-23)-Pro\n34\n-pNPY, cPP(21-23)-Pro\n34\n-pNPY, cPP(22-23)-Pro\n34\n-pNPY, cPP(1-7)-Pro\n34\n-pNPY, cPP(20-23)-Pro\n34\n-pNPY, cPP(1-7, 20-23)-Pro\n34\n-pNPY, cPP(1-7)-pNPY(19-23)-hPP, cPP(1-7)-pNPY(19-23)-His\n34\nhPP, cPP(1-7)-gPP(19-23)-hPP, cPP(1-7)-pNPY(19-23)-Ala\n31\nAib\n32\nGln\n34\n-hPP, cPP(1-7)-pNPY(19-23)-Ala\n31\nAib\n32\nHis\n34\n-hPP hPP(1-7)-Ala\n31\nAib\n32\n-pNPY, hPP(1-17)-Ala\n31\nAib\n32\n-pNPY, pNPY(1-7)-Ala\n31\nAib\n32\nGln\n34\n-hPP, or pNPY(1-7, 19-23)-Ala\n31\nAib\n32\nGln\n34\n-hPP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the PPF chimeric polypeptides can comprise fragments of PP family analog polypeptides. For instance, the PPF chimeric polypeptides may comprise PPF analog polypeptides described herein, as well as PP analog polypeptides, and NPY analog polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPYY analog polypeptide for use in the GIP hybrids of the invention, or administered as a second agent with a GIP hybrid, are those having a potency in one of the assays described herein (including food intake, gastric emptying, pancreatic secretion, body composition or weight reduction assays) which is equal to or greater than the potency of NPY, PYY, or PYY(3-36) in that same assay. In some embodiments, the PPY analog polypeptide for use in a GIP hybrid component may be useful in the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as, for example, obesity, insulin resistance syndrome (Syndrome X) or diabetes mellitus. In some embodiments, the PYY analog polypeptide for use in a GIP hybrid may exhibit improved ease of manufacture, stability, and/or ease of formulation, as compared to PP, NPY, PYY, or PYY(3-36).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the PPF chimeric polypeptide component portion retains at least about 25%, or from about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, about 98%, or about 99% percent of the biological activity of native human PYY with regard to the reduction of nutrient availability, the reduction of food intake, the effect of body weight gain, and/or the treatment and prevention of metabolic conditions and disorders. In another embodiment, the PPF chimeric polypeptide for use in a GIP hybrid exhibits improved PYY agonist activity. In some embodiments, the PPF chimeric polypeptides exhibits at least about 110%, about 125%, about 130%, about 140%, about 150%, about 200%, or more of the biological activity of native human PYY with regard to the reduction of nutrient availability the reduction of food intake, the effect of body weight gain, and/or the treatment and prevention of metabolic conditions and disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, in one aspect, the PPF chimeric polypeptides comprise a fragment of PP linked to a fragment of PYY. In one embodiment, the PPF chimeric polypeptides comprise an N-terminal fragment of PP or a PP analog polypeptide linked at its C-terminal end to a C-terminal fragment of PYY or a PYY analog polypeptide. In another embodiment, the PPF chimeric polypeptides comprise an N-terminal fragment of PYY, PYY(3-36), or a PYY analog polypeptide linked at its C-terminal end to a C-terminal fragment of PP or a PP analog polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the PPF chimeric polypeptides comprise a fragment of PYY linked to a fragment of NPY. In one embodiment, the PPF chimeric polypeptides comprise an N-terminal fragment of PYY, PYY(3-36), or a PYY analog polypeptide linked at its C-terminal end to a C-terminal fragment of NPY or a NPY analog polypeptide. In another embodiment, the PPF chimeric polypeptides comprise an N-terminal fragment of NPY or a NPY analog polypeptide linked at its C-terminal end to a C-terminal fragment of PYY or a PYY analog polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the PPF chimeric polypeptides comprise a fragment of PP linked to a fragment of NPY. In one embodiment, the PPF chimeric polypeptides comprise an N-terminal fragment of PP or a PP analog polypeptide linked at its C-terminal end to a C-terminal fragment of NPY or a NPY analog polypeptide. In another embodiment, the PPF chimeric polypeptides comprise an N-terminal fragment of NPY or a NPY analog polypeptide linked at its C-terminal end to a C-terminal fragment of PP or a PP analog polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a fragment of PP, a PP analog polypeptide, PYY, PYY(3-36), a PYY analog polypeptide, NPY, or an NPY analog polypeptide is a fragment comprising anywhere from 4 to 20 amino acid residues of the PP, PP analog polypeptide, PYY, PYY(3-36), PYY analog polypeptide, NPY, or NPY analog polypeptide. In some embodiments, the length of fragment is selected so as to obtain a final PPF chimeric polypeptide of at least 34 amino acids in length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PPF chimeric polypeptides when used in a GIP hybrid may also comprise further modifications including, but are not limited to, substitution, deletion, and insertion to the amino acid sequence of such PPF chimeric polypeptides and any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the PPF chimeric polypeptides include one or more modifications of a “non-essential” amino acid residue. A “non-essential” amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered, i.e., deleted or substituted, in the native human amino acid sequence without abolishing or substantially reducing the activity interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDerivatives of the PPF chimeric polypeptides are also useful in a GIP hybrid. Such derivatives include PPF chimeric polypeptides conjugated to one or more water soluble polymer molecules, such as polyethylene glycol (“PEG”) or fatty acid chains of various lengths (e.g., stearyl, palmitoyl, octanoyl, oleoyl etc.), or by the addition of polyamino acids, such as poly-his, poly-arg, poly-lys, and poly-ala. Modifications to the PPF chimeric polypeptides can also include small molecule substituents, such as short alkyls and constrained alkyls (e.g., branched, cyclic, fused, adamantyl), and aromatic groups. In some embodiments, the water soluble polymer molecules will have a molecular weight ranging from about 500 to about 20,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch polymer-conjugations and small molecule substituent modifications may occur singularly at the N- or C-terminus or at the side chains of amino acid residues, which are not involved in formation of the hybrid, within the sequence of the PPF chimeric polypeptides. Alternatively, there may be multiple sites of derivatization along the PPF chimeric polypeptide. Substitution of one or more amino acids with lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine may provide additional sites for derivatization. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,824,784 and 5,824,778. In some embodiments, the PPF chimeric polypeptides may be conjugated to one, two, or three polymer molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the water soluble polymer molecules are linked to an amino, carboxyl, or thiol group, and may be linked by N or C terminus, or at the side chains of lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine. Alternatively, the water soluble polymer molecules may be linked with diamine and dicarboxylic groups. In some embodiments, the PPF chimeric polypeptides are conjugated to one, two, or three PEG molecules through an epsilon amino group on a lysine amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPPF chimeric polypeptides also include PPF chimeric polypeptides with chemical alterations to one or more amino acid residues. Such chemical alterations include amidation, glycosylation, acylation, sulfation, phosphorylation, acetylation, and cyclization. The chemical alterations may occur singularly at the N- or C-terminus or at the side chains of amino acid residues within the sequence of the PPF chimeric polypeptides. In one embodiment, the C-terminus of these peptides may have a free —OH or —NH\n2 \ngroup.

Component peptide hormones useful in the present invention also include GLP-1 peptide hormones. Native GLP-1 peptide hormones, including GLP-1(1-37), GLP-1(7-37), and GLP-1(7-36)amide, are known in art, as are functional peptide analogs and derivatives. As used herein, GLP-1 refers to all native forms of GLP-1 peptide hormones. Certain exemplary native peptides, peptide analogs and derivatives are described herein, however it should be recognized that any known GLP-1 peptides that exhibit hormonal activity known in the art may be used in conjunction with the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCentral to many metabolic diseases and disorders is the regulation of insulin levels and blood glucose levels. Insulin secretion is modulated in part by secretagogue hormones, termed as incretins, which are produced by enteroendocrine cells. The incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (“GLP-1”) is a peptide hormone secreted by intestinal cells that has been shown in multiple studies to produce an enhancing effect on insulin secretion. GLP-1 is processed from proglucagon in the gut and enhances nutrient-induced insulin release (Krcymann B., et al., Lancet, 2:1300-1303 (1987)). Various truncated forms of GLP-1, are known to stimulate insulin secretion (insulinotropic action) and cAMP formation (see, e.g., Mojsov, S., Int. J. Pep. Pro. Res., 40:333-343 (1992)). A relationship between various in vitro laboratory experiments and mammalian, especially human, insulinotropic responses to exogenous administration of GLP-1, GLP-1(7-36) amide, and GLP-1(7-37) acid has been established (see, e.g., Nauck, M. A., et al., Diabetologia, 36:741-744 (1993); Gutniak, M., et al., New Eng. J. of Med., 326(20):1316-1322 (1992); Nauck, M. A., et al., J. Clin. Invest., 91:301-307 (1993); and Thorens, B., et al., Diabetes, 42:1219-1225 (1993)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP-1(7-36) amide exerts a pronounced antidiabetogenic effect in insulin-dependent diabetics by stimulating insulin sensitivity and by enhancing glucose-induced insulin release at physiological concentrations (Gutniak M., et al., New Eng. J. Med., 326:1316-1322 (1992)). When administered to non-insulin dependent diabetics, GLP-1(7-36) amide stimulates insulin release, lowers glucagon secretion, inhibits gastric emptying and enhances glucose utilization (Nauck, 1993; Gutniak, 1992; Nauck, 1993). However, the use of GLP-1 type molecules for prolonged therapy of diabetes has been complicated because the serum half-life of such peptides is quite short.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, GLP-1 is a 30-amino acid peptide derived from proglucagon, a 160-amino acid prohormone. Actions of different prohormone convertases in the pancreas and intestine result in the production of glucagon and other ill-defined peptides, whereas cleavage of proglucagon results in the production of GLP-1 and GLP-2 as well as two other peptides. The amino acid sequence of GLP-1 is 100% homologous in all mammals studied so far, implying a critical physiological role. GLP-1 (7-37) acid is C-terminally truncated and amidated to form GLP-1 (7-36) NH2. The biological effects and metabolic turnover of the free acid GLP-1 (7-37) OH, and the amide, GLP-1 (7-36) NH2, are indistinguishable. By convention, the numbering of the amino acids is based on the processed GLP-1 (1-37) OH from proglucagon. The biologically active GLP-1 is the result of further processing: GLP-1 (7-36) NH2. Thus the first amino acid of GLP-1 (7-37) OH or GLP-1 (7-36)NH2 is 7H is.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the gastrointestinal tract, GLP-1 is produced by L-cells of intestinal, colonic and rectal mucosa, in response to stimulation by intraluminal glucose. The plasma half-life of active GLP-1 is <5 minutes, and its metabolic clearance rate is around 12-13 minutes (Holst, Gastroenterology 107(6):1848-55 (1994)). The major protease involved in the metabolism of GLP-1 is dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) IV (CD26) which cleaves the N-terminal His-Ala dipeptide, thus producing metabolites, GLP-1 (9-37) OH or GLP-1 (9-36) NH2 which are variously described as inactive, weak agonist or antagonists of GLP-1 receptor. The GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a G protein coupled receptor of 463 amino acid and is localized in pancreatic beta cells, in the lungs, and to a lesser extent in the brain, adipose tissue and kidneys. The stimulation of GLP-1R by GLP-1 (7-37) OH or GLP-1 (7-36)NH2 results in adenylate cyclase activation, cAMP synthesis, membrane depolarization, rise in intracellular calcium and increase in glucose-induced insulin secretion (Holz et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270(30):17749-57 (1995)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP-1 is a potent insulin secretagogue that is secreted from the intestinal mucosa in response to food intake. The profound incretin effect of GLP-1 is underscored by the fact that GLP-1R knockout mice are glucose-intolerant. The incretin response of i.v. infused GLP-1 is preserved in diabetic subjects, though the incretin response to oral glucose in these patients is compromised. GLP-1 administration by infusion or sc injections controls fasting glucose levels in diabetic patients, and maintains the glucose threshold for insulin secretion (Gutniak et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 326:1316-22 (1992); Nauck et al., Diabet. Med. 13:(9 Suppl 5):S39-S43 (1996); Nauck et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 76:912-917 (1993)). GLP-1 has shown tremendous potential as a therapeutic agent capable of augmenting insulin secretion in a physiological manner, while avoiding hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther important effects of GLP-1 on glucose homeostasis are suppression of glucagon secretion and inhibition of gastric motility. GLP-1 inhibitory actions on pancreatic alpha cell secretion of glucagon leads to decreases in hepatic glucose production via reduction in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. This antiglucagon effect of GLP-1 is preserved in diabetic patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe so-called ileal brake effect of GLP-1, in which gastric motility and gastric secretion are inhibited, is effected via vagal efferent receptors or by direct action on intestinal smooth muscle. Reduction of gastric acid secretion by GLP-1 contributes to a lag phase in nutrient availability, thus obviating the need for rapid insulin response. In summary, the gastrointestinal effects of GLP-1 contribute significantly to delayed glucose and fatty acid absorption and modulate insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP-1 has also been shown to induce beta cell specific genes, such as GLUT-1 transporter, insulin (via the interaction of PDX-1 with insulin gene promoter), and hexokinase-1. Thus GLP-1 could potentially reverse glucose intolerance normally associated with aging, as demonstrated by rodent experiments. In addition, GLP-1 may contribute to beta cell neogenesis and increase beta cell mass, in addition to restoring beta cell function during states of beta cell insufficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCentral effects of GLP-1 include increases in satiety coupled with decreases in food intake, effected via the action of hypothalamic GLP-1R. A 48 hour continuous SC infusion of GLP-1 in type II diabetic subjects, decreased hunger and food intake and increased satiety. These anorectic effects were absent in GLP-1R knock out mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus a GIP hybrid comprising an incretin family hormone module can provide the functions and uses associated with the incretin family module, e.g. exendin-4, GLP1, GLP2, as discussed, in addition to having a GIP function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny GLP-1 peptide analog or derivative known in the art may be used in conjunction with the present invention.

Native exendin peptide hormones are known in art, as are functional peptide analogs and derivatives. Certain exemplary native peptides, peptide analogs and derivatives are described herein, however it should be recognized that any known exendin peptides that exhibit hormonal activity known in the art may be used in conjunction with the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExendins are another family of peptides implicated in insulin secretion. Exendins are found in the saliva of the Gila-monster, a lizard endogenous to Arizona, and the Mexican Beaded Lizard. Exendin-3 is present in the saliva of Heloderma horridum, and exendin-4 is present in the saliva of Heloderma suspectum (Eng, J., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265:20259-62, 1990; Eng., J., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267:7402-05 (1992)). The exendins have some sequence similarity to several members of the glucagon-like peptide family, with the highest identity, 53%, being to GLP-1 (Goke, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 268:19650-55 (1993)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExendin-4 binds the GLP-1 receptors on insulin-secreting TC1 cells, at dispersed acinar cells from guinea pig pancreas, and at parietal cells from stomach; the peptide also stimulates somatostatin release and inhibits gastrin release in isolated stomachs (Goke, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 268:19650-55 (1993); Schepp, et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 69:183-91 (1994); Eissele, et al., Life Sci., 55:629-34 (1994)). Exendin-3 and exendin-4 were found to bind the GLP-1 receptors on, to stimulating cAMP production in, and amylase release from, pancreatic acinar cells (Malhotra, R., et al., Relulatory Peptides, 41:149-56 (1992); Raufman, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267:21432-37 (1992); Singh, et al., Regul. Pept., 53:47-59 (1994)). The use of the insulinotropic activities of exendin-3 and exendin-4 for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and the prevention of hyperglycemia has been proposed (Eng, U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,286).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTruncated exendin peptides such as exendin[9-39], a carboxyamidated molecule, and fragments 3-39 through 9-39 have been reported to be potent and selective antagonists of GLP-1 (Goke, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 268:19650-55 (1993); Raufman, J. P., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266:2897-902 (1991); Schepp, W., et al., Eur. J. Pharm., 269:183-91 (1994); Montrose-Rafizadeh, et al., Diabetes, 45(Suppl. 2):152A (1996)). Exendin[9-39] blocks endogenous GLP-1 in vivo, resulting in reduced insulin secretion (Wang, et al., J. Clin. Invest., 95:417-21 (1995); D'Alessio, et al., J. Clin. Invest., 97:133-38 (1996)). The receptor apparently responsible for the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 has been cloned from rat pancreatic islet cells (Thorens, B., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:8641-8645 (1992)). Exendins and exendin[9-39] bind to the cloned GLP-1 receptor (rat pancreatic-cell GLP-1 receptor: Fehmann H C, et al., Peptides, 15 (3): 453-6 (1994); human GLP-1 receptor: Thorens B, et al., Diabetes, 42 (11): 1678-82 (1993)). In cells transfected with the cloned GLP-1 receptor, exendin-4 is an agonist, i.e., it increases cAMP, while exendin[9-39] is an antagonist, i.e., it blocks the stimulatory actions of exendin-4 and GLP-1. Id.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, exendin-4 is a 39 amino acid C-terminal amidated peptide found in the saliva of the Gila Monster (Heloderma suspectum), with a 53% amino acid sequence identity to the GLP-1 peptide sequence. See, e.g., Eng, J., et al. “Isolation and Characterization of Exendin-4, and Exendin-3 Analogue from Heloderma suspectum Venom,” J. Bio. Chem., 267:11, p. 7402-7405 (1992), Young, A. A., et al., “Glucose-Lowering and Insulin-Sensitizing Actions of Exendin-4,” Diabetes, Vol. 48, p. 1026-1034, May, 1999. In terms of its activity, exendin-4 is a highly specific agonist for the GLP-1 receptor, and, like GLP-1, is able to stimulate insulin secretion. Therefore, like GLP-1, exendin-4 is regarded as an insulinotropic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, unlike GLP-1, exendin-4 has a relatively long half-life in humans, because of its resistance to the dipeptidyl peptidase IV which rapidly degrades the GLP-1 sequence in vivo. Furthermore, it has been shown that, as compared to GLP-1, exendin-4 has a stronger capability to stimulate insulin secretion, and that a lower concentration of exendin-4 may be used to obtain such stimulating activity. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,286, herein incorporated by reference. Therefore exendin-4 peptides or derivatives thereof (for examples of such derivatives, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,486, herein incorporated by reference, and its corresponding international application WO 01/04156) have a greater potential utility for the treatment of conditions involving the dysregulation of insulin levels (e.g., conditions such as diabetes) than either insulin or GLP-1. Thus a GIP hybrid comprising an exendin family hormone module can provide the functions and uses associated with the exendin family module, e.g. exendin-4, exendin tail, as discussed, in addition to having a GIP function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny exendin peptide analog or derivative known in the art may be used in conjunction with the present invention. In one embodiment, the exendin peptide analogs and derivatives have at least one hormonal activity of a native exendin peptide. In certain embodiments, the exendin peptide analogs are agonists of a receptor which a native exendin peptide is capable of specifically binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary exendin analogs include:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n14\nLeu,\n25\nPhe-exendin-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n5\nAla,\n14\nLeu,\n25\nPhe-exendin-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n14\nLeu,\n22\nAla,\n25\nPhe-exendin-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs known in the art, such exendin analogs are preferably amidated, but within the context of the present invention, may optionally be in the acid form unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional exemplary exendin analogs and derivatives are described in PCT Application Serial No. PCT/US98/16387 filed Aug. 6, 1998, entitled “Novel Exendin Agonist Compounds,” which claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser.

The catestatin fragment of chromogranin A is an endogenous inhibitor of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, functioning in negative feedback control of catecholamine secretion.

They are synthesized and stored as 3 distinct precursor prohormones, which are the 126 amino acid ANP, 108 amino acid BNP, and 104 amino acid CNP.

Removal of a 25-amino acid signal peptide from its N terminal end occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, leaving a 126-amino acid ANP prohormone (ProANP), the main storage form of ANP within the heart. The prohormone consists of 4 biologically active peptide segments: amino acids 1-30 (ProANF 1-30, also known as long acting Na stimulator), 31-67 (ProANF 31-67, also known as vessel dilator), 79-98 (ProANF 79-98, also known as potassium excreter), and 99-126 (ANF, also known as atrial natriuretic factor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBNP was originally isolated from porcine brain but in humans it is synthesized and secreted from the left ventricle. Sequence analysis reveals that preproBNP consists of 134 residues and is cleaved to a 108-amino acid ProBNP. Cleavage of a 32-amino acid sequence from the C-terminal end of ProBNP results in human BNP (77-108), which is the physiologically active form in plasma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCNP is the third member of the natriuretic peptide system and is primarily found in human vascular endothelial cells, kidney, and porcine brain. High concentrations of CNP are also found in human hypothalamus and midbrain. In humans, preproCNP is a 126-amino acid precursor processed into proCNP by cleavage of 23 residues from its N-terminal end. This 23-amino acid sequence serves as a signal peptide. The terminal 22 (105-126) amino acids are cleaved from proCNP to yield a biologically active form of CNP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUrodilatin is a kidney-derived member of the natriuretic peptide family and is formed from the same ANP prohormone and consists of amino acids 95-126. Except for the 4 amino acid N terminal extension, it is identical to ANF (99-126). Urodilatin appears to be an important regulator of sodium and water handling in the kidney, as well as a mediator of sodium excretion in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNatriuretic peptides exert their biologic effects by binding to high-affinity receptors on the surface of target cells. Three subtypes of NPRs—NPR-A, NPR-B, and NPRC—have been isolated. Consequently, in one embodiment is provided a method to screen hybrids for natriuretic receptor binding and/or activation. Natriuretic peptides including prohormone variants can impart numerous natriuretic peptide hormone activities to hybrids of the invention. In other embodiments of interest are natriuretic antagonist hybrids. Natriuresis is the excretion of an excessively large amount of sodium into the urine. Natriuresis is similar to diuresis (the excretion of an unusually large quantity of urine), except that in natriuresis the urine is exceptionally salty. Natriuresis occurs with some diuretics and diseases (as of the adrenal) and can lead to the salt-losing syndrome characterized by dehydration, vomiting, low blood pressure, and the risk of sudden death. Exogenous administration of the 4 independent circulating peptides of the ANP prohormone (1-30, 31-67, 79-98, and 99-126) produce in vivo vasodilation, diuresis, suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and enhanced natriuresis and/or kaliuresis. ProANF 1-30, ProANF 31-67 and ANF 99-126 each have natriuretic, blood pressure lowering and diuretic properties with ProANF 31-67 and ANF 99-126 having the greatest impact on blood pressure. There are varying effects of the ANP peptides on potassium homeostasis: ProANF 79-98 stimulates potassium excretion, whereas ProANF 31-67 spares potassium loss by inhibiting Na/K ATPase in the medullary collecting duct cells. Specific to ANF 99-126 is a dose-dependent inhibition of angiotensin II-mediated aldosterone secretion, whereas proANF 31-67 has the property of inducing natriuresis through generation of prostaglandin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBNP produces similar biologic effects as ANF in normal humans. Infusions of BNP in normal men produced a 2-fold increase in sodium excretion, 50% reduction in plasma renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone secretion as well as a reduction in plasma volume.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCNP induces cardiovascular effects similar to the other natriuretic peptides but does not appear to mediate any renal effects. When CNP is infused in anesthetized dogs at equivalent doses of ANF, plasma cGMP rose with a concomitant reduction in mean arterial pressure, right atrial pressure and cardiac output, but glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow and sodium excretion decreased.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNatriuretic peptides can provide therapeutic benefit in heart failure. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is associated with increases in vasopressin, endothelin, and with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and sympathetic nervous systems, mediating vasoconstriction, sodium and water retention, and negative vascular and cardiac remodeling. These effects occur despite the elevated levels of the natriuretic peptides in patients with heart failure. In one embodiment of the invention are hybrids that provide increased or therapeutic serum levels of natriuretic peptide activity for treatment or prevention of cardiac related diseases and conditions, including CHF. Although ANF infusion in normal individuals can result in a sustained increase in sodium excretion and urine flow rates, in the heart failure patient a marked beneficial reduction in renal response can be obtained. BNP infusion markedly increases sodium excretion in patients with heart failure and exerts significant beneficial hemodynamic effects. As compared with ANP, the diuretic and natriuretic effects of BNP are significantly greater. BNP is cleared more slowly than ANP and exerts other effects including suppressing aldosterone secretion and increasing serum levels of ANP. BNP peptides can also provide a beneficial decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance, right atrial pressure and systolic blood pressure, with an increase in cardiac index in patients hospitalized for symptomatic CHF. In patients with decompensated heart failure, natriuretic peptide hybrids can provide a beneficial decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and an improved dyspnea score. (Dyspnea is an unpleasant sensation of difficulty in breathing, typically associated with early stages of cardiac heart failure.) The hybrids containing one, two or three natriuretic hormone functions provide methods of administration of pharmaceutically active compositions that are useful for both the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of CHF patients, preferably CHF patients that are decompensated, patients with chronic CHF, and patients with hypertension. The natriuretic portion(s) of a hybrid is sufficient to provide a therapeutically effective amount of a natriurertic peptide to such patient when administered in a therapeutically effective dose over a therapeutically effective period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein any of the family of therapeutically effective natriuretic peptides or their analogs can be used as a component of a GIP hybrid. Useful natriuretic peptides include, for example, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP or B-type natriuretic peptide) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). Sequences of useful forms of natriuretic peptides are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 20010027181, which is incorporated herein by reference. Examples of ANPs include human ANP (Kangawa et al., BBRC 118:131 (1984)) or that from various species, including pig and rat ANP (Kangawa et al., BBRC 121:585 (1984)). Such ANPs comprise 28 amino acids. Such ANPs may be administered as a peptide having a ring structure of ANP (formation of a disulfide bond based on Cys), and a C-terminal portion succeeding the ring structure. An example of such a peptide is a peptide having amino acid residues at the 7-position to the 28-position of ANP is provided in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20010027181. Another example is frog ANP. Specific examples of BNPs that can be used in the methods of the invention include human BNP (hBNP). Human BNP comprises 32 amino acids and involves the formation of a disulfide bond (Sudoh et al., BBRC 159:1420 (1989)) and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,114,923, 5,674,710, 5,674,710, and 5,948,761, each of which is incorporated by reference. Various BNP's of origin other than human, including as pig BNP and rat BNP, are also known, and can be used. A further example is chicken BNP. Examples of CNPs that can be used in the methods of the invention include pig CNP. Pig CNP comprises 22 amino acids and involves the formation of a disulfide bond, like the above-described ANP and BNP (Sudoh et al., BBRC 168:863 (1990)) (human and rat have the same amino acid sequence), chicken CNP (Arimura et al., BBRC 174:142 (1991)). Frog CNP (Yoshihara et al., BBRC 173:591 (1990) can also be used. As discussed herein, one skilled in the art can apply modifications, such as a deletion, substitution, addition or insertion, and/or chemical modification to amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of a known natriuretic peptide as desired, by known methods. The resulting compound has the activity of acting on a receptor of the starting ANP, BNP or CNP. Analogs having this activity, therefore, are included in the hybrids for use in accordance with the methods of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the hybrids containing one or more natriuretic functions can be used in treating hypertension. In one embodiment a natriuretic hybrid will have no deleterious effect on heart rate and is not associated with arrhythmias. In one embodiment the hybrid will comprise at least one, two or three natriuretic peptide functions, for example, both ANP and BNP activity. One or more natriuretic hormone functions can be combined with any other hormone function or peptidic enhancer, as described herein. In another embodiment the natriuretic portion(s) is a more stable analog having an extended in vivo half-life when compared with that of a native natriuretic peptide. Analogs that prevent undesirable cleavage by endogenous enzymes such as NEP are also envisioned. The natriuretic containing hybrids are also further directed to hypertension reduction, diuresis inducement, natriuresis inducement, vascular conduct dilatation or relaxation, natriuretic peptide receptors (such as NPR-A) binding, renin secretion suppression from the kidney, aldostrerone secretion suppression from the adrenal gland, treatment of cardiovascular diseases and disorders, reducing, stopping or reversing cardiac remodeling in congestive heart failure, treatment of renal diseases and disorders; treatment or prevention of ischemic stroke, and treatment of asthma. Hybrids can be administered to patients that would benefit from inducing natriuresis, diuresis and vasodilatation. Hybrids can be administered alone or in combination with one or more of the following types of compounds: ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, spironolactone, digoxin, anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents, and angiotensin receptor blockers. Additional diseases or conditions include renal disorders and diseases, asthma, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension. Hybrids are also useful to treat inflammatory-related diseases, erectile dysfunction and hypercholesterolemia.\n\n\n \nPeptide Module Selection Considerations, Spacers, and Linking Groups.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe GIP hybrid polypeptides of the present invention generally comprise at least two bio-active peptide hormone modules of the invention, wherein at least one of the bio-active peptide hormone modules, typically a GIP module, exhibits at least one hormonal activity. Within the context of the present invention, at least one of the bio-active peptide hormone modules will be comprised from a GIP peptide hormone, analog, derivative, fragment, or peptidic enhancer. The bio-active peptide hormone module that exhibits the at least one hormonal activity may be located at the N-terminal end of the hybrid polypeptide, the C-terminal end of the hybrid polypeptide, or in the event that the hybrid polypeptide comprises more than two bio-active peptide hormone modules, may be located in the internal portion of the hybrid polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, it may be preferable to locate the bio-active peptide hormone module exhibiting the at least one hormonal activity such that the C-terminal end of the bio-active peptide hormone module is amidated. Amidation of the C-terminal end of the bio-active peptide hormone module may be accomplished by locating the module at the C-terminal end of the hybrid peptide, or by configuring the module in the C-terminal-to-N-terminal direction at the N-terminal end of the hybrid polypeptide. In both configurations, the C-terminal end of the bio-active peptide hormone module is available for amidation. Specific component peptide hormones where C-terminal amidation may preferably include amylin family peptide hormones, CCK, PYY, hGLP-1(7-36) and hGLP-2. Specific component peptide hormones where C-terminal amidation is not necessarily exemplary (stated otherwise, where elongation at the C-terminal end of the module is easily tolerated) include exendin-4, exendin-4(1-28), GIP, GLP-1(7-37), frog GLP-1(7-36), and frog GLP-2. However, if these component peptide hormones are located at the C-terminal end of the hybrid polypeptide, they may still be optionally amidated, and in fact may preferably be optionally amidated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe bio-active peptide hormone modules may be covalently linked in any manner known in the art. Stable linkages may be used, or cleavable linkage may be used. In one embodiment, the carboxy of a first module may be directly linked to the amino of a second module. In another embodiment, linking groups may be used to attached modules. Further, if desired, spacers or turn inducers known in the art may be employed to stabilize the linkage. By way of example, where amidation of the C-terminal end of the N-terminally located bio-active peptide hormone module is not desired, the module may be attached to a second module directly, or using any appropriate linking group known in the art, such as, an alkyl; PEG; amino acid, e.g., Lys, Glu, beta-Ala; polyaminoacids, e.g., poly-his, poly-arg, poly-lys, poly-ala, Gly-Lys-Arg (GKR) etc.; bifunctional linker (see, e.g., Pierce catalog, Rockford, Il); aminocaproyl (“Aca”), beta-alanyl, 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl, or other cleavable and non-cleavable linker known in the art. Specifically described herein, as if each were explicitly drawn, are embodiments of specific hybrids in which the linker in each exemplified linker-containing hybrid is replaced by a Gly linker, particularly embodiments where the Gly linker is Gly-Gly-Gly. As an example, for exemplified YAEGTFISDYSIAMDKIRQQDFVNWLLAQK-Linker-KCNTATCVLGRLSQELHRLQTYPRTNTGSETF (SEQ ID NO: 92)(see tables herein) its Gly linker species analog is also specifically intended and disclosed: this species is YAEGTFISDYSIAMDKIRQQDFVNWLLAQK-Gly-Gly-Gly-KCNTATCVLGRLSQELHRLQTYPRTNTGSETF (SEQ ID NO: 92). In one embodiment a linker or spacer is 1 to 30 residues long, in another \nembodiment\n 2 to 30 residues, and in yet another 3-30 residues long, and any integer length from 2 to 30 inclusive; each integer unit is contemplated, e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc. In one embodiment a Gly linker is used, and in a particular embodiment a three residue linker Gly-Gly-Gly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the linker is an K(N-epsilon) linker, as used for example in 0601GIP4619:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment as discussed herein the GIP is attached to the second bio-active hormone module in a C-terminus to C-terminus orientation. The C-terminus of a GIP is linked to the C-terminus of a second bio-active hormone module, optionally with a linker. Orthogonal chemistries can be used to ligate functionalized peptide modules, optionally with linkers as described herein. For example, native chemical ligation chemistries can be used. As shown below, where R is a good leaving group, a hybrid can be generated with a Cys-Lys linkage:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further example the hybrid can be prepared using functionalized modules:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nto generate:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing a similar approach, a hybrid having a lysine linker can be created:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional linkers are shown in \nFIG. 24\n. The linkers are particularly useful for N-terminal to N-terminal linking, however either or both ends of these linkers can be readily adapted to react to the C-terminus of a GIP compound. The C-terminus of a GIP compound is the preferred terminal for linking a GIP analog or derivative to another peptide component of a GIP-containing hybrid, because as shown herein, linking a peptide module to the N-terminus of GIP resulted in lack of receptor activation, unless the module was cleaved off in vivo. Such N-terminal extensions are known that act to extend plasma half life of the GIP compound and prevent or reduce receptor activation until removed by a serum or membrane protease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf particular interest are GIP-exendin family hybrids that are linked C-terminus to C-terminus, keeping their respective receptor activation N-termini unhindered. The receptor activation regions of both molecules are present in such hybrids, for example using any of the GIP and the exendin and GLP1 family peptides and analogs, active fragments and derivatives herein. For example a dAla(2)-GIP(1-30) analog can be linked to exendin-4, in a tail to tail manner, via suitable linking chemistry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, as will be recognized by those of skill in the art, the peptides of the invention may be C-terminally amidated, or may exist as a free acid. In an exemplary embodiment the peptides of the invention are C-terminally amidated. Where amidation of the C-terminal end of N-terminally located bio-active peptide hormone module is desired, the module may again be attached to a second module using any appropriate linking group known in the art. More specifically, in the event that a bio-active peptide hormone module exhibiting at least one hormonal activity has been configured in the C-terminal-to-N-terminal orientation, resulting in an amino to amino linkage, exemplary linking groups include dicarboxylic acids, alkyls, PEGs, and amino acids such as Lys, Cys, and Glu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, the hybrid polypeptides may also preferably include spacer to further stabilize the linkage of the bio-active peptide hormone modules. Any spacer or turn inducer known in the art may be used. By way of example, referred beta-turn mimetics include mimic A and mimic B illustrated herein, also Ala-Aib and Ala-Pro dipeptides. Their IUPAC names are Mimic A: N-(3S,6S,9S)-2-oxo-3-amino-1-azabicyclo[4.3.0]-nonane-9-carboxylic acid. Mimic B: N-(3S,6S,9R)-2-oxo-3-amino-7-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.3.0]-nonane-9-carboxylic acid.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy agonist is meant a compound which elicits a biological activity of native human hormone. In a exemplary embodiment, the terms refer to a compound which elicits a biological effect in glucose lowering or other activity of native human GIP. Novel GIP analogs for example have activity in a glucose lowering assay, gastric secretion inhibition assay, dP/dt assay, blood pressure assay, insulin secretion assay, bone density assay, or plasma stability assay, preferably similar to or better than native human GIP and/or which binds specifically in a GIP receptor assay or in a competitive binding assay with labeled GIP. In one embodiment, the agonists will bind in such assays with an affinity of greater than 1 μM, and more preferably with an affinity of greater than 1-5 nM. In another embodiment the agonist (or antagonist as the case may be) IC50 will be less than or about 100 micromolar, less than or about 50 micromolar, less than about 20 micromolar, and less than or about 10 micromolar. Such agonists may comprise a polypeptide having a GIP sequence with a Trp-cage motif (e.g. exendin tail PSSGAPS (SEQ ID NO: 93) or variant) or frog GLP-1 tail or analog or derivative of the tail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “amino acid” and “amino acid residue” is meant natural amino acids, unnatural amino acids, and modified amino acid. Unless stated to the contrary, any reference to an amino acid, generally or specifically by name, includes reference to both the D and the L stereoisomers if their structure allow such stereoisomeric forms.

Unnatural amino acids include, but are not limited to homolysine, homoarginine, azetidinecarboxylic acid, 2-aminoadipic acid, 3-aminoadipic acid, beta-alanine, aminopropionic acid, 2-aminobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, 6-aminocaproic acid, 2-aminoheptanoic acid, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, 3-aminoisbutyric acid, 2-aminopimelic acid, tertiary-butylglycine, 2,4-diaminoisobutyric acid, desmosine, 2,2′-diaminopimelic acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, N-ethylglycine, N-ethylasparagine, homoproline, hydroxylysine, allo-hydroxylysine, 3-hydroxyproline, 4-hydroxyproline, isodesmosine, allo-isoleucine, N-methylalanine, N-methylglycine, N-methylisoleucine, N-methylpentylglycine, N-methylvaline, naphthalanine, norvaline, norleucine, ornithine, pentylglycine, pipecolic acid, thioproline, sarcosine and citrulline. Additional unnatural amino acids include modified amino acid residues which are chemically blocked, reversibly or irreversibly, or chemically modified on their N-terminal amino group or their side chain groups, as for example, N-methylated D and L amino acids or residues wherein the side chain functional groups are chemically modified to another functional group. For example, modified amino acids include methionine sulfoxide; methionine sulfone; aspartic acid- (beta-methyl ester), a modified amino acid of aspartic acid; N-ethylglycine, a modified amino acid of glycine; or alanine carboxamide, a modified amino acid of alanine. Additional residues that can be incorporated are described in Sandberg et al., J. Med. Chem. 41: 2481-91, 1998.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “Ahx” is meant 6-amino hexanoic acid.

For example, in any of the embodiments herein, including the above hybrids, positions 1 (including the N-terminus), 2 or 3 can be modified to impart DPP-IV resistance. For example, specifically exemplified herein are each of the D-Ala2 analogs of each embodiment herein as well as of the above species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGIP and Peptidic Enhancer Hybrid\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one hybrid embodiment GIP is C-terminally extended by a peptidic enhancer, e.g., a tail or C-terminal portion of another hormone, such as exendin or GLP-1, which provide analogs that have enhanced in vivo efficacy. Exendin-4 (\nFIG. 1\n) is a potent incretin mimetic that shares a 53% homology with GLP-1, and mirrors many of the key biological actions of GLP-1. Unlike GLP-1, exendin-4 is much more resistant to proteolytic cleavage to DPP-IV peptidase and NEP. This confers greater enhanced pharmacokinetics and improved in vivo efficacy in humans compared to GLP-1. Circular dichroism (CD) and NMR studies of Exendin-4 in aqueous media and in media containing organic cosolvents reveal that the C-terminal segment containing the sequence LFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 183) (residues 21-39) forms a unique hydrophobic Trp-cage cluster resulting from interactions of Pro37 with Phe22 and Pro38 with Trp25 (29-31). This Trp-cage cluster motif is the first example of a protein-like tertiary structure displayed by a peptide, and could be responsible for imparting greater metabolic stability by masking protease-sensitive sites in the molecule in vivo (32).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in one aspect, exemplary module combinations include those involving a first module comprising GIP, a fragment of GIP that exhibits at least one hormonal activity, a GIP analog or derivative that exhibits at least one hormonal activity, or a fragment of an GIP analog that exhibits at least one hormonal activity in combination with a peptidic enhancer. Useful peptidic enhancers are the exendin-4 and frog GLP tails, as described herein, as well as PYY(25-36), PYY(30-36) and PYY(31-36). In one embodiment, the first module is located at the C-terminal end of the hybrid polypeptide and the peptidic enhancer is located at the N-terminal end of the hybrid polypeptide. Alternatively, the first module may be located at the N-terminal end of the hybrid polypeptide and the peptidic enhancer may be located at the C-terminal end of the hybrid polypeptide. In certain embodiments, spacers or linkers such as betaAla or Gly may be inserted if desired to attach the modules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particular compound of interest is YaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKPSSGAPPPS-NH2 (Compound 0601GIP3794; which has a D-Ala at \nposition\n 2, and is in amide form).

combination with other modifications and derivatizations, and the exemplary GIP compounds containing them, are depicted in the following table along with various activities. Analog 0601GIP4233 is an example of a GIP analog having surprisingly high solubility (e.g., solubility greater than 5 mg/ml in 30 mM histidine buffer at \npH\n 4 to 8) and contains a frog GLP-1 C-terminal tail. A further such tail modification that improves solubility of a GIP analog or hybrid into which it is incorporated is a chimera of the frog tail and the exendin tail: PKKIPPPS (SEQ ID NO. 836) as found in 0601GIP4951. This chimeric tail can be incorporated into other GIP analogs and hybrids as disclosed herein to improve solubility. Further modification and derivatizations as shown in the table below can also improve duration of action, e.g. as tested in a rat IVGTT assay, and plasma stability, when incorporated into a GIP analog or hybrid. In in vitro studies, the main cleavage site of an analog having the frog tail was at the Ile34-Arg35 peptide bond. Accordingly, in one embodiment is a GIP analog or hybrid having a modification, substitution or derivitization at one or both of these two positions to reduce in vitro cleavage as compared to the parent peptide. Examples of such modifications (as compared to 0601GIP4233) are shown in the table below, and are contemplated to be used with any of the other GIP analogs and hybrids shown herein.\n\n\n \n

of less than 25%, less than 15%, less than 10% or less than about 5%, at \npH\n 4 to 9, at \npH\n 5 to 7, or further at \npH\n 6 to 7, under accelerated stability of 40 degrees C. for at least 1, at least 3 or at least 7 days. In yet a further embodiment, the GIP analog has a solubility greater than about at least 1 mg/ml, at least 2 mg/ml, at least 3 mg/ml, at least 4 mg/ml or greater than at least 5 mg/ml, at least one or more of about \n \n \n \n \n \npH\n \n \n \n \n \n 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and further at least three or more of these pHs, and even further at all of these pHs. In one embodiment the GIP compound has a solubility of at least about 2.0 mg/ml in 30 mM histidine buffer at \npH\n 6 and/or at least about 5.0 mg/ml in 30 mM histidine buffer at \npH\n 6.

The modifications provide increased plasma stability. In one embodiment the frog GLP-1 tail region is substituted or modified at or near the “KK” sequence to prevent or reduce proteolytic cleavage. While such modified tail region is depicted in the context of specific GIP analogs in the table below, it is intended that such a modified tail sequence that increases plasma stability of the attached GIP portion, is to be used with any GIP analog or derivative, including those disclosed herein, to provide enhanced plasma stability and longer half-life. The modified tail can be combined with one or more other GIP modifications or derivatizations as discussed herein. Further, modified-frog-tail-containing GIP compounds are particularly useful components of GIP hybrids. In a further embodiment the frog GLP1 tail and analogs and derivatives thereof that enhance stability are of particular interest as an alternative to the exendin tail as used with GIP, exendin, GLP1 or other peptide hormones, as discussed herein.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4814\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKA\n\n\n  88 (% \nInh\n 10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKKIRYS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 695)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4815\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n  89 (% \nInh\n 10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAKIRYS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 696)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4816\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n87.3 (% \nInh\n 10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKAIRYS-NH2 (SEQ ID NO. 697)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4817\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n80.5 (% \nInh\n 10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKKIAYS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 698)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4818\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n76.1 (% \nInh\n 10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKKIRAS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 699)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4819\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n80.4 (% \nInh\n 10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKKIRYA-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 700)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4820\n\n\nYaEGFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKPS\n\n\n  46 (% \nInh\n 10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPKKIRYS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 701)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4823\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n94.1 (% \nInh\n 10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSPKKIRYS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 702)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4821\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n93.5 (% \nInh\n 10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKSARPS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 703)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4822\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n95.4 (% \nInh\n 10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKKLKPS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 704)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNKIRYS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 705)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKNIRYS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 706)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQKIRYS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 707)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKQIRYS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 708)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4824\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n92.9 (% \nInh\n 10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKK(OctG)RYS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 709)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4825\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKP\n\n\n77.5 (% \nInh\n 10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKKIRYS(OctG)-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 710)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther exemplary “tail” modifications (compare to 0601GIP4288 (SEQ ID NO. 608) which has Leu14, Glu15 and Arg18 and Glu21 substitutions compared to 0601GIP3794), that improve solubility, duration of action or glucose lowering of GIP analogs compared to human GIP or to 0601GIP4288, and that can be used alone or combined with other modifications and derivatizations disclosed herein, and the exemplary compounds containing them, are depicted in the following table along with various activities.

them, are depicted in the following table. For example, in one embodiment a GIP analog or hybrid will incorporate (at its C-terminus) any one of the tail sequences, such as PSSGAPPNS (SEQ ID No: 881), in the following table, to achieve greater solubility, improved duration of action or improved glucose lowering as compared to the parent compound.

In other embodiments solubility is enhanced by addition of a water soluble polymer, e.g. PEG, either to either terminal or to an internal amino acid, e.g. lysine, as shown herein.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4767\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVEWLLAQKPKKIRYS-\n\n\n82.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. (711)\n\n\n(% Inh,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4768\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVPWLLAQKPKKIRYS-\n\n\n17.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 712)\n\n\n(% Inh,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4769\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNELLAQKPKKIRYS-\n\n\n42.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 713)\n\n\n(% Inh,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4770\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNPLLAQKPKKIRYS-\n\n\n10.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 714)\n\n\n(% Inh,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4771\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLEAQKPKKIRYS-\n\n\n17.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 715)\n\n\n(% Inh,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4772\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLPAQKPKKIRYS-\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 716)\n\n\n(% Inh,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4289\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIALDKIRQQDFVEWLLAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n0.58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 609)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4708\n\n\nAdo-Ado-\n\n\n19.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n(% Inh,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 717)\n\n\n10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4709\n\n\nYaEGTFISYDSIAMDK-(epsilon-NH-(Ado-Ado-Ado-(2-(2-\n\n\n42.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmethoxyetoxy)-acetoyl)))-\n\n\n(% Inh,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIHQQDFVNWLLAQKPSSGAPPPS-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 718)\n\n\n10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4763\n\n\n((2-(2-methoxyethoxy)-acetoyl)-Ado-Ado)-\n\n\n14.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISYDSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n(% Inh,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 719)\n\n\n10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4761\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n87.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdo-Ado-NH2 (SEQ ID No. 720)\n\n\n(% Inh,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0601GIP4832\n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAK(epsilon-NH-(Ado-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nacetyol)))DKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKPSSGAPPPS-NH2 (SEQ\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nID No. 721)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNQLLAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 722)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNQLLAQKPKKIRYS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 723)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVQWLLAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 724)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVQWLLAQKPKKIRYS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 725)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNNLLAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 726)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLNAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 727)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLSAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 728)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLQAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 729)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWNLAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 730)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWSLAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 731)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWQLAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 732)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVEWLKAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 733)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNNLNAQKPSSGAPPPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 734)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKPSSGNPPPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 735)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKPSSGANPPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 736)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKPSSGAPNPS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 737)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKPSSGAPPNS-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNH2 (SEQ ID No. 738)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternative representations of some of the above compounds are as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet further embodiments contain modifications and specific GIP sequences described in the following table that may provide increased solubility, glucose lowering or duration of action as compared to human GIP, and in some embodiments, greater than or equal to 0601GIP3794.

It is intended that the various modifications and variants shown are to be used in the present invention, and may be combined as discussed herein. For example, the terms exendin tail or exendin trp-cage motif includes any of the exendin tail variants depicted, which are useful as shield sequences (peptidic enhancers). Of further interest are the frog GLP1 C-terminal extensions as shown in the figures, which are yet another example of a shield sequence that can be used in place of an exendin tail. For example, in one embodiment the GIP compounds of the invention comprise a frog GLP1 “tail” sequence as a peptidic enhancer as described herein (and see \nFIG. 12\n). Of particular interest are compounds 0601GIP4179, 0601GIP4233, 0601GIP4285, 0601GIP4178, and 0601GIP4467. In other embodiment, the “S” or shield region or C-terminal tail can be any of the tails depicted herein, including for example PSSGQPPQSK (SEQ ID No: 925), PSSGAPPQSK (SEQ ID No: 926), PSSGAPPKSK (SEQ ID No: 927), PSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID No: 1), PSSGAPPKS (SEQ ID No: 928), PSSGARPPS (SEQ ID No: 929), PSSGAKPPS (SEQ ID No: 930), PSSGAPKPS (SEQ ID No: 931), PSSGAPDPS (SEQ ID No: 932) or PKGKIRYS (SEQ ID No: 933). Further the “S” or shield region or C-terminal tail can be any of the tails found in any of theGIP analogs depicted herein including those from GIP compounds 0601GIP3794, 0601GIP4850, 0601GIP5075, 0601GIP5076, 0601GIP5080, 0601GIP5081, 0601GIP5082, 0601GIP5070, 0601GIP5071, 0601GIP5072, 0601GIP5073 or 0601GIP4904.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet a further embodiment of any of the GIP modules herein, is a Serine-2, Aspartic acid3 (i.e. S2,D3), double substitution at \n \npositions\n \n 2 and 3 at the N-terminus of a GIP. Thus it is expressly intended that for each of the species and formulas depicted herein, that each S2,D3 analog is explicitly disclosed herein as if it had been written. As with the other DPP-IV resistance modifications described herein, the S2,D3 can be combined with one or two or more other modifications, for example a fatty acyl derivatization to decrease plasma (e.g. renal clearance) and/or increase duration of action, and/or with a C-terminal shield sequence, and/or with a GIP species amino acid substitution. Of course these GIP analogs can be used directly or as the GIP portion of a GIP hybrid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary compounds (see \nFIG. 12\n for example) showing exceptional GIP Receptor binding activity at less than about 10 nm include 0601GIP3794 at 3.8 nM, 0601GIP4283 0.41 nM, 0601GIP4284 1.8 nM, 0601GIP4285 0.58 nM, 0601GIP4288 0.28 nM, 0601GIP4289 0.58 nM, 0601GIP4290 0.35 nM, 0601GIP4147 at 7.4 nM, 0601GIP4178 1.5 nM, 0601GIP4293 0.12 nM, 0601GIP4292 0.17 nM, 0601GIP4238 4.2 nM, 0601GIP4179 3.3 nM, 0601GIP4294 0.92 nM, 0601GIP4252 5.6 nM, 0601GIP3794 3.8 nM, 0601GIP4190 2.4 nM, 0601GIP4152 2.3 nM, 0601GIP4150 1.6 nM, 0601GIP4153 0.53 nM, 0601GIP4149 1.5 nM, 0601GIP4176 4.8 nM, 0601GIP4177 2.9 nM, 0601GIP4213 7.9 nM, 0601GIP4215 4.5 nM, 0601GIP4263 0.66 nM, 0601GIP4278 0.24 nM, 0601GIP4264 0.4 nM, 0601GIP4279 2.1 nM, 0601GIP4233 0.1 nM, 0601GIP4234 3.4 nM, 0601GIP4236 0.62 nM. These compounds also display GIP Receptor activation and appropriate receptor specificity (e.g., lack of binding to GLP1-R or glucagon receptor in absence of appropriate hybrid module).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated herein, DPP-IV resistant hybrids of the invention have increased plasma stability compared to native GIP. For example, 0601GIP3796 amide form is essentially 100% present after 5 hours in human plasma, in contrast to about 60% for GIP(1-42) acid form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following table further demonstrates that GIP peptides of the invention and their analogs and derivatives have in vivo activities that are directly related to desirable therapeutic effects as discussed herein. Compounds marked in bold are of particular interest, as are the modifications and/or derivatizations, which can be combined or used with other modifications or derivatives herein. These compounds find particular use in the GIP hybrids of the invention. Bolded compounds demonstrate very effective activity.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBasal Glucose\n\n\nIVGTT\n\n\nBasal Glucose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLowering\n\n\n

A GIP compound is thereby capable of covalently binding to a blood component through the reactive group. The reactive group typically will covalently bond with an amino group, a hydroxyl group, or a thiol group on a blood component, thereby covalently linking the GIP peptide to the blood component. In one embodiment, the reactive group will react with a thiol group on a blood component. More preferably, the reactive group will react with a thiol group on blood serum albumin. The reactive group may contain any of a number of chemically reactive entities that are capable of forming a covalent bond. In one embodiment, the reactive group will be capable of reacting with a thiol group on a blood component to form a disulfide bond. Such reactive groups are found for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,593,295. In one embodiment of particular interest, the GIP compound is reacted ex vivo with along-lived blood component such as albumin to form a composition suitable for sustained release. Other suitable long-lived components of the blood include immunoglobulin, human serum albumin, red blood cells and platelets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReactive groups that are capable of forming disulfide bonds with thiol groups include those having an activated disulfide bond or an S-sulfonate. Reactive groups having an activated disulfide bond can be derived by coupling a GIP peptide cysteine (or cysteine analog) with an activating group, such as 2,2′-dithiodipyridine (DTDP), 2,2′-dithiobis(5-Nitropyridine) (NPYS), 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent), or 6,6′-dithiodinicotinic acid. Reactive groups containing an activated disulfide bond are herein referred to as activated disulfide bond groups. In addition, an activated disulfide bond group can be derived by acylating a lysine side chain of a GIP peptide with a mercapto-activated carboxylic acid. Another exemplary embodiment of the present invention is to utilize a reactive group that is capable of reacting with a thiol group on a blood component to form a thioether linkage. In one embodiment, such a reactive group will be derived by coupling a GIP peptide with a chemically reactive entity from a maleimido-containing group, such as gamma-maleimide-butyrylamide (GMBA), maleimide-benzoyl-succinimide (MBS), gamma-maleimido-butyryloxy succinimide ester (GMBS), and maleimidopropionic acid (MPA). These and other maleimide containing groups are herein referred to as maleimido groups. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the reactive group of a GIP compound will be capable of covalently bonding to a primary amine on a blood component to form an amide bond. In one embodiment, such reactive groups will be derived by coupling a GIP peptide with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) or N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS) to form an NHS or sulfo-NHS ester. These succinimidyl groups may potentially react with alpha-amine groups on the N-termini of blood component proteins, provided that such amine groups are accessible or available to the reactive group. In one embodiment, these succinimidyl groups will react with the epsilon-amine of lysine in blood component proteins, since the epsilon-amine of lysine is the only amino acid side chain that reacts significantly with NHS esters. In yet another embodiment, GIP compounds of the present invention contain reactive groups that are designed to covalently bond with thiol groups on blood components. Binding to thiol groups is exemplary over binding to amino groups, because thiol groups are less abundant in vivo than are amino groups. Fewer blood components are thereby targeted through binding to thiol groups compared to binding to amino groups, resulting in greater specificity of binding. Accordingly, the exemplary GIP compounds will contain GIP peptides modified with a maleimido group or more In one embodiment, an S-sulfonate or an activated disulfide bond group. While the GIP compounds of the present invention may bind to any of several blood components that contain a free thiol group, the GIP compounds preferably will covalently bond with the thiol group on serum albumin. Serum albumin is the most abundant blood protein, and contains a single thiol group, located at \namino acid residue\n 34 in the protein (Cys34), which is highly conserved among species. The binding of GIP compounds to serum albumin not only provides specificity of binding, but also provides a reproducible formation of conjugates having a 1:1 binding of GIP compound to serum albumin. The reproducibility of this 1:1 ratio is desirable for use of a GIP compound as a therapeutic, since reproducible conjugates of GIP compound and serum albumin will result upon administration of the GIP compound. Furthermore, the reproducibility of 1:1 conjugates of GIP compound and serum albumin is desirable for ex vivo or in vitro approaches to form conjugates for therapy. Conjugates can be formed ex vivo by combining GIP compounds of the present invention with blood, allowing formation of the conjugates, and then administering the conjugate-containing blood to the host. Alternatively, GIP compound-serum albumin conjugates can also be formed in vitro, by combining GIP compound with recombinant serum albumin to form conjugates which can be administered. The reproducibility of 1:1 conjugates of GIP compound and serum albumin provides for reproducible conjugates from ex vivo administration or in vitro batch to batch preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment provided are GIP compounds covalently attached to one or more molecules of polyethylene glycol (peg), or a derivative thereof wherein each peg is attached at a Cys or Lys amino acid or the carboxy terminus of the peptide, resulting in pegylated GIP compound with a half-life of at least one hour, at least 4, 6, 10, 15, 20 or 24.

In other words, the C-terminus of these peptides, may have a free —OH or —NH2 group. These peptides may also have other post-translational modifications. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the novel GIP analog polypeptides of the present invention may also be constructed with an N-terminal methionine residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments envisioned are variants of each of the sequences where the GIP portion is modified by one, two or three modifications as described herein. Exemplary modifications are those at the first (including the terminal NH2), second or third N-terminal amino acid of GIP that impart DPP-IV resistance superior to that of native GIP. Of particular interest are GIP compounds as described herein having at least a D-Ala substitution at \nposition\n 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, in one aspect, the present invention relates to novel GIP analog polypeptides including one or more amino acid sequence modifications. Such modifications include substitutions, insertions, and/or deletions, alone or in combination. In one aspect the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptide includes one or more modifications of a “non-essential” amino acid residue. In the context of the invention, a “non-essential” amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered, i.e., deleted or substituted, in the native human amino acid sequence without abolishing or substantially reducing the GIP or component peptide hormone receptor agonist activity of the GIP analog or hybrid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitutions. In one embodiment, the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the invention may have one or more substitutions in the amino acid sequence of native GIP, GIP(1-30), GIP(1-14), GIP(1-26), GIP(1-39), GIP(19-26), GIP(19-30), GIP(19-39) or GIP(19-42) or a region S, alone or in combination with one or more insertions or deletions. In one embodiment, the substitution does not abolish or substantially reduce the GIP agonist activity of the GIP analog polypeptide. In one aspect, the present invention relates to GIP analog polypeptides that have a single substitution, or consecutive or non-consecutive substitution of more than one amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of native human GIP. In one embodiment, the GIP analog polypeptides of the invention include one, two, or three amino acid substitutions. In one embodiment the native GIP is human, rat, mouse, porcine or bovine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly useful substitutions include conservative amino acid substitutions. A “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain, or physicochemical characteristics (e.g., electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, isosteric, hydrophobic features). Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains are known in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, methionine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). In yet other embodiments exemplary conservative substitutions are shown in the following table under the column “Exemplary Substitutions”. In still other embodiments conserved substitutions are selected from the amino acids listed in the column labeled “Preferred Substitutions.”\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal\n\n\nExemplary\n\n\nPreferred\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidue\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nval; leu; ile\n\n\nval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nlys; gln; asn\n\n\nlys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\ngln; his; asp; lys; arg\n\n\ngln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nglu; asn\n\n\nglu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nser; ala\n\n\nser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nasn; glu\n\n\nasn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu (E)\n\n\nasp; gln\n\n\nasp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\nala\n\n\nala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nasn; gln; lys; arg\n\n\narg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nleu; val; met; ala; phe; norleucine\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu (l)\n\n\nnorleucine; ile; val; met; ala; phe\n\n\nile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\narg; gln; asn\n\n\narg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nleu; phe; ile\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nleu; val; ile; ala; tyr\n\n\ntyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nala\n\n\nala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nthr\n\n\nthr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nser\n\n\nser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\ntyr; phe\n\n\ntyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\ntrp; phe; thr; ser\n\n\nphe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nile; leu; met; phe; ala; norleucine\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, a novel GIP analog or hybrid will have no more than one conservative amino acid substitution as compared to the sequence against which is being compared, alternatively no more than 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 conservative amino acid substitution as compared to the sequence against which is being compared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the invention may include substitutions of one or more unnatural and/or non-amino acids, e.g., amino acid mimetics, into the sequence of GIP. In a exemplary embodiment, the non-amino acids inserted into the sequence of GIP may be beta-turn mimetics or linker molecules, such as —NH—X—CO—, wherein X═(CH\n2\n)\nn \n(where n can be 2-20) or —NH—CH\n2\nCH\n2\n(—O-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n—O—)\nm\n—CH\n2\n—CO— (where m=1-5). Exemplary linker molecules include aminocaproyl (“Aca”), beta-alanyl, and 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl. beta-turn mimetics are available commercially (BioQuadrant Inc, Quebec, Canada) and have been described in literature (Hanessian et al., Tetrahedron 12789-854 (1997); Gu et al., Tetrahedron Letters 44: 5863-6 (2003); Bourguet et al., Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 13: 1561-4 (2003); Grieco et al., Tetrahedron Letters 43: 6297-9 (2002); Souers et al., Tetrahedron 57: 7431-48 (2001); Tsai et al., Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 7: 29-38 (1999); Virgilio et al., Tetrahedron 53: 6635-44 (1997)). Exemplary beta-turn mimetics include mimic A and mimic B illustrated herein. Their IUPAC names are Mimic A: N-(3S,6S,9S)-2-oxo-3-amino-1-azabicyclo[4.3.0]-nonane-9-carboxylic acid. Mimic B: N-(3S,6S,9R)-2-oxo-3-amino-7-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.3.0]-nonane-9-carboxylic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides comprising amino acid sequence beta-turn mimetic substitutions include native human GIP, wherein amino acids at positions x and x+1 are substituted with beta-turn mimetics selected from the group consisting of mimic A and mimic B, wherein x is selected from the amino acids at \namino acid positions\n 8 to 14 of native human GIP. (In addition to mimic A and B, Ala-Aib and Ala-Pro dipeptides are good turn inducers). These linkers are particularly useful to comprise region the region “L” of the D-L-C-S novel GIP analogs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDeletions and Truncations. In another embodiment, the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the invention may have one or more amino acid residues deleted from the amino acid sequence of native GIP, or a region S, alone or in combination with one or more insertions or substitutions. In one aspect, the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the invention may have one or more amino acid residues deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus of a native GIP. In another embodiment, the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the invention may have one or more amino acid residues deleted at \namino acid positions\n 1 through 42 of a native GIP, GIP(1-14), GIP(1-26), GIP(1-30), GIP(1-39), GIP(19-26), GIP(19-30), GIP(19-39) or GIP(19-42) or a region S. Such deletions may include more than one consecutive or non-consecutive deletion. In a exemplary embodiments no more than 1, no more than 2, no more than 3, no more than 4, or no more than 5 amino acids are deleted from a native GIP, from GIP(1-30), GIP(1-14), GIP(1-26), GIP(1-39), GIP(19-30), GIP(19-26), GIP(19-39) or GIP(19-42) or from a region S as when region is exendin(31-39) or exendin(27-39) for example. In one embodiment the native GIP is human, rat, mouse, porcine or bovine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the GIP compound, either analog, derivative or hybrid, when intended for use as an agonist, does not include a deletion at any one of positions 1-15, corresponding to positions YAEGTFISDYSIAMD (SEQ ID No. 477), of the C-terminal sequence of GIP. In other words, each of the corresponding 1-15 positions of GIP will be present, although they may be substituted or derivatized. In a further embodiment the agonist GIP compound does not include a deletion at any one of positions 4-15, corresponding to positions GTFISDYSIAMD (SEQ ID No. 478), of the C-terminal sequence of GIP. In other words, each of the corresponding 4-15 positions of GIP will be present, although they may be substituted or derivatized. Accordingly, in embodiments of an agonist GIP compound, each of the positions 1-15 or 4-15 will be present and occupied by the amino acid present in that position of a naturally-occurring GIP species or by a substitution or derivative thereof. In yet another embodiment of agonist GIP compounds, excluded from the various embodiments described herein are the GIP compounds that did not demonstrate adequate receptor binding activity or receptor activation activity as shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the GIP compound, either analog, derivative or hybrid, when intended for use as an agonist, does not include a deletion at any one of positions 1-15, corresponding to positions YAEGTFISDYSIAMD (SEQ ID No. 477), of the C-terminal sequence of GIP. In other words, each of the corresponding 1-15 positions of GIP will be present, although they may be substituted or derivatized. In a further embodiment the agonist GIP compound does not include a deletion at any one of positions 4-15, corresponding to positions GTFISDYSIAMD (SEQ ID No. 478), of the C-terminal sequence of GIP. In other words, each of the corresponding 4-15 positions of GIP will be present, although they may be substituted or derivatized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsertions. In another embodiment, the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the invention may have one or more amino acid residues inserted into the amino acid sequence of native GIP from GIP(1-30), GIP(1-14), GIP(1-26), GIP(1-39), GIP(19-30), GIP(19-26), GIP(19-39) or GIP(19-42) or region S, alone or in combination with one or more deletions and/or substitutions. In one aspect, the present invention relates to GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides that have a single insertion, or consecutive or non-consecutive insertions of more than one amino acid residues into the amino acid sequence of native GIP, GIP(1-30), GIP(1-14), GIP(1-26), GIP(1-39), GIP(19-30), GIP(19-26), GIP(19-39) or GIP(19-42), or region S, for example exendin(27-39) and exendin(31-39). In one embodiment the native GIP is human, rat, mouse, porcine or bovine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the invention may include insertions of one or more unnatural amino acids and/or non-amino acids into the sequence of GIP, GIP(1-30), GIP(1-14), GIP(1-26), GIP(1-39), GIP(19-30), GIP(19-26), GIP(19-39) or GIP(19-42), or a region S, for example exendin(27-39) and exendin(31-39). In a exemplary embodiment, the unnatural amino acids inserted into the sequence of GIP, GIP(1-30), GIP(1-14), GIP(1-26), GIP(1-39), GIP(19-30), GIP(19-26), GIP(19-39) or GIP(19-42) or region S, for example exendin(27-39) and exendin(31-39) may be beta-turn mimetics or linker molecules. In further such embodiments the native GIP can be human, rat, mouse, porcine or bovine. In some embodiments region S retains at least Proline (or proline analog) at X37 in order to interact with a Trp (or Trp analog) to favor Trp cage formation. In further exemplary embodiments a Pro is retained at position X31 to also interact with Trp at X25. In the case of N-terminally truncated exendin-4 analogs (Trp-cages), it has been established that the helix is not significantly populated unless it is capped by either a Trp25/Pro31 hydrophobic staple or the complete formation of the Trp-cage. The latter, complete Trp-cage formation, serves as a very effective helix C-cap. There is also evidence for the contribution of the half-cage structure, with the Pro at X36, X37, X38 unit undocked, in partially melted Trp-cage species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, while compounds are shown with optional linking groups, in one embodiment of the sequences herein, the linker is a Gly linker, for example Gly-Gly-Gly, or a betaAla linker, for example betaAla-betaAla; all of which are specifically envisioned. Linker molecules of particular interest include aminocaproyl (“Aca”), beta-alanyl, and 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl. Further in other embodiments a beta-turn mimetic is used, which includes mimic A: N-(3S,6S,9S)-2-oxo-3-amino-1-azabicyclo[4.3.0]-nonane-9-carboxylic acid, mimic B: N-(3S,6S,9R)-2-oxo-3-amino-7-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.3.0]-nonane-9-carboxylic acid, and also Ala-Aib and Ala-Pro dipeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the invention may include insertions of polyamino acid sequences (e.g., poly-his, poly-arg, poly-lys, poly-ala, etc.) at either terminus of the polypeptide, known as “extensions” or “tails.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments novel GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides comprising amino acid sequence insertions include an alanine substitution at each amino acid position along the length of native GIP, GIP(1-30), GIP(1-14), GIP(1-26), GIP(1-39), GIP(19-30), GIP(19-26), GIP(19-39) or GIP(19-42), or region S, for example exendin(27-39) and exendin(31-39).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDerivatives. The present invention also relates to derivatives of the GIP analogs and hybrid polypeptides. Such derivatives include GIP analog and hybrid polypeptides conjugated to one or more water soluble polymer molecules, such as polyethylene glycol (“PEG”) or fatty acid chains of various lengths (e.g., stearyl, palmitoyl, octanoyl, etc.), or by the addition of polyamino acids, such as poly-his, poly-arg, poly-lys, and poly-ala. Modifications to the polypeptides can also include small molecule substituents, such as short alkyls and constrained alkyls (e.g., branched, cyclic, fused, adamantyl), and aromatic groups. The water soluble polymer molecules will preferably have a molecular weight ranging from about 500 to about 20,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch polymer-conjugations and small molecule substituent modifications may occur singularly at the N- or C-terminus or at the side chains of amino acid residues within the sequence of the GIP analog and hybrid polypeptides. Alternatively, there may be multiple sites of derivatization along the GIP analog and hybrid polypeptide. Substitution of one or more amino acids with lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine may provide additional sites for derivatization. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,824,784 and 5,824,778. In one embodiment, the GIP analog and hybrid polypeptides may be conjugated to one, two, or three polymer molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe water soluble polymer molecules are preferably linked to an amino, carboxyl, or thiol group, and may be linked by N or C termini, or at the side chains of lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine. Alternatively, the water soluble polymer molecules may be linked with diamine and dicarboxylic groups. In a exemplary embodiment, GIP analog and hybrid polypeptides of the invention are conjugated to one, two, or three PEG molecules through an epsilon amino group on a lysine amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGIP analog and hybrid polypeptide derivatives of the invention also include GIP analog and hybrid polypeptides with chemical alterations to one or more amino acid residues. Such chemical alterations include amidation, glycosylation, acylation, sulfation, phosphorylation, acetylation, and cyclization. The chemical alterations may occur singularly at the N- or C-terminus or at the side chains of amino acid residues within the sequence of the GIP analog and hybrid polypeptides. In one embodiment, the C-terminus of these peptides may have a free —OH or —NH2 group. In another embodiment, the N-terminal end may be capped with an isobutyloxycarbonyl group, an isopropyloxycarbonyl group, an n-butyloxycarbonyl group, an ethoxycarbonyl group, an isocaproyl group (isocap), an octanyl group, an octyl glycine group (G(Oct)), or an 8-aminooctanic acid group or a Fmoc group. In a exemplary embodiment, cyclization can be through the formation of disulfide bridges. Alternatively, there may be multiple sites of chemical alteration along the GIP analog and hybrid polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of pseudopeptide bonds have been described that in general do not affect peptide structure and biological activity. One example of this approach is to substitute retro-inverso pseudopeptide bonds (“Biologically active retroinverso analogues of thymopentin”, Sisto A. et al in Rivier, J. E. and Marshall, G. R. (eds) “Peptides, Chemistry, Structure and Biology”, Escom, Leiden (1990), pp. 722-773) and Dalpozzo, et al. (1993), Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., 41:561-566, incorporated herein by reference). According to this modification, the amino acid sequences of the peptides may be identical to the sequences of a GIP described herein, except that one or more of the peptide bonds are replaced by a retro-inverso pseudopeptide bond. Preferably the most N-terminal peptide bond is substituted, since such a substitution will confer resistance to proteolysis by exopeptidases acting on the N-terminus. Further modifications also can be made by replacing chemical groups of the amino acids with other chemical groups of similar structure. Another suitable pseudopeptide bond that is known to enhance stability to enzymatic cleavage with no or little loss of biological activity is the reduced isostere pseudopeptide bond (Couder, et al. (1993), Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., 41:181-184, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the amino acid sequences of these peptides may be identical to the sequences of a novel GIP analog and hybrid peptide, except that one or more of the peptide bonds are replaced by an isostere pseudopeptide bond. Preferably the most N-terminal peptide bond is substituted, since such a substitution would confer resistance to proteolysis by exopeptidases acting on the N-terminus. The synthesis of peptides with one or more reduced isostere pseudopeptide bonds is known in the art (Couder, et al. (1993), cited above). Other examples include the introduction of ketomethylene or methylsulfide bonds to replace peptide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the bond between the second and third residues that is a target for cleavage by DPP-IV is replaced to a peptidase-resistant bond as disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptoid derivatives of GIP analog and hybrid peptides represent another class of peptide mimetics that retain the important structural determinants for biological activity, yet eliminate the peptide bonds, thereby conferring resistance to proteolysis (Simon, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:9367-9371 (1992), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Peptoids are oligomers of N-substituted glycines. A number of N-alkyl groups have been described, each corresponding to the side chain of a natural amino acid (Simon, et al. (1992), cited above). Some or all of the amino acids of the GIP peptides may be replaced with the N-substituted glycine corresponding to the replaced amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the novel GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides include combinations of the above-described modifications, i.e., deletion, insertion, and substitution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included within the scope of the invention are GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the formulas wherein the indicated amino acid residue is chemical modified or derivitized (e.g., through fatty acid derivatization, PEGylation, amidation, glycolization, etc.). Exemplary embodiments include derivatization of a lysine residue, particularly at \n \nposition\n \n 16 or 30. Also contemplated within the scope of the invention are D-amino acid residues of the indicated amino acids. In another embodiment, exemplary GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides include the polypeptides of the formulas with internal deletions, particularly in areas not corresponding to the active sites as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides comprising substitutions of unnatural amino acids. Exemplary derivatives of the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the invention include polymer-conjugated GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides, wherein the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptide includes any of the above-described insertions, deletions, substitutions, or combinations thereof, and the polymer molecule is conjugated at a lysine residue. Thus in one embodiment, the GIP analog or GIP-containing hybrid is a derivative or substitution of the methionine at \nposition\n 14 and having a longer duration of action compared to human GIP or to the patent analog. For example, an octyl-glycine at the \nmethionine position\n 14, as in 0601GIP4755, increases the duration of action of the compound in vivo. Duration of action was increased to at least 4 hours by this modification. Accordingly, in one embodiment are GIP analog and hybrid polypeptides conjugated at this position to one or more water soluble polymer molecules, such as polyethylene glycol (“PEG”) or fatty acid chain of various lengths (e.g., stearyl, palmitoyl, octanoyl, etc.), or by the addition of polyamino acids, such as poly-his, poly-arg, poly-lys, poly-glu and poly-ala. Modifications to the polypeptides can also include small molecule substituents, such as short alkyls and constrained alkyls (e.g., branched, cyclic, fused, adamantyl), and aromatic groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther specifically envisioned are D-Ala2 variants of each GIP sequence herein (e.g., see tables). In yet other embodiments envisioned are variants of each of the above sequences where the GIP portion is modified by one, two or three modifications as described herein. Exemplary modifications are those at the first, second or third N-terminal amino acid of GIP that impart DPP-IV resistance superior to that of native GIP. In yet a further embodiment the novel GIP compounds comprise a C-terminal amide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the novel GIP analog or a GIP hybrid comprises a half-life at least twice that of human GIP(1-30)amide. Further the half-life can be at least 6 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a novel GIP analog or hybrid. The novel GIP analogs and hybrids can be formulated in a composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment an analog of exenatide with leucine substituted for Met at \nposition\n 14 is used either as a hybrid component or in adjunct therapy with a GIP hybrid:\n\n\n \nHGEGTFTSDLSKQLEEEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 286).\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the invention retain at least about 25%, preferably about 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% percent of the biological activity of native human GIP with regard to glucose lowering. In another embodiment, the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the invention exhibit improved GIP agonist activity. In one embodiment, the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the invention exhibits at least about 110%, 125%, 130%, 140%, 150%, 200%, or more of the biological activity of native human GIP. Conversely, the novel GIP analog or hybrids can be antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary GIP analog or hybrid polypeptide are those having a potency which is equal to or greater than the potency of GIP(1-42) or GIP(1-30) in that same assay. Alternatively, exemplary GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides of the invention may exhibit improved ease of manufacture, stability, and/or ease of formulation, as compared to GIP(1-42) or GIP(1-30).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also contemplated that the novel GIP analogs of the invention, as well as GIP analogs, can be administered with agents such as small molecules or antibodies that are agonists or antagonists, as may be the case, for the peptide hormones and growth factors mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further embodiments and uses of the GIP hybrids having the naturally-occurring C-terminal amino acid sequence of exendin-4, particularly PSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 1) sequence, described herein, specifically excluded are those having a modification at the “P′1” position as described in WO2004/103390.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther examples of the analog and hybrid polypeptides of the present invention are provided in the Sequence Listing, Tables and in the Examples section.\n\n\n \nFurther Uses of Hybrid Polypeptides in the Treatment or Prevention Disease Conditions or Disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \nMetabolic diseases and disorders take on many forms, including obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, cellular apoptosis, etc. Obesity and its associated disorders are common and very serious public health problems in the United States and throughout the world. Upper body obesity is the strongest risk factor known for \ntype\n 2 diabetes mellitus, and is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Obesity is a recognized risk factor for hypertension, atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, reproductive disorders such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, cancers of the breast, prostate, and colon, and increased incidence of complications of general anesthesia (see, e.g., Kopelman, Nature 404: 635-43 (2000)). It reduces life-span and carries a serious risk of co-morbidities above, as well disorders such as infections, varicose veins, acanthosis nigricans, eczema, exercise intolerance, insulin resistance, hypertension hypercholesterolemia, cholelithiasis, orthopedic injury, and thromboembolic disease (Rissanen et al., Br. Med. J. 301: 835-7 (1990)). Obesity is also a risk factor for the group of conditions called insulin resistance syndrome, or “Syndrome X.” Recent estimate for the medical cost of obesity and associated disorders is $150 billion worldwide. The pathogenesis of obesity is believed to be multifactorial but the basic problem is that in obese subjects nutrient availability and energy expenditure do not come into balance until there is excess adipose tissue. Obesity is currently a poorly treatable, chronic, essentially intractable metabolic disorder. A therapeutic drug useful in weight reduction of obese persons could have a profound beneficial effect on their health.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetes is a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism characterized by hyperglycemia and glucosuria resulting from insufficient production or utilization of insulin. Diabetes severely affects the quality of life of large parts of the populations in developed countries. Insufficient production of insulin is characterized as \ntype\n 1 diabetes and insufficient utilization of insulin is \ntype\n 2 diabetes. However, it is now widely recognized that there are many distinct diabetes related diseases which have their onset long before patients are diagnosed as having overt diabetes. Also, the effects from the suboptimal control of glucose metabolism in diabetes gives rise to a wide spectrum of related lipid and cardiovascular disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDyslipidemia, or abnormal levels of lipoproteins in blood plasma, is a frequent occurrence among diabetics. Dyslipidemia is typically characterized by elevated plasma triglycerides, low HDL (High Density Lipoprotein) cholesterol, normal to elevated levels of LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) cholesterol and increased levels of small dense, LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) particles in the blood. Dyslipidemia is one of the main contributors to the increased incidence of coronary events and deaths among diabetic subjects. Epidemiological studies have confirmed this by showing a several-fold increase in coronary deaths among diabetic subjects when compared with non-diabetic subjects. Several lipoprotein abnormalities have been described among diabetic subjects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsulin resistance is the diminished ability of insulin to exert its biologically action across a broad range of concentrations. In insulin resistance, the body secretes abnormally high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect and a state of impaired glucose tolerance develops. Failing to compensate for the defective insulin action, the plasma glucose concentration inevitable rises, resulting in the clinical state of diabetes. It is being recognized that insulin resistance and relative hyperinsulinemia have a contributory role in obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis and \ntype\n 2 diabetes. The association of insulin resistance with obesity, hypertension and angina has been described as a syndrome, Syndrome X, having insulin resistance as the common pathogenic link.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApoptosis is an active process of cellular self-destruction that is regulated by extrinsic and intrinsic signals occurring during normal development. It is well documented that apoptosis plays a key role in regulation of pancreatic endocrine beta cells. There is increasing evidence that in adult mammals the beta-cell mass is subject to dynamic changes to adapt insulin production for maintaining euglycemia in particular conditions, such as pregnancy and obesity. The control of beta cell mass depends on a subtle balance between cell proliferation, growth and programmed cell death (apoptosis). A disturbance of this balance may lead to impairment of glucose homeostasis. For example, it is noteworthy that glucose intolerance develops with aging when beta cell replication rates are reduced and human autopsy studies repeatedly showed a 40-60% reduction of beta cell mass in patients with non-insulin-dependent-diabetes mellitus compared with nondiabetic subjects. It is generally agreed that insulin resistance is an invariable accompaniment of obesity but that normoglycemia is maintained by compensatory hyperinsulinemia until the beta cells become unable to meet the increased demand for insulin, at which \npoint type\n 2 diabetes begins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAttempts to treat the multiple abnormalities associated with diabetes have prompted for the administration of several anti-diabetic medicaments in order to address these abnormalities in the different patients. However, the GIP analogs, GIP hybrids and GIPR agonists as discussed herein find use, when administered at therapeutically effective amounts, either in monotherapy or in adjunct therapy, in treating or preventing these and other diseases and conditions discussed throughout.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) are gut peptide hormones that exert potent glucoregulatory action through their glucose-dependant stimulation of insulin secretion. Studies have shown that GIP and GLP-1 act in concert to exert their incretin effects [1-3]. Consequently, these incretin hormones have attracted considerable interest as potential anti-diabetic agents with reduced risk for hypoglycemia. Whereas GLP-1, GLP-1 analogs and mimetics such as exenatide have been shown to be efficacious in controlling glucose levels in \ntype\n 2 diabetic patients, the insulinotropic effect of GIP is significantly reduced in diabetic subjects, compared to normal individuals [4-6]. The preservation of insulinotropic action of GLP-1 but not of GIP in the same diabetic subjects suggests that GIP signal transduction is impaired in \ntype\n 2 diabetes. Reduced GIP receptor expression in pancreatic beta cells has been proposed to contribute to overall reduced incretin effects in diabetic subjects [7]. This hypothesis is supported by rodent studies showing decreased GIP receptor expression on beta-cells in diabetic fatty Zucker rats and reduced GIP incretin effect seen in first-degree relatives of patients with \ntype\n 2 diabetes [8-9]. However, a recent study has shown significant increases in plasma insulin levels in \ntype\n 2 diabetics to a bolus intravenous administration of GIP, that is in marked contrast to weak increase in insulin secretion with continuous GIP infusion [10]. The similar relative beta-cell sensitivity towards GIP bolus in \ntype\n 2 diabetic patients and healthy control subjects suggest that a specific GIP receptor defect appears unlikely [10]. Rather, the differences in insulin secretion after acute and during continuous GIP administration indicate an impaired amplification of the late phase insulin response to glucose by GIP in \ntype\n 2 diabetic patients, whereas the response in the early phase is almost preserved [11-12]. While not to be bound by theory, it is believed that while GIP's incretin effect is attenuated during persistent hyperglycemia, there is potential for GIP or its analogs to act with a similar potency in diabetic patients as their action in normal subjects once glucose control is improved in these individuals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has conducted three pivotal clinical studies to evaluate the effects of exenatide in patients with \ntype\n 2 diabetes not achieving target blood glucose concentrations using metformin alone, sulfonylureas alone, or using a combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea. All three studies met the primary glucose control endpoint as measured by HbA1c. The average reduction in HbA1c across the \nPhase\n 3 program in patients completing the studies on the highest dose of exenatide (10 μg twice daily) was approximately one percent. Additionally, approximately 40 percent of these patients achieved HbA1c measurements of 7 percent or less. The clinical data indicate that despite the efficacy of exenatide, some diabetic individuals fail to attain normal glucose concentrations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the invention, reduction of hyperglycemia (e.g., as by exenatide) in treated diabetic patients sets the stage for GIP intervention. Whereas the chronic hyperglycemic condition in \ntype\n 2 diabetes patients attenuates GIP's insulinotropic response, improved glycemic control resulting from exenatide treatment would restore responsiveness of the pancreatic beta-cell to GIP stimulation. Therefore adjunct therapy, e.g. co-administration, GIP phybrids, of pharmacological doses of GIP or novel GIP analog or hybrids with exenatide (or other glucose lowering agents or agents or methods that reduce or inhibit gastric emptying) will lead to desired normoglycemia in diabetic patients or patients suffering from conditions associated with elevated glucose. Of note, GIP lacks the gastric emptying effect of GLP-1 [13-14] that is a possible contributing factor to the incidence of nausea during GLP-1 treatment and which limits the peptide's therapeutic window [15]. Thus, it should permit the use of higher GIP dosing regimens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince currently prescribed anti-diabetic agents (metformin, sulfonyureas, TZDs, etc) are able to achieve various degrees of glycemic control, the combination of GIP or novel GIP analog or hybrids with any of these therapies should also elicit an improved response that leads to normalization of glucose levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in one embodiment the methods of the present invention are based on the notion that patients can be primed for GIP therapy through prior glucose lowering with other anti-diabetic agents, such as GLP-1, a GLP-1 analog or exendin-4 or other agents, e.g. metformin, sulfonyureas, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), pramlintide, insulin, acarbose, dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-IV) inhibitors. DPP-IV inhibitors are well-known and described for example in published application US20050004117, U.S. Pat. No. 6,710,040, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,645,995, which are incorporated herein by reference for their compounds. As example of a sulfonylureas (SFUs), which acts on the pancreatic tissue to produce insulin, is Glimepiride.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdjunct therapy of a metabolically stable GIP analog or hybrid or novel GIP analog or hybrid with exenatide (or other antidiabetics) will provide for increased insulinotropic responses than either alone, in patients with conditions associated with elevated glucose, such as patients with \ntype\n 2 diabetes. Such a treatment regimen leads to normalization of glucose concentrations, improvement in beta-cell function, and through their trophic activity on the 0 cells slows disease progression to obviate or lesson the need for insulin therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGIP hybrids of the invention can be useful for reducing food intake, reducing appetite, reducing caloric intake, inducing satiety, reducing nutrient availability, causing weight loss, affecting body composition, altering body energy content or energy expenditure, improving lipid profile (including reducing LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and/or changing HDL cholesterol levels), slowing gastrointestinal motility, delay gastric emptying, moderating the postprandial blood glucose excursions, preventing or inhibiting glucagon secretion, and decreasing blood pressure. In one embodiment such GIP hybrids contain an exendin, GLP1, amylin and/or sCT portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf particular interest as anti-obesity, weight reduction, food reduction, metabolic rate increasing, and body fat reduction and/or fat redistribution hybrids are those GIP-containing hybrids that contain an exendin, amylin (e.g. amylin-sCT-amylin chimera), leptin or PYY (e.g. PYY-NPY chimera) family module that can effectively reduce food intake, change body composition, redistribute fat and/or reduce body weight. In embodiments of particular interest for treating obesity and related diseases and conditions (body fat reduction) as discussed herein, are GIP hybrids comprising an exendin-4 or analog or derivative thereof, an amylin component such as pramlintide or an amylin-sCT-amylin chimera, an FN38 family member such as FN38 or an analog or derivative thereof, a PYY member such as a PYY-NPY chimera as described herein such as SEQ ID Nos. 266, 437, 438, 439, 442, 462, 469, 470, 471 and 472 of US 2006/013547A1 or the PYY-NPY chimera compound with the amino acid sequence Ile, Lys, Pro, Glu, His, Pro, Gly, Glu, Asp, Ala, Ser, Pro, Glu, Glu, Leu, Ala, Arg, Tyr, Tyr, Ala, Ser, Leu, Arg, Ala, Tyr, Ile, Asn, Leu, Ile, Thr, Arg, Gln, Arg, Tyr (SEQ ID No. 456), for example. In another embodiment, the GIP hybrid can have at least one, preferably two components, which act on the CNS. Particular areas of the forebrain (telencephalonic- and diencephalonic-derived constituents of the brain) and hindbrain or brainstem (including the midbrain, pons and medulla) have been identified as being involved in controlling energy balance. Forebrain structures or nuclei residing in the hypothalamus involved in food intake and/or body weight modulation include, for example, the arcuate nucleus (ARC), the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), the ventromedial nucleus (VMH), and the lateral hypothalamus nucleus (LHA). Hindbrain structures or nuclei residing in the brainstem involved in food intake and/or body weight modulation include, for example, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST), the area postrema (AP), and the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN). Brainstem nuclei that control the elements of the consummatory motor control system are likely controlled by primary or second order projections from brainstem regions like the NST, AP, and lPBN. It is noteworthy that the AP, NST and lPBN have all been shown to (collectively and independently) possess their own integrative abilities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of CNS-directed anti-obesity agents act upon these forebrain structures residing in the hypothalamus involved in food intake and/or body weight modulation. In addition, CNS-directed anti-obesity agents act upon hindbrain structures residing in the brainstem involved in food intake and/or body weight modulation. Examples of such anti-obesity agents are described herein. See the table below for further examples of peptide family modules that can be combined with a GIP compound to form an anti-obesity agent hybrid, and can be combined to form an anti-obesity hybrid with activity on both the forebrain and hindbrain. Such components include, for example, neuropeptide Y1 (NPY1) receptor antagonists, NPY5 receptor antagonists, leptin and leptin agonists, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and CNTF agonists, peptide YY (PYY) and PYY agonists, exendin and exendin agonists, GLP-1 and GLP-1 agonist, ghrelin and ghrelin antagonists, cholecystokinin (CCK) and CCK agonists, and amylin and amylin agonists, including those described herein. Further peptide family components and clinical guidance can be found in applicant's co-pending patent application PCT/US06/17529, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual anti-obesity targets and location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignaling\n\n\n \n\n\nFood Intake\n\n\nAnti-obesity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem\n\n\nCNS Region\n\n\nRole\n\n\nagents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeuropeptide\n\n\nForebrain\n\n\nIncreases intake\n\n\nNPY1 and NPY5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY (NPY)\n\n\n(ARC/PVN)\n\n\n \n\n\nreceptor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nantagonists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeptin\n\n\nForebrain (ARC)\n\n\nDecreases intake\n\n\nLeptin, or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nagonists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCiliary\n\n\nForebrain (ARC)\n\n\nDecreases intake\n\n\nCNTF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nneurotrophic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfactor (CNTF)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide YY\n\n\nForebrain (ARC)\n\n\nDecrease intake\n\n\nPYY(3-36)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PYY)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nagonists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon-like\n\n\nForebrain (PVN)\n\n\nDecrease intake\n\n\nExenatide and\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeptide-1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nother GLP-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(GLP-1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nligands, DPP-IV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ninhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhrelin\n\n\nForebrain (ARC)\n\n\nIncrease intake\n\n\nGhrelin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nantagonists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCholecysto-\n\n\nHindbrain (AP)\n\n\nDecrease intake\n\n\nCCK agonists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkinin (CCK)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmylin\n\n\nHindbrain (AP)\n\n\nDecrease intake\n\n\nAmylin agonists,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPramlintide,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\namylin analogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelanocortins\n\n\nForebrain\n\n\nAgonists decrease\n\n\nMC4 agonists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(MC)\n\n\n(PVN/ARC)\n\n\nintake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the GIP hybrid is an anti-obesity agent that can include one or more predominantly forebrain acting peptide family components in addition to a GIP compound. In other embodiments, the hybrid is an anti-obesity agent that can include one or more predominantly hindbrain acting anti-obesity agents. Exemplary peptide families and components are an NPY1 receptor antagonist, an NPY5 receptor antagonist, a leptin or a leptin agonist or analog, a CNTF, an NPY2 receptor agonist (e.g., a PYY(3-36) or a PYY(3-36) agonist), an exendin or an exendin agonist or analog, a GLP-1 or a GLP-1 agonist or analog, a ghrelin antagonist, a CCK or a CCK agonist or analog, and an amylin or an amylin agonist or analog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the GIP hybrid and method for it use include a first component that predominantly targets the energy balance centers of the hypothalamus, such as the ARC, PVN, VM, and LH. In one embodiment the GIP hybrid further contains one or more other peptide family component that also target the hypothalamus but at a different location or via a different mechanism of action than the first component. When the GIP hybrid contains more than one other peptide family component and these also target the hypothalamus, the more than one other peptide family components may target the same location via the same mechanism of action as each other, or they may target different locations and/or different mechanisms of action. In another embodiment, the GIP hybrid then contains one or more other peptide family components that provide one or more additional beneficial therapeutic effects as desired, including an anti-obesity effect via a location or mechanism of action different than the first component and each other, control of blood glucose, cardioprotection, and/or control of hypertension. In certain embodiments, the additional peptide family component is one that predominantly targets the energy balance centers of the hindbrain such as the NST, the AP and the lPBN.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the GIP hybrid and method for it use include a first component that predominantly targets the energy balance centers of the hindbrain such as the NST, the AP and the lPBN.

In certain embodiments, the additional peptide family component is one that predominantly targets the energy balance centers of the hypothalamus, such as the ARC, PVN, VM, and LH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an anti-obesity agent that “acts on a forebrain structure involved in food intake and/or body weight modulation” stimulates or suppresses activity of a particular region, e.g., particular nuclei and/or neuronal circuits, in the forebrain. This forebrain stimulation or suppression leads to a reduction in nutrient availability to the body. An anti-obesity agent that “acts on a hindbrain structure involved in food intake and/or body weight modulation” stimulates or suppresses activity of a particular region, e.g., particular nuclei and/or neuronal circuits, in the hindbrain. This hindbrain stimulation or suppression results in a reduction in nutrient availability to the body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, methods for reducing fat mass by increasing the metabolic rate in a subject are provided, where the methods comprise administering an anti-obesity GIP hybrid in amounts effective to reduce fat mass by increasing the subject's metabolic rate. Fat mass can be expressed as a percentage of the total body mass. In some aspects, the fat mass is reduced by at least 1%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, or at least 25% over the course of treatment. In one aspect, the subject's lean mass is not decreased over the course of the treatment. In another aspect, the subject's lean mass is maintained or increased over the course of the treatment. In another aspect, the subject is on a reduced calorie diet or restricted diet. By “reduced calorie diet” is meant that the subject is ingesting fewer calories per day than compared to the same subject's normal diet. In one instance, the subject is consuming at least 50 fewer calories per day. In other instances, the subject is consuming at least 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, or 1000 fewer calories per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, methods of use in altering fat distribution, reducing fat mass, or both in a subject are provided. Accordingly, subjects for whom altering body composition is of benefit can also benefit from the present methods. Altered body composition, as intended herein, includes loss or maintenance of body fat, with minimization of loss, maintenance, or gain of lean body mass. In such situations, weight may increase as well as decrease. Accordingly, subjects may be lean, overweight, or obese as these terms are generally used in the art. Methods provided may also include reducing fat in non-adipose tissue while sparing lean mass. Uses for this method include treating diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or lipodystrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a method for altering the fat distribution in a subject is provided where the method comprises administering an anti-obesity GIP hybrid in amounts effective to alter fat distribution in the subject. In one aspect, the alteration results from an increased metabolism of visceral or ectopic fat, or both in the subject. By “fat distribution” is meant the location of fat deposits in the body. Such locations of fat deposition include, for example, subcutaneous, visceral and ectopic fat depots. By “subcutaneous fat” is meant the deposit of lipids just below the skin's surface. The amount of subcutaneous fat in a subject can be measured using any method available for the measurement of subcutaneous fat. Methods of measuring subcutaneous fat are known in the art, for example, those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,530,886, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. By “ectopic fat storage” is meant lipid deposits within and around tissues and organs that constitute the lean body mass (e.g., skeletal muscle, heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, blood vessels). Generally, ectopic fat storage is an accumulation of lipids outside classical adipose tissue depots in the body. By “visceral fat” is meant the deposit of fat as intra-abdominal adipose tissue. Visceral fat surrounds vital organs and can be metabolized by the liver to produce blood cholesterol. Visceral fat has been associated with increased risks of conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. In some embodiments, the method involves the metabolism of visceral or ectopic fat or both at a rate of at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, or 50% greater than for subcutaneous fat. In one aspect, the methods result in a favorable fat distribution. In one embodiment, favorable fat distribution is an increased ratio of subcutaneous fat to visceral fat, ectopic fat, or both. In one aspect, the method involves an increase in lean body mass, for example, as a result of an increase in muscle cell mass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, methods for reducing the amount of subcutaneous fat in a subject are provided, wherein the method comprises administering, to a subject in need thereof, an anti-obesity GIP hybrid in amounts effective to reduce the amount of subcutaneous fat in the subject. In one instance, the amount of subcutaneous fat is reduced in a subject by at least about 5%. In other instances, the amount of subcutaneous fat is reduced by at least about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% 40%, or 50% compared to the subject prior to administration of the anti-obesity hybrid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods described herein can be used to reduce the amount of visceral fat in a subject. In one instance, the visceral fat is reduced in a subject by at least about 5%. In other instances, the visceral fat is reduced in the subject by at least about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% 40%, or 50% compared to the subject prior to administration of the anti-obesity GIP hybrid. Visceral fat can be measured through any means available to determine the amount of visceral fat in a subject. Such methods include, for example, abdominal tomography by means of CT scanning and MRI. Other methods for determining visceral fat are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,864,415, 6,850,797, and 6,487,445.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a method for preventing the accumulation of ectopic fat or reducing the amount of ectopic fat in a subject is provided, wherein the method comprises administering, to a subject in need thereof, an anti-obesity GIP hybrid in amounts effective to prevent accumulation of ectopic fat or to reduce the amount of ectopic fat in the subject. In one instance, the amount of ectopic fat is reduced in a subject by at least about 5% compared to the subject prior to administration of the anti-obesity hybrid. In other instances, the amount of ectopic fat is reduced in a subject by at least about 10%, or by at least about 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% 40%, or 50%. Alternatively, the amount of ectopic fat is proportionally reduced 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% in comparison to subcutaneous fat in a subject. Ectopic fat can be measured in a subject using any method available for measuring ectopic fat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, methods are provided for producing a more favorable fat distribution in a subject, where the method comprises administering to a subject a GIP hybrid that is effective as an anti-obesity agent in an amount effective to produce a favorable fat distribution. In one embodiment, administration of an anti-obesity GIP hybrid reduces the amount of visceral fat or ectopic fat, or both, in a subject. In one embodiment is administered an anti-obesity hybrid that comprises at least one family module that acts upon forebrain structures involved in food intake or body weight modulation or both in combination with at least one family module that acts upon hindbrain structures involved in food intake or body weight modulation or both. In one embodiment, the methods preferentially reduce the amount of visceral or ectopic fat, or a combination of both, over the reduction in subcutaneous fat. Such methods result in a higher ratio of subcutaneous fat to visceral fat or ectopic fat. Such improved ratios may result in a reduced risk of the development of cardiovascular diseases, polycystic ovary syndrome, metabolic syndrome, or any combinations thereof. In one embodiment, ectopic or visceral fat is metabolized at a \nrate\n 5% greater than subcutaneous fat. In other embodiments, ectopic or visceral fat is metabolized at a rate at least 10% 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% greater than subcutaneous fat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf particular interest for anti-obesity, body weight and fat composition related treatments as discussed herein are GIP hybrids containing an exendin, amylin (e.g. amylin-sCT-amylin chimera), leptin and/or PPF (e.g. PYY analogs or PPY/NPY chimera) family modules. In yet a further embodiment a GIP hybrid contains at least two of these peptide family modules. The GIP hybrid can be administered either alone or in combination with a second anti-obesity agent such as an amylin. Leptin, PYY or exendin family peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn still another aspect, provided is a method for the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a GIP hybrid effective as an anti-obesity agent administered in combination with glucocorticosteroids. Glucocorticosteroids have the adverse effect of increasing fat mass and decreasing lean mass. Accordingly, it is contemplated that the anti-obesity agent combination can be used in conjunction with glucocorticosteroids under conditions where glucocorticosteroid use is beneficial, in order to counteract the adverse effect of the glucocoriticosteroid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein, a GIP hybrid of the invention can be administered separately or together with one or more other agents in order to obtain additional benefits or to enhance the effect of either the hybrid or the other agent. For example, an anti-obesity GIP hybrid can be administered with an anti-obesity agent or a cardioprotective or anti-hypertension agent, depending on the risk factors pertinent to the subject in need of treatment and desired treatment outcome. Exemplary anti-obesity agents for administration (either separately or mixed; either prior to, concomitantly or after) with a hybrid include serotonin (5HT) transport inhibitors, including, but not limited to, paroxetine, fluoxetine, fenfluramine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, and imipramine. Anti-obesity agents also include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including, but not limited to dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine, sibutramine (e.g., MERIDIA®) and those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,365,633 and PCT Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 01/27060 and WO 01/162341, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Such 5HT transport inhibitors and serotonin reuptake inhibitors, analogs, derivatives, preparations, formulations, pharmaceutical compositions, doses, and administration routes have previously been described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-obesity agents also include selective serotonin agonists and selective 5-HT2C receptor agonists, including, but not limited to, U.S. Pat. No. 3,914,250; and PCT Application Publication Nos. WO 02/36596, WO 02/48124, WO 02/10169, WO 01/66548, WO 02/44152; WO 02/51844, WO 02/40456, and WO 02/40457, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Such selective serotonin agonists and 5-HT2C receptor agonists, compositions containing such agonists, and administration routes appropriate for use in the methods provided are known in the art. See, for example, Halford et al. (2005) Curr. Drug Targets 6:201-213 and Weintraub et al. (1984) Arch. Intern. Med. 144:1143-1148.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-obesity agents also include antagonists/inverse agonists of the central cannabinoid receptors (the CB-1 receptors), including, but not limited to, rimonabant (Sanofi Synthelabo), and SR-147778 (Sanofi Synthelabo). CB-1 antagonists/inverse agonsits, derivatives, preparations, formulations, pharmaceutical compositions, doses, and administration routes have previously been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,344,474, 6,028,084, 5,747,524, 5,596,106, 5,532,237, 4,973,587, 5,013,837, 5,081,122, 5,112,820, 5,292,736, 5,624,941; European Patent Application Nos.

The receptor MC4R appears to play a role in energy balance and obesity. See, for example, Anderson et al., Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 11:1583-1592 (2001), Speake et al., Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 12:1631-1638 (2002), Bednarek et al., Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 14:327-336 (2004).

WO 01/87335 and WO 02/08250. Ghrelin antagonists are also known as GHS (growth hormone secretagogue receptor) antagonists. The compositions and methods provided therefore contemplate the use GHS antagonists in place of ghrelin antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-obesity agents include obestatin and obestatin analogs and agonists. Obestatin is a peptide derived from the same precursor from which ghrelin is derived, preproghrelin. See, for example, Zhang et al. (2005) Science 310: 996-999; Nogueiras et al. (2005) Science 310: 985-986; Pan et al. (2006) Peptides 27:911-916. In contrast to the activity of ghrelin, obestatin appears to act as an anorexic hormone by decreasing food intake, gastric emptying activities, jejunal motility, and body weight gain. Obestatin peptides of use include, but are not limited to those described in Zhang et al. (2005) Science 310: 996-999.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnd the amylinomimetics, e.g. pramlintide, amylin-sCT-amylin, incretins, e.g. exendin-4, and PYY analogs, are anti-obesity agents that also can be administered as an anti-obesity agents with a GIP hybrid. For example, a GIP-leptin hybrid may be administered with exendin-4, a PYY analog, and/or an amylin analog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in certain embodiments, the hybrids of the invention are useful for treating or preventing conditions or disorders which can be alleviated by reducing nutrient availability comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Such conditions and disorders include, but are not limited to, eating disorders, insulin-resistance, obesity, abnormal postprandial hyperglycemia, diabetes of any kind, including Type I, Type II, and gestational diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome, Dumping Syndrome, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, cancer, pulmonary hypertension, cholecystitis, and osteoarthritis. In one embodiment such hybrids contain an exendin, GLP1, amylin and/or sCT portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-limiting examples of a cardiovascular condition or disease are hypertension, myocardial ischemia, and myocardial reperfusion. Compounds of the invention may also be useful in treating or preventing other conditions associated with obesity including stroke, cancer (e.g., endometrial, breast, prostate, and colon cancer), gallbladder disease, sleep apnea, reduced fertility, and osteoarthritis, (see Lyznicki et al, Am. Fam. Phys. 63:2185, 2001). In other embodiments, compounds of the invention may be used to alter body composition for aesthetic reasons, to enhance one's physical capabilities, or to produce a leaner meat source. Hybrids are useful to change body composition by decreasing fat without significant decrease in muscle mass, thus producing a desirable loss of body fat while preserving lean body mass. In one embodiment such hybrids contain an exendin, GLP1, amylin and/or sCT portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect of the invention, methods for treating or preventing obesity are provided, wherein the method comprises administering a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a hybrid polypeptide to a subject in need thereof. In a exemplary embodiment, the subject is an obese or overweight subject. While “obesity” is generally defined as a body mass index over 30, for purposes of this disclosure, any subject, including those with a body mass index of less than 30, who needs or wishes to reduce body weight is included in the scope of “obese.” Subjects who are insulin resistant, glucose intolerant, or have any form of diabetes mellitus (e.g., \n \ntype\n \n 1, 2 or gestational diabetes) can benefit from these hybrids. In one embodiment such GIP hybrids contain an exendin, PYY, GLP1, amylin and/or sCT portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other aspects of the invention, methods of reducing food intake, reducing nutrient availability, causing weight loss, affecting body composition, and altering body energy content or increasing energy expenditure, treating diabetes mellitus, and improving lipid profile (including reducing LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and/or changing HDL cholesterol levels) are provided, wherein the methods comprise administering to a subject an effective amount of a hybrid polypeptide of the invention. In a exemplary embodiment, the methods of the invention are used to treat or prevent conditions or disorders which can be alleviated by reducing nutrient availability in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a hybrid polypeptide of the invention. Such conditions and disorders include, but are not limited to, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, eating disorders, insulin-resistance, obesity, and diabetes mellitus of any kind In one embodiment such hybrids contain an exendin, PYY, GLP1, amylin and/or sCT portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment in which a PPF or PYY family member comprises a GIP-hybrid component, and without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the effects of such peripherally-administered GIP hybrid polypeptides in the reduction of food intake, in the delay of gastric emptying, in the reduction of nutrient availability, and in the causation of weight loss are determined by interactions with one or more unique receptor classes in, or similar to, those in the PP family. More particularly, it appears that a receptor or receptors similar to the PYY-preferring (or Y7) receptors are involved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional assays useful to the invention include those that can determine the effect of GIP hybrid compounds, particularly those containing an exendin, PPF, PYY, GLP1, amylin and/or sCT portion, on body composition. An exemplary assay can be one that involves utilization of a diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model for metabolic disease. Prior to the treatment period, male C57BL/6J mice can be fed a high-fat diet (#D12331, 58% of calories from fat; Research Diets, Inc.,) for 6 weeks beginning at 4 weeks of age. During the study, the mice can continue to eat their high-fat diet. Water can be provided ad libitum throughout the study. One group of similarly-aged non-obese mice can be fed a low-fat diet (#D12329, 11% of calories from fat) for purposes of comparing metabolic parameters to DIO groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDIO mice can be implanted with subcutaneous (SC) intrascapular osmotic pumps to deliver either vehicle (50% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in water) or a compound of the invention. The pumps of the latter group can be set to deliver any amount, e.g., 1000 μg/kg/d of a compound of the invention for 7-28 days. Body weights and food intake can be measured over regular intervals throughout the study periods. Respiratory quotient (RQ, defined as CO\n2 \nproduction÷O\n2 \nconsumption) and metabolic rate can be determined using whole-animal indirect calorimetry (Oxymax, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, Ohio). The mice can be euthanized by isoflurane overdose, and an index of adiposity (bilateral epididymal fat pad weight) measured. Moreover, prior to determination of epididymal weight, body composition (lean mass, fat mass) for each mouse can be analyzed using a Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) instrument per manufacturer's instructions (Lunar Piximus, GE Imaging System). In the methods of the invention, GIP hybrids, particularly those comprising an exendin, PPF, PYY, GLP1, amylin and/or sCT portion having a potency in one of the assays described herein (preferably food intake, gastric emptying, pancreatic secretion, weight reduction or body composition assays) which is greater than the potency of a component peptide hormone in that same assay, can be identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the amelioration of hypertension in subjects in need thereof as a result of reduced food intake, weight loss, or treating obesity, compounds of the invention may be used to treat hypotension.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another general aspect, hybrids of the invention may be used to inhibit the secretion of ghrelin. Accordingly, compounds of the invention may be utilize this mechanism to treat or prevent ghrelin related disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome, diabetes of all types and its complications, obesity, hyperphagia, hyperlipidemia, or other disorders associated with hypernutrition. In one embodiment such hybrids contain an exendin, GLP1, amylin and/or sCT portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention may also be useful for potentiating, inducing, enhancing or restoring glucose responsivity in pancreatic islets or cells. These actions may be useful for treating or preventing conditions associated with metabolic disorders such as those described above and in U.S. patent application no. US2004/0228846. Assays for determining such activity are known in the art. For example, in published U.S. patent application no. US2004/0228846 (incorporated by reference in its entirety), assays are described for islet isolation and culture as well as determining fetal islet maturation. In the examples of patent application US2004/0228846, intestine-derived hormone peptides including pancreatic polypeptide (PP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), neuropeptide K (NPK), PYY, secretin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and bombesin were purchased from Sigma. Collagenase type XI was obtained from Sigma. \nRPMI\n 1640 culture medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Gibco. A radioimmunoassay kit containing anti-insulin antibody ([\n125\nI]-RIA kit) was purchased from Linco, St Louis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPost-partem rat islets were obtained from P-02 year old rats. Adult rat islets were obtained from 6-8 week old rats. Fetal rat islets were obtained as follows. Pregnant female rats were sacrificed on pregnancy day E21. Fetuses were removed from the uterus. 10-14 pancreata were dissected from each litter and washed twice in Hanks buffer. The pancreata were pooled, suspended in 6 \nml\n 1 mg/ml collagenase (Type XI, Sigma) and incubated at 37° C. for 8-10 minutes with constant shaking. The digestion was stopped by adding 10 volumes of ice-cold Hanks buffer followed by three washes with Hanks buffer. The islets were then purified by Ficoll gradient and cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/RPMI medium with or without addition of 1 μM IBMX. At the end of five days, 20 islets were hand picked into each tube and assayed for static insulin release. Generally, islets were first washed with KRP buffer and then incubated with 1 ml of KRP buffer containing 3 mM (low) glucose for 30 minutes at 37° C. with constant shaking After collecting the supernatant, the islets were then incubated with 17 mM (high) glucose for one hour at 37° C. The insulin released from low or high glucose stimulation were assayed by radioimmunoassay (RIA) using the [\n125\nI]-RIA kit. E21 fetal islets were cultured for 5 days in the presence of 200 ng/ml PYY, PP, CCK, NPK, NPY, Secretin, GLP-1 or Bombesin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary in vivo assay is also provided using the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) male rat, an inbred (>F30 Generations) rat model that spontaneously expresses diabetes in all fa/fa males fed a standard rodent diet Purina 5008. In ZDF fa-fa males, hyperglycemia begins to develop at about seven weeks of age and glucose levels (fed) typically reach 500 mg/DL by 10 to 11 weeks of age. Insulin levels (fed) are high during the development of diabetes. However, by 19 weeks of age insulin drops to about the level of lean control litter mates. Triglyceride and cholesterol levels of obese rats are normally higher than those of leans. In the assay, three groups of 7-week old ZDF rats, with 6 rats per group, received the infusion treatment by ALZA pump for 14 days: 1) vehicle control, 2) and 3), PYY with two different doses, 100 pmol/kg/hr and 500 pmol/kg/hr respectively. Four measurements were taken before the infusion and after the infusion at \nday\n 7 and day 14: 1) plasma glucose level, 2) plasma insulin level, and 3) plasma triglycerides (TG) level, as well as oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) test. Accordingly, these assays can be used with compounds of the invention to test for desired activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHybrids are also useful for the therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of neurological and nervous system disorders associated with neuronal loss or dysfunction, including, but not limited to, Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, ALS, stroke, ADD, and neuropsychiatric syndromes, and to enhance or facilitate learning, memory and cognition in mammals. Particularly useful in this regard are GIP hybrids containing an exendin or GLP1 active portion, more specifically comprising at least the N-terminal 7-15 amino acids or analog thereof, for example HSEGTFTSD (SEQ ID NO. 94).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther uses contemplated for the hybrid polypeptides include methods for reducing aluminum (Al) concentrations in the central nervous system (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,734,166, incorporated by reference in its entirety) for treating, preventing, or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Assays for determining effects on Al are known in the art and can be found in US Pat 6,734,166 using diploid and Ts mice. These mice were individually housed in Nalgene® brand metabolism or polypropylene cages and given three days to adjust to the cages before experimentation. Mice had free access to food (LabDiet® NIH Rat and Moust/Auto 6F5K52, St. Louis, Mo.) and water during the experiment except for the 16 hours prior to euthanasia when no food was provided. Mice were given daily subcutaneous injections of either active compound or saline. Mice were sacrificed at the end of \nday\n 13 for one experiment and \nday\n 3 for another, and samples were collected. Mice brain samples were weighted in clean teflon liners and prepared for analysis by microwave digestion in low trace element grade nitric acid. Samples were then analyzed for Al content using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (Nuttall et al., \nAnnals of Clinical and \n \nLaboratory Science\n \n \n25, 3, 264-271 (1995)). All tissue handling during analysis took place in a clean room environment utilizing HEPA air filtration systems to minimize background contamination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHybrids of the invention are useful for prevention and treatment of nephropathy, including hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy, and nephropathy associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Hybrids achieve these ends by, among other things, improving or preventing worsening of hypertension, endothelial function, renal function, and glomerulosclerosis. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for preventing or treating nephropathy, including hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy, or that related to insulin resistance, comprising administering a compound of the invention. Hybrids find further use for improving endothelial function in a patient having reduced vasodilatory capacity, or having glomerulosclerosis or any other reduction in glomerular flow. Such improvement in endothelial function serves both to reduce hypertension and to improve the function of the capillaries of the glomeruli. In additional embodiments, the molecules of the invention are useful to prevent progression of nephropathy to ESRD, to prevent, slow the progression of, treat or ameliorate proteinuria and/or glomerulosclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHybrids are useful for reducing the risk of suffering from, preventing, or treating cardiac arrhythmias. Hybrids can provide anti-arrhythmic effects in patients with cardiac ischemia, cardiac ischemia-reperfusion, and congestive heart failure. For example, incretin GLP-1 has been found to reduce cardiac injury and enhance recovery in patients with these disorders. Incretins, including GLP-1, are glucose-dependent insulinotropic hormones. GLP-1 and exendin effectively enhance peripheral glucose uptake without inducing dangerous hypoglycemia. They also strongly suppress glucagon secretion, independent of its insulinotropic action, and thereby powerfully reduce plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels substantially more than can be accomplished with insulin. High FFA levels have been implicated as a major toxic mechanism during myocardial ischemia. In another embodiment hybrids are useful for preventing and treating cardiac arrhythmias that reliably reduce injury associated with reperfusion and ischemia, and enhance patient recovery. In yet a further embodiment hybrid treatment after acute stroke or hemorrhage, preferably intravenous administration, provides a means for optimizing insulin secretion, increasing brain anabolism, enhancing insulin effectiveness by suppressing glucagon, and maintaining euglycemia or mild hypoglycemia with no risk of severe hypoglycemia or other adverse side effects. In one embodiment such GIP hybrids contain a GLP1 or exendin portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet a further embodiment, hybrids that are capable of lowering insulin resistance or increasing insulin sensitivity are useful to treat polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Administering hybrids of the invention can reduce or prevent insulin resistance in a subject suffering from PCOS. In yet another embodiment hybrids prevent the onset of type-2 diabetes in a subject suffering from PCOS. Further hybrids can restore regular menses, ovulation, or fertility in a subject suffering from PCOS. In one embodiment such GIP hybrids contain a GLP1 or an exendin portion for binding and activating a GLP1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy selection of hormone component modules the compounds of the invention can exhibit a broad range of biological activities, some related to their antisecretory and antimotility properties. The compounds may suppress gastrointestinal secretions by direct interaction with epithelial cells or, perhaps, by inhibiting secretion of hormones or neurotransmitters which stimulate intestinal secretion. Anti-secretory properties include inhibition of gastric and/or pancreatic secretions and can be useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases and disorders including gastritis, pancreatitis, Barrett's esophagus, and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, as well as conditions associated therewith including heartburn, heartburn accompanied by regurgitation of gastric/intestinal contents into the mouth or the lungs, difficulty in swallowing, coughing, intermittent wheezing and vocal cord inflammation (conditions associated with GERD), esophageal erosion, esophageal ulcer, esophageal stricture, Barrett's metaplasia (replacement of normal esophageal epithelium with abnormal epithelium), Barrett's espohageal adenocarcinoma, and pulmonary aspiration. In another embodiment GIP hybrids containing amylin and/or sCT portions can be useful for treating or preventing these diseases and conditions, such as Barrett's esophagus, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and conditions associated therewith as disclosed herein. Such hybrids have particularly effective anti-secretory properties, such as inhibition of gastric acids, inhibition of bile acids, and inhibition of pancreatic enzymes. Moreover, such hybrids can have a gastroprotective effect, which renders them particularly useful in the treatment or prevention of intestinal diseases and conditions and of Barrett's esophagus, and/or GERD and related or associated conditions as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are useful in the treatment of any number of gastrointestinal disorders (see e.g., Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, McGraw-Hill Inco, N.Y., 12th Ed.) that are associated with excess intestinal electrolyte and water secretion as well as decreased absorption, e.g., infectious diarrhea, inflammatory diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, or the diarrhea which typically occurs following surgical procedures, e.g., ileostomy. Examples of infectious diarrhea include, without limitation, acute viral diarrhea, acute bacterial diarrhea (e.g., \nsalmonella, campylobacter\n, and \nclostridium \nor due to protozoal infections), or traveller's diarrhea (e.g., Norwalk virus or rotavirus). Examples of inflammatory diarrhea include, without limitation, malabsorption syndrome, tropical sprue, chronic pancreatitis, Crohn's disease, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome. It has also been discovered that the peptides of the invention can be used to treat an emergency or life-threatening situation involving a gastrointestinal disorder, e.g., after surgery or due to cholera.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention may also be useful for treating or preventing intestinal, including gastrointestinal, damage as opposed to merely treating the symptoms associated with the intestinal damage (for example, diarrhea). Such damage to the intestine may be, or a result of, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, bowel atrophy, loss bowel mucosa, and/or loss of bowel mucosal function (see WO 03/105763, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Assays for such activity, as described in WO 03/105763, include 11 week old male HSD rats, ranging 250-300 grams housed in a 12:12 light:dark cycle, and allowed ad libitum access to a standard rodent diet (Teklad LM 485, Madison, Wis.) and water. The animals were fasted for 24 hours before the experiment. A simple and reproducible rat model of chronic colonic inflammation has been previously described by Morris G P, et al., “Hapten-induced model of chronic inflammation and ulceration in the rat colon.” Gastroenterology. 1989; 96:795-803. It exhibits a relatively long duration of inflammation and ulceration, affording an opportunity to study the pathophysiology of colonic inflammatory disease in a specifically controlled fashion, and to evaluate new treatments potentially applicable to inflammatory bowel disease in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRats were anesthetized with 3% isofluorane and placed on a regulated heating pad set at 37° C. A gavage needle was inserted rectally into the \ncolon\n 7 cm. The hapten trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 50% ethanol (v/v) was delivered into the lumen of the colon through the gavage needle at a dose of 30 mg/kg, in a total volume of 0 0.4-0.6 mL, as described in Mazelin, et al., “Protective role of vagal afferents in experimentally-induced colitis in rats.” \nJuton Nery Syst. \n73:38-45 (1998). Control groups received saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) intracolonically. Four days after induction of colitis, the colon was resected from anesthetized rats, which were then euthanized by decapitation. Weights of excised colon and spleen were measured, and the colons photographed for scoring of gross morphologic damage. Inflammation was defined as regions of hyperemia and bowel wall thickening.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, GIP hybrids can be useful for treating or preventing pancreatitis, pancreatic carcinoma, and gastritis, particularly in the treatment and prevention of pancreatitis in patients who have undergone endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Amylin and/or sCT containing GIP hybrid agonists can have a surprisingly superior therapeutic effect when combined with somatostatin. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, methods for treating or preventing pancreatitis comprise administering such hybrids and administering somatostatin and somatostatin agonists to a subject. Hybrid polypeptides of the invention may also be used to treat or prevent Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma or pancreatic tumors (e.g., inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic tumors). Methods of the invention include reducing the proliferation of tumor cells. The types of benign pancreatic tumor cells which may be treated in accordance with the present invention include serous cyst adenomas, microcystic tumors, and solid-cystic tumors. The method is also effective in reducing the proliferation of malignant pancreatic tumor cells such as carcinomas arising from the ducts, acini, or islets of the pancreas. Particularly useful GIP hybrids in this regard are those comprising a hormone module component of the PYY or PPF family. U.S. Pat. No. 5,574,010 (incorporated by reference in its entirety) provides exemplary assays for testing anti-proliferative properties. For example, the '010 patent provides that PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 are two human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cancer cell lines which are available commercially from suppliers such as American Type Culture Collection, ATCC (Rockville, Md.). The two tumor cells were grown in RPMI-1640 culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 29.2 mg/L of glutamine, 25 μg gentamicin, 5 ml penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone solution (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, Kans.) at 37 degrees Celcius in a NAPCO water jacketed 5% CO\n2 \nincubator. All cell lines were detached with 0.25% trypsin (Clonetics, San Diego, Calif.) once to twice a week when a confluent monolayer of tumor cells was achieved. Cells were pelleted for 7 minutes at 500 g in a refrigerated centrifuge at 4 degrees Celcius, and resuspended in trypsin free \nfortified RPMI\n 1640 culture media. Viable cells were counted on a hemocytometer slide with trypan blue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTen thousand, 20,000, 40,000 and 80,000 cells of each type were added to 96 well microculture plates (Costar, Cambridge, Mass.) in a total volume of 200 ul of culture media per well. Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 hours prior to addition of the PYY or test peptide. Fresh culture media was exchanged prior to addition of peptides. In vitro incubation of pancreatic tumor cells with either PYY or test compound was continued for 6 hours and 36 hours in length. PYY was added to cells at doses of 250 pmol, 25 pmol, and 2.5 pmol per well (N=14). Test compound was added to cells cultures at doses of 400 pmol, 40 pmol, and 4 pmol per well. Control wells received 2 ul of 0.9% saline to mimic the volume and physical disturbance upon adhered tumor cells. Each 96 well plate contained 18 control wells to allow for comparison within each plate during experimentation. Ninety-six (96) well plates were repeated 6 times with varying concentrations of PYY and test compound in both the PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the end of the incubation period, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, MTr tetrazolium bromide (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) was added to fresh culture media at 0.5 mg/ml. Culture media was exchanged and tumor cells were incubated for 4 hours with MTT tetrazolium bromide at 37° C. At the end of incubation, culture media was aspirated. Formazon crystal precipitates were dissolved in 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). Quantitation of solubilized formazon was performed by obtaining absorption readings at 500 nm wavelength on an ELISA reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, Calif.). The MTT assay measures mitochondrial NADH dependent dehydrogenase activity, and it has been among the most sensitive and reliable method to quantitative in vitro chemotherapy responses of tumor cells. (Alley, M. C., et al., \nCancer Res., \n48:589-601, 1988; Carmichael, J., et al., \nCancer Res., \n47:936-942, 1987; McHale, A. P., et al., \nCancer Lett., \n41:315-321, 1988; and Saxton, R. E., et al., \nJ. Clin. Laser Med. and Surg., \n10(5):331-336, 1992.) Analysis of absorption readings at 550 nm were analyzed by grouping wells of the same test conditions and verifying differences occurring between control and the various peptide concentration treatments by one-way ANOVA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary in vivo assay is also provided. The human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Mia Paca-2 was examined for in vivo growth inhibition by peptide YY and test compound. Seventy thousand to 100,000 human Mia PaCa-2 cells were orthotopically transplanted into 48 male athymic mice. After one week, the animals were treated with either PYY or test compound at 200 pmol/kg/hr via mini-osmotic pumps for four weeks. The paired cultures received saline. At sacrifice, both tumor size and mass were measured. Control mice had significant human cancer growth within the pancreas as evidenced by histologic sections. At 9 weeks, ninety percent (90%) of control mice had substantial metastatic disease. Tumor mass was decreased by 60.5% in test treated mice and 27% in PYY treated mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another general aspect, hybrids are useful for decreasing bone resorption, decreasing plasma calcium, and/or inducing an analgesic effect, particularly to treat bone disorders such as osteopenia and osteoporosis. In yet other embodiments, hybrids are useful to treat pain and painful neuropathy. In one embodiment such hybrids contain an exendin, GLP1, amylin and/or sCT portion. For example, a GIP-sCT or GIP-amylin/sCT hybrid compound of the invention can have a selectable property of a salmon calcitonin or amylin/sCT/Amylin chimera, such as decreasing bone loss and bone resorption or reducing cartilage turnover (chondroprotection), and a property of a GIP, such as plasma glucose lowering (concomitant with an anti-catabolic aspect as described herein) and/or inhibiting bone resorption and maintaining or increasing bone density. A GIP hybrid with such selectable properties can enhance treatment of osteoporosis or conditions of high cartilage turnover, particularly in those who can also benefit from glycemic control, such as subjects with diabetes or under going critical care.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGIP compounds, particularly GIP analogs, extended half-life GIP hybrids (e.g. DPP-IV cleavage resistant (such as a D-Ala2, N-Acetyl or N-pyroglutamyl analogs) optionally further comprising a peptidic enhancer such as a heterologous C-terminal tail, and GIP hybrids comprising other hormone modules known to provide beneficial cardiovascular effects, are useful to treat cardiovascular disease and related conditions. As demonstrated herein GIP compounds increase cardiac contractility (dP/dt), decrease blood pressure (for example by acute vasodilatation), decrease systolic pressure, decrease diastolic pressure, and can provide a direct beneficial action on cardiac cells. GIP compounds also improve cardiac function via metabolic actions, e.g. glucose lowering, insulin secretion, beta cell proliferation. By also providing direct effects on the cardiovascular system, the GIP compounds are surprisingly even more therapeutically beneficial.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, provided herein are methods to treat, prevent or alleviate cardiovascular diseases and conditions by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a GIP compound, either alone or with another agent that provides cardiovascular benefit, to a patient in need of such treatment. As with the other conditions discussed throughout this specification, a GIP compound can be administered concurrently, sequentially or alternately with another agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in one embodiment the cardiovascular disease or condition is hypertension (including \nstage\n 1, \nstage\n 2 and \nstage\n 3 hypertension, diastolic or systolic), pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiac insufficiency, reduced stroke volume, cardiomyopathy (dilated, hypertrophic or restrictive), decreased cardiac contractility, pulmonary congestion associated with cardiovascular conditions, pulmonary and systemic edema, decreased cardiac output, abnormal left ventricular function, diastolic blood pressure abnormalities, renal failure associated with decreased cardiac contractility, increased cardiovascular risk (e.g. associated with elevated systolic pressure accompanied by normal diastolic pressure, associated with elevated diastolic pressure accompanied by normal systolic pressure, associated with elevated diastolic and systolic pressure, associated with elevated mean arterial blood pressure) and non-ischemic or ischemic heart tissue degeneration (such as from myocardial infarction). In one embodiment either or both the mortality or the morbidity associated with these diseases and conditions are reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe patient in need of treatment includes those who are diabetic (e.g. suffering from diabetic cardiomyopathy), obese, undergoing intensive care, undergoing surgery, or a combination thereof, or who are otherwise normal. The patient may have had or be at risk of having such a disease or condition. For example, patients post myocardial infarction that are in need of preventing further heart failure can benefit from the methods herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreventing a disease or condition, e.g., a cardiovascular disease or condition, includes preventing the initiation of, delaying the initiation of, preventing the progression or advancement of, slowing the progression or advancement of, delaying the progression or advancement of, and reversing the progression of the disease or condition from an advanced to a less advanced stage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the method provides treating or delaying the onset of such diseases or conditions. For example, impaired contractility can decrease stroke volume which in turn can precipitate congestive heart failure. Thus in one embodiment treating heart failure refers to treating any one or more of the conditions underlying heart failure, including, without limitation, decreased cardiac contractility, abnormal diastolic compliance, reduced stroke volume, high blood pressure, pulmonary congestion, and decreased cardiac output.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment is provided a method for inducing an inotropic response, for reducing blood pressure, for reducing diastolic pressure, for reducing diastolic pressure, increasing vasodilation, or a any combination of the above, with or without a concomitant beneficial metabolic action of a GIP such as glucose lowering, insulin secretion, or beta cell proliferation, comprising administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a GIP compound to provide such desired beneficial action. These methods are useful for treating conditions or disorders that can be alleviated by an increase in cardiac contractility, a reduction in blood pressure, a reduction in diastolic pressure, a reduction in diastolic pressure, an increase in vasodilation, or a combination of the above, in patients in need of such benefits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInotropic compounds are compounds that induce inotropic effects (e.g., increase of force of contraction of the heart) have been recognized as being useful for the treatment of, for example, congestive heart failure. Congestive heart failure, which is one of the most common causes of death and disability in industrialized nations, has a mortality rate of about 50% at five years (Goodman and Gilman s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Ed. McGraw Hill, N.Y., pp. 809-838). Criteria, testing and guidelines as established by the American Heart Association (AHA) are suitable for diagnosing the cardiovascular diseases and conditions discussed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGIP compounds display a desired positive inotropic effect without a substantial, concomitant increase in blood pressure. Such blood pressure changes in subjects experiencing heart failure or cardiovascular disease or condition could cause further deterioration in heart function. In fact as demonstrated herein, GIP compounds can function to reduce blood pressure or the rate of change in blood pressure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIssues with available inotropic agents illustrates the need for, and desirability of, therapies that are inotropic, with rapid onset of action, with prolonged duration of action (including a persistent effect, with absence of tachyphylaxis), with low toxicity (a high ratio of toxic to therapeutic dose), with absent or low nausea effect, and with a convenient (non-intravenous) route of administration. GIP compounds can provide these benefits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther beneficial action of GIP compounds of the invention, particularly the GIP hybrids comprising a DPP-IV resistant GIP analog with a peptidic enhancer such as an exendin tail (e.g. Compound G), arises from a lack of or reduced anorectic effect and an absence of or relatively insignificant nausea effect, which can be important in the patient populations discussed throughout.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a method for treating critically ill patients, exemplified as those sufficiently ill to warrant admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and that find benefit from anti- or non-catabolic therapy, which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a GIP analog or hybrid to a patient in need of such treatment, alone or with another beneficial agent. Without being limited by theory, the methods are intended to benefit those patients in which the effect of GIP agonist analogs and hybrids to stimulate insulin secretion and incur the benefits associated with intensive insulin therapy (GIK therapy; glucose-insulin-potassium), without the hazards and complexity associated with insulin/glucose infusion and without the side effects reportedly associated with the use of some glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists. Further, it is now observed that GIP can favorably affect a patient's metabolic state in addition to simply indirectly regulating glucose levels in response to digestion of food. Accordingly GIP compounds are useful to reduce the mortality and morbidity that occurs in critically ill patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated herein GIP compounds provide beneficial metabolic effects such as glucose lowering, insulin secretion and/or beta cell proliferation. GIP compounds also improve cardiac function by increasing cardiac contractility (dP/dt), decreasing blood pressure (for example by acute vasodilatation), and decreasing systolic pressure, decreasing diastolic pressure, and providing a direct beneficial action on cardiac cells. Since many critically ill patients have or are at risk for or are complicated by cardiovascular diseases or conditions, these cardiovascular effects can provided additional benefit. By also providing direct effects on the cardiovascular system, the GIP compounds, surprisingly, have added therapeutic value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, provided herein are methods to treat, prevent or alleviate conditions and diseases of critical care by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a GIP compound, either alone or with another agent that provides desired benefits, to a critically ill patient in need of such treatment. As with the other conditions discussed throughout this specification, a GIP compound can be administered concurrently, sequentially or alternately with another agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “intensive care unit” can be a part of a hospital where critically ill patients are treated, and of course may not officially bear the name “Intensive Care Unit”. ICU also includes a nursing home a clinic, for example, a private clinic, or the like if the same or similar activities are performed there.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term a “critically ill patient” can be a patient who has sustained or are at risk of sustaining acutely life-threatening single or multiple organ system failure due to disease or injury, a patient who is being operated and where complications supervene, and a patient who has been operated in a vital organ within the last week or has been subject to major surgery within the last week. A critically ill patient can be a patient who needs vital organ support (either mechanically such as with mechanical ventilation or dialysis etc., or pharmacologically such as with inotropes or vasopressors) without which they would not survive. Expressions “critical care”, “intensive care” and “critically ill” are used interchangeably. Critically ill patients are those who generally experience an unstable metabolic state. This unstable metabolic state, e.g. catabolic state, can be a result of changes in substrate metabolism which may lead to relative deficiencies in some nutrients and/or increased oxidation (e.g. wasting) of both fat and muscle, undesirable accelerated protein breakdown, hyperglycemia and high concentrations of serum triglycerides and other lipids. Non-limiting examples of a critically ill patient is a patient in need of cardiac surgery, cerebral surgery, thoracic surgery, abdominal surgery, vascular surgery, or transplantation, or a patient suffering from cerebral trauma, respiratory insufficiency, critical illness polyneuropathy, multiple traumas or severe burns, or a patient being mechanically ventilated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in one embodiment the critical care disease or condition is classified as medical, surgical (e.g. trauma) or coronary care, and further can be classified as sepsis and respiratory care. Of particular interest are those classifications, such as septic shock or myocardial infarction, for which GIK therapy would be warranted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCatabolic change (e.g., loss of body weight) is an adverse risk factor for the critically ill patient. Although most admissions to the ICU receive intravenous lines that deliver calories in some form, a Canadian study of nutritional support in ICU reported that typically only 58% of daily requirements were supplied and only 26% received parenteral nutrition. Thus a method is provided in which a critically ill patient in need of prevention or alleviating catabolic effects, such as weigh loss, is administered a therapeutically effective amount of a GIP compound as provided herein to prevent or alleviate the catabolism. The critically ill patient in need of treatment includes patients who are non-diabetic patient (not diagnosed as having diabetes or prediabetes), diabetic, prediabetic, and/or obese. The patient may have had or be at risk of having the disease or conditions indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of GIP compounds can minimize or avoid risks associated with GLP-1 in invoking a GIK-like benefit. Slowing of gastric emptying can complicate the delivery of oral medicines, for example, by altering their kinetics, and decrease nutrient uptake; GLP-1 agonists, amylin agonists, CCK agonists, and secretin agonists, for example, slow gastric emptying. As shown herein, within therapeutic ranges, doses of GIP compounds do not slow gastric emptying or show only a weak effect, and in any event much less so than GLP1 and \nexendin\n 4. Typically such effect was blocked with a selective amylin antagonist, e.g. pramlintide, indicating that the effect was an indirect consequence of augmented beta-cell secretion of amylin, the latter being the most potent endogenous inhibitor of gastric emptying thus far identified. GIP administration is thus unassociated with a direct inhibition of gastric emptying. Importantly, it has been shown herein that GIP itself does not acutely inhibit food intake in mice. Neither does GIP cause weight loss in diet-induced-obese mice. Nor does the GIP analog hybrid 0601GIP3794. Further GIP was reported to exert a fat-sparing effect relative to GLP-1 agonists which are associated with a loss of body weight and adiposity. This fat-sparing effect is possibly attributable to an antilipolytic effect in adipocytes or to such effects as promotion of lipoprotein lipase, amplification of insulin signaling, and/or an increase of fatty acid incorporation into adipocyte lipid. Interestingly, 0601GIP3794 provided a slight decrease in percentage body fat with an increase in body protein without a concomitant reduction in body weight, indicating that body composition was affected. It is well recognized that loss of body energy stores predicts adverse outcomes in critical care whereas preservation of body energy stores promotes beneficial outcomes. The absence of or decreased anorexigenic effects, the absence of or decreased nausea and/or the absence of or reduction of weight loss, with or without the improvement in body composition, are advantageous in patients experiencing catabolic effects, such as critically ill patients. Although GIP receptor mRNA has been detected in heart tissue, hormone binding in heart has not been detected to date. However, as shown herein GIP binds to and activates cardiac myocytes and displays a positive inotropic effect in vivo. With regard to treatment of renal failure, particularly acute renal failure, in patients who remain oliguric despite attempts to enhance urine flow by approaches to establish urine output such as by the use of loop diuretics and osmotic diuretics, intervention by inotropic agents that increase cardiac contractility is generally attempted. Thus as discussed GIP compounds provide further benefit in patients with or at risk of compromised myocardium, and certain other conditions such as renal failure, independent of its insulinotropic action. Further the method includes administering to patients in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a GIP compound that provides a sparing of cardiac muscle, which otherwise tends to atrophy in catabolic states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in one embodiment the critical care patient has a disease or condition of catabolic change associated with a critical illness, sepsis, post-traumatic, post-surgical, post-shock, comatose patients, stress-induced hyperglycemia (for example after a vascular event), stroke, myocardial infarction, acute mesenteric ischemia, respiratory distress, ventilator dependency, renal failure, congestive heart failure, edema, hibernating myocardium, cardiomyopathies (ischemic, diabetic), lowering of BNP, ejection dysfunction, hypertension, polyneuropathy, ischemia/reperfusion injury (for example post-thrombolytic therapy, post cardiac surgery), histoprotection of organ beds, myocardial infarction (mortality, function, symptomatology), acute coronary syndrome (stable/unstable angina, non-Q wave infarct, ECG positive), disturbances of conduction or rhythm, papillary dysfunction, and/or pulmonary edema. For example, in a one embodiment the method comprises attenuating, ameliorating or reducing such disease or conditions including pre- or post-surgical catabolic changes, comprising, administering to a patient in need thereof a GIP compound. The GIP compound is designed to provide a therapeutic benefit, for example a benefit measured for example as a reduction in APACHE score, a reduction in mortality, a reduction in days in hospital, a reduction in need for readmission, a reduction in hospitalization costs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment is a method for the treatment of a critically ill patient in need thereof, to prevent or decrease the incidence of blood stream infection, sepsis or septic shock, to reduce morbidity associated with the critical care, to reduce mortality (e.g. in-hospital mortality) associated with the critical care, to prevent or decrease the incidence of prolonged inflammation, to prevent or decrease the incidence of acute renal failure and/or renal replacement therapy, to prevent or decrease the incidence of critical care polyneuropathy, to reduce the use of antibiotics, to prevent or decrease the incidence of immune-mediated destruction of the beta cells, to reduce the likelihood of disturbance in markers of inflammation and/or inflammatory responses, to prevent or decrease the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), to reduce the amount of red cell transfusion, to reduce stress-induced hyperglycemia, to protect from cholestasis, to reduce the need for invasive treatment, to prevent or decrease the incidence of endoneural edema, to decrease dialysis or hemofiltration, to reduce or eliminate a need of vital organ system support, to allow at least about one third of the caloric need through the normal enteral route, to reduce the risk or likelihood of multiple organ failure, to reduce the risk or likelihood of multiple organ failure associated with sepsis or septic shock, to reduce the use of mechanical ventilatory support, to reduce the likelihood of disturbed kidney function parameters, to reduce the likelihood of hyperbilirubinemia, or to treat, prevent or alleviate or reduce the incidence of one or more of the other critical care conditions mentioned herein, which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a GIP compound. In a further embodiment administration achieves a normo- or euglycemia, a lowering of blood glucose, insulin secretion, a cardiovascular benefit as discussed herein, a reduction of catabolic effect, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCritical care patients can include those suffering from respiratory distress in which the patient has difficulty breathing as a result of pulmonary dysfunction. The patient may exhibit varying degrees of hypoxemia that that may or may not be controlled with supplemental oxygen. Respiratory distress may occur in patients with impaired pulmonary function due to direct lung injury, such as from pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, pulmonary contusion, fat emboli, near-drowning, inhalation injury, high altitude and reperfusion pulmonary edema, or from indirect lung injury as from sepsis, severe trauma with shock and multiple transfusions, cardiopulmonary bypass, drug overdose, and acute pancreatitis. A critically ill patient may have a pulmonary disorders associated with chronic hypoxemia, which can result in raised pressure within the pulmonary circulation called pulmonary hypertension. A critically ill patient may have cor pulmonale, which is a failure of the right side of the heart caused by prolonged high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery and right ventricle of the heart. A critically ill patient may have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPDs) which include emphysema and chronic bronchitis, which also cause respiratory distress.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the critical care patient is one who with a disturbed glucose metabolism such as insulin resistance but no overt diabetes, as well as a patient who for any reason cannot receive nutrition through the alimentary canal. Such patients include surgery patients, comatose patients, patients in shock, patients with gastrointestinal disease, patients with digestive hormone disease, and the like. In particular, obese patients, atherosclerotic patients, vascular disease patients, patients with gestational diabetes, patients with liver disease such as liver cirrhosis, patients with acromegaly, patients with glucorticoid excess such as cortisol treatment or Cushings disease, patients with activated counter-regulatory hormones such as would occur after trauma, accidents and surgery and the like, patients with hypertriglyceridemia and patients with chronic pancreatitis can be readily and suitably nourished according to the invention without subjecting the patient to hypo- or hyperglycemia, while reducing undesirable catabolic changes and/or providing cardiovascular benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the administration of a GIP compound, alone or with other agents, reduces morbidity or mortality in critically ill patients (who require intensive care) or the time they stay in the ICU. A reduction in morbidity means reducing the likelihood that the critically ill patient will develop additional illnesses, conditions, or symptoms or reducing the severity of additional illnesses, conditions or symptoms. For example reducing morbidity can be achieved by decreasing the incidence of bacteremia or sepsis or complications associated with multiple organ failure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese indications need not be confined to those with dysglycemia, nor require that euglycemia be achieved. Neither are they restricted to an insulinotropic mechanism, or those individuals capable of responding with increased insulin secretion. Although GIP resistance has been reported in \ntype\n 2 diabetes, resistance to the insulinotropic effects of GIP is not expected to be a feature of critically ill patients, including those with acute stress induced dysglycemia. Normal glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion will occur in the majority of critically ill patients, and in those patients resistant to GIP efficacy can be attained with higher GIP doses or with the use of the GIP analogs and hybrids disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus in one embodiment is provided a method for inducing an insulinotropic response, for providing an anti- or non-catabolic effect (e.g. reducing a catabolic effect) or providing any one of the cardiovascular benefits discussed herein, or a any combination of the above, comprising administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a GIP compound to provide such desired beneficial action. These methods are useful for treating critical care conditions or disorders that can be alleviated by such effects, preferably in conjunction with a reduction of catabolic effect, in critically ill patients in need of such benefits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GIP compound includes GIP and GIP analogs and hybrids, particularly novel GIP analogs as described herein, extended half-life GIP hybrids (e.g. DPP-IV cleavage resistant (such as a D-Ala2, N-Acetyl or N-pyroglutamyl analogs) optionally further comprising a peptidic enhancer such as a heterologous C-terminal tail, and GIP hybrids comprising at least one hormone module known to provide beneficial benefit to a patient undergoing critical or intensive care. For example, GIP compounds of the invention particularly useful are the GIP hybrids comprising a DPP-IV resistant GIP analog with a peptidic enhancer such as an exendin tail (e.g. Compound G), or GIP hybrids comprising a GIP analog and a amylin family or salmon calcitonin hormone module, which are additionally beneficial by their lack of or reduced anorectic effect while maintaining a desirable glucose lowering, insulinotropic and/or cardiovascular benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment administering a GIP compound reduces the problems associated with parenteral nourishment. Very often it is not possible to infuse a desired amount of glucose even to people with healthy metabolism without provoking hyperglycemia. This can be exacerbated in critical care patients. Insulin secretion during parenteral nourishment in the presence of a GIP compound can be controlled such that the plasma glucose increase will be less than without the GIP compound. Therefore more glucose can be delivered over a 24-hour period than otherwise. The calorie deficit seen with parenterally nourished patients can thus be better satisfied. Accordingly, provided is a method for non-alimentary nutrition comprising administering by a parenteral route to a patient in need of parenteral nutrition, a nutritively effective amount of one or more nutrients selected from the group consisting of carbohydrates, ammo acids, lipids, free fatty acids, mono- or diglycerides, glycerol and any combination thereof; and a GIP compound, wherein the administration of the nutrient(s) produces a blood glucose level in the patient of from about 80 to 180 mg glucose per deciliter of blood, and the rate of administration is calculated to deliver up to about 1000 g of glucose or its equivalent per patient per day. In a further embodiment the patient receives at least about one third of the caloric need through the normal enteral route, at least about half of the caloric need through the normal enteral route, or at least about two third of the caloric need through the normal enteric route. When the nutrient source is carbohydrate, the source of carbohydrate can be present at a concentration of about a 2% to about a 50% by weight of glucose or its equivalent per liter. In a further embodiment enhance nutrient metabolism is achieved via the parenteral route in patients with a disturbed glucose metabolism, a surgery patient, a comatose patient, a patient in shock, a patient with gastrointestinal disease, a patient with digestive hormone disease, an obese patient, an atherosclerotic patient, a patient with vascular disease, a patient with gestational diabetes, a patient with liver disease, a patient with liver cirrhosis, a patient with glucocorticoid excess, a patient with Cushings disease, a patient with activated counter-regulatory hormones that occur after trauma or a disease, a patient with hypertriglyceridemia, or a patient with chronic pancreatitis, a nutritively effective amount of one or more nutrients or any combination thereof and one or more insulinotropic peptides. In yet a further embodiment the patient in need of enhanced parenteral nutrition via a non-alimentary route is a critical care patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment for critical care use and parenteral nutrition enhancement use, a GIP compound is administered by continuous intravenous infusion to achieve blood glucose levels less than 200 mg/dl, or in the range of 80 to 150 mg/dl, or in the range of 80 to 110 mg/dl. For example, the GIP compound can be administered to maintain plasma glucose below the “renal threshold” of about 160 to 180 milligrams per deciliter. Patients not suffering from hyperglycemia can also be treated in view of the additional anti-catabolic and cardiovascular benefits provided by the GIP compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein, both acute and chronic administration by a range of routes is contemplated for critical care use and for enhancement of parenteral nutrition. In one embodiment for critical care use, a GIP compound is infused continuously at a rate of between about 0.1 and 100 pmol/kg/min, between about 0.1 and 50 pmol/kg/min, between about 0.5 and 30 pmol/kg/min, between about 0.1 and 10 pmol/kg/min, between about 0.5 and 5 pmol/kg/min, or between about 1.0 and 3.0 pmol/kg/min. As discussed elsewhere herein, the GIP compound can also be provided via a sustained release formulation, e.g. comprising microspheres or a gel matrix, and/or administered via discrete or superimpositioning dosages, via subcutaneous, nasal, intravenous or other routes. The GIP compound can be administered prior to, during and/or after commencement of critical care, such as surgery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutically effective dose of the GIP, GIP analog, novel GIP analog or GIP hybrid, or derivative thereof, will depend on a number of factors, including without limitation, the patient's sex, weight and age, the severity of inability to regulate blood glucose, the underlying cause(s) of inability to regulate blood glucose, whether glucose or another carbohydrate source is simultaneously administered, the route of administration and bioavailability, the persistence in the body, the formulation and the potency. It is within the skill of the ordinary physician to titrate the dose and rate of administration of a GIP compound to achieve the desired clinical result.\n\n\n \nPolypeptide Production and Purification.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe polypeptides described herein may be prepared using standard recombinant techniques or chemical peptide synthesis techniques known in the art, e.g., using an automated or semi-automated peptide synthesizer, or both.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptides of the invention can be synthesized in solution or on a solid support in accordance with conventional techniques. Such methods are described, for example, herein and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,610,824 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,686,411 and in patent application Serial No. 454,533 (filed Dec. 6, 1999), the entirety of which are incorporated herein by reference. Various automatic synthesizers are commercially available and can be used in accordance with known protocols. See, e.g., Stewart and Young, \nSolid Phase Peptide Synthesis, \n2d. ed., Pierce Chemical Co. (1984); Tam et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n105: 6442 (1983); Merrifield, \nScience \n232: 341-7 (1986); and Barany and Merrifield, \nThe Peptides\n, Gross and Meienhofer, eds., Academic Press, New York, 1-284 (1979). Solid phase peptide synthesis may be carried out with an automatic peptide synthesizer (e.g., Model 430A, Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, Calif.) using the NMP/HOBt (Option 1) system and tBoc or Fmoc chemistry (see, Applied Biosystems User's Manual for the ABI 430A Peptide Synthesizer, Version 1.3B Jul. 1, 1988, \nsection\n 6, pp. 49-70, Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, Calif.) with capping. Peptides may also be assembled using an Advanced Chem Tech Synthesizer (\nModel MPS\n 350, Louisville, Ky.). Peptides may be purified by RP-HPLC (preparative and analytical) using, e.g., a Waters Delta Prep 3000 system and a C4, C8, or C18 preparative column (10 μ, 2.2×25 cm; Vydac, Hesperia, Calif.). Polypeptides can be synthesized by convergent methods such as “native chemical ligation”, and variations thereof, in which two or more peptide fragments with appropriate orthogonally reactive ends are ligated with native amide bond formation. The newly formed peptide can be further ligated to create even longer polypeptides. The individual starting peptides can be derivatized as desired or can be derivatized after a ligation step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides analogs were synthesized on a Pioneer continuous flow peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using PAL-PEG-PS resin (Applied Biosystems) with a loading of 0.2 mmol/g (0.25 mmole scale). Fmoc amino acid (4.0 eq, 1.0 mmol) residues were activated using 4.0 eq HBTU, 4.0 eq of HOBT, 8.0 eq DIEA and coupled to the resin for 1 hour. The Fmoc group was removed by treatment with 20% (v/v) piperidine in dimethylformamide. Final deprotection and cleavage of the peptide from the solid support was performed by treatment of the resin with reagent B (93% TFA, 3% phenol, 3% water and 1% triisopropylsilane) for 2-3 hours. The cleaved peptide was precipitated using tert-butyl methyl ether, pelleted by centrifugation and lyophilized. The pellet was re-dissolved in water (10-15 mL), filtered and purified via reverse phase HPLC using a C-18 column and an acetonitrile/water gradient containing 0.1% TFA. The purified product was lyophilized and analyzed by ESI-LC/MS and analytical HPLC and were demonstrated to be pure (>98%). Mass results all agreed with calculated values.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, peptides were assembled on a Symphony® peptide synthesizer (Protein Technologies, Inc., Woburn, Mass.) using Rink amide resin (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif.) with a loading of 0.43-0.49 mmol/g at 0.050-0.100 mmol. Fmoc amino acid (Applied Biosystems, Inc. 5.0 eq, 0.250-0.500 mmol) residues were dissolved at a concentration of 0.10 M in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. All other reagents (HBTU, HOBT and N,N-diisopropylethylamine) were prepared as 0.55 M dimethylformamide solutions. The Fmoc protected amino acids were then coupled to the resin-bound amino acid using, HBTU (2.0 eq, 0.100-0.200 mmol), HOBT (1.8 eq, 0.090-0.18 mmol), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (2.4 eq, 0.120-0.240 mmol) for 2 hours. Following the last amino acid coupling, the peptide was deprotected using 20% (v/v) piperidine in dimethylformamide for 1 hour. Once peptide sequence is completed, the Symphony® peptide synthesizer is programmed to cleave the resin. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) cleavage of the peptide from resin was carried out using a reagent mixture composed of 93% TFA, 3% phenol, 3% water and 1% triisopropylsilane. The cleaved peptide was precipitated using tert-butyl methyl ether, pelleted by centrifugation and lyophilized. The pellet was dissolved in acetic acid, lyophilized and then dissolved in water, filtered and purified via reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column and an acetonitrile/water gradient containing 0.1% TFA. Analytical HPLC was used to assess purity of peptide and identity was confirmed by LC/MS and MALDI-MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active protein can be readily synthesized and then screened in screening assays designed to identify reactive peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe analog and hybrid polypeptides of the present invention may alternatively be produced by recombinant techniques well known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, \n2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor (1989). These GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides produced by recombinant technologies may be expressed from a polynucleotide. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the polynucleotides, including DNA and RNA, that encode such GIP analog or hybrid polypeptides may be obtained from the wild-type cDNA, e.g. GIP, GLP1, amylin, taking into consideration the degeneracy of codon usage, or may be engineered as desired. These polynucleotide sequences may incorporate codons facilitating transcription and translation of mRNA in microbial hosts. Such manufacturing sequences may readily be constructed according to the methods well known in the art. See, e.g., WO 83/04053. The polynucleotides above may also optionally encode an N-terminal methionyl residue. Non-peptide compounds useful in the present invention may be prepared by art-known methods. For example, phosphate-containing amino acids and peptides containing such amino acids may be prepared using methods known in the art. See, e.g., Bartlett and Landen, \nBioorg. Chem. \n14: 356-77 (1986).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of expression vector/host systems may be utilized to contain and express a GIP polypeptide coding sequence. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria transformed with recombinant bacteriophage, plasmid or cosmid DNA expression vectors; yeast transformed with yeast expression vectors; insect cell systems infected with virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus); plant cell systems transfected with virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with bacterial expression vectors (e.g., Ti or pBR322 plasmid); or animal cell systems. Mammalian cells that are useful in recombinant protein productions include but are not limited to VERO cells, HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, COS cells (such as COS-7), \nWI\n 38, BHK, HepG2, 3T3, RIN, MDCK, A549, PC12, K562 and 293 cells. Exemplary protocols for the recombinant expression of the protein are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs such, polynucleotide sequences provided by the invention are useful in generating new and useful viral and plasmid DNA vectors, new and useful transformed and transfected procaryotic and eucaryotic host cells (including bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells grown in culture), and new and useful methods for cultured growth of such host cells capable of expression of the present GIP polypeptides. The polynucleotide sequences encoding GIP analogs or hybrids herein may be useful for gene therapy in instances where underproduction of GIP or other component peptide hormone(s) of the hybrid would be alleviated, or the need for increased levels of such would be met.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides for processes for recombinant DNA production of the present GIP polypeptides. Provided is a process for producing the GIP polypeptides from a host cell containing nucleic acids encoding such GIP polypeptides comprising: (a) culturing said host cell containing polynucleotides encoding such GIP polypeptides under conditions facilitating the expression of such DNA molecule; and (b) obtaining such GIP polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic and include bacteria, mammalian cells (such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, monkey cells, baby hamster kidney cells, cancer cells or other cells), yeast cells, and insect cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMammalian host systems for the expression of the recombinant protein also are well known to those of skill in the art. Host cell strains may be chosen for a particular ability to process the expressed protein or produce certain post-translation modifications that will be useful in providing protein activity. Such modifications of the polypeptide include, but are not limited to, acetylation, carboxylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, lipidation and acylation. Post-translational processing, which cleaves a “prepro” form of the protein, may also be important for correct insertion, folding and/or function. Different host cells, such as CHO, HeLa, MDCK, 293, WI38, and the like, have specific cellular machinery and characteristic mechanisms for such post-translational activities, and may be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the introduced foreign protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a yeast system may be employed to generate the GIP polypeptides of the present invention. The coding region of the GIP polypeptide cDNA is amplified by PCR. A DNA encoding the yeast pre-pro-alpha leader sequence is amplified from yeast genomic DNA in a PCR reaction using one primer containing nucleotides 1-20 of the alpha mating factor gene and another primer complementary to nucleotides 255-235 of this gene (Kurjan and Herskowitz, \nCell, \n30: 933-43 (1982)). The pre-pro-alpha leader coding sequence and GIP polypeptide coding sequence fragments are ligated into a plasmid containing the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2) promoter, such that the promoter directs expression of a fusion protein consisting of the pre-pro-alpha factor fused to the mature GIP polypeptide. As taught by Rose and Broach, \nMeth. Enz. \n185: 234-79, Goeddel ed., Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif. (1990), the vector further includes an ADH2 transcription terminator downstream of the cloning site, the yeast “2-micron” replication origin, the yeast leu-2d gene, the yeast REP1 and REP2 genes, the \nE. coli \nbeta-lactamase gene, and an \nE. coli \norigin of replication. The beta-lactamase and leu-2d genes provide for selection in bacteria and yeast, respectively. The leu-2d gene also facilitates increased copy number of the plasmid in yeast to induce higher levels of expression. The REP1 and REP2 genes encode proteins involved in regulation of the plasmid copy number.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA construct described in the preceding paragraph is transformed into yeast cells using a known method, e.g., lithium acetate treatment (Steams et al., \nMeth. Enz. \n185: 280-97 (1990)). The ADH2 promoter is induced upon exhaustion of glucose in the growth media (Price et al., \nGene \n55: 287 (1987)). The pre-pro-alpha sequence effects secretion of the fusion protein from the cells. Concomitantly, the yeast KEX2 protein cleaves the pre-pro sequence from the mature GIP polypeptides (Bitter et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81: 5330-4 (1984)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGIP polypeptides of the invention may also be recombinantly expressed in yeast using a commercially available expression system, e.g., the Pichia Expression System (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.), following the manufacturer's instructions. This system also relies on the pre-pro-alpha sequence to direct secretion, but transcription of the insert is driven by the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter upon induction by methanol. The secreted GIP polypeptide is purified from the yeast growth medium by, e.g., the methods used to purify GIP polypeptide from bacterial and mammalian cell supernatants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the cDNA encoding GIP polypeptides may be cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1393 (PharMingen, San Diego, Calif.). This GIP-compound-encoding vector is then used according to the manufacturer's directions (PharMingen) to infect \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells in sF9 protein-free media and to produce recombinant protein. The protein is purified and concentrated from the media using a heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) and sequential molecular sizing columns (Amicon, Beverly, Mass.), and resuspended in PBS. SDS-PAGE analysis shows a single band and confirms the size of the protein, and Edman sequencing on a Proton 2090 Peptide Sequencer confirms its N-terminal sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the DNA sequence encoding the predicted mature GIP analog or hybrid polypeptide may be cloned into a plasmid containing a desired promoter and, optionally, a leader sequence (see, e.g., Better et al., Science 240: 1041-3 (1988)). The sequence of this construct may be confirmed by automated sequencing. The plasmid is then transformed into \nE. coli\n, strain MC1061, using standard procedures employing CaCl\n2 \nincubation and heat shock treatment of the bacteria (Sambrook et al., supra). The transformed bacteria are grown in LB medium supplemented with carbenicillin, and production of the expressed protein is induced by growth in a suitable medium. If present, the leader sequence will affect secretion of the mature GIP analog or hybrid polypeptide and be cleaved during secretion. The secreted recombinant protein is purified from the bacterial culture media by the method described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the GIP polypeptides of the invention may be expressed in an insect system. Insect systems for protein expression are well known to those of skill in the art. In one such system, \nAutographa californica \nnuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes in \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells or in \nTrichoplusia larvae\n. The GIP polypeptide coding sequence is cloned into a nonessential region of the virus, such as the polyhedrin gene, and placed under control of the polyhedrin promoter. Successful insertion of GIP analog or hybrid polypeptide will render the polyhedrin gene inactive and produce recombinant virus lacking coat protein coat. The recombinant viruses are then used to infect \nS. frugiperda \ncells or \nTrichoplusia larvae \nin which GIP analog or hybrid polypeptide is expressed (Smith et al., \nJ. Virol. \n46: 584 (1983); Engelhard et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n91: 3224-7 (1994)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the DNA sequence encoding the GIP polypeptide may be amplified by PCR and cloned into an appropriate vector, for example, pGEX-3X (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.). The pGEX vector is designed to produce a fusion protein comprising glutathione-S-transferase (GST), encoded by the vector, and a protein encoded by a DNA fragment inserted into the vector's cloning site. The primers for the PCR may be generated to include, for example, an appropriate cleavage site. The recombinant fusion protein may then be cleaved from the GST portion of the fusion protein. The pGEX-3×/GIP analog polypeptide construct is transformed into \nE. coli \nXL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.), and individual transformants are isolated and grown at 37° C. in LB medium (supplemented with carbenicillin) to an optical density at \nwavelength\n 600 nm of 0.4, followed by further incubation for 4 hours in the presence of 0.5 mM Isopropyl beta-D-Thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.). Plasmid DNA from individual transformants is purified and partially sequenced using an automated sequencer to confirm the presence of the desired GIP polypeptide-encoding gene insert in the proper orientation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion protein, expected to be produced as an insoluble inclusion body in the bacteria, may be purified as follows. Cells are harvested by centrifugation; washed in 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, \n \npH\n \n 8, 1 mM EDTA; and treated with 0.1 mg/mL lysozyme (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 15 min. at room temperature. The lysate is cleared by sonication, and cell debris is pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min. at 12,000×g. The fusion protein-containing pellet is resuspended in 50 mM Tris, \n \npH\n \n 8, and 10 mM EDTA, layered over 50% glycerol, and centrifuged for 30 min. at 6000×g. The pellet is resuspended in standard phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) free of Mg\n++\n and Ca\n++\n. The fusion protein is further purified by fractionating the resuspended pellet in a denaturing SDS polyacrylamide gel (Sambrook et al., supra). The gel is soaked in 0.4 M KCl to visualize the protein, which is excised and electroeluted in gel-running buffer lacking SDS. If the GST/GIP polypeptide fusion protein is produced in bacteria as a soluble protein, it may be purified using the GST Purification Module (Pharmacia Biotech).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion protein may be subjected to digestion to cleave the GST from the mature GIP analog or hybrid polypeptide. The digestion reaction (20-40 μg fusion protein, 20-30 units human thrombin (4000 U/mg (Sigma) in 0.5 mL PBS) is incubated 16-48 hrs. at room temperature and loaded on a denaturing SDS-PAGE gel to fractionate the reaction products. The gel is soaked in 0.4 M KCl to visualize the protein bands. The identity of the protein band corresponding to the expected molecular weight of the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptide may be confirmed by partial amino acid sequence analysis using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems Model 473A, Foster City, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particularly exemplary method of recombinant expression of the GIP polypeptides of the present invention, 293 cells may be co-transfected with plasmids containing the GIP analog or hybrid polypeptide cDNA in the pCMV vector (5′ CMV promoter, 3′ HGH poly A sequence) and pSV2neo (containing the neo resistance gene) by the calcium phosphate method. In one embodiment, the vectors should be linearized with ScaI prior to transfection. Similarly, an alternative construct using a similar pCMV vector with the neo gene incorporated can be used. Stable cell lines are selected from single cell clones by limiting dilution in growth media containing 0.5 mg/mL G418 (neomycin-like antibiotic) for 10-14 days. Cell lines are screened for GIP analog or hybrid polypeptide expression by ELISA or Western blot, and high-expressing cell lines are expanded for large scale growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is preferable that the transformed cells are used for long-term, high-yield protein production and as such stable expression is desirable. Once such cells are transformed with vectors that contain selectable markers along with the desired expression cassette, the cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media before they are switched to selective media. The selectable marker is designed to confer resistance to selection, and its presence allows growth and recovery of cells that successfully express the introduced sequences. Resistant clumps of stably transformed cells can be proliferated using tissue culture techniques appropriate to the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of selection systems may be used to recover the cells that have been transformed for recombinant protein production. Such selection systems include, but are not limited to, HSV thymidine kinase, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase genes, in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, anti-metabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for dhfr, that confers resistance to methotrexate; gpt, that confers resistance to mycophenolic acid; neo, that confers resistance to the aminoglycoside, G418; also, that confers resistance to chlorsulfuron; and hygro, that confers resistance to hygromycin. Additional selectable genes that may be useful include trpB, which allows cells to utilize indole in place of tryptophan, or hisD, which allows cells to utilize histinol in place of histidine. Markers that give a visual indication for identification of transformants include anthocyanins, beta-glucuronidase and its substrate, GUS, and luciferase and its substrate, luciferin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany of the GIP polypeptides of the present invention may be produced using a combination of both automated peptide synthesis and recombinant techniques. For example, a GIP polypeptide of the present invention may contain a combination of modifications including deletion, substitution, and insertion by PEGylation. Such a GIP polypeptide may be produced in stages. In the first stage, an intermediate GIP polypeptide containing the modifications of deletion, substitution, insertion, and any combination thereof, may be produced by recombinant techniques as described. Then after an optional purification step as described herein, the intermediate GIP polypeptide is PEGylated through chemical modification with an appropriate PEGylating reagent (e.g., from NeKtar Transforming Therapeutics, San Carlos, Calif.) to yield the desired GIP polypeptide. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the above-described procedure may be generalized to apply to a GIP polypeptide containing a combination of modifications selected from deletion, substitution, insertion, derivation, and other means of modification well known in the art and contemplated by the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be desirable to purify the GIP polypeptides generated by the present invention. Peptide purification techniques are well known to those of skill in the art. These techniques involve, at one level, the crude fractionation of the cellular milieu to polypeptide and non-polypeptide fractions. Having separated the polypeptide from other proteins, the polypeptide of interest may be further purified using chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques to achieve partial or complete purification (or purification to homogeneity). Analytical methods particularly suited to the preparation of a pure peptide are ion-exchange chromatography, exclusion chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and isoelectric focusing. A particularly efficient method of purifying peptides is reverse phase HPLC, followed by characterization of purified product by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Additional confirmation of purity is obtained by determining amino acid analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain aspects of the present invention concern the purification, and in particular embodiments, the substantial purification, of an encoded protein or peptide. The term “purified peptide” as used herein, is intended to refer to a composition, isolatable from other components, wherein the peptide is purified to any degree relative to its naturally obtainable state. A purified peptide therefore also refers to a peptide, free from the environment in which it may naturally occur.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, “purified” will refer to a peptide composition that has been subjected to fractionation to remove various other components, and which composition substantially retains its expressed biological activity. Where the term “substantially purified” is used, this designation will refer to a composition in which the peptide forms the major component of the composition, such as constituting about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95% or more of the peptides in the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques suitable for use in peptide purification will be well known to those of skill in the art. These include, for example, precipitation with ammonium sulphate, PEG, antibodies, and the like; heat denaturation, followed by centrifugation; chromatography steps such as ion exchange, gel filtration, reverse phase, hydroxylapatite and affinity chromatography; isoelectric focusing; gel electrophoresis; and combinations of such and other techniques. As is generally known in the art, it is believed that the order of conducting the various purification steps may be changed, or that certain steps may be omitted, and still result in a suitable method for the preparation of a substantially purified protein or peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is no general requirement that the peptides always be provided in their most purified state. Indeed, it is contemplated that less substantially purified products will have utility in certain embodiments. Partial purification may be accomplished by using fewer purification steps in combination, or by utilizing different forms of the same general purification scheme. For example, it is appreciated that a cation-exchange column chromatography performed, utilizing an HPLC apparatus, will generally result in a greater “-fold” purification than the same technique utilizing a low pressure chromatography system. Methods exhibiting a lower degree of relative purification may have advantages in total recovery of protein product, or in maintaining the activity of an expressed protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne may optionally purify and isolate such GIP polypeptides from other components obtained in the process. Methods for purifying a polypeptide can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,849,883. These documents describe specific exemplary methods for the isolation and purification of G-CSF compositions that may be useful in isolating and purifying the GIP polypeptides of the present invention. Given the disclosure of these patents, it is evident that one of skill in the art would be well aware of numerous purification techniques that may be used to purify GIP polypeptides from a given source.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso it is contemplated that a combination of anion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography may be employed to produce purified GIP polypeptide compositions of the present invention.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of at least one GIP polypeptide of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, preservatives, solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvants and/or carriers useful in the delivery of the GIP polypeptides. Such compositions may include diluents of various buffer content (e.g., acetate, citrate, tartrate, phosphate, TRIS-HCl), pH and ionic strength; additives such as surfactants and solubilizing agents (e.g., sorbitan monooleate, lecithin, Pluronics, \nTween\n 20 & 80, \nPolysorbate\n 20 & 80, propylene glycol, ethanol, PEG-40, sodium dodecyl sulfate), anti-oxidants (e.g., monothioglyercol, ascorbic acid, acetylcysteine, sulfurous acid salts (bisulfite and metabisulfite), preservatives (e.g., phenol, meta-cresol, benzyl alcohol, parabens (methyl, propyl, butyl), benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, thimersol, phenylmercuric salts, (acetate, borate, nitrate), and tonicity/bulking agents (glycerine, sodium chloride, mannitol, sucrose, trehalose, dextrose); incorporation of the material into particulate preparations of polymeric compounds, such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, etc., or in association with liposomes. Such compositions will influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the present GIP analog polypeptides. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1435-712, 18th ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1990).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally a GIP or a novel GIP analog can be formulated with (or alternatively administered in adjunct therapy with or alternatively covalently linked or fused to) a second active agent. Such agents can comprise activity that will complement or enhance a GIP effect. In one embodiment such agents have glucose lowering or anti-diabetic activity. In another embodiment the agent inhibits or reduces gastric emptying. In other embodiments the agent can comprise any other desirable activity, such as increasing bone density, reducing food intake, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the present GIP analog and hybrid polypeptides will be useful in the same way that GIP and/or the individual component polypeptides (in the case of a hybrid) are useful in view of their pharmacological properties. Generally, the GIP polypeptides are peripherally administered for the treatment or prevention of metabolic conditions and disorders. In particular, the compounds of the invention possess activity as glucose lowering agents, insulinotropic agents, reducing or inhibiting gastric secretion, effecting weight loss, reducing nutrient availability, reducing food intake, suppressing appetite, ameliorating mortality and morbidity in critical (intensive) care applications, providing improved memory and other neurological benefits, increasing or maintaining bone density, effecting cardiovascular benefits, providing cardioprotection, and effecting other therapeutic benefits as discussed herein. In another embodiment, a exemplary use is to administer such hybrid polypeptides for the treatment of diabetes or diabetes related conditions and disorders, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases and conditions. The present GIP polypeptides may be formulated for peripheral administration, including formulation for injection, oral administration, nasal administration, pulmonary administration, topical administration, or other types of administration as one skilled in the art will recognize. More particularly, administration of the pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be via any common route so long as the target tissue is available via that route. In a exemplary embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions may be introduced into the subject by any conventional peripheral method, e.g., by intravenous, intradermal, intramusclar, subcutaneous, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, retrobulbar, intrapulmonary (e.g., term release); by oral, sublingual, nasal, buccal, intratracheal, anal, vaginal, transmucosal, pulmonary or transdermal delivery, by suppository or by surgical implantation at a particular site. In one embodiment the administration is parenteral (including intravenous, intradermal, intraperitoneal, intramuscular and subcutaneous).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe treatment may consist of a single dose or a plurality of doses over a period of time. Controlled continual release of the compositions of the present invention is also contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSupplementary active ingredients also can be incorporated into the compositions. For use by the physician, the compounds will be provided in dosage unit form containing an amount of a GIP or novel GIP analog, with or without another therapeutic agent, for example, a glucose-lowering agent, a gastric emptying modulating agent, a lipid lowering agent, or a food intake inhibitor agent. Therapeutically effective amounts of a GIP or a novel GIP analog for example for use in the control of blood glucose or in the control of gastric emptying and in conditions in which gastric emptying is beneficially slowed or regulated are those that decrease post-prandial blood glucose levels, preferably to no more than about 8 or 9 mM or such that blood glucose levels are reduced as desired. In diabetic or glucose intolerant individuals, plasma glucose levels are higher than in normal individuals. In such individuals, beneficial reduction or “smoothing” of post-prandial blood glucose levels may be obtained. As will be recognized by those in the field, an effective amount of therapeutic agent will vary with many factors including the patient's physical condition, the blood sugar level or level of inhibition of gastric emptying to be obtained, or the desired level of food intake reduction, and other factors. In some cases, it will be convenient to provide a GIP polypeptide and at least one other active agent, for example another food-intake-reducing, plasma glucose-lowering or plasma lipid-altering agent, such as an exendin or GLP1 or agonist thereof, amylin, an amylin agonist analog, a CCK or CCK agonist, or a leptin or leptin agonist or a small molecule cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonists, beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 inhibitors, sibutramine and other drugs marketed for treatment of diabetes or obesity, in a single composition or solution for administration together. As has been discussed throughout, the GIP polypeptide may be a GIP hybrid comprising the at least one other such active agent. In other cases, it may be more advantageous to administer the additional agent separately from said GIP polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment a GIP polypeptide may be administered separately or together with one or more other compounds and compositions that exhibit a long term or short-term action to lower blood glucose, reduce or inhibit gastric emptying or reduce or inhibit gastric secretions or reduce nutrient availability, including, but not limited to other compounds and compositions that comprise an amylin or amylin analog agonist, salmon calcitonin, a cholecystokinin (CCK) or CCK agonist, a leptin (OB protein) or leptin agonist, an exendin or exendin analog agonist, or a GLP-1 or GLP-1 analog agonist. Suitable amylin agonists include, for example, [\n25,28,29\nPro-] human amylin (also known as “pramlintide,” and described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,686,511 and 5,998,367). The CCK used is preferably CCK octapeptide (CCK-8), more preferably its sulfated form. Leptin is discussed in, for example, (Pelleymounter et al., Science 269: 540-3 (1995); Halaas et al., Science 269: 543-6 (1995); Campfield et al., Science 269: 546-9 (1995)). Suitable exendins include exendin-3 and exendin-4, and exendin agonist compounds include, for example, those described in PCT Publications WO 99/07404, WO 99/25727, and WO 99/25728. Suitable agents also include various anti-diabetic agents, e.g. metformin, sulfonyureas, TZDs. In another embodiment is provided a combination therapy of a GIP analog or hybrid, e.g. 0601GIP3794, with an incretin mimetic, e.g., exenatide or liraglutide. In a further embodiment sub-therapeutic doses of the incretin mimetic are used, which provide a therapeutic benefit when combined with the GIP compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in one embodiment, particularly in patients subject to conditions associated with elevated glucose levels such as diabetic or glucose intolerant individuals, more particularly \ntype\n 2 diabetic patients, where plasma glucose levels are higher than in normal individuals, GIP therapy in such individuals will benefit from a beneficial reduction or “smoothing” of post-prandial blood glucose levels prior to or concomitant with administration of a GIP or novel GIP analog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast to GLP-1, GLP-1 analogs and mimetics such as exenatide which have been shown to be efficacious in controlling glucose levels in \ntype\n 2 diabetic patients, the insulinotropic effect of GIP is significantly reduced in diabetic subjects compared to normal individuals. While not to be bound by theory, it is believed that while GIP's incretin effect is attenuated during persistent hyperglycemia, GIP or its analogs will act with a similar potency in diabetic patients as their action in normal subjects once glucose control is improved in these individuals. Thus according to the present invention GIP insensitivity can be reduced by achieving in a patient in need thereof, a glucose-lowering or a reduction or “smoothing” of post-prandial blood glucose levels by appropriate agents or means, prior to or concomitant with administration of a GIP or novel GIP analog that will enable or prolong even further glucose-lowering. In one embodiment the agent or means is provided at least one day prior to GIP administration. In another embodiment the agent or means is provided and a sufficient glucose-lowering is observed prior to GIP administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned herein suitable agents include exenatide, metformin, sulfonylureas, or combinations thereof. Primary glucose control endpoint can be measured by means known in the art to clinicians. One method is simply to determine blood glucose levels post-prandially. Another is to measure HbA1c levels, as is known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particularly suitable target population is those patients who fail to attain normal glucose concentrations during treatment with a glucose-lowering agent (such as exenatide). A type of hemoglobin called hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) forms when glucose attaches to hemoglobin. This happens only when blood glucose levels are high. The hemoglobin A1c level can be used to measure a subject's past average blood sugar, e.g. over two to three months. Normal HbA1c values for non-diabetics are approximately 4.0-6.2 percent. The American Diabetes Association recommends that it should be below 7 percent for diabetics, to minimize the complications from diabetes. Despite glucose-lowering therapies, such as exenatide, significant numbers of patients may still remain with elevated Hb1Ac. Consequently, in one embodiment such subjects whose HbA1c level (despite treatment with a glucose-lowering agent) remains above normal, at least 7 percent, at least 8 percent, at least 9 percent or at least 10 percent, are suitable subjects for the GIP therapy and novel adjunct therapy treatments of the invention. In yet another embodiment the Hb1Ac level is greater than normal but no greater than 6.5%, no greater than 7%, no greater than 7.5%, no greater than 8.0%, no greater than 8.5%, no greater than 9.0%, no greater than 9.5%, or no greater than 10%. In yet another embodiment, while reduction of Hb1Ac levels is not reduced to normal levels with monotherapy, it is preferably reduced at least 10 percent, at least 20 percent, at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or at least 90 percent from pre-treatment levels, prior to GIP administration or application of a novel adjunct therapy of the invention. In such patients, adjunct therapy with GIP is indicated according to the invention since reduction of hyperglycemia (e.g., as by exenatide) in treated patients, e.g. diabetic patients, poises the patient for reduced GIP insensitivity. Whereas the chronic hyperglycemic condition in \ntype\n 2 diabetes patients attenuates GIP's insulinotropic response, improved glycemic control resulting from exenatide treatment, for example, would restore responsiveness of the pancreatic beta-cell to GIP stimulation. Therefore GIP therapy or novel adjunct therapy (e.g. co-administration, GIP phybrid, GIP fusion protein) of pharmacological doses of GIP or novel GIP analogs with exenatide (or other glucose lowering agents or agents or methods that lower glucose or that reduce or inhibit gastric emptying) will attain GIP sensitivity and lead to desired normoglycemia in diabetic patients or patients suffering from conditions associated with elevated glucose. Since GIP lacks the gastric emptying effect of GLP1, nausea may be avoided, thus permitting the use of higher GIP dosing regimens than for GLP1. In yet another embodiment, GIP therapy or novel adjunct therapy will reduce Hb1Ac levels to at least normal levels, or at least 10 percent, at least 20 percent, at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or at least 90 percent from pre-treatment (pre GIP therapy or pre-novel-adjunct therapy) levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet a further embodiment, the GIP therapy or novel adjunct therapy can act at least additively, and preferably synergistically, to reduce the dose, dosing, amount, frequency or extent of treatment associated with another agent as mentioned herein. For example, such GIP or novel adjunct therapy can result in at least a 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90% reduction in the amount, dose, frequency of dosing, or length of treatment associated with a the other agent. The agent can be a glucose-lowering agent such a exendin-4, or any other agent, for diabetes or other conditions that benefit form the methods and compositions of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GIP polypeptide of the invention may be prepared for administration as solutions of free base, or pharmacologically acceptable salts in water suitably mixed with surface active agents (e.g., sorbitan monooleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitain monolaurate (Tween 20), polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), lecithin, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers (Pluronics), hydroxypropylcellulose,) or complexation agents (e.g., hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin, sulfobutyether-b-cyclodextrin (Captisol), polyvinylpyrrolidone). Pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the protein) and which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic, and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups also can be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, histidine, procaine and the like. Such products are readily prepared by procedures well known to those skilled in the art. Dispersions also can be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are formulated so as to be suitable for parenteral administration, e.g., via injection or infusion. In one embodiment, the GIP polypeptide is suspended in an aqueous carrier, for example, in an buffer solution at a pH of about 3.0 to about 8.0, preferably at a pH of about 3.5 to about 7.4, about 3.5 to about 6.0, about 3.5 to about 5.0 or about 3.7 to about 4.7. Useful buffers include sodium acetate/acetic acid, sodium lactate/lactic acid, ascorbic acid, sodium citrate-citric acid, sodium bicarbonate/carbonic acid, sodium succinate/succinic acid, Histidine, Sodium benzoate/benzoic acid, and sodium phosphates, and Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomehane. A form of repository or “depot” slow release preparation may be used so that therapeutically effective amounts of the preparation are delivered into the bloodstream over many hours or days following transdermal injection or delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form should be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that is easily syringable. It is also desirable for the GIP polypeptide of the invention to be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., sorbitol, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), dimethylacetamide, cremorphor EL, suitable mixtures thereof, and oils (e.g., soybean, sesame, castor, cottonseed, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, glycofurol, corn). The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial an antifungal agents, for example, meta-cresol, benzyl alcohol, parabens (methyl, propyl, butyl), chlorobutanol, phenol, phenylmercuric salts (acetate, borate, nitrate), sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include tonicity agents (for example, sugars, sodium chloride). Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption (for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions may be prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle that contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the exemplary methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques that yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of the present GIP polypeptides will be determined by the age, weight, and condition or severity of the diseases or metabolic conditions or disorders of the recipient. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 697-773. See also Wang and Hanson, Parenteral Formulations of Proteins and Peptides: Stability and Stabilizers, Journal of Parenteral Science and Technology, Technical Report No. 10, Supp. 42:2 S (1988). Typically, a dosage of between about 0.001 μg/kg body weight/day to about 1000 μg/kg body weight/day, may be used, but more or less, as a skilled practitioner will recognize, may be used. Dosing may be one, two, three, four or more times daily, or less frequently, such as once a week, once a month, or once a quarter, depending on the formulation, and may be in conjunction with other compositions as described herein. It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to the dosages recited herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAppropriate dosages may be ascertained through the use of established assays for determining level of metabolic conditions or disorders in conjunction with relevant dose-response data. The final dosage regimen will be determined by the attending physician, considering factors that modify the action of drugs, e.g., the drug's specific activity, severity of the damage and the responsiveness of the patient, the age, condition, body weight, sex and diet of the patient, the severity of any infection, time of administration and other clinical factors. As studies are conducted, further information will emerge regarding appropriate dosage levels and duration of treatment for specific diseases and conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective dose will typically be in the range of about 0.5 to 30 μg to about 5 mg/day, preferably about 10 to 30 μg to about 2 mg/day and more preferably about 5 to 100 μg to about 1 mg/day, most preferably about 5 μg to about 500 μg/day, for a 50 kg patient, administered in a single or divided doses and/or controlled continual release, of two, three, four or more administrations. Ine one embodiment the GIP compound is administered peripherally at a dose of about 0.5 μg to about 5 mg per day in single or divided doses or controlled continual release, or at about 0.01 μg/kg to about 500 μg/kg per dose, more preferably about 0.05 μg/kg to about 250 μg/kg, most preferably below about 50 μg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, exemplary doses can be derived from the total amount of drug to be given a day and the number doses administered a day. For example, exemplary doses can range from about 0.125 μg/dose (0.5 μg given four times a day) to about 2 mg/dose (2 mg given once a day). Other dosages can be between about 0.01 to about 100 μg/kg/dose. The exact dose to be administered may be determined by one of skill in the art and is dependent upon the potency of the particular compound, as well as upon the age, weight and condition of the individual. Administration should begin whenever the therapeutic benefit, e.g. suppression of nutrient availability, food intake, weight loss or control, blood glucose or plasma lipid lowering or modulation, is desired, for example, at the first sign of symptoms or shortly after diagnosis of obesity, diabetes mellitus, or insulin-resistance syndrome. In one embodiment the GIP compound is administered prophylactically. Administration may be by any route, e.g., injection, preferably subcutaneous or intramuscular, oral, nasal, transdermal, etc. Dosages for certain routes, for example oral administration, may be increased to account for decreased bioavailability, for example, by about 5-100 fold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the GIP compounds may be formulated into a stable, safe pharmaceutical composition for administration to a patient. Pharmaceutical formulations contemplated for use in the methods of the invention may comprise approximately 0.01 to 20% (w/v), preferably 0.05 to 10%, of the GIP compound. The GIP compounds may be in an acetate, phosphate, citrate or glutamate buffer allowing a pH of the final composition of about 3.0 to about 7.0; containing carbohydrate or polyhydric alcohol as tonicity modifier and, optionally, approximately 0.005 to 5.0% (w/v) of a preservative selected from the group consisting of m-cresol, benzyl alcohol, methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl parabens and phenol. Such a preservative is generally included if the formulated peptide is to be included in a multiple use product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment of the present invention, a pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention may contain a range of concentrations of GIP compounds, e.g., between about 0.01% to about 98% w/w, or between about 1 to about 98% w/w, or preferably between 80% and 90% w/w, or preferably between about 0.01% to about 50% w/w, or more preferably between about 10% to about 25% w/w in this embodiment. A sufficient amount of water for injection may be used to obtain the desired concentration of solution. The pharmaceutical formulations described herein may be lyophilized. An exemplary formulation can be 1 mg/mL GIP compound in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer solution, pH 4.2, containing 9.3% sucrose as an osmolality modifier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, where the pharmaceutical formulation is to be administered parenterally, the composition is formulation so as to deliver a dose of GIP polypeptide ranging from 0.1 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg body weight/day, preferably at doses ranging from 1 μg/kg to about 50 mg/kg body weight/day. Exemplary daily amounts may be in the range of a lower limit of 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 or 80 to an upper limit of 80 100, 150, 200, or 250. Parenteral administration may be carried out with an initial bolus followed by continuous infusion to maintain therapeutic circulating levels of drug product. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily optimize effective dosages and administration regimens as determined by good medical practice and the clinical condition of the individual patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the dose of GIP compound, either GIP analog, derivative or hybrid, for treatment of a human can be about 5 to about 50 fold lower than the dose used in a mouse to elicit a similar effect, such as the doses depicted herein. In a further embodiment, the dose for a human can be a 10 to 30-fold lower dose than that used in a mouse, or for example about 3 to 10 nmol/kg/d. In another embodiment, the dose in humans can be from about 0.1 to 20 ug/kg/day, and can be 0.5 to 10 ug/kg/d, and can be 1-2 ug/kg/d. These amounts may be achieved from either single or multiple dosing per day or from a sustained release delivery. For example, a sustained release composition if taken once weekly, can be provided at about 0.1 to 1.0 milligrams of GIP compound, depending factors as discussed herein and as would be known to a skilled practitioner. Once monthly or bi-monthly dosing would be adjusted accordingly. Should nausea occur that would compromise patient compliance, an escalating dose scheme can be used, starting from a lower dose that does not elicit substantial nausea to increasing doses until the therapeutic effective dose is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe frequency of dosing will depend on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the agents and the routes of administration. The optimal pharmaceutical formulation will be determined by one of skill in the art depending on the route of administration and the desired dosage. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra, pages 1435-1712. Such formulations may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo clearance of the administered agents. Depending on the route of administration, a suitable dose may be calculated according to body weight, body surface areas or organ size. Further refinement of the calculations necessary to determine the appropriate treatment dose is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation, especially in light of the dosage information and assays disclosed herein, as well as the pharmacokinetic data observed in animals or human clinical trials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment a formulation of the invention is a liquid, solid, or semi-solid depot, slow, or continuous release formulation capable of delivering an active ingredient of the invention (or multiple active ingredients as for use in the adjunct therapies mentioned herein) over a time period of at least one hour. The release can occur over a period of 24 hours to four months. Such slow or extended release formulations can, in some embodiments, comprise the active ingredient in a slow dissolving form or formulation, such as a slow-dissolving peptide crystal (such as disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,380,357), in a matrix, or in a coating such as, e.g., an enteric coating or slow-dissolving coating (e.g., coated granules of active ingredient). Slow release matrices are commonly a biodegradable polymer, non-biodegradable polymer, wax, fatty material, etc., and are known in the art (e.g., see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,368,630 and related patents, 6,379,704 and related patents). In addition, parenteral controlled release delivery can be achieved by forming polymeric microcapsules, matrices, solutions, implants and devices and administering them parenterally or by surgical means. These dosage forms would typically have a lower bioavailability due to entrapment of some of the peptide in the polymer matrix or device. (See e.g., US Pat. Nos. 6,379,704, 6,379,703, and 6,296,842).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment are microencapsulated GIP compounds, either a GIP analog, derivative or hybrid, for sustained delivery. Suitable polymer matrix and excipient formulations, and methods for making them, are provided for example, in US2005271702 published Dec. 8, 2005, for example. The matrix may be formulated as microspheres for injection or otherwise configured as an implantable device. Such a composition for the sustained release of biologically active GIP compound while comprise, preferably consist essentially of, a biocompatible polymer, the GIP compound and a sugar. The sugar can stabilize the peptide during manufacture, storage and use. The sustained release composition can comprise GIP compound from about 0.1% w/w to about 10% w/w of the total weight of the sustained release composition. The GIP polypeptide can be present from about 0.5% w/w to about 5% w/w of the total weight of the sustained release composition. In one embodiment the GIP compound will be present from about 2% to 5%. In one embodiment, to minimize initial burst and to increase the sustained release period, the sustained release composition can have a low porosity. In such embodiments, the sustained release composition has a total pore volume of about 0.1 mL/g or less. In addition the total pore volume can be from 0.0 to 0.1 mL/g and from 0.01 to less than 0.1 mL/g. For example, in one embodiment the total pore volume is about 0.1 mL/g or less as determined using mercury intrusion porosimetry. The sugar can be present from about 0.01% w/w to about 10% w/w of the total weight of the sustained release composition. In one embodiment the sugar is present from about 0.1% w/w to about 5% w/w of the total weight of the sustained release composition. In another embodiment the total combined percent weight of drug and excipient(s) is from about 2% to about 8%. The sugar can be selected from a monosaccharide, a disaccharide, a sugar alcohol or a combination thereof. In one embodiment the sugar is selected from sucrose, mannitol, trehalose, and combinations thereof. While any biocompatible, biodegradable polymer may be used, the polymer can be selected from the group consisting of poly(lactides), poly(glycolides), poly(lactide-co-glycolides), poly(lactic acid)s, poly(glycolic acid)s, poly(lactic acid co-glycolic acid)s, polycaprolactone, polycarbonates, polyesteramides, polyanhydrides, poly(amino acids), polyorthoesters, polycyanoacrylates, poly(p dioxanone), poly(alkylene oxalate)s, biodegradable polyurethanes, blends thereof and copolymers thereof. In one embodiment of particular interest the polymer comprises poly(lactide-co-glycolide), and further can be a 50:50 poly(lactide-co-glycolide), and further can have an inherent viscosity of between about 0.3 and 0.5 dL/g. In another embodiment when the sustained release compositions have a low porosity as described herein, which serves to both reduce initial release and to provide longer sustained release with a desirable Cmax to Cave ratio, additional excipients can be present. Such agents preferably will have little or no substantial effect on release rate. Such excipients can include those that provide or enhance agent stability, either during manufacturing, storage or release. Suitable stabilizers include, for example, carbohydrates, amino acids, fatty acids and surfactants and are known to those skilled in the art. Further, stabilizers include “antioxidants” such as methionine, vitamin C, vitamin E and maleic acid. The antioxidant can be present as part of a stabilized aqueous formulation or added into the polymer phase. Further a pH buffer can be added. Buffers are solutions containing either a weak acid and a related salt of the acid, or a weak base and a salt of the base. Buffers can maintain a desired pH to stabilize the formulation during any step of manufacturing, storage or release. For example, the buffer can be a monobasic phosphate salt or dibasic phosphate salt or combinations thereof or a volatile buffer such as ammonium bicarbonate. Other buffers include but are not limited to acetate, citrate, succinate and amino acids such as glycine, arginine and histidine. The buffer can be present in the formulation from about 0% to about 10% of the total weight, or less than about 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 mM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein one of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine frequency, timing and dose of a GIP or novel GIP analog of the invention for treatment, particularly for conditions associated with elevated glucose, and further when used in adjunct therapy. For example a dose-response relationship over time for the glucose-lowering effect of agent of interest can be first determined, followed by determining a dose-response relationship with the added GIP or novel GIP analog in relation to the doses selected for the other agent. In one example patients with \ntype\n 2 diabetes are treated and assessed following randomized, subcutaneous injection of placebo, and various amounts of agent on separate days following an overnight fast. Injections are given immediately before ingestion of a standardized Sustacal® meal (7 kcal/kg) followed by collection of plasma glucose samples at frequent intervals during the subsequent 300 minutes. Glycemic response can be quantified as the time-weighted mean (±SE) change in plasma glucose concentration during the 5-hr period. An ED\n50 \nfor the glucose lowering effect is determined, and appropriate dose of agent that lowers postprandial plasma glucose concentrations is selected. Subsequently, in a similar study, this dosage is administered to patients while administering varying doses of GIP or a novel GIP analog in order to determine an appropriate dose of GIP that will act in concert with the first agent to further lower or prolong glucose lowering.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, if desired, the timing of administration of the GIP dose relative to when or how long the first agent was administered is examined in order to identify an optimal dosing regimen. For example, a dose of exenatide can be given on \nday\n 1, followed by administration of GIP on \nday\n 2, preferably once a glucose lowering response is observed resulting from the exenatide alone. In another embodiment, alternating agent dosing with GIP dosing is provided. The agent may be administered every other period alternating with GIP administration. The period can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days, 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 months. The period can be varied, such as \nGIP administration\n 2 days after agent and \nagent administration\n 7 days after GIP treatment. Sustained release formulations or methods will extend the period in each case. Further, GIP or novel GIP analogs can be provided in adjunct therapy with (or after cessation of) beta cell neogenesis therapy or islet or beta cell transplantation, where beta cells are increased in number, thus providing a glucose-lowering post treatment. Consequently, in one embodiment such treatment, while not entirely creating a normoglycemia, nonetheless provides a patient with a sufficiently lowered glucose level, that resistance to GIP is attenuated such that further or more normal glucose levels are achieved post-prandially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the agent will have been administered or the method will have been applied at least twenty-four hours prior to commencing GIP administration. More specifically the intervening period can be 24, 36, 48, 60 or 72 hours to 4, 5, 6, 7 or more days, to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more weeks, or any particular intervening time in hours or minutes within the above range. Alternatively, blood glucose levels can be monitored regularly or post-prandially as would be known in the art to measure the effect of the glucose-lowering agent, using methods well known in the art, during and/or following administration of the agent. The administration of GIP can then be performed either at a time when the subject shows a level of response e.g., blood glucose level, indicative of reduced resistance to GIP, at which time or thereafter GIP or a novel GIP analog can be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein, in another embodiment of adjunct therapy with a GIP or novel GIP analog, the therapy comprises an agent or method that slows nutrient to the duodenum (or other more distal nutrient-sensing GIP-secreting sites) that results in lowering glucose levels compared to the absence of the agent or method. In yet another embodiment adjunct therapy comprises an agent or method that slows gastric emptying. In addition to the viscous decelerants, such as described herein (e.g., guar and fiber), the agent includes pharmacologic decelerants of gastric emptying, and includes gut hormones for which gastric slowing is a physiologic event. Such agents include agonists of amylin (e.g. pramlintide), agonists of GLP1 and exendin (e.g. exenatide, NN2211, ZP-10. liraglutide), agonists of CCK, agonists of PYY, agonists of secretin, agonists of GRP, agonists of neuromedins, and agonists of urocortin. In further embodiments are agents that directly or indirectly promote agonist signaling of the physiologic gastric decelerants. Such agents include secretagogues of endogenous gastric decelerants, and inhibitors of their degrading enzymes, including dipeptidyl dipeptidase inhibitors, or other inhibitors of their clearance, especially at the kidney. In other embodiments are therapeutic strategies that slow the appearance of nutrient stimulus at GIP-secreting cells. Examples include modulation of digestive functions through inhibition of digestive secretions (e.g. gastric acid, pancreatic enzymes, bile) or through inhibition of the digestive effect of such secretions (e.g. acid neutralization, enzyme inhibition, bile sequestration) Inhibiting digestive secretion can occur via agents that directly achieve this (e.g. somatostatin, amylin, calcitonins, PYY) or by agents that interfere with endogenous pro-secretory pathways (e.g. luminal CCK-releasing factor). In one embodiment the adjunct therapy comprises a method that achieves slower gastric emptying and lower nutrient uptake, e.g. diminishes nutrient drive at GIP secreting cells. In one such embodiment is gastric bypass surgery, for example Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery, lap band, or physical devices that physically divert nutrient flow from the duodenum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments adjunct therapy comprises methods that stimulate secretion of, or slow degradation of, gastric decelerants. As mentioned guar gum ingestion is one example, for example 10 grams guar gum flour per meal. In Another agent is xanthum gum. Other decelerants of nutrient absorption include fiber, as for example provided in a high fiber diet, and as rough fiber in breads and bran. Another agent is a glucosidase inhibitor, such as acarbose, which slows the rate at which glucose (and fructose) is generated from sucrose at gut brush border disaccharidases. Yet another agent is Miglitol, another a glucosidase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment gastric emptying is achieved or mediated by administering a peptide or peptide agonist. Based on the rat, doses of the following peptides have been determined to slow gastric emptying, and are entirely suitable as agents for adjunct therapies of the invention: amylin (e.g., pramlintide doses of 60-600 μg/day); GLP1 or exendin agonist (e.g., exenatide dose range of 10-50 μg/day); CCK and agonists (see Young et al. “Dose-responses for the slowing of gastric emptying in a rodent model by glucagon-like peptide (7-36)NH2, amylin, cholecystokinin, and other possible regulators of nutrient uptake.” Metabolism 451-3 (1996); incorporated herein by reference). Other agents include Secretin and agonists, CGRP and agonists, Neuromedin agonists, Urocortin agonists, GRP and bombesin agonists, and PYY and agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the embodiments herein, a method of defining doses can be based on a desired degree of slowing, which can be readily determined. For example, therapeutic doses of pramlintide (30, 60 90 μg; see Kong et al. “The effect of single doses of pramlintide on gastric emptying of two meals in men with IDDM.” Diabetologia. 41577-583 (1998)) approximately doubled the half-emptying time of the stomach. Accordingly, in one embodiment adjunct therapy comprises an agent or method that increases the half-emptying time of the stomach by about 200%, however in other embodiments the t ½ of stomach emptying can increased by more than about 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 200%, 300% and even 400% or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy example, an ED50 for exenatide slowing of gastric emptying has been reported at about 0.05 μg/kg (e.g., approximately currently used clinical dose) (see Kolterman et al. “Dose-response for inhibition of glucagon secretion and gastric emptying by synthetic exendin-4 (AC2993) in subjects with \ntype\n 2 diabetes.” Diabetes 49 (suppl 1)A114 Abstract 460-P (2000)). In adjunct therapy with a GIP or a novel GIP analog such slowing will provide a increased benefit to the subject. Consequently, in one embodiment agents or methods that provide an equivalent slowing of gastric emptying at pharmaceutically acceptable doses are suitable agents or methods. As discussed throughout, other embodiments of adjunct therapy comprise mammalian amylins, the (25,28,29)proline-human amylin analog (pramlintide), and salmon calcitonin, those being amongst the most potent. Additional suitable peptides and their EC50 (EC(50) nmol/kg_sem (EC(50) in μg): Pramlintide, 0.09\n—\n0.08 log (0.07 μg); Human amylin, 0.19\n—\n0.11 log (0.15 μg); Rat amylin, 0.23\n—\n0.08 log (0.18 μg); Salmon calcitonin, 0.28\n—\n0.07 log (0.19 μg); Rat calcitonin, 0.94\n—\n0.18 log (0.64 μg); Rat CGRP, 2.13\n—\n0.29 log (1.62 μg); GLP-1 (7-36)NH2, 2.76\n—\n0.12 log (1.82 μg); Secretin, 3.09\n—\n0.20 log (1.87n); CCK-8, 12.8\n—\n0.20 log (2.93 μg); Gastrin releasing peptide, 49.9\n—\n0.05 log (28.5 μg) (see Gedulin et al. “Comparison of 21 peptides on inhibition of gastric emptying in conscious rats.” Dig. Dis. Week. A742 (abstract 2967) (1996); This study reported the potency and effect of 21 peptides to modulate gastric emptying in dose-response studies in conscious rats (n=˜18 rats/peptide, rat weight ˜200 g). Peptide was injected subcutaneously 5 min before gavage with an acaloric dye-labeled methyl cellulose gel. Animals were sacrificed 20 min later and the dye content of the stomach measured spectroscopically to assess emptying. Only 10 peptides were found to fully inhibit gastric emptying at doses up to 100 ug/rat. Peptides found to be either weakly active or inactive at doses of 100 μg were vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), pancreatic polypeptide, neuropeptide Y, glucagon, insulin (if plasma glucose was maintained constant), gastrin, somatostatin, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP38), adrenomedullin and deamidated pramlintide.). In other embodiments of the invention the agent comprise a agonist of any of the peptides mentioned herein, such as an antibody or antibody fragment agonist or small molecule agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described throughout, such agents (or their combination) can be administered either separately or together with GIP or can comprise a chimeric molecule with a GIP, e.g., either chemically linked or recombinant fusion. As described throughout (e.g., see times and periods mentioned herein), when administered separately GIP can be administered either at a designated time point after administration of the agent(s) or method, or it can be administered at or shortly after a desired effect has been obtained by prior administration of the agent or method, such effect associated with reducing the subject's GIP resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that the pharmaceutical compositions and treatment methods of the invention may be useful in fields of human medicine and veterinary medicine. Thus the subject to be treated may be a mammal, preferably human or other animal. For veterinary purposes, subjects include for example, farm animals including cows, sheep, pigs, horses and goats, companion animals such as dogs and cats, exotic and/or zoo animals, laboratory animals including mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs and hamsters; and poultry such as chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the present invention contemplates a kit comprising a GIP analog or hybrid polypeptide of the invention, components suitable for preparing said GIP compound polypeptide of the invention for pharmaceutical application, and instructions for using GIP compound polypeptide and components for pharmaceutical application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following formulation method can be used with the GIP compounds, as well as with other suitable drug compounds. Generally, while screening for and formulating peptide or protein candidates for pharmaceutical applications, formulation scientists seek compounds where the solubility and physical stability and/or chemical stability are somewhat within the same pH range, making it easier to formulate and have sufficiently long shelf-life for clinical use. However, compounds that have solubility and stability maxima at different pH ranges present a formulation challenge. Because the solubility and stability of these drug candidates occur at different pH ranges, a common practice is to screen excipients to enhance the solubility where the peptide is most stable. Often times, however, the solubility increased only slightly by the solubility enhancer, but compromised the chemical stability of the peptide/protein. Exemplary bioactive GIP compounds where solubility and physical/chemical stability are at different ranges of pH include AC163794, AC164326. AC164850, AC164190, AC164847, AC164957, AC164947 and AC164948. For example, a drug compound that is a candidate for this method may have optimal physical/chemical stability at about \npH\n 6, instability near the isoelectric point (e.g. pI ˜5), and chemically stability, but lack desired solubility near the desired pH for formulation, \ne.g. pH\n 4. In contrast, exemplary compounds where the properties share the same pH range include AC164233, AC164815, AC164816, AC164853, AC164854, and AC164855.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause the solubility and stability of peptides can occur at different pH ranges, a common practice is to screen excipients to enhance the solubility where the peptide is most stable. However, in many cases the solubility enhancer increases only slightly the solubility, but compromises the chemical stability of the peptide/protein. However, the present invention is based on a different approach to the problem. The method entails solubilizing the drug at a pH range at which the drug is maximally soluble, optimally soluble or at a sufficient and desirable concentration. Long-term physical or chemical stability (such as determine by an accelerated stability study, typically 40 degrees C. for 1 to 7 or more days) is not of concern at this step, since the drug need only be sufficiently stable until and during the subsequent processing step. By long-term stability is meant a period of time and under such conditions during which the drug is stored during transport and prior to therapeutic use. The concentrated drug solution (first solution) may be used as a bulk solution to fill commercial vials, etc. The drug solution is then dried to remove the aqueous phase. This is typically done in vial form or in the container for therapeutic use. Just prior to use or upon use, the dried material is reconstituted, and used for administration. In one embodiment, the drug solution pH is first optimized to attain the desired drug concentration (solubility, mg/mL) (i.e. the first solution). Secondly, the first solution is treated to remove the aqueous phase, as by lyophilization. The dried material provides a stable storage form. Thirdly, prior to or upon therapeutic use the lyophilized material is reconstituted with a buffered solution such that the dissolved drug is at a suitable dosing concentration that is stable during the use period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of buffers can be used at various pHs to provide the first solution where the protein has maximal, optimal or desired solubility, as would be known to the formulation chemist with regard to the drug compound of interest. In one embodiment the buffer is volatile, such as an acetate. In another embodiment, the buffer is not volatile but does not significantly affect the stability of the compound in the final formulation upon reconstitution prior to use. In yet another embodiment, the buffer comprises and contributes to the final formulation upon reconstitution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment a tonicity modifier and/or lyo/cryoprotectant can be used as would be known by a formulation chemist with regard to the drug of interest. For peptide and polypeptide compounds, these excipients can include mannitol, sucrose, trehalose, or glycerol. These compounds can be included in the first solution, if solubility is not adversely affected, or can be included in the reconstitution vehicle or diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method can be used to formulate drug products containing biomolecules (e.g., peptides or proteins), that have low inherent solubility in the pH range where these compounds are optimally stable. Other examples of suitable biologically active agents that can have low inherent solubility in the pH range where these compounds are optimally stable include GLP-1 peptides and analogs, immunoglobulins, antibodies, cytokines (e.g. lymphokines, monokines, chemokines), blood clotting factors, hemopoietic factors, interleukins (IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6), interferons (β-IFN, α-IFN and γ-IFN), erythropoietin, nucleases, tumor necrosis factor, colony stimulating factors (e.g., GCSF, GM-CSF, MCSF), insulin, enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase, tissue plasminogen activator), tumor suppressors, blood proteins, hormones and hormone analogs (e.g., growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH)), vaccines (e.g., tumoral, bacterial and viral antigens); somatostatin; antigens; blood coagulation factors; growth factors (e.g., nerve growth factor, insulin-like growth factor); protein inhibitors, protein antagonists, and protein agonists; nucleic acids, such as antisense molecules; oligonucleotides; and ribozymes. Small molecular weight agents suitable for use in the method so long as they have low inherent solubility in the pH range where these compounds are optimally stable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following are examples present exemplary solutions and formulations, which can also be used with GIP analogs presented herein. In one embodiment, \nFormulation\n 1, the first solution is about 2 mg/mL drug (e.g. AC163794, AC164850, or AC164288 having a solubility range of about 0.5-5 mg/mL) in 10 mM Tris buffer (range: 10-50 mM) with about 5.07% mannitol at about pH 8.5 (range: ±0.5). The aqueous phase is removed, for example by lyophilization. Prior to use, the material is reconstituted with an (acidic) diluent to bring the pH to 7 (range: ±0.5). In another embodiment, \nFormulation\n 2, the first solution is about 2 mg/mL drug (e.g. AC163794, AC164850, or AC164288 (range: 0.5-5 mg/mL) in 10 mM glycylglycine buffer (range: 10-50 mM) with about 5.07% mannitol at about pH 8.5 (range: ±0.5). The aqueous phase is removed, for example by lyophilization. Prior to use, the material is reconstituted with an (acidic) diluent to bring the pH to 7 (range: ±0.5). In another embodiment, \nFormulation\n 3, the first solution is about 2 mg/mL drug (e.g. AC163794, AC164850, or AC164288 (range: 0.5-5 mg/mL) in 10 mM glycine (range: 10-50 mM) with 5.07% mannitol at pH 8.5 (range: ±0.5). The aqueous phase is removed, for example by lyophilization. Prior to use, the material is reconstituted with an (acidic) diluent to bring the pH to 7 (range: ±0.5). In another embodiment, \nFormulation\n 4, the first solution is about 2 mg/mL drug (e.g. AC163794, AC164850, or AC164288 (range: 0.5-5 mg/mL) in 10 mM Ethanolamine buffer (range: 10-50 mM) with about 5.07% mannitol at about pH 8.5 (range: ±0.5). The aqueous phase is removed, for example by lyophilization. Prior to use, the material is reconstituted with an (acidic) diluent to bring the pH to 7 (range: ±0.5). In another embodiment, \nFormulation\n 5, the first solution is about 2 mg/mL drug (e.g. AC163794, AC164850, or AC164288 (range: 0.5-5 mg/mL) in 10 mM phosphate buffer (range: 10-50 mM) with about 5.07% mannitol at about pH 8.0 (range: −1.0). The aqueous phase is removed, for example by lyophilization. Prior to use, the material is reconstituted with an (acidic) diluent to bring the pH to 7 (range: ±0.5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present application hereby incorporates by reference in their entirety commonly-owned: PCT/US05/04178 filed Feb. 11, 2005 and published as WO2005/077072; PCT/US2005/004351 filed Feb. 11, 2005; PCT/US2005/004631 filed Feb. 11, 2005; PCT/US2005/045471 filed Dec. 15, 2005; U.S. patent application Ser.

The disclosures of these publications in their entirety are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assist in understanding the present invention, the following Examples are included. The experiments relating to this invention should not, of course, be construed as specifically limiting the invention and such variations of the invention, now known or later developed, which would be within the purview of one skilled in the art are considered to fall within the scope of the invention as described herein and hereinafter claimed.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe examples illustrate the preparation of the present GIP polypeptides, and the testing of these GIP polypeptides of the invention in vitro and/or in vivo.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nPreparation of GIP Polypeptides\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptides of the invention may be assembled on a Symphony peptide synthesizer (Protein Technologies, Inc.) using Rink amide resin (Novabiochem) with a loading of 0.43-0.49 mmol/g at 0.050-0.100 mmol or a pre-loaded Wang Resin (Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-Wang resin) 0.63 mmol/g (Novabiochem). Fmoc amino acid (5.0 eq, 0.250-0.500 mmol) residues are dissolved at a concentration of 0.10 M in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. All other reagents (HBTU, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate and N,N-Diisopropylethylamine) are prepared as 0.55 M dimethylformamide solutions. The Fmoc protected amino acids are then coupled to the resin-bound amino acid using, HBTU (2.0 eq, 0.100-0.200 mmol), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (1.8 eq, 0.090-0.18 mmol), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (2.4 eq, 0.120-0.240 mmol) for 2 hours. Following the last amino acid coupling, the peptide is deprotected using 20% (v/v) piperidine in dimethylformamide for 1 hour. Once peptide sequence is complete, the Symphony peptide synthesizer is programmed to cleave the resin. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) cleavage of the peptide from resin is carried out using 93% TFA, 3% phenol, 3% water and 1% triisopropylsilane for 1 hour. The cleaved peptide is precipitated using tert-butyl methyl ether, pelleted by centrifugation and lyophilized. The pellet is re-dissolved in water (10-15 mL), filtered and purified via reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column and an acetonitrile/water gradient containing 0.1% TFA. The resulting peptides are purified to homogeneity by reverse phase HPLC and the purity is confirmed by LCMS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA general procedure for N-capping the peptides of the invention with fatty acids (e.g., octanoic and stearic acids) is as follows: Peptide on rink amide resin (0.1 mmol) is suspended in NMP (5 mL). In a separate vial, HBTU (0.3 mmol), HOBt (0.3 mmol) is dissolved in DMF (5 mL) followed by the addition of DIEA (0.6 mmol). This solution is added to the resin and this suspension is shaken for 2 hrs. The solvent is filtered and washed thoroughly with NMP (5 mLx4) and CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(20 mL), dried and is subjected to the TFA cleavage for 1 hr. The yield of the desired peptide is ca. 40 mg after cleavage and purification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPEG modification may be carried out in solution on a free epsilon-amino group of lysine or a terminal amino group of a purified peptide using commercially available activated PEG esters. The resulting PEGylated derivatives are purified to homogeneity by reverse phase HPLC and the purity is confirmed by LC/MS and MALDI-MS.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nBinding Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nThe GIP polypeptides of the invention may be tested in a variety of receptor, e.g. GIPR, GLP-1R, amylin receptor, binding assays using binding assay methodologies generally known to those skilled in the art. Such assays include those described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGIP Receptor Binding Assay: To identify GIP analog peptides having affinity for the human GIP receptor the following assay was performed in a high throughput format. Cell membranes were prepared from confluent cultures of an HEK293 cell line stably expressing the human GIP receptor (HEK-GIPR), snap frozen, and stored at −80 degrees C. until use. At the time of assay, membranes were thawed on ice and diluted to 0.02 mg/mL in ice cold binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.5% BSA, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 170 μM Phosphoramidon, 1.5 mM Bestatin-HCL, and 70 mM Bacitracin). Heterologous binding assays were initiated by combining membranes with 30 pM 1251-GIP and 10 nM individual unlabeled GIP analogs diluted in assay buffer. Reactions were allowed to proceed to equilibrium for 90′ at room temperature with constant shaking Binding was then terminated by rapid filtration through 96-well glass fiber filter plates separating bound and unbound fractions of radioligand. Displacement of radioligand for each analog was calculated relative maximal displacement by human GIP (100%), and non-specific binding (0%) in the absence of any competing ligand. Analog peptides displacing more than 50% of total ligand were segregated to a ‘positive” test group and re-tested for accurate IC50 determination using the aforementioned format with increasing concentrations of unlabeled analog (10 pM-1 uM final concentration). Analogs displacing more than 50% of total ligand were scored to have IC50 values less than 10 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmylin binding assay: Evaluation of the binding of some exemplary compounds of the invention to amylin receptors may be carried out as follows in nucleus accumbens membranes prepared from rat brain. Male Sprague-Dawley® rats (200-250) grams are sacrificed by decapitation. Brains are removed and place in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). From the ventral surface, cuts are made rostral to the hypothalamus, bounded laterally by the olfactory tracts and extending at a 45° angle medially from these tracts. This basal forebrain tissue, containing the nucleus accumbens and surrounding regions, is weighed and homogenized in ice-cold 20 mM HEPES buffer (20 mM HEPES acid, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH at 23° C.). Membranes are washed three times in fresh buffer by centrifugation for 15 minutes at 48,000×g. The final membrane pellet is resuspended in 20 mM HEPES buffer containing 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo measure \n125\nI-amylin binding (see, Beaumont K et al. Can J Physiol Pharmacol. 1995 July; 73(7):1025-9), membranes from 4 mg original wet weight of tissue are incubated with \n125\nI-amylin at 12-16 pM in 20 mM HEPES buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mM PMSF. Solutions are incubated for 60 minutes at 2° C. Incubations are terminated by filtration through GF/B glass fiber filters (Whatman Inc., Clifton, N.J.) that are presoaked for 4 hours in 0.3% poylethyleneimine in order to reduce nonspecific binding of radiolabeled peptides. Filters are washed immediately before filtration with 5 ml cold PBS, and immediately after filtration with 15 ml cold PBS. Filters are removed and radioactivity assessed in a gamma-counter at a counting efficiency of 77%. Competition curves are generated by measuring binding in the presence of 10\n−12 \nto 10\n−6 \nM unlabeled test compound and are analyzed by nonlinear regression using a 4-parameter logistic equation (Inplot program; GraphPAD Software, San Diego).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCGRP receptor binding assay: Evaluation of the binding of compounds of the invention to CGRP receptors are essentially as described for amylin except using membranes prepared from SK-N-MC cells, known to express CGRP receptors (Muff, R. et.al., Ann NY Acad. Sci. 1992: 657, 106-16). Binding assays are performed as described for amylin except using 13,500 cpm 125I-hCGRP/well or 21.7 pM/well (Amersham).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdrenomedullin binding assay: Binding to the adrenomedullin receptor may be investigated using HUVECs that contain the adrenomedullin receptor (Kato J et.al., \nEur J. Pharmacol. \n1995, 289:383-5) using the Perkin Elmer AlphaScreen™ assay for cyclic AMP using an optimum of 25-30,000 cells per well. Elevation of cAMP levels is not large for HUVEC compared to CHO cells. As such, CHO cells may be chosen as a negative control since they do not express the adrenomedullin receptor if desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalcitonin receptor binding assay: Binding to the calcitonin receptor may be investigated using CHO cells or T47D cells, which also express the calcitonin receptor (Muff R. et.al, \nAnn N Y Acad. Sci. \n1992, 657:106-16 and Kuestner R. E. et. al. \nMol. Pharmacol. \n1994, 46:246-55), as known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLeptin binding assay: Two in vitro bioassays are routinely used to assess leptin binding and receptor activation (see e.g., White, et al., 1997. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94: 10657-10662). An alkaline phosphatase(“AP”)-leptin (“OB”) fusion protein (“AP-OB”) may be used to measure inhibition of leptin binding in the absence or presence of recombinant mouse leptin (positive control) or peptide, by COS-7 cells transfected with the long (signaling) form of the mouse OB receptor (“OB-RL”). Signal transduction assays may be done in GT1-7 cells cotransfected with AP reporter and OB-RL constructs. Secreted alkaline phosphatase(“SEAP”) activity in response to stimulation with mouse leptin or peptide may be measured by chemiluminescence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nY1 receptor binding assay: Membranes are prepared from confluent cultures of SK-N-MC cells that endogenously expresses the neuropeptide Y1 receptors. Membranes are incubated with 60 pM [125I]-human Peptide YY (2200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and with unlabeled test compound for 60 minutes at ambient temperature in a 96 well polystyrene plate. Then well contents are harvested onto a 96 well glass fiber plate using a Perkin Elmer plate harvestor. Dried glass fiber plates are combined with scintillant and counted on a Perkin Elmer scintillation counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nY2 receptor binding assay: Membranes are prepared from confluent cultures of SK-N-BE cells that endogenously expresses the neuropeptide Y2 receptors. Membranes are incubated with 30 pM [125I]-human Peptide YY (2200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and with unlabeled test compound for 60 minutes at ambient temperature in a 96 well polystyrene plate. Then well contents are harvested onto a 96 well glass fiber plate using a Perkin Elmer plate harvestor. Dried glass fiber plates are combined with scintillant and counted on a Perkin Elmer scintillation counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nY4 receptor binding assay: CHO-K1 cells are transiently transfected with cDNA encoding neuropeptide Y4 gene, and then forty-eight hours later membranes are prepared from confluent cell cultures. Membranes are incubated with 18 pM [125I]-human Pancreatic Polypeptide (2200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and with unlabeled test compound for 60 minutes at ambient temperature in a 96 well polystyrene plate. Then well contents are harvested onto a 96 well glass fiber plate using a Perkin Elmer plate harvestor. Dried glass fiber plates are combined with scintillant and counted on a Perkin Elmer scintillation counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nY5 receptor binding assay: CHO-K1 cells are transiently transfected with cDNA encoding neuropeptide Y5 gene, and then forty-eight hours later membranes are prepared from confluent cell cultures. Membranes are incubated with 44 pM [125I]-human Peptide YY (2200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and with unlabeled test compound for 60 minutes at ambient temperature in a 96 well polystyrene plate. Then well contents are harvested onto a 96 well glass fiber plate using a Perkin Elmer plate harvestor. Dried glass fiber plates are combined with scintillant and counted on a Perkin Elmer scintillation counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP-1 receptor binding assay: GLP-1 receptor binding activity and affinity may be measured using a binding displacement assay in which the receptor source is RINm5F cell membranes, and the ligand is [125I]GLP-1. Homogenized RINm5F cell membranes are incubated in 20 mM HEPES buffer with 40,000 cpm [125I]GLP-1 tracer, and varying concentrations of test compound for 2 hours at 23° C. with constant mixing. Reaction mixtures are filtered through glass filter pads presoaked with 0.3% PEI solution and rinsed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline. Bound counts are determined using a scintillation counter. Binding affinities are calculated using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.).\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nMouse Food Intake Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe GIP hybrid polypeptides of the invention may be tested for appetite suppression in the mouse food intake assay and for their effect on body weight gain in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. The experimental protocols for the screens are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFemale NIH/Swiss mice (8-24 weeks old) are group housed with a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle with lights on at 0600. Water and a standard pelleted mouse chow diet are available ad libitum, except as noted. Animals are fasted starting at approximately 1500 hrs, 1 day prior to experiment. The morning of the experiment, animals are divided into experimental groups. In a typical study, n=4 cages with 3 mice/cage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt time=0 min, all animals are given an intraperitoneal injection of vehicle or compound, typically in an amount ranging from about 10 nmol/kg to 75 nmol/kg, and immediately given a pre-weighed amount (10-15 g) of the standard chow. Food is removed and weighed, typically at 30, 60, and 120 minutes, to determine the amount of food consumed (Morley, Flood et al., \nAm. J. Physiol. \n267: R178-R184, 1994). Food intake is calculated by subtracting the weight of the food remaining at the e.g., 30, 60, 120, 180 and/or 240 minute time point, from the weight of the food provided initially at time=O, Significant treatment effects are identified by ANOVA (p<0.05). Where a significant difference exists, test means are compared to the control mean using Dunnett's test (Prism v. 2.01, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity in the food intake assay and sequence of parent molecules used with GIP for the synthesis of hybrids herein include:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n60 min\n\n\n \n\n\nMouse Food Intake, %\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nED50\n\n\n \n\n\nbasal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n \n\n\n(nmol/kg)\n\n\nSequence\n\n\n30 min\n\n\n60 min\n\n\n120 min\n\n\n180 min\n\n\nDose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPYY(3-36)\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\nIKPEAPGEDASPEELN\n\n\n−31\n\n\n−38\n\n\n−40\n\n\n−26\n\n\n10\n\n\nnmol/Kg\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 47)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRYYASLRHYLNLVTR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQRY-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExendin-4\n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLSKQME\n\n\n−41\n\n\n−60\n\n\n−61\n\n\n−60\n\n\n4.8\n\n\nnmol/Kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 5)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEEAVRLFIEWLKNGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPSSGAPPPS-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExendin-4 (1-28)\n\n\n11\n\n\n0.3\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLSKQME\n\n\n−50\n\n\n−62\n\n\n−49\n\n\n−49\n\n\n16.3\n\n\nnmol/Kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEEAVRLFIEWLKN-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n287)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExendin-4 (1-28)\n\n\n12\n\n\n13\n\n\nHGEGAFTSDLSKQLE\n\n\n−53\n\n\n−61\n\n\n−50\n\n\n−53\n\n\n16.7\n\n\nnmol/Kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Ala5, Leu14,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEEAVRLFIEFLKN-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhe25]\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRat Amylin (SEQ\n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\nKCNTATCATQRLANF\n\n\n−58\n\n\n−40\n\n\n−36.5\n\n\n−35.5\n\n\n25\n\n\nnmol/Kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID No. 33)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLVRSSNNLGPVLPPTN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nVGSNTY-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhAmylin(1-7)-\n\n\n10\n\n\n26\n\n\nKCNTATCVLGRLSQE\n\n\n−60\n\n\n−47\n\n\n−42.5\n\n\n−32\n\n\n25\n\n\nnmol/Kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n11,18\nArg-sCT(8-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLHRLQTYPRTNTGSN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27)-Amylin(33-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTY-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 95)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCK-8\n\n\n \n\n\n26\n\n\nDY(SO3) MGWMDF-\n\n\n−92\n\n\n−56\n\n\n−27\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\nnmol/Kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n289)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nBody Weight Gain in Fattened C57B1/6 (Diet-Induced-Obesity, or DIO) Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nMale C57BL/6 mice (4 weeks old at start of study) are fed high fat (HF, 58% of dietary kcal as fat) or low fat (LF, 11% of dietary kcal as fat) chow. After 4 weeks on chow, each mouse is implanted with an osmotic pump (Alzet # 2002) that subcutaneously delivers a predetermined dose of hybrid polypeptide continuously for two weeks. Body weight and food intake are measured weekly (Surwit et al., \nMetabolism—Clinical and Experimental, \n44: 645-51, 1995). Effects of the test compound are expressed as the mean +/− sd of % body weight change (i.e., % change from starting weight) of at least 14 mice per treatment group (p<0.05 ANOVA, Dunnett's test, Prism v. 2.01, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, Calif.).\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nFurther Testing of GIP Compounds and Hybrids\n\n\n \n \n \nCircular dichroism (CD) and NMR studies of Exendin-4 in aqueous media and in media containing organic cosolvents reveal that the C-terminal segment containing the sequence, LFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 183) (residue 21-39) forms a unique hydrophobic Trp-cage cluster resulting from interactions of Pro37 with Phe22 and Pro38 with Trp25 (14-16). Interestingly, there is no evidence of Trp-cage formation in water containing dodecylphosphocholine (DPC), a micellar state that mimics a biological membrane environment. NMR spectral data indicate rapid segmental motion of the eight C-terminal residues, presumably because the Trp-cage is destabilized due to energetically favorable association of the Trp residue with the phosphocholine head groups. This Trp-cage cluster motif is the first example of a protein-like tertiary structure displayed by a peptide, and could be responsible for imparting greater metabolic stability by masking protease-sensitive sites in the molecule in vivo (17).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one embodiment GIP analog or hybrids were designed with the premise that these peptides could assume the Trp cage structure reported for Exendin-4 by appending the Exendin tail sequence to the C-termini of the truncated GIP peptides GIP-(1-30) and GIP-(1-26). In addition, substitutions of the Tyr and Ala residues at the N-terminus of GIP were also made to confer resistance to DPP-IV peptidase degradation. These metabolically stable GIP analog or hybrids can be used as monotherapy or as an adjunct therapy with Exendin-4 (or other GLP-1 agonists) or ant-diabetic drugs such as metformin, sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones, pramlintide and insulin for treatment of \ntype\n 2 diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalogs can and were screened in GIP receptor binding and acute glucose lowering assays in NIH Swiss or diabetic db/db mice. See \nFIGS. 2-4\n. In vitro GLP-1 and glucagon receptor binding counterscreens were carried out to assess receptor specificity. The enzymatic stability of these GIP analog or hybrids are also being tested by incubation of the peptides with kidney brush-border membrane extract, membrane extract from RINm5F cells and purified neutral endopeptidase 24.11, followed by analysis of the cleavage products by LC-MS/MS (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalogs can be and were characterized further to assess their anti-diabetic effects, and in particular, the insulin secretion enhancement (insulinotropic effect) and glucose lowering action. For example, in normal mice Compound G was found to be significantly more efficacious than full length GIP (\nFIGS. 3A and 3B\n). As seen in \nFIG. 4\n, Compound G shows a pronounced and long-acting effect in lowering glucose in a diabetic mouse model, whereas the action of GIP at a 10 fold higher dose is modest and wanes over time. The glucose lowering profile of Compound G also differs from that of Exendin-4 (Compound K), which has a more rapid onset of action.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nEnhanced Glucose Lowering Effects of GIP Analogs and Hybrids\n\n\n \n \n \nGlucose lowering effect in vivo of novel GIP analog or hybrids was determined. \nFIGS. 8A and 8\n \nb \nprovide a result of one such study. Points represent mean±sem. Peptide was injected IP at t=0 immediately following baseline sample into 2-hour fasted NIH/Swiss mice. Samples were taken at t=60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes.

Addition of D-Ala even to full length improves glucose lowering compared to unmodified GIP: improved activity is seen in the first hour, but wanes over time. In contrast, a clearly superior and surprising profile is observed when both a protease resistant N-terminus and a Trp-cage C-terminal shield are present. For example, the profile an analog (see Compound G) comprising both aspects shows gradually increasing activity that peaks at t=120 min, and is more sustained than native GIP or its D-Ala2 version.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n depicts glucose lowering effect of novel GIP analog or hybrids, particularly the effect of a Trp-cage.

GIP compounds were selected that displayed significant glucose lowering in vivo. For example, while native GIP displayed no or little activity in basal glucose lowering (basal glucose lowering (% maximal decrease) at 0% and OGTT response of −10%), the analog 0601GIP4042 and the analog hybrids 0601GIP 3794 and 0601GIP 4178 displayed, respectively, a very transient −11%, −20% and delayed onset −20% for basal glucose lowering, and “ND” (not determined), −21% and −20% decrease in the OGTT assay. The delayed onset with 0601 GIP 4178 is consistent with the view that it binds to plasma proteins from which it is slowly released.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuration of action of GIP compounds and hybrids was determined in an IVGTT assay. In the typical IVGTT assays the test sample was administered by IV infusion. The IV infusion of sample was initiated at t=−30 min and continued through t=90. IV glucose was given at t=0. To determine a duration of action using the IVGTT assay, the sample was injected SC as a single injection at one time point indicated (e.g., t=−240, −120, −60 or −30) prior to administration of glucose. IV glucose was given at t=0. Insulin levels were determined at 0-30 minutes as AUC.

GIP, 0601GIP3794 and 0601GIP4178 produced a significant rise in insulin levels prior to the glucose challenge. All three analogs produced a significant lowering of the glucose excursion in response to the glucose challenge (data not shown). As described, fed, isoflurane anesthetized HSD male rats were intubated and cannulated via femoral artery and vein and allowed to stabilize for 1 hour. Following stabilization, an i.v. infusion of saline, GIP, or GIP analog hybrid was started (t=−30). At t=0, an i.v. bolus of 5.7 mmol/kg D-glucose was administered over 2 minutes. Samples for glucose measurement and insulin concentrations were taken at various time points before and after (0 to 90 minutes) glucose infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional GIP hybrids that will be active in the IVGTT assay include:\n\n\n \n \n0601GIP4252 [dAla2]GIP-(1-30)-[Octylglycine 34] Exendin-4 (31-39);\n\n\n0601GIP4285 [dAla2, Leu14, Ala18, glu21] GIP-(1-30)-Exendin-4 (31-39);\n\n\n0601GIP4233 [dAla2] GIP-(1-30)-fGLP-1v2-(31-37); and\n\n\n0601GIP4179 [dAla2, Leu14, beta-Ala31, beta-Ala32] GIP-(1-32)-Exendin-4 (31-39).\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso performed were insulin secretion enhancement assays using mouse islet cells. Islet cells were isolated as follows. Mouse islets were isolated with technique described previously (Gotoh M, Maki T, Kiyoizumi T, Satomi S, Monaco A P (1985) An improved method for isolation of mouse pancreatic islets. Transplantation 40(4):437-438). Briefly, 0.35 mg/ml Liberase R1 (Roche Applied Science) solution was injected into pancreatic duct and pancreas was digested for 18 min at 37° C. Islets were separated from exocrine tissue using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) discontinuous density gradient centrifugation for 20 min at 900 g. Before insulin secretion experiments, islets were cultured for 2 days in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mM Hepes, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37° C. with 5% CO2. The insulin secretion in vitro assay was performed as follows. Glucose- and peptide-induced insulin secretion was performed according to previously described method with slight modifications (Tatarkiewicz k, Garcia M, Omer A, Van Schilfgaarde R, Weir G C, De Vos P (2001) C-peptide responses after meal challenge in mice transplanted with microencapsulated rat islets. Diabetologia 44(5):646-53). Before stimulation, islets were washed 3 times and preincubated with RPMI-1640 supplemented with 0.5% BSA and containing 1.67 mM glucose. After 1 hr preincubation, islets were washed again 3 times to remove residual insulin and islets were aliquoted into 24-well plates with culture inserts (Millicell-PCF, Millipore) containing stimulation medium. The static incubation was performed with approx. 10 islets per well in triplicates for 1 hr at 37 degrees C. Stimulatory medium contained 16.7 mM glucose with GIP analogs in doses of 1, 10, 100 nM. At the end of insulin secretion experiment, inserts with islets were removed, media were collected and frozen at -20 degrees C. for insulin ELISA assay (Crystal Chem, Inc.). Acid ethanol was applied for overnight extraction of insulin from remaining islets. Total islet insulin content per well was used to normalize insulin release results.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nPeptide Stability and Protease Resistance\n\n\n \n \n \nResistance to proteases was determined according to the protocol of Hupe-Sodmann et al. (Peptides 18(5):625-632 (1997)) using the cell line RINmF5. This well-differentiated cell line is generally accepted as a pancreatic beta-cell model. The indicated GIP compounds (30 μM) were incubated with RINm5F cell membrane extracts at 37° C., and degradation of peptides, in proportion to percentage of the parent peptide was monitored at different intervals for 6 hr using LC-MS. The data (see \nFIG. 11\n) indicate that the [DAla2]-GIP(1-30)-PSSGAPPPS GIP hybrid (Compound G (also designated 0601GIP3794); with C-terminally Trp-cage shield (e.g., exendin-4 tail)) is more stable than its parent molecule GIP(1-30) without the shield or the full length GIP(1-42). Accordingly the addition of a Trp-cage shield provides a surprisingly superior protease resistance compared to the absence of the cage or the presence of an alternate non-cage-forming sequence, such as the native GIP C-terminal sequence. Further the data indicates that a GIP(1-30) truncation can accommodate foreign sequences at its C-terminus and, in particular, can accommodate a Trp-cage shield sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalogs were also tested for stability in human plasma. Briefly, test compounds were dissolved water (or in very dilute DMSO as needed), added to human plasma or human kidney brush border membrane (hKBBM) preparations, incubated for 37° C. for time-points (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hrs), extracted with methanol (1:4 ratio), and the supernatant analyze by LC/MS/MS. Typically, the GIP samples were prepared from a stock solution of peptides in water at 1 mg/mL concentration. The plasma stability samples were prepared by spiking a human plasma pool with the stock solution to a final concentration of 20 ug/mL. The hKBBM samples were prepared by adding 5 uL of kidney membrane proteins (at 10 mg/mL) to 650 uL of PBS, and then spiking stock solution of the peptides to a final concentration of 20 ug/mL. After incubation at different time points (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 hrs) at 37 degrees C., 25 uL of each of the samples were diluted 1:4 with an aqueous solution of 1% formic acid using a BioTek™ Precision™ liquid handler. 50 μL of this diluted sample was injected into the Symbiosis Pharma™ system, and online solid phase extraction was performed. A 2 micron filter was used as a pre-column to prevent clogging of the Analytical (PLRPS, 1×20 mm) column. The HPLC pumps, Reliance™ autosampler and on-line solid phase extraction (SPE) were parts of an integrated system (Symbiosis Pharma™,Spark Holland, Inc.) controlled by a driver on the Mass Spectrometer (Analyst™) software. An Applied Biosystems API 4000™ Qtrap mass spectrometer provided MRM detection. The HPLC gradient form 95:5 to 5:95, combined solvent A that consisted of water and solvent B that consisted of acetonitrile, both with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA). Total analysis time was about 3.6 minutes per sample. A SPE cartridge (Hysphere GP resin, 2.0×4 mm, 10-15 μm) was used for sample extraction. After washing, samples were eluted with methanol for the analytical analysis. The integrated peak areas for the peptides were used to generate the following parameters: 1) normalized area counts for all time points to time zero for all peptides; 2) calculated Area Under the Curves (AUC) for all peptides, and 3) normalized all AUCs to AUC for exendin-4, which is given a value of 100% (the positive control).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the human plasma stability assays, “stable” was scored as greater than about 90% remaining at 5 hours of treatment to human plasma, “intermediately stable” was scored as greater than about 75% remaining at 2 hours and less than about 90% remaining at 5 hours, and “unstable” was scored as less than about 75% remaining at 2 hours. Unstable analogs and hybrids would generally be unsuited in the methods presented herein. Exemplary compounds were tested. Compounds scored as stable were 0601GIP3794, 0601 GIP 4150 and 0601GIP4233. Compounds scored as intermediately stable were 0601GIP4149, 0601GIP4152, 0601GIP4153, 0601GIP4176, 0601GIP4177, 0601GIP4215, 0601GIP4284, and 0601GIP4289. Compounds scored as unstable were 0601GIP1540, 0601GIP4147, 0601GIP4292, 0601GIP4293, and 0601GIP4294. GIP Compound 0601GIP4178 which contains an octylglycine, was scored as unstable, however it is DPP-IV resistant, and binds to plasma proteins complicating its extraction and detection; it is nonetheless believed to be a stable compound for the purposes of the methods herein. The GIP analog hybrid 0601GIP3794 and GIP compounds having a C-terminal frog GLP-1 “tail” were surprisingly at least as stable or more stable than exendin-4.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nFurther Exemplary GIP/amylin-sCT Hybrids\n\n\n \n \n \nFurther exemplary GIP phybrids, amide forms, were prepared.

Thus these GIP hybrid compounds combine the insulinotropic action (and other actions) of a GIP analog with a gastric emptying effect or beneficial calcium modulation effect (e.g. as for bone density maintenance) of an amylin mimetic. In one embodiment for each of these GIP hybrids a Gly linker is used, e.g. GlyGlyGly. While the amylin-sCT-amylin chimera did not lower blood glucose compared to vehicle, the GIP hybrids containing the amylin-sCT-amylin chimera effectively lowered blood glucose. Exemplary compounds of GIP and an amylin family module with this activity include 0601GIP4090 and 0601GIP4091.

The binding of a ligand to the receptor leads to G protein activation which in turns regulates Adenylyl Cyclase, the enzyme responsible for modulating intracellular levels of cAMP. Measurement of cAMP levels is widely used as an indicator of receptor function. Activation of cardiomyocyte Gs- and Gi-coupled receptors was determined as a measure of cAMP production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell Isolation. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated using a commercially available system. The Cellutron Isolation kit (nc-6031) (Cellutron, N.J.) and protocol was used for cell isolation. Sprague Dawley neonatal rats (1-2 days old) were decapitated and the beating heart dissected out into digestion buffer (Cellutron D1 buffer) to dissociate cells. For 15 rat hearts, 8 digestions with 6 mls of buffer (Cellutron D2 buffer) were sufficient. The resuspended cells incubated in buffer (Cellutron D3 buffer) for sufficient time to allow optimal dispersion and minimize the need for pipetting to break up clumps. Cells released from the first 2 digestions were discarded since a significant portion of these is red blood cells. Resuspended cells were filtered and allowed to pre-plate for 1 hour on plastic in an incubator in NS media (Cellutron, N.J.) in order to remove fibroblasts. After 1 hour of pre-plating, floating cells are removed and the flask rinsed with NS media. The floating cells and the cells in the rinse media were combined and counted. Residual red blood cells, which are smaller that the cardiac myocytes, were not counted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell Plating. At \nDay\n 0 of an experiment, the cells were isolated and plated in NS media at 8,000/384 well, 50,000/96 well or 500,000/12 well for 24 hours. At \nDay\n 1, the NS media was replaced with fresh NS media. It was observed that the recommended NW (Cellutron, N.J.) media did not typically support adequate cell growth or morphology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncAMP Assay. GIP compounds were tested for cAMP induction on the isolated, cultured cardiomyocytes. Test-compound induced cAMP levels were determined using a commercially available CisBio (Bedford Mass.) HRTF® (homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence) cAMP dynamic assay in a Gs/Gi 384-well adherent format, essentially as described by the manufacture (see also Gabriel et al., High throughput screening technologies for direct cyclic AMP measurement, Assay & Drug Dev. Technol. 2:291-303 (2003) and Cenni et al., HTRF® cyclic AMP assay: new optimized cell-based assay for better investigation of Gi coupled receptors, in Smart assays for screening, IIR Congress, Zurich (CH) (2003)). Dose response was determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor Gs assays the positive control was 10 uM forskolin and negative control was buffer. For Gi assays the positive control was buffer and the negative control was 10 uM forskolin. Test compound was incubated with cells for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C. in stimulation buffer ((200 mls contains 198.3 ml 1X HBSS, 1 ml 1M Hepes, 670ul 30% BSA titrated to pH 7.4 with 1 M NaOH). To measure cAMP produced, cells were lysed and cAMP assayed according to the manufacturers protocol. Exemplary results are shown in \nFIGS. 18A\n (GIP: human GIP(1-42) acid form) and 18B (GIP hybrid Compound G). The Y-axis is a ratio of time resolved fluorescence measurements taken at 665 nM divided by measurements taken at 620 nM. In this experiment the EC50 was 11.7 nM for the GIP hybrid and 9.1 nM for GIP. GLP-1 and exendin-4 displayed very low to no significant activity (data not shown). Further, from three independent experiments of cardiomyocyte Gs-coupled receptor activation, the EC50 (nM) was 15.6 for GIP, 0.7 for urocortin and 29.8 for the GIP hybrid Compound G. Urocortin is a known cardiac myocyte Gs-coupled receptor activator used as a positive control. GIP and the GIP hybrid typically gave receptor activation responses greater than 50%. Usdin et al. (Endocrinology 133:2861-2870 (1993)) reported cloning of a rat GIP receptor and its in situ hybridization to RNA in various rat tissues, including the heart, particularly the cardiac endothelium, which was consistent with labeling of the endothelium of major blood vessels. The results indicate that GIP compounds can provide a direct action on the heart.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nMeasurement of Circulatory System Effects in Conscious Rats by Telemetry After Administration of GIP Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Harlan Sprague Dawley rats housed at 22.8±0.8° C. in a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle were used to study the effects of test compounds on the circulatory system through the use of telemetry. The experiments were performed during the light cycle. Telemetry allows for real-time hemodynamic readings including arterial blood pressure, heart rate and arterial dP/dt, via an implanted radio transmitter in conscious, non-anesthetized, unrestrained rats. In the present Example, rats were injected with either vehicle, 80 nmol/kg GIP (human GIP(1-42) acid form), or 80 nmol/kg of 0601GIP3794 by remote intravenous dosing. Remote intravenous dosing was achieved through in-dwelling vascular access ports (Access Technologies (Skokie, Ill.). The port is secured to the underlying muscle just below the skin between the scapulae. The catheter resides in the jugular vein. Data were collected for up to 60 minutes following injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIGS. 19A-E\n the effect of the GIP hybrid to increase heart rate was transient relative to GIP (human GIP(1-42) acid form) (\nFIG. 19B\n), that that the GIP hybrid decreased mean arterial pressure while GIP had no effect (\nFIG. 19A\n), and that both compounds increased dP/dt similarly (\nFIG. 19C\n). \nFIGS. 19D and 19E\n demonstrate that the GIP hybrid provides a sustained lowering of systolic and diastolic pressures compared to either vehicle or GIP. Hybrid 0601GIP4091 had a beneficial effect on these cardiovascular parameters, similar to that of GIP and the amylin-sCT-\namylin chimera Compound\n 10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the data it can be seen that GIP displays a positive inotropic effect in intact rats without elevating arterial pressure. GIP also displayed a chronotropic (heart rate elevating) effect. The GIP hybrid displayed a prolonged inotropic effect (shown here as peak rate of increase in arterial pressure; dP/dt), compared to GIP, without causing cardiac acceleration, and invoked a decrease in arterial pressure. Accordingly, GIP hybrids can display vasodilation and perfusion benefits that are not associated with an increase in cardiac work. In addition the sustained lowering of either systolic pressure or diastolic pressure, including both, is a recognized beneficial cardiovascular effect linked to reducing hypertension and cardiovascular-associated morbidity and mortality events.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nLack of Effect of GIP on Weight Loss\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of GIP(1-42) and a GIP DPP-IV resistant analog/exendin tail hybrid (0601GIP3794) were tested for effect on food intake and on weight loss in DIO mice as described herein. As shown in \nFIG. 20A\n, it was observed that GIP did not acutely inhibit food intake in mice. In comparison, rat amylin at one tenth the dose caused a significant decrease in food intake within 30 min, relative to control. A trend for GIP to decrease food intake at later time points (60, 120 min) may have been an indirect effect due to its stimulation of amylin secretion. Points represent mean±sd of n=4 cages (3 mice/cage). Peptide was injected IP at t=0. Food was introduced immediately after injection and amount consumed measured at t=30, 60, and 120 min. * p<0.05 vs. vehicle control; ANOVA, Dunnett's test. Similarly the DPP-IV resistant GIP analog hybrid comprising an exendin tail, Compound 0601GIP3794, did not acutely inhibit food intake as reflected by no difference from vehicle control intake at 30 min (\nFIG. 20B\n). As with GIP, a trend for this compound to decrease food intake at later time points (60, 120 min) may have been due to its stimulation of amylin secretion. Points represent mean±sd of n=4 cages (3 mice/cage). Peptide was injected IP at t=0. Food was introduced immediately after injection and amount consumed measured at t=30, 60, and 120 min. * p<0.05 vs. vehicle control; ANOVA, Dunnett's test. In contrast to GIP and GIP agonists, exenatide and \nGLP\n 1 agonists directly and acutely inhibit food intake, independent of their effect to stimulate amylin secretion. A reduction in food intake is apparent at the first time point (\nFIG. 20C\n). Similarly, effects of GLP-1 and exenatide on gastric emptying and post-prandial glucose profiles have been reported in \ntype\n 1 diabetic subjects, indicating the effect is not dependent upon the presence of b cells or amylin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 21\n, GIP did not cause weight loss in diet-induced-obese mice. In mice in which body weight had been increased by feed a high-fat diet (HF Saline group), GIP infused via min-osmotic pump for 2 weeks had no effect on body weight change. In contrast, exenatide infused at a 30-fold lower rate reduced body weight change to that observed in mice fed a low fat diet (LF group). * P<0.05; ANOVA vs HF Saline. This demonstrates an anti- or non-catabolic effect of GIP. In contrast, it was observed herein that a GIP hybrid having an appropriate choice of a second hormone module, such as an amylin/sCT/amylin chimera, did cause a reduction in food intake and weight loss. Further a GIP hybrid containing an exendin family module also resulted in weight loss. The exendin-GIP hybrid 0601GIP4526 [HGEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEAVRLFIEWLKN(beta-A)(beta-A)K(#C)-NH2] (SEQ ID NO: 484) [YaEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQK(beta-A)(beta-A)K#] (SEQ ID No. 483) in which the two molecules were linked C-terminal to C-terminal displayed reduction of body weight sustained to \nday\n 7. This hybrid also reduced food intake in a mouse model. This hybrid bound to and activated both the GIP and the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nSolubility and Physical Stability\n\n\n \n \n \nGIP analogs comprising the modifications described here have surprisingly good solubility (at least about 1 mg/ml or at least about 2.5 mg/ml or even at least about 5 mg/ml) at least several pHs relevant for pharmaceutical formulation, storage and administration, while retaining superior bioactivity, duration of action and/or physical stability, as compared to human GIP or to a parent GIP compound such as 0601GIP3794. The following method can be used to compare solubility and physical and chemical stability at various pHs. The following exemplary pH and buffers can be used: pH 3.0 in 30 mM citrate, pH 4.0 in 30 mM acetate, pH 5.0 in 30 mM acetate, pH 6.0 in 30 mM histidine, pH 7.0 in 30 mM histidine, pH 8.0 in 30 mM phosphate and pH 9.0 in 30 mM borate. Two hundred ml of buffer is added to a vial containing the test peptide to achieve a 10 mg/ml or a 5 mg/ml solution. After vortexing for approximate 30 seconds, the appearance of the solution is observed under a Fiber-Lite. Buffer is continued added in 200 ml aliquots until the total volume of the solution reaches 1000 ml. The appearance of the solution is recorded after each 200 ml of buffer is added. The appearance versus the peptide concentration is recorded as clear, slightly hazy, hazy or cloudy. In one embodiment the GIP analog achieves a clear solution at least 2.5 mg/ml concentration at pH 4-8 or pH 5-7, and further at least 5.0 mg/ml at pH 4-8 or at pH 5-7.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assess stability at a pH, the solution above is filtered into a 2-mL Schott vial, and equally divided into 3 vials. Each vial is stoppered and tightly sealed. A first vial is incubated at 5° C. for 7 days, the second at 40° C. for 3 days, and the third at 40° C. for 7 days. After incubation, the appearance of all samples is recorded under the Fiber-Lite. If the peptide solution becomes cloudy or precipitated, the solution is filtered prior to HPLC analysis (reverse-phase HPLC method using Vydac C18 column) to determine amount of intact peptide remaining in solution. Alternatively, bioactivity can be measured. Stability is recorded as percent potency loss using the calculation [(% peptide at test day−% peptide at T0 at 5C)/% peptide at T0 at 5C] times 100. \nFIG. 27\n presents an exemplary pH versus solubility profile and a pH versus stability profile of 0601GIP5082.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the present invention has been described in terms of exemplary examples and embodiments, it is understood that variations and modifications will occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, it is intended that the appended claims cover all such equivalent variations which come within the scope of the invention as claimed."
