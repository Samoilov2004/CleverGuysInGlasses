Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to glucagon receptor polypeptide antagonists which inhibit the binding of the hormone glucagon to its receptor. More particularly, the present invention relates to high affinity glucagon receptor antibodies or Fab fragments thereof that inhibit binding of glucagon to its receptor and their use in the treatment or prevention of type 2 diabetes (NIDDM) and related disorders in mammalian species.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nGlucagon is 29 amino acid peptide hormone produced by pancreatic α-cells in response to low blood glucose levels. Glucagon binds to a membrane-associated glucagon receptor on the surface of hepatocytes, which triggers a G-protein signal transduction cascade, activating intracellular cyclic AMP and leading to release of glucose through denovo synthesis (gluconeogenesis) and glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnson et al., disclose polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to two extracellular portions of the rat receptor. In the assay disclosed, polyclonal antibodies raised against amino acid residues 126-137 and 206-219 were found to block binding of glucagon to the receptor in rat liver membranes (Unson et al., PNAS Vol. 93, pp. 310-315, January 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBuggy et al., discloses the preparation of a monoclonal antibody that is said to compete with glucagon for the hormone binding site of the receptor in an in vitro assay (Buggy et al., Horm. Metab. Res. 28 (1996) 215-219). In the assay disclosed the antibody, given the designation CIV395.7A, recognizes the human and rat glucagon receptors, but not mouse. In order to develop antibodies for human therapeutic treatments it is commonly necessary to perform pre-clinical efficacy and safety studies in validated rat and/or murine animal models. It would therefore greatly facilitate drug development of a therapeutic antibody and thus be highly desirable to provide a pre-clinical therapeutic antibody candidates that are able to bind rat, murine and human forms of the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWright et al., disclose a monoclonal antibody designated hGR-2 F6 and the amino acid sequence of a Fab fragment thereof. This antibody has been raised in a mouse against the human glucagon receptor and described in the disclosed assay as a competitive antagonist at this receptor (Wright et al., Acta Cryst. (2000) D56, 573-580). The applicant has found that hGR-2 F6 binds to the rat and murine forms of the glucagon receptor with only low affinity, and no therapeutic efficacy has been found for hGR-2F6 in a diabetic rat in vivo model at high doses. In particular, this antibody was unable to reduce blood serum glucose in the rat model with any statistical significance (unpublished).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe applicant has identified a need to provide therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that will bind with high affinity to the glucagon receptor and thereby inhibit the binding of glucagon thereto, to provide effective treatments for diabetes, preferably type 2 diabetes and related disorders. Furthermore, in order to allow pre-clinical drug development of an antibody it is clearly desirable to provide monoclonal antibodies that can bind to the human, rat and murine forms of the glucagon receptor to allow obligatory pre-clinical safety and efficacy studies to be undertaken.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel monoclonal antibodies or Fab fragments thereof that are able to specifically bind with a high affinity to native glucagon receptors of human, rat and murine origin. Furthermore, the present inventors provide monoclonal antibodies or Fab fragments thereof that not only bind glucagon receptors of multiple origins, but for the first time provide glucagon receptor binding monoclonal antibodies that show in vivo efficacy in their ability to reduce blood serum glucose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a first aspect the present invention relates to a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment, wherein said Fab fragment capable of binding to human, rat and murine glucagon receptors and inhibits glucagon binding to each receptor with a Ki of less than 50 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further unexpected finding the inventors for the first time provide antibodies or Fab fragments thereof capable of specifically binding to the glucagon receptor that are able to significantly increase in vivo serum concentrations of GLP-1. Increasing serum levels of GLP-1 is known in the art to enhance β-cell function, reduce glucagon secretion and delay gastric emptying and is recognized as being highly advantageous in the treatment of diabetes type 2 and associated conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a second aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody according to the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a third aspect, the invention provides a method of treating type 1 or type 2 diabetes and in the achievement of weight loss in a human, wherein said method comprises administrating an effective amount of a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody according to the present invention, to a patient in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fourth aspect of the invention comprises a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody according to the present invention for use as a medicament.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fifth aspect of the invention of relates to the use of a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody according to the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of type 1 or type 2 diabetes or in the achievement of weight loss in a human.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment, wherein said Fab fragment is capable of binding to human, rat and murine glucagon receptors and inhibits glucagon binding to each receptor with a Ki of less than 50 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides monoclonal antibodies, which in addition to the glucagon receptors of human, rat and murine origin, are also able to bind with a high affinity to the glucagon receptor of a cynomologous monkey. Preferably, the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment therefore also inhibits glucagon binding to a cynomologous monkey glucagon receptor with a Ki of less than 50 nM. Preferably the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment has a Ki at each of the named glucagon receptors of less than 30 nM, more preferably less than 20 nM, further preferred less than 10 nM. Further preferred the Fab fragment has an in vitro Ki at the rat, murine and cyno receptors of less than 20 nM and in vitro Ki at the human receptor of less than 5 nM. More preferably the Ki of the Fab fragment, and in particular at the human glucagon receptor, is from 0.1 nM to 15 nM, most preferably from 1 to 10 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment according to the present invention preferably has a functional binding affinity (Kb) at the human and rat glucagon receptors of at least 100 nM. Further preferred the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment has a functional binding affinity at these receptors of at least 50 nM, more preferably at least 10 nM. In a most preferred embodiment the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment has a functional binding affinity at the human and rat glucagon receptor of 1 to 10 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particularly unexpected finding, the applicant has noted a very rapid rate at which serum GLP-1 is increased and serum blood glucose decreased on in vivo exposure to the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment having the binding properties identified in accordance with this invention. In order to maximize this favourable effect it is preferable that the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment does not appreciably bind to the GLP receptor i.e. Ki greater than 5000 nM.\n\n\n \nDESCRIPTION OF THE SEQUENCES\n\n\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NOS 1 to 22 refer to the light and heavy chain CDRs of Table 1:\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 23 to 30 refer to preferred human framework regions described herein:\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 31 and 32 are amino acid and cDNA sequences of the human GluR:\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 33 and 34 are amino acid and cDNA sequences of the rat GluR:\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 35 and 36 are amino acid and cDNA sequences of the murine GluR:\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 37 and 38 are amino acid and cDNA sequences of the cyno GluR:\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 39 and 40 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 1 (Ab1)\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 41 and 42 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 2 (Ab2)\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 43 and 44 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 3 (Ab3)\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 45 and 46 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 4 (Ab4)\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 45 and 47 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 5 (Ab5)\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 45 and 48 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 6 (Ab6)\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 45 and 49 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 7 (Ab7)\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 50 refers to a preferred kappa light chain IgG4 constant region.\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 51 refers to a preferred heavy chain CH1 constant domain.\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 52 refers to a preferred modified human IgG4 Fc region.\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 53 to 55 refer to preferred light chain CDRs.\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 56 to 68 refer to preferred heavy chain CDRs.\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 59 and 60 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 1 (Ab1).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 61 and 62 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 2 (Ab2).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 63 and 64 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 3 (Ab3).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 65 and 66 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 4 (Ab4).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 65 and 67 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 5 (Ab5).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 65 and 68 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 6 (Ab6).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 65 and 69 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 7 (Ab7).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 70 and 71 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 1 (Ab1).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 72 and 73 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 2 (Ab2).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 74 and 75 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 3 (Ab3).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 76 and 77 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 4 (Ab4).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 76 and 78 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 5 (Ab5).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 76 and 79 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 6 (Ab6).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 76 and 80 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 7 (Ab7).\n\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe “glucagon receptor” also referred to herein as “GluR” belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor class 2 family consisting of a long amino terminal extracellular domain, seven transmembrane segments, and an intracellular C-terminal domain. Glucagon receptors are notably expressed on the surface of hepatocytes where they bind to glucagon and transduce the signal provided thereby into the cell. DNA sequences encoding glucagon receptors of rat and human origin have been isolated and disclosed in the art (EP0658200B1). The murine and cynomologous monkey homologues have also been isolated and sequenced (Burcelin, et al., Gene 164 (1995) 305-310); McNally et al., Peptides 25 (2004) 1171-1178).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “inhibits” as used herein with respect to an activity of an antibody or Fab fragment thereof of the invention means the ability to substantially antagonize the biological activity of the glucagon receptor. This ability is reflected in the Ki values calculated from the [\n125\nI] glucagon binding assay described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “humanized” as used in reference to a monoclonal antibody of the invention refers to an antibody with at least human frameworks and constant regions (CL, CH domains (e.g., CH1, CH2, CH3), and hinge), and CDRs derived from glucagon receptor binding antibodies. Human frameworks comprise frameworks that correspond to human germline sequences as well as sequences with somatic mutations. Human frameworks and constant regions may be fully human or may vary from the native sequences by one or more amino acid substitutions, terminal and intermediate additions and deletions, and the like. CDRs may be derived from one or more CDRs that bind to the glucagon specific receptors in this application in the context of any antibody framework. For example, the CDRs of the humanized antibody of the present invention may be derived from CDRs that bind glucagon receptors in the context of a mouse antibody framework and then are engineered to bind glucagon receptors in the context of a human framework.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody” refers to an antibody that is derived from a single copy or clone, including e.g., any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced. Preferably a monoclonal antibody of the invention exists in a homogeneous or substantially homogeneous population.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “in vivo efficacy” as used herein with respect to an antibody of the invention means the ability of the antibody to impart a positive biological effect in a human or animal model. Preferably in vivo efficacy refers to a glucose normalization effect on an animal showing elevated blood glucose in response to an antibody of the present invention as compared to a control response. A diabetic Zucker diabetic fatty rat (ZDF) model (Horm Metab Res. 2005 February; 37(2):79-83) may be appropriately used to assess in vivo efficacy, wherein in vivo efficacy preferably denotes 100% blood glucose normalization on exposure of the animal to ≦30 mg/kg dosage of humanized antibody according to the present invention. More preferably in vivo efficacy denotes 100% blood glucose normalization on exposure of the animal to a dosage of ≦15 mg/kg of antibody, further preferred at a dosage of ≦10 mg/kg, more preferably 0.1 to 5 mg/kg. In a most preferred embodiment in vivo efficacy is used to denote 100% blood glucose normalization in a diabetic ZDF rat model on exposure of the animal to 1 to 3 mg/kg dosage of humanized antibody according to the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “glucose normalization” refers to mean plasma glucose values in a ZDF rat model of less than 120 mg/dL, preferably in the range of 110 to 120 mg/dL. Plasma glucose may be determined in accordance with Etgen et al., (Metabolism 2000; 49(5): 684-688) or calculated from a conversion of whole blood glucose concentration in accordance with D'Orazio et al., (Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2006; 44(12): 1486-1490).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “Fab fragment” refers to that portion of an antibody molecule, within the variable region, which contains the amino acid residues of the light and heavy chain CDR and framework sequences in addition to CL and CH1 domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 3 CDRs of the heavy chain are herein referred to as “CDRH1, CDRH2, and CDRH3” and the 3 CDRs of the light chain are referred to as “CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3”. Assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with a well-known convention (Kabat, et al., \nAnn. NY Acad. Sci. \n190:382-93 (1971); Kabat, et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242 (1991)).

In vivo efficacy should be observed at a dosage of 30 mg/kg in a ZDF rat model, preferably at a dosage of less than 15 mg/kg, more preferably less than 5 mg/kg, further preferred with the range 0.1 to 5 mg/kg. Most preferably an antibody in accordance with the present invention achieves 100% glucose normalization in a ZDF rat model at a dosage of about 1 to 3 mg/kg. It has been found that particularly preferred antibodies in accordance with the present invention are able to show 100% glucose normalization in an in vivo ZDF rat model at the low dosage of 3 mg/kg.

It has been found that an antibody comprising Fab fragments in accordance with this embodiment has a particularly advantageous property of maintaining in vivo efficacy over an extended period as compared to other similar antibodies within the genus being described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment of the present invention, preferably comprises light and heavy variable chain framework regions of human origin. Moreover, a variety of different human framework sequences may be used singly or in combination as a basis for the humanized immunoglobulins of the present invention. Preferably, the framework regions of the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody of the invention are of human origin or substantially of human origin (at least 95%, 97% or 99% of human origin). The sequences of framework regions of human origin may be obtained from ImMunoGenetics (IMGT) via their website http://imgt.cines.fr/textes/IMGTindex/FR.html or from \nThe immunoglobulin Factsbook\n, by Marie-Paule Lefranc, Gerard Lefranc, Academic Press 2001, ISBN 012441351. For example, germline light chain frameworks may be selected from the group consisting of: A11, A17, A18, A19, A20, A27, A30, L1, L1I, L12, L2, L5, L15 L6, L8, O12, O2, and O8 and germline heavy chain framework regions may be selected from the group consisting of: VH2-5, VH2-26, VH2-70, VH3-20, VH3-72, VHI-46, VH3-9, VH3-66, VH3-74, VH4-31, VH I-18, VH I-69, VI-13-7, VH3-11, VH3-15, VH3-21, VH3-23, VH3-30, VH3-48, VH4-39, VH4-59, and VH5-5I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific antibodies disclosed herein can be used as a template or parent antibody to make additional antibodies of the invention. In one approach the parent antibody CDRs are grafted into a human framework that has a high sequence identity with the parent antibody framework. The sequence identity of the new framework will generally be at least 80%, at least 85%, or at least 90% with the corresponding framework in the parent antibody. This grafting may result in a reduction in binding affinity compared to the parent antibody. If this is the case, the framework can be back-mutated to the parent framework at certain positions based on specific criteria published by Queen et al., [Queen, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 2869 (1991)]. Further methods that may be used include, for example, Jones et al., Nature, 321:522 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534 (1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost preferably the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment according to the present invention comprises the following light chain framework (FR) sequences: FR1 SEQ ID NO: 23; FR2 SEQ ID NO: 24; FR3 SEQ ID NO: 25; FR4 SEQ ID NO: 26; and heavy variable chain frameworks sequences: FR5 SEQ ID NO: 27; FR6 SEQ ID NO: 28; FR7 SEQ ID NO: 29; FR8 SEQ ID NO: 30; wherein these are arranged as light chain variable sequence FR1-CDRL1-FR2-CDRL2-FR3-CDRL3-FR4 and heavy chain variable sequence FR5-CDRH1-FR6-CDRH2-FR7-CDRH3-FR8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe applicant has surprisingly determined that when predicting the in vivo efficacy of a glucagon receptor antagonism antibody through the use of an in vitro competitive glucagon binding assay, that it is the affinity of the Fab fragment that is positively correlated with in vivo efficacy. Conversely, the binding affinity (Ki) of a full antibody to the glucagon receptor is not necessarily a valid predictor of in vivo efficacy. A process of preparing monoclonal antibodies having the favourable properties sought herein, therefore preferably comprises selecting a Fab fragment that binds to each glucagon receptor with a Ki of less than 50 nM in an in vitro competitive glucagon binding assay using heterologously expressed glucagon receptor gene. More preferably said process comprises selecting a Fab fragment that has an in vitro Ki at each of the glucagon receptors of less than 30 nM, more preferably less than 20 nM, further preferred less than 10 nM. More preferably, the Fab fragment is selected by an in vitro Ki at the rat, murine and cyno receptors of less than 20 nM and in vitro Ki at the human receptor of less than 5 nM. More preferably the Ki of the selected Fab fragment, and in particular at the human glucagon receptor, is from 0.1 nM to 15 nM, most preferably from 1 to 10 nM. Fab fragments identified by this process may then be suitably expressed as full antibodies for therapeutic use by techniques commonly known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that applying the teaching of the present invention the person skilled in the art may use common techniques e.g. site directed mutagenesis, to substitute amino acids within the specific CDR and framework sequences herein disclosed and in so doing generate further variable region amino acid sequences derived from the sequences herein provided. Up to all 20 alternative naturally occurring amino acids may be introduced at a specific substitution site. The in vitro selection process defined here above may then be suitably used to screen these additional variable region amino acid sequences for Fab fragments having the claimed cross reactivity and in vitro Ki that has been found by the present applicants to be indicative of in vivo efficacy. In this way further Fab fragments are identified that are suitable for preparing a humanized antibody in accordance with the present invention. Preferably the amino acid substitution within the frameworks is restricted to one, two or three positions within one or each of the framework sequences disclosed herein. Preferably amino acid substitution within the CDRs is restricted to one to three positions within one or each CDR, more preferably substitution at one or two amino acid positions within one or each CDR is performed. Further preferred, amino acid substitution is performed at one or two amino acid positions in the CDRs of the heavy chain variable region. Most preferably amino acid substitution is performed at one or two amino acid positions within CDRH2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable methodology for combining CDR and framework substitutions to prepare alternative antibodies according to the present invention, using an antibody described herein as a parent antibody, is provided in Wu et al., J. Mol. Biol., 294:151-162.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin refers to the constant region of an antibody from both heavy chains, which associate through non-covalent interactions and disulfide bonds. The Fc portion can include the hinge regions and extend through the CH2 and CH3 domains to the C-terminus of the antibody. The Fc portion can further include one or more glycosylation sites. Monoclonal antibodies of the present invention may have a heavy chain constant region selected from any of the immunoglobulin classes IgA, IgD, IgG, IgM and IgE. Preferably antibodies of the invention contain an Fc portion which is derived from human IgG4 Fc region because of its reduced ability to bind FcγR and complement factors as compared to other IgG sub-types. More preferably, the IgG4 Fc region of an antibody of the present invention contains substitutions that further reduce effector function [Issacs et al., (1996) Clin. Exp. Immunol. 106:427-433]. These may be selected from one or more of the group comprising proline for glutamate at residue 233, alanine or valine for phenylalanine at residue 234 and alanine or glutamate for leucine at residue 235 (EU numbering, Kabat, E. A. et al. (1991) \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5\nth \nEd. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Md., NIH Publication no. 91-3242). These residues corresponds to positions 15, 16 and 17 in SEQ ID NO: 52 and positions 235, 236 and 237 of SEQ ID NO: 67. Further, removing the N-linked glycosylation site in the IgG4 Fc region by substituting Ala for Asn at residue 297 (EU numbering) which corresponds to position 79 of SEQ ID NO:52 is another way to ensure that residual effector activity is eliminated in the context of a humanized antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the IgG4 Fc portion for use with a humanized monoclonal antibody of present invention preferably contains a substitution that stabilizes heavy chain dimer formation and prevents the formation of half-IgG4 Fc chains. This construct consists of serine at position at 228 (EU numbering) being substituted by proline (amino acid residue 10 in SEQ ID NO:52). The C-terminal lysine residue present in the native molecule may also be deleted in the IgG4 derivative Fc portion of the antibodies discussed herein (position 229 of SEQ ID NO:52; deleted lysine referred to as des-K). A most preferred IgG4 Fc portion is provided by amino acids 221 to 448 of SEQ ID NO: 67.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is further directed to an isolated nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody of the invention; a vector (or vectors) comprising that nucleic acid, optionally operably linked to control sequences recognized by a host cell transformed with the vector; a host cell comprising that vector; a process for producing an antibody or Fab fragment thereof according to the invention comprising culturing the host cell so that the nucleic acid is expressed and, optionally, recovering the antibody from the host cell culture medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody of the invention. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In said pharmaceutical composition, the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody of the invention is the active ingredient. Preferably the pharmaceutical composition comprises a homogeneous or substantially homogeneous population of the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody of the invention. The composition for therapeutic use is sterile and may be lyophilized, optionally supplied with an appropriate diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further embodiment of the present invention comprises a host cell or cell culture that is a recipient of any isolated polynucleotide of the invention or any recombinant vector(s) comprising a sequence encoding a HCVR, LCVR, monoclonal antibody or Fab fragment of the invention. Host cells include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be completely identical (in morphology or in total DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation and/or change. A host cell includes cells transformed, transduced or infected in vivo or in vitro with one or more a recombinant vectors or a polynucleotide expressing a monoclonal antibody of the invention or a light chain or heavy chain thereof. A host cell which comprises a recombinant vector of the invention (either stably incorporated into the host chromosome or not) may also be referred to as a “recombinant host cell”. Preferred host cells for use in the invention are CHO cells, NS0 cells, HeLa, SP2/0 cells or COS cells. Additional host cells for use in the invention include plant cells, yeast cells, other mammalian cells and prokaryotic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention embodies an article of manufacture comprising a packaging material and a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody of the invention contained within said packaging material and wherein the packaging material comprises a package insert which indicates that the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody neutralizes a GluR or decreases the level of GluR activity in the patient.\n\n\n \nBiological Assays:\n\n\nGlucagon Receptor (GlucR) Membrane Preparations\n\n\n \n \n \nMembrane preparations for binding studies are prepared from 293HEK cells expressing cloned human, mouse, cynomologous monkey or rat glucagon receptor. Each clonal cell line is first grown as a suspension culture and the frozen cell pellet is resuspended in membrane prep buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, Complete® EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science), and 20 U/ml DNase I (Sigma Chemical Company) at 4° C. The cells are homogenized with a motor-driven Teflon-glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer using 25 strokes, followed by centrifugation at 1800×g for 15 minutes at 4° C. The supernatant is collected and the pellet resuspended in membrane prep buffer, rehomogenized and centrifuged. The second supernatant is combined with the first supernatant and recentrifuged at 1800×g for 15 mins to clarify. The clarified supernatant is transferred to high speed tubes and centrifuged at 25000×g for 30 minutes at 4° C. The membrane pellet (P2) is resuspended in the membrane prep buffer (without DNAase), aliquoted, quick frozen on dry ice and stored at −80° C. until needed.\n\n\n \n[\n125\nI]Glucagon Binding by Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA).\n\n\n \n \n \nA competitive receptor/ligand binding experiment is adapted to a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) format. Incubations are performed in clear bottom, opaque 96-well microplates. Compound is serially diluted 3-fold in binding buffer consisting of 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA, 0.003% tween-20 and Complete® EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets. P2 membranes (prepared above) are diluted in binding buffer from each receptor preparation, then added to the diluted compound followed by addition of 0.15 mgs of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) SPA beads (GE Healthcare) previously blocked with 1% fatty acid free BSA, and 0.15 nM [\n125\nI]-Glucagon (Perkin-Elmer). Plates are sealed with adhesive sealing tape, mixed end over end, and incubated at room temperature for 12 hours. The radioactivity bound to the receptor (in close proximity to the WGA SPA bead) is quantified on a PE Life and Analytical Sciences Trilux Microbeta plate scintillation counter and expressed as counts per minute (CPM). Total binding is determined in the absence of added compound and nonspecific binding is determined by adding 1 uM glucagon (Lilly Research Labs). The final concentration of 1 uM of unlabeled glucagon is capable of completely inhibiting [\n125\n]-glucagon binding to background levels.\n\n\n \n[\n125\nI]Glucagon Binding Data Analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \nRaw CPM data for concentration curves of compound are converted to percent inhibition by subtracting nonspecific binding from the individual CPM values and dividing by the total binding signal, also corrected for nonspecific binding. Data is analyzed using four-parameter (curve maximum, curve minimum, IC\n50\n, Hill slope) nonlinear regression routines (XLFit version 3.0: Activity Base, IDBS). The equilibrium dissociation constant determined by competitor inhibited radioligand binding, Ki, is calculated from the absolute IC\n50 \nvalue based upon the equation [Ki=IC\n50\n/(1+D/Kd)] where D equals the concentration of radioligand used in the experiment and Kd equals the equilibrium binding affinity constant of [\n125\nI]glucagon, in the assay for each individual receptor species.\n\n\n \n \nGlucagon-Stimulated cAMP Functional Antagonist Assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe functional antagonist activity is determined from the dose-dependent inhibition of increases in intracellular cAMP with a sub-maximal dose of glucagon using the same clonal rat, mouse, cynomologous, and human glucagon receptor-293HEK cell lines. Quantitation of the intracellular cAMP level is done with an Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay, (Alpha Screen) from Perkin Elmer (6760625R). Briefly, cAMP generated within the cell competes for binding of a biotinylated cAMP-streptavidin coated Donor bead and a coated anti-cAMP antibody Acceptor bead. As the cAMP level within the cell increases, a disruption of the Acceptor bead-biotinylated cAMP-Donor bead complex occurs. The functional assay is performed in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, with 0.25 mM IBMX in HBSS containing Mg+2 and Ca+2. The clonal glucagon receptor-293HEK cells are suspended at 2500 cells per well and 1 unit/well of biotinylated cAMP from the kit in a total volume of 20 uls. The cells are pre-incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with 20 uls of either 3-fold serially diluted compounds or of 3-fold serially diluted cAMP for use as a standard curve. The reaction is started by the addition of 20 uls of 300 pM glucagon (3×), a dose sufficient to produce 90% of the maximal intracellular cAMP. After 60 minutes at room temperature in the dark, the reaction is stopped by the addition of 30 uls of lysis buffer made of 1% IGEPAL CA630 (Sigma) and 0.1% fatty-acid free BSA (Gibco) in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4 containing 1 unit each of the kit Donor and Acceptor beads per well. The plates are wrapped in foil to protect the Donor and Acceptor beads from light and mixed on Titertek shaker medium speed for 30 secs. After incubation overnight at room temperature, the plates are read on a Packard Fusion™-α Instrument.\n\n\n \n \nData Analysis for Functional cAMP Activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alpha screen units are converted to pmoles cAMP generated per well based upon the cAMP standard curve. The pmoles cAMP produced in the presence of compound are converted to % of a maximal response with the submaximal dose of glucagon alone. Within each experiment, the concentration of glucagon needed to produce a 50% response in pmoles cAMP is determined. This EC50 concentration is used to normalize results between runs to a Kb where Kb=(EC50 compound)/[1+(pM glucagon used/EC50 in pM for glucagon dose response)]. The data is analyzed using four-parameter (curve maximum, curve minimum, IC\n50\n, Hill slope) nonlinear regression routines (XLFit version 3.0: Activity Base, IDBS).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibody examples Ab-1, Ab-2, Ab-3, Ab-4, Ab-5, Ab-6 and Ab-7 are made and purified as known in the art. An appropriate host cell, such as HEK 293 EBNA or CHO, is either transiently or stably transfected with an expression system for secreting antibodies using an optimal predetermined light chain to heavy chain vector ratio or a single vector system encoding both a light chain (set out in SEQ ID NOS: 70, 72, 74, 76) and a heavy chain (set out in SEQ ID NOS: 71, 73, 75, 77, 78, 79, 80). Clarified medium into which the antibody has been secreted is purified using any of many commonly-used techniques. For example, the medium may be conveniently applied to a Protein A or G Sepharose FF column that has been equilibrated with a compatible buffer, such as phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4). The column is washed to remove nonspecific binding components. The bound antibody is eluted, for example, by pH gradient (such as 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.8 to 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer pH 2.5). Antibody fractions are detected, such as by SDS-PAGE, and then are pooled. Further purification is optional, depending on the intended use. The antibody may be concentrated and/or sterile filtered using common techniques. Soluble aggregate and multimers may be effectively removed by common techniques, including size exclusion, hydrophobic interaction, ion exchange, or hydroxyapatite chromatography. The purity of the antibody after these chromatography steps is greater than 99%. The product may be immediately frozen at −70° C. or may be lyophilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFab expression is achieved in \nE. coli \nwherein the Fab molecules are secreted into the periplasmic space. The cell wall is disrupted by osmotic shock, and the Fab containing a His tag is purified on an IMAC column.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 1 sets out the CDR combinations used in the antibody examples according to the present invention. The full antibody light chain combines the light chain framework sequences interspaced by three light chain CDRs; Framework 1 (SEQ ID NO: 23)-CDRL1-Framework 2 (SEQ ID NO: 24)-CDRL2-Framework 3 (SEQ ID NO: 25)-CDRL3-Framework 4 (SEQ ID NO: 26) and the light chain constant region (SEQ ID NO: 53). The heavy chain framework sequences are interspaced by three heavy chain CDRs Framework 5 (SEQ ID NO: 27)-CDRH1-Framework 6 (SEQ ID NO: 28)-CDRH2-Framework 7 (SEQ ID NO: 29)-CDRH3-Framework 8 (SEQ ID NO: 30) and then the heavy chain CH1 constant region (SEQ ID NO: 51) followed by Fc domain for the Ab, absent in Fab fragment (SEQ ID NO: 52, wherein X\n10\n=P; X\n15\n=E; X\n16\n=A; X\n17\n=A; X\n79\n=N; X\n229\n=is absent).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDRL 1\n\n\nCDRL 2\n\n\nCDRL 3\n\n\nCDRH 1\n\n\nCDRH 2\n\n\nCDRH 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nSEQ ID\n\n\nSEQ ID\n\n\nSEQ ID\n\n\nSEQ ID\n\n\nSEQ ID\n\n\nSEQ ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAb-1\n\n\n2\n\n\n4\n\n\n7\n\n\n11\n\n\n15\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAb-2\n\n\n1\n\n\n4\n\n\n6\n\n\n10\n\n\n16\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAb-3\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n8\n\n\n11\n\n\n15\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAb-4\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n12\n\n\n15\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAb-5\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n12\n\n\n17\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAb-6\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n12\n\n\n15\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAb-7\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n13\n\n\n18\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody examples 1 through 7 and Fab fragments thereof all inhibit glucagon binding to human, mouse, cynomologous monkey and rat glucagon receptors in the above glucagon receptor binding assay with a Ki of less than 50 nM.\n\n\n \nIn Vitro Activity of Antibody of Example 4 (Ab4)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctional cAMP Antagonism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nrat GluR\n\n\nhuman GluR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nKb (nM)\n\n\nn\n\n\nKb (nM)\n\n\nStdev\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAb4\n\n\n6.85\n\n\n1\n\n\n6.49\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis assay demonstrates that at nanomolar concentrations an Ab4 binding to the GluR can block down stream activities of the rat or human glucagon receptor cell line, and reduce cAMP production by the cells.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro Ki (nM), for full antibody of Example 4 and respective Fab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhuman\n\n\nmouse\n\n\nrat\n\n\ncyno\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nGlucR\n\n\nGlucR\n\n\nGlucR\n\n\nGlucR\n\n\nGLP-1 R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon\n\n\n3.13\n\n\n2.72\n\n\n12.77\n\n\n5.78\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAb4\n\n\n1.34\n\n\n0.83\n\n\n1.24\n\n\n6.00\n\n\n>5000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFab4\n\n\n2.90\n\n\n2.43\n\n\n3.30\n\n\n9.42\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis assay demonstrates that in an in vitro glucagon competition binding assay Ab4 binds with high affinity (Ki) to glucagon receptor of human, mouse, rat, cynomologous monkey origin and low affinity to the human GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Activity of Antibody of Example 4 (Ab4)\n\n\n \n \n \nZDF rats approximately 8 weeks of age and approximately 400 g in weight are dosed with a single subcutaneous injection of antibody according to example 4 (i.e. Ab4) or a human IgG (hIgG4) control.

The complete disclosures of the aforementioned related patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.\n\n\nThe present invention is concerned with macrocylic compounds having inhibitory activity on the replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It further concerns compositions comprising these compounds as active ingredients as well as processes for preparing these compounds and compositions.\n\n\nHepatitis C virus is the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and has become a focus of considerable medical research. HCV is a member of the Flaviviridae family of viruses in the \nhepacivirus \ngenus, and is closely related to the \nflavivirus \ngenus, which includes a number of viruses implicated in human disease, such as dengue virus and yellow fever virus, and to the animal pestivirus family, which includes bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). HCV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, with a genome of around 9,600 bases. The genome comprises both 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions which adopt RNA secondary structures, and a central open reading frame that encodes a single polyprotein of around 3,010-3,030 amino acids. The polyprotein encodes ten gene products, which are generated from the precursor polyprotein by an orchestrated series of co- and posttranslational endoproteolytic cleavages mediated by both host and viral proteases. The viral structural proteins include the core nucleocapsid protein, and two envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. The non-structural (NS) proteins encode some essential viral enzymatic functions (helicase, polymerase, protease), as well as proteins of unknown function. Replication of the viral genome is mediated by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by non-structural protein 5b (NS5B). In addition to the polymerase, the viral helicase and protease functions, both encoded in the bifunctional NS3 protein, have been shown to be essential for replication of HCV RNA. In addition to the NS3 serine protease, HCV also encodes a metalloproteinase in the NS2 region.\n\n\nFollowing the initial acute infection, a majority of infected individuals develop chronic hepatitis because HCV replicates preferentially in hepatocytes but is not directly cytopathic. In particular, the lack of a vigorous T-lymphocyte response and the high propensity of the virus to mutate appear to promote a high rate of chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis can progress to liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma), making it the leading cause of liver transplantations.\n\n\nThere are 6 major HCV genotypes and more than 50 subtypes, which are differently distributed geographically. HCV type 1 is the predominant genotype in Europe and the US. The extensive genetic heterogeneity of HCV has important diagnostic and clinical implications, perhaps explaining difficulties in vaccine development and the lack of response to therapy.\n\n\nTransmission of HCV can occur through contact with contaminated blood or blood products, for example following blood transfusion or intravenous drug use. The introduction of diagnostic tests used in blood screening has led to a downward trend in post-transfusion HCV incidence. However, given the slow progression to the end-stage liver disease, the existing infections will continue to present a serious medical and economic burden for decades.\n\n\nCurrent HCV therapies are based on (pegylated) interferon-alpha (IFN-α) in combination with ribavirin. This combination therapy yields a sustained virologic response in more than 40% of patients infected by genotype 1 viruses and about 80% of those infected by genotypes 2 and 3. Beside the limited efficacy on HCV type 1, this combination therapy has significant side effects and is poorly tolerated in many patients. Major side effects include influenza-like symptoms, hematologic abnormalities, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Hence there is a need for more effective, convenient and better tolerated treatments.\n\n\nRecently, two peptidomimetic HCV protease inhibitors have gained attention as clinical candidates, namely BILN-2061 disclosed in WO00/59929 and VX-950 disclosed in WO03/87092. A number of similar HCV protease inhibitors have also been disclosed in the academic and patent literature. It has already become apparent that the sustained administration of BILN-2061 or VX-950 selects HCV mutants which are resistant to the respective drug, so called drug escape mutants. These drug escape mutants have characteristic mutations in the HCV protease genome, notably D168V, D168A and/or A156S. Accordingly, additional drugs with different resistance patterns are required to provide failing patients with treatment options, and combination therapy with multiple drugs is likely to be the norm in the future, even for first line treatment.\n\n\nExperience with HIV drugs, and HIV protease inhibitors in particular, has further emphasized that sub-optimal pharmacokinetics and complex dosage regimes quickly result in inadvertent compliance failures. This in turn means that the 24 hour trough concentration (minimum plasma concentration) for the respective drugs in an HIV regime frequently falls below the IC\n90 \nor ED\n90 \nthreshold for large parts of the day. It is considered that a 24 hour trough level of at least the IC\n50\n, and more realistically, the IC\n90 \nor ED\n90\n, is essential to slow down the development of drug escape mutants. Achieving the necessary pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism to allow such trough levels provides a stringent challenge to drug design. The strong peptidomimetic nature of prior art HCV protease inhibitors, with multiple peptide bonds poses pharmacokinetic hurdles to effective dosage regimes.\n\n\nThere is a need for HCV inhibitors which may overcome the disadvantages of current HCV therapy such as side effects, limited efficacy, the emerging of resistance, and compliance failures.\n\n\nWO04/094452 relates to macrocyclic isoquinoline peptide inhibitors of HCV. Compositions comprising the compounds and methods for using the compounds to inhibit HCV are also disclosed.\n\n\nWO05/010029 discloses aza-peptide macrocyclic hepatitis C serine protease inhibitors; pharmaceutical compositions comprising the aforementioned compounds for administration to a subject suffering from HCV infection; and methods of treating an HCV infection in a subject by administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nThe present invention concerns HCV inhibitors which are superior in one or more of the following pharmacological related properties, i.e. potency, decreased cytotoxicity, improved pharmacokinetics, improved resistance profile, acceptable dosage and pill burden.\n\n\nIn addition, the compounds of the present invention have relatively low molecular weight and are easy to synthetize, starting from starting materials that are commercially available or readily available through art-known synthesis procedures.\n\n\nThe present invention concerns inhibitors of HCV replication, which can be represented by formula (I):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nand the N-oxides, salts, and stereoisomers thereof, wherein\n\n\nX is N, CH and where X bears a double bond it is C;\n\n\nR\n1 \nis —OR\n5\n, —NH—SO\n2\nR\n6\n;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis hydrogen, and where X is C or CH, R\n2 \nmay also be C\n1-6\nalkyl;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis hydrogen, C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkoxyC\n1-6\nalkyl, or C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl;\n\n\nR\n4 \nis isoquinolinyl optionally substituted with one, two or three substituents each independently selected from C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkoxy, hydroxy, halo, polyhaloC\n1-6\nalkyl, polyhaloC\n1-6\nalkoxy, amino, mono- or diC\n1-6\nalkylamino, mono- or diC\n1-6\nalkylaminocarbonyl, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl-amino, aryl, and Het;\n\n\nn is 3, 4, 5, or 6;\n\n\nwherein each dashed line (represented by - - - - -) represents an optional double bond;\n\n\nR\n5 \nis hydrogen; aryl; Het; C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl optionally substituted with C\n1-6\nalkyl; or C\n1-6\nalkyl optionally substituted with C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl, aryl or with Het;\n\n\nR\n6 \nis aryl; Het; C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl optionally substituted with C\n1-6\nalkyl; or C\n1-6\nalkyl optionally substituted with C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl, aryl or with Het;\n\n\neach aryl as a group or part of a group is phenyl optionally substituted with one, two or three substituents selected from halo, hydroxy, nitro, cyano, carboxyl, C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkoxy, C\n1-6\nalkoxyC\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl, amino, mono- or diC\n1-6\nalkylamino, azido, mercapto, polyhaloC\n1-6\nalkyl, polyhaloC\n1-6\nalkoxy, C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, 4-C\n1-6\nalkylpiperazinyl, 4-C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl-piperazinyl, and morpholinyl; and wherein the morpholinyl and piperidinyl groups may optionally substituted with one or two C\n1-6\nalkyl radicals; and\n\n\neach Het as a group or part of a group is a 5 or 6 membered saturated, partially unsaturated or completely unsaturated heterocyclic ring containing 1 to 4 heteroatoms each independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, said heterocyclic ring being optionally substituted with one, two or three substituents each independently selected from the group consisting of halo, hydroxy, nitro, cyano, carboxyl, C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkoxy, C\n1-6\nalkoxyC\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl, amino, mono- or diC\n1-6\nalkylamino, azido, mercapto, polyhaloC\n1-6\nalkyl, polyhaloC\n1-6\nalkoxy, C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, 4-C\n1-6\nalkyl-piperazinyl, 4-C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl-piperazinyl, and morpholinyl and wherein the morpholinyl and piperidinyl groups may optionally substituted with one or two C\n1-6\nalkyl radicals.\n\n\n\n\nThe invention further relates to methods for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I), the N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines, metal complexes, and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, their intermediates, and the use of the intermediates in the preparation of the compounds of formula (I).\n\n\nThe invention relates to the compounds of formula (I) per se, the N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines, metal complexes, and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, for use as a medicament.

For instance pyridyl includes 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl and 4-pyridyl; pentyl includes 1-pentyl, 2-pentyl and 3-pentyl.\n\n\nWhen any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent, each definition is independent.\n\n\nWhenever used hereinafter, the term “compounds of formula (I)”, or “the present compounds” or similar terms, it is meant to include the compounds of formula (I), each and any of the subgroups thereof, their prodrugs, N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines, metal complexes, and stereochemically isomeric forms. One embodiment comprises the compounds of formula (I) or any subgroup of compounds of formula (I) specified herein, as well as the N-oxides, salts, as the possible stereoisomeric forms thereof. Another embodiment comprises the compounds of formula (I) or any subgroup of compounds of formula (I) specified herein, as well as the salts as the possible stereoisomeric forms thereof.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) have several centers of chirality and exist as stereochemically isomeric forms. The term “stereochemically isomeric forms” as used herein defines all the possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interchangeable, which the compounds of formula (I) may possess.\n\n\nWith reference to the instances where (R) or (S) is used to designate the absolute configuration of a chiral atom within a substituent, the designation is done taking into consideration the whole compound and not the substituent in isolation.\n\n\nUnless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, which said compound may possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention both in pure form or mixed with each other are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nPure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term “stereoisomerically pure” concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of at least 80% (i.e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other possible isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and none of the other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of 90% up to 100%, even more in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 94% up to 100% and most in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms “enantiomerically pure” and “diastereomerically pure” should be understood in a similar way, but then having regard to the enantiomeric excess, and the diastereomeric excess, respectively, of the mixture in question.\n\n\nPure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids or bases. Examples thereof are tartaric acid, dibenzoyl-tartaric acid, ditoluoyltartaric acid and camphosulfonic acid. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.\n\n\nThe diastereomeric racemates of the compounds of formula (I) can be obtained separately by conventional methods. Appropriate physical separation methods that may advantageously be employed are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column chromatography.\n\n\nFor some of the compounds of formula (I), their N-oxides, salts, solvates, quaternary amines, or metal complexes, and the intermediates used in the preparation thereof, the absolute stereochemical configuration was not experimentally determined. A person skilled in the art is able to determine the absolute configuration of such compounds using art-known methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction.\n\n\nThe present invention is also intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring on the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14.\n\n\nThe term “prodrug” as used throughout this text means the pharmacologically acceptable derivatives such as esters, amides and phosphates, such that the resulting in vivo biotransformation product of the derivative is the active drug as defined in the compounds of formula (I). The reference by Goodman and Gilman (The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 8\nth \ned, McGraw-Hill, Int. Ed. 1992, “Biotransformation of Drugs”, p 13-15) describing prodrugs generally is hereby incorporated. Prodrugs preferably have excellent aqueous solubility, increased bioavailability and are readily metabolized into the active inhibitors in vivo. Prodrugs of a compound of the present invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either by routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound.\n\n\nPreferred are pharmaceutically acceptable ester prodrugs that are hydrolysable in vivo and are derived from those compounds of formula (I) having a hydroxy or a carboxyl group. An in vivo hydrolysable ester is an ester, which is hydrolysed in the human or animal body to produce the parent acid or alcohol. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable esters for carboxy include C\n1-6\nalkoxymethyl esters for example methoxymethyl, C\n1-6\nalkanoyloxymethyl esters for example pivaloyloxymethyl, phthalidyl esters, C\n3-8\ncycloalkoxycarbonyloxyC\n1-6\nalkyl esters for example 1-cyclohexylcarbonyloxyethyl; 1,3-dioxolen-2-onylmethyl esters for example 5-methyl-1,3-dioxolen-2-onylmethyl; and C\n1-6\nalkoxycarbonyloxyethyl esters for example 1-methoxycarbonyloxyethyl which may be formed at any carboxy group in the compounds of this invention.\n\n\nAn in vivo hydrolysable ester of a compound of the formula (I) containing a hydroxy group includes inorganic esters such as phosphate esters and α-acyloxyalkyl ethers and related compounds which as a result of the in vivo hydrolysis of the ester breakdown to give the parent hydroxy group. Examples of α-acyloxyalkyl ethers include acetoxymethoxy and 2,2-dimethylpropionyloxy-methoxy. A selection of in vivo hydrolysable ester forming groups for hydroxy include alkanoyl, benzoyl, phenylacetyl and substituted benzoyl and phenylacetyl, alkoxycarbonyl (to give alkyl carbonate esters), dialkylcarbamoyl and N-(dialkylaminoethyl)-N-alkylcarbamoyl (to give carbamates), dialkylaminoacetyl and carboxyacetyl. Examples of substituents on benzoyl include morpholino and piperazino linked from a ring nitrogen atom via a methylene group to the 3- or 4-position of the benzoyl ring.\n\n\nFor therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the counter-ion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases which are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid and base addition salt forms which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acid. Appropriate acids comprise, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic (i.e. ethanedioic), malonic, succinic (i.e. butanedioic acid), maleic, fumaric, malic (i.e. hydroxybutanedioic acid), tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids.\n\n\nConversely said salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base into the free base form.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) containing an acidic proton may also be converted into their non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like.\n\n\nThe term addition salt as used hereinabove also comprises the solvates which the compounds of formula (I) as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are for example hydrates, alcoholates and the like.\n\n\nThe term “quaternary amine” as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted alkylhalide, arylhalide or arylalkylhalide, e.g. methyliodide or benzyliodide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alkyl p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate and acetate. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins.\n\n\nThe N-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that the compounds of formula (I) may have metal binding, chelating, complex forming properties and therefore may exist as metal complexes or metal chelates. Such metalated derivatives of the compounds of formula (I) are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nSome of the compounds of formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the compounds of formula (I) have several asymmetric centers. In order to more efficiently refer to each of these asymmetric centers, the numbering system as indicated in the following structural formula will be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsymmetric centers are present at positions 1, 4 and 6 of the macrocycle as well as at the carbon atom 3′ in the 5-membered ring, carbon atom 2′ when the R\n2 \nsubstituent is C\n1-6\nalkyl, and at carbon atom 1′ when X is CH. Each of these asymmetric centers can occur in their R or S configuration.\n\n\nThe stereochemistry at position 1 preferably corresponds to that of an L-amino acid configuration, i.e. that of L-proline.\n\n\nWhen X is CH, the 2 carbonyl groups substituted at positions 1′ and 5′ of the cyclopentane ring preferably are in a trans configuration. The carbonyl substituent at position 5′ preferably is in that configuration that corresponds to an L-proline configuration. The carbonyl groups substituted at positions 1′ and 5′ preferably are as depicted below in the structure of the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) include a cyclopropyl group as represented in the structural fragment below:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein C\n7 \nrepresents the carbon at position 7 and carbons at position 4 and 6 are asymmetric carbon atoms of the cyclopropane ring.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding other possible asymmetric centers at other segments of the compounds of formula (I), the presence of these two asymmetric centers means that the compounds can exist as mixtures of diastereomers, such as the diastereomers of compounds of formula (I) wherein the carbon at position 7 is configured either syn to the carbonyl or syn to the amide as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne embodiment concerns compounds of formula (I) wherein the carbon at position 7 is configured syn to the carbonyl. Another embodiment concerns compounds of formula (I) wherein the configuration at the carbon at position 4 is R. A specific subgroup of compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the carbon at position 7 is configured syn to the carbonyl and wherein the configuration at the carbon at position 4 is R.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may include a proline residue (when X is N) or a cyclopentyl or cyclopentenyl residue (when X is CH or C).

The linking of blocks P1 and P3 involves double bond formation. The linking of building blocks P1, P2 and P3 to prepare compounds (I-i) or (I-j) can be done in any given sequence. One of the steps involves a cyclization whereby the macrocycle is formed.\n\n\nRepresented herebelow are compounds (I-i) which are compounds of formula (I) wherein carbon atoms C7 and C8 are linked by a double bond, and compounds (I-j) which are compounds of formula (I) wherein carbon atoms C7 and C8 are linked by a single bond. The compounds of formula (I-j) can be prepared from the corresponding compounds of formula (I-I) by reducing the double bond in the macrocycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe synthesis procedures described hereinafter are meant to be applicable for as well the racemates, stereochemically pure intermediates or end products, or any stereoisomeric mixtures. The racemates or stereochemical mixtures may be separated into stereoisomeric forms at any stage of the synthesis procedures. In one embodiment, the intermediates and end products have the stereochemistry specified above in the compounds of formula (I-a) and (I-b).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, compounds (I-i) are prepared by first forming the amide bonds and subsequent forming the double bond linkage between P3 and P1 with concomitant cyclization to the macrocycle.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, compounds (I) wherein the bond between C\n7 \nand C\n8 \nis a double bond, which are compounds of formula (I-i), as defined above, may be prepared as outlined in the following reaction scheme:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormation of the macrocycle can be carried out via an olefin metathesis reaction in the presence of a suitable metal catalyst such as e.g. the Ru-based catalyst reported by Miller, S. J., Blackwell, H. E., Grubbs, R. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118, (1996), 9606-9614; Kingsbury, J. S., Harrity, J. P. A., Bonitatebus, P. J., Hoveyda, A. H., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, (1999), 791-799; and Huang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, (1999), 2674-2678; for example a Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst.\n\n\nAir-stable ruthenium catalysts such as bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)-3-phenyl-1H-inden-1-ylidene ruthenium chloride (Neolyst M1®) or bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)-[(phenylthio)methylene]ruthenium (IV) dichloride can be used. Other catalysts that can be used are Grubbs first and second generation catalysts, i.e. Benzylidenebis(tricyclohexylphosphine)dichlororuthenium and (1,3-bis-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2-imidazolidinylidene)dichloro(phenylmethylene)-(tricyclohexylphosphine)ruthenium, respectively. Of particular interest are the Hoveyda-Grubbs first and second generation catalysts, which are dichloro(o-isopropoxyphenylmethylene)(tricyclohexylphosphine)ruthenium(II) and 1,3-bis-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2-imidazolidinylidene)dichloro(oisopropoxyphenylmethylene)ruthenium respectively. Also other catalysts containing other transition metals such as Mo can be used for this reaction.\n\n\nThe metathesis reactions may be conducted in a suitable solvent such as for example ethers, e.g. THF, dioxane; halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichoromethane, CHCl\n3\n, 1,2-dichloroethane and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene. In a preferred embodiment, the metathesis reaction is conducted in toluene. These reactions are conducted at increased temperatures under nitrogen atmosphere.\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) wherein the link between C7 and C8 in the macrocycle is a single bond, i.e. compounds of formula (I-j), can be prepared from the compounds of formula (I-i) by a reduction of the C7-C8 double bond in the compounds of formula (I-i). This reduction may be conducted by catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as, for example, Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru or Raney nickel. Of interest is Rh on alumina. The hydrogenation reaction preferably is conducted in a solvent such as, e.g. an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or an ether such as THF, or mixtures thereof. Water can also be added to these solvents or solvent mixtures.\n\n\nThe R\n1 \ngroup can be connected to the P1 building block at any stage of the synthesis, i.e. before or after the cyclization, or before or after the cyclization and reduction as described herein above. The compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n1 \nrepresents —NHSO\n2\nR\n6\n, said compounds being represented by formula (I-k-1), can be prepared by linking the R\n1 \ngroup to P1 by forming an amide bond between both moieties. Similarly, the compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n1 \nrepresents —OR\n5\n, i.e. compounds (I-k-2), can be prepared by linking the R\n1 \ngroup to P1 by forming an ester bond. In one embodiment, the —OR\n5 \ngroups are introduced in the last step of the synthesis of the compounds (I) as outlined in the following reaction schemes wherein G represents a group:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntermediate (2a) can be coupled with the amine (2b) by an amide forming reaction such as any of the procedures for the formation of an amide bond described hereinafter. In particular, (2a) may be treated with a coupling agent, for example N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), EEDQ, IIDQ, EDCI or benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (commercially available as PyBOP®), in a solvent such as an ether, e.g. THF, or a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, chlorophorm, dichloroethane, and reacted with the desired sulfonamide (2b), preferably after reacting (2a) with the coupling agent. The reactions of (2a) with (2b) preferably are conducted in the presence of a base, for example a trialkylamine such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, or 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). Intermediate (2a) can also be converted into an activated form, e.g. an activated form of general formula G-CO—Z, wherein Z represents halo, or the rest of an active ester, e.g. Z is an aryloxy group such as phenoxy, p.nitrophenoxy, pentafluorophenoxy, trichlorophenoxy, pentachlorophenoxy and the like; or Z can be the rest of a mixed anhydride. In one embodiment, G-CO—Z is an acid chloride (G-CO—Cl) or a mixed acid anhydride (G-CO—O—CO—R or G-CO—O—CO—OR, R in the latter being e.g. C\n1-4\nalkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, i.propyl, butyl, t.butyl, i.butyl, or benzyl). The activated form G-CO—Z is reacted with the sulfonamide (2b).\n\n\nThe activation of the carboxylic acid in (2a) as described in the above reactions may lead to an internal cyclization reaction to an azalactone intermediate of formula\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein X, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, n are as specified above and wherein the stereogenic centers may have the stereochemical configuration as specified above, for example as in (I-a) or (I-b). The intermediates (2a-1) can be isolated from the reaction mixture, using conventional methodology, and the isolated intermediate (2a-1) is then reacted with (2b), or the reaction mixture containing (2a-1) can be reacted further with (2b) without isolation of (2a-1). In one embodiment, where the reaction with the coupling agent is conducted in a water-immiscible solvent, the reaction mixture containing (2a-1) may be washed with water or with slightly basic water in order to remove all water-soluble side products. The thus obtained washed solution may then be reacted with (2b) without additional purification steps. The isolation of intermediates (2a-1) on the other hand may provide certain advantages in that the isolated product, after optional further purification, may be reacted with (2b), giving rise to less side products and an easier work-up of the reaction.\n\n\n\nIntermediate (2a) can be coupled with the alcohol (2c) by an ester forming reaction. For example, (2a) and (2c) are reacted together with removal of water either physically, e.g. by azeotropical water removal, or chemically by using a dehydrating agent. Intermediate (2a) can also be converted into an activated form G-CO—Z, such as the activated forms mentioned above, and subsequently reacted with the alcohol (2c). The ester forming reactions preferably are conducted in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal carbonate or hydrogen carbonate, e.g. sodium or potassium hydrogen carbonate, or a tertairy amine such as the amines mentioned herein in relation to the amide forming reactions, in particular a trialkylamine, e.g. triethylamine. Solvents that can be used in the ester forming recations comprise ethers such as THF; halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichoromethane, CH\n2\nCl\n2\n; hydrocarbons such as toluene; polar aprotic solvents such as DMF, DMSO, DMA; and the like solvents.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n3 \nis hydrogen, said compounds being represented by (I-1), can also be prepared by removal of a protecting group PG, from a corresponding nitrogen-protected intermediate (3a), as in the following reaction scheme. The protecting group PG in particular is any of the nitrogen protecting groups mentioned hereinafter and can be removed using procedures also mentioned hereinafter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe starting materials (3a) in the above reaction can be prepared following the procedures for the preparation of compounds of formula (I), but using intermediates wherein the group R\n3 \nis PG.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) can also be prepared by reacting an intermediate (4a) with intermediate (4b) as outlined in the following reaction scheme wherein the various radicals have the meanings specified above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY in (4b) represents hydroxy or a leaving group LG such as a halide, e.g. bromide or chloride, or an arylsulfonyl group, e.g. mesylate, triflate or tosylate and the like.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the reaction of (4a) with (4b) is an O-arylation reaction and Y represents a leaving group. This reaction can be conducted following the procedures described by E. M. Smith et al. (J. Med. Chem. (1988), 31, 875-885). In particular, this reaction is conducted in the presence of a base, preferably a strong base, in a reactioninert solvent, e.g. one of the solvents mentioned for the formation of an amide bond.\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment, starting material (4a) is reacted with (4b) in the presence of a base which is strong enough to detract a hydrogen from the hydroxy group, for example an alkali of alkaline metal hydride such as LiH or sodium hydride, or alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium or potassium methoxide or ethoxide, potassium tertbutoxide, in a reaction inert solvent like a dipolar aprotic solvent, e.g. DMA, DMF and the like. The resulting alcoholate is reacted with the arylating agent (4b), wherein Y is a suitable leaving group as mentioned above. The conversion of (4a) to (I) using this type of O-arylation reaction does not change the stereochemical configuration at the carbon bearing the hydroxy group.\n\n\nAlternatively, the reaction of (4a) with (4b) can also be conducted via a Mitsunobu reaction (Mitsunobu, 1981, Synthesis, January, 1-28; Rano et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 22, 3779-3792; Krchnak et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 5, 6193-6196; Richter et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1994, 35, 27, 4705-4706). This reaction comprises treatment of intermediate (4a) with (4b) wherein Y is hydroxyl, in the presence of triphenylphosphine and an activating agent such as a dialkyl azocarboxylate, e.g. diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD), diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) or the like. The Mitsunobu reaction changes the stereochemical configuration at the carbon bearing the hydroxy group.\n\n\nAlternatively, in order to prepare the compounds of formula (I), first an amide bond between building blocks P2 and P1 is formed, followed by coupling of the P3 building block to the P1 moiety in P1-P2, and a subsequent carbamate or ester bond formation between P3 and the P2 moiety in P2-P1-P3 with concomitant ring closure.\n\n\nYet another alternative synthetic methodology is the formation of an amide bond between building blocks P2 and P3, followed by the coupling of building block P1 to the P3 moiety in P3-P2, and a last amide bond formation between P1 and P2 in P1-P3-P2 with concomitant ring closure.\n\n\nBuilding blocks P1 and P3 can be linked to a P1-P3 sequence. If desired, the double bond linking P1 and P3 may be reduced. The thus formed P1-P3 sequence, either reduced or not, can be coupled to building block P2 and the thus forming sequence P1-P3-P2 subsequently cyclized, by forming an amide bond.\n\n\nBuilding blocks P1 and P3 in any of the previous approaches can be linked via double bond formation, e.g. by the olefin metathesis reaction described hereinafter, or a Wittig type reaction. If desired, the thus formed double bond can be reduced, similarly as described above for the conversion of (I-i) to (I-j). The double bond can also be reduced at a later stage, i.e. after addition of a third building block, or after formation of the macrocycle. Building blocks P2 and P1 are linked by amide bond formation and P3 and P2 are linked by carbamate or ester formation.\n\n\nThe tail P1′ can be bonded to the P1 building block at any stage of the synthesis of the compounds of formula (I), for example before or after coupling the building blocks P2 and P1; before or after coupling the P3 building block to P1; or before or after ring closure.\n\n\nThe individual building blocks can first be prepared and subsequently coupled together or alternatively, precursors of the building blocks can be coupled together and modified at a later stage to the desired molecular composition.\n\n\nThe functionalities in each of the building blocks may be protected to avoid side reactions.\n\n\nThe formation of amide bonds can be carried out using standard procedures such as those used for coupling amino acids in peptide synthesis. The latter involves the dehydrative coupling of a carboxyl group of one reactant with an amino group of the other reactant to form a linking amide bond. The amide bond formation may be performed by reacting the starting materials in the presence of a coupling agent or by converting the carboxyl functionality into an active form such as an active ester, mixed anhydride or a carboxyl acid chloride or bromide. General descriptions of such coupling reactions and the reagents used therein can be found in general textbooks on peptide chemistry, for example, M. Bodanszky, “Peptide Chemistry”, 2nd rev. ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, (1993).\n\n\nExamples of coupling reactions with amide bond formation include the azide method, mixed carbonic-carboxylic acid anhydride (isobutyl chloroformate) method, the carbodiimide (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or water-soluble carbodiimide such as N-ethyl-N′-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide) method, the active ester method (e.g. p-nitrophenyl, p-chlorophenyl, trichlorophenyl, pentachlorophenyl, pentafluorophenyl, N-hydroxysuccinic imido and the like esters), the Woodward reagent K-method, the 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI or N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole) method, the phosphorus reagents or oxidation-reduction methods. Some of these methods can be enhanced by adding suitable catalysts, e.g. in the carbodiimide method by adding 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene), or 4-DMAP. Further coupling agents are (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris-(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, either by itself or in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or 4-DMAP; or 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetra-methyluronium tetrafluoroborate, or O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate. These coupling reactions can be performed in either solution (liquid phase) or solid phase.\n\n\nA preferred amide bond formation is performed employing N-ethyloxycarbonyl-2-ethyloxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) or N-isobutyloxy-carbonyl-2-isobutyloxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (IIDQ). Unlike the classical anhydride procedure, EEDQ and IIDQ do not require base nor low reaction temperatures. Typically, the procedure involves reacting equimolar amounts of the carboxyl and amine components in an organic solvent (a wide variety of solvents can be used). Then EEDQ or IIDQ is added in excess and the mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature.\n\n\nThe coupling reactions preferably are conducted in an inert solvent, such as halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, chloroform, dipolar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, DMSO, HMPT, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF).\n\n\nIn many instances the coupling reactions are done in the presence of a suitable base such as a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), N-methylmorpholine, N-methylpyrrolidine, 4-DMAP or 1,8-diazabicycle[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The reaction temperature may range between 0° C. and 50° C. and the reaction time may range between 15 min and 24 h.\n\n\nThe functional groups in the building blocks that are linked together may be protected to avoid formation of undesired bonds. Appropriate protecting groups that can be used are listed for example in Greene, “Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry”, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1999) and “The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology”, Vol. 3, Academic Press, New York (1987).\n\n\nCarboxyl groups can be protected as an ester that can be cleaved off to give the carboxylic acid. Protecting groups that can be used include 1) alkyl esters such as methyl, trimethylsilyl and tert-butyl; 2) arylalkyl esters such as benzyl and substituted benzyl; or 3) esters that can be cleaved by a mild base or mild reductive means such as trichloroethyl and phenacyl esters.\n\n\nAmino groups can be protected by a variety of N-protecting groups, such as:\n\n \n \n \n \n1) acyl groups such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and p-toluenesulfonyl;\n \n2) aromatic carbamate groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyls, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc);\n \n3) aliphatic carbamate groups such as tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxy-carbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl;\n \n4) cyclic alkyl carbamate groups such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl;\n \n5) alkyl groups such as triphenylmethyl, benzyl or substituted benzyl such as 4-methoxybenzyl;\n \n6) trialkylsilyl such as trimethylsilyl or t.Bu dimethylsilyl; and\n \n7) thiol containing groups such as phenylthiocarbonyl and dithiasuccinoyl. Interesting amino protecting groups are Boc and Fmoc.\n \n \n \n\n\nPreferably the amino protecting group is cleaved off prior to the next coupling step. Removal of N-protecting groups can be done following art-known procedures. When the Boc group is used, the methods of choice are trifluoroacetic acid, neat or in dichloromethane, or HCl in dioxane or in ethyl acetate. The resulting ammonium salt is then neutralized either prior to the coupling or in situ with basic solutions such as aqueous buffers, or tertiary amines in dichloromethane or acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. When the Fmoc group is used, the reagents of choice are piperidine or substituted piperidine in dimethylformamide, but any secondary amine can be used. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between 0° C. and room temperature, usually around 15-25° C., or 20-22° C.\n\n\nOther functional groups that can interfere in the coupling reactions of the building blocks may also be protected. For example hydroxyl groups may be protected as benzyl or substituted benzyl ethers, e.g. 4-methoxybenzyl ether, benzoyl or substituted benzoyl esters, e.g. 4-nitrobenzoyl ester, or with trialkylsilyl groups (e.g. trimethylsilyl or tert-butyldimethylsilyl).\n\n\nFurther amino groups may be protected by protecting groups that can be cleaved off selectively. For example, when Boc is used as the α-amino protecting group, the following side chain protecting groups are suitable: p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) moieties can be used to protect further amino groups; benzyl (Bn) ethers can be used to protect hydroxy groups; and benzyl esters can be used to protect further carboxyl groups. Or when Fmoc is chosen for the α-amino protection, usually tert-butyl based protecting groups are acceptable. For instance, Boc can be used for further amino groups; tert-butyl ethers for hydroxyl groups; and tert-butyl esters for further carboxyl groups.\n\n\nAny of the protecting groups may be removed at any stage of the synthesis procedure but preferably, the protecting groups of any of the functionalities not involved in the reaction steps are removed after completion of the build-up of the macrocycle. Removal of the protecting groups can be done in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups, which manners are well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe intermediates of formula (1a) wherein X is N, said intermediates being represented by formula (1a-1), may be prepared starting from intermediates (5a) which are reacted with an alkenamine (5b) in the presence of a carbonyl introducing agent as outlined in the following reaction scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbonyl (CO) introducing agents include phosgene, or phosgene derivatives such as carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), and the like. In one embodiment (5a) is reacted with the CO introducing agent in the presence of a suitable base and a solvent, which can be the bases and solvents used in the amide forming reactions as described above. In a particular embodiment, the base is a hydrogencarbonate, e.g. NaHCO\n3\n, or a tertiary amine such as triethylamine and the like, and the solvent is an ether or halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. THF, CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, CHCl\n3\n, and the like. Thereafter, the amine (5b) is added thereby obtaining intermediates (1a-1) as in the above scheme. An alternative route using similar reaction conditions involves first reacting the CO introducing agent with the alkenamine (5b) and then reacting the thus formed intermediate with (5a).\n\n\nThe intermediates (1a-1) can alternatively be prepared as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPG\n1 \nis an O-protecting group, which can be any of the groups mentioned herein and in particular is a benzoyl or substituted benzoyl group such as 4-nitrobenzoyl. In the latter instance this group can be removed by reaction with a an alkali metal hydroxide (LiOH, NaOH, KOH), in particular where PG\n1 \nis 4-nitrobenzoyl, with LiOH, in an aqueous medium comprising water and a water-soluble organic solvent such as an alkanol (methanol, ethanol) and THF.\n\n\nIntermediates (6a) are reacted with (5b) in the presence of a carbonyl introducing agent, similar as described above, and this reaction yields intermediates (6c). These are deprotected, in particular using the reaction conditions mentioned above. The resulting alcohol (6d) is reacted with intermediates (4b) as described above for the reaction of (4a) with (4b) and this reaction results in intermediates (1a-1).\n\n\nThe intermediates of formula (1a) wherein X is C, said intermediates being represented by formula (1a-2), may be prepared by an amide forming reaction starting from intermediates (7a) which are reacted with an amine (5b) as shown in the following reaction scheme, using reaction conditions for preparing amides such as those described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intermediates (1a-1) can alternatively be prepared as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPG\n1 \nis an O-protecting group as described above. The same reaction conditions as described above may be used: amide formation as described above, removal of PG\n1 \nas in the description of the protecting groups and introduction of R\n4 \nas in the reactions of (4a) with the reagents (4b).\n\n\nThe intermediates of formula (2a) may be prepared by first cyclizing the open amide (9a) to a macrocyclic ester (9b), which in turn is converted to (2a) as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPG\n2 \nis a carboxyl protecting group, e.g. one of the carboxyl protecting groups mentioned above, in particular a C\n1-4\nalkyl or benzyl ester, e.g. a methyl, ethyl or t.butyl ester. The reaction of (9a) to (9b) is a metathesis reaction and is conducted as described above. The group PG is removed following procedures also described above. Where PG\n1 \nis a C\n1-4\nalkyl ester, it is removed by alkaline hydrolysis, e.g. with NaOH or preferably LiOH, in an aqueous solvent, e.g. a C\n1-4\nalkanol/water mixture. A benzyl group can be removed by catalytic hydrogenation.\n\n\nIn an alternative synthesis, intermediates (2a) can be prepared as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PG\n1 \ngroup is selected such that it is selectively cleavable towards PG\n2\n. PG\n2 \nmay be e.g. methyl or ethyl esters, which can be removed by treatment with an alkali metal hydroxide in an aqueous medium, in which case PG\n1 \ne.g. is t.butyl or benzyl. PG\n2 \nmay be t.butyl esters removable under weakly acidic conditions or PG\n1 \nmay be benzyl esters removable with strong acid or by catalytic hydrogenation, in the latter two cases PG\n1 \ne.g. is a benzoic ester such as a 4-nitrobenzoic ester.\n\n\nFirst, intermediates (10a) are cyclized to the macrocyclic esters (10b), the latter are deprotected by removal of the PG\n1 \ngroup to (10c), which are reacted with intermediates (4b), followed by removal of carboxyl protecting group PG\n2\n. The cyclization, deprotection of PG\n1 \nand PG\n2 \nand the coupling with (4b) are as described above.\n\n\nThe R\n1 \ngroups can be introduced at any stage of the synthesis, either as the last step as described above, or earlier, before the macrocycle formation. In the following scheme, the groups R\n1 \nbeing —NH—SO\n2\nR\n6 \nor —OR\n5 \n(which are as specified above) are introduced:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above scheme, PG\n2 \nis as defined above and L\n1 \nis a P3 group\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein n and R\n3 \nare as defined above and where X is N, L\n1 \nmay also be a nitrogen-protecting group (PG, as defined above) and where X is C, L\n1 \nmay also be a group —COOPG\n2a\n, wherein the group PG is a carboxyl protecting group similar as PG\n2\n, but wherein PG\n2\na is selectively cleavable towards PG\n2\n. In one embodiment PG\n2a \nis t.butyl and PG\n2 \nis methyl or ethyl.\n\n\n\nThe intermediates (11c) and (11d) wherein L\n1 \nrepresents a group (b) correspond to the intermediates (1a) and may be processed further as specified above.\n\n\nCoupling of P1 and P2 Building Blocks\n\n\nThe P1 and P2 building blocks are linked using an amide forming reaction following the procedures described above. The P1 building block may have a carboxyl protecting group PG\n2 \n(as in (12b)) or may already be linked to P1′ group (as in (12c)). L\n2 \nis a N-protecting group (PG), or a group (b), as specified above. L\n3 \nis hydroxy, —OPG\n1 \nor a group —O—R\n4 \nas specified above. Where in any of the following reaction schemes L\n3 \nis hydroxy, prior to each reaction step, it may be protected as a group —OPG\n1 \nand, if desired, subsequently deprotected back to a free hydroxy function. Similarly as described above, the hydroxy function may be converted to a group —O—R\n4\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the procedure of the above scheme, a cyclopropyl amino acid (12b) or (12c) is coupled to the acid function of the P2 building block (12a) with the formation of an amide linkage, following the procedures described above. Intermediates (12d) or (12e) are obtained. Where in the latter L\n2 \nis a group (b), the resulting products are P3-P2-P1 sequences encompassing some of the intermediates (11c) or (11d) in the previous reaction scheme. Removal of the acid protecting group in (12d), using the appropriate conditions for the protecting group used, followed by coupling with an amine H\n2\nN—SO\n2\nR\n6 \n(2b) or with HOR\n5 \n(2c) as described above, again yields the intermediates (12e), wherein —COR\n1 \nare amide or ester groups. Where L\n2 \nis a N-protecting group, it can be removed yielding intermediates (5a) or (6a). In one embodiment, PG in this reaction is a BOC group and PG\n2 \nis methyl or ethyl. Where additionally L\n3 \nis hydroxy, the starting material (12a) is Boc-L-hydroxyproline. In a particular embodiment, PG is BOC, PG\n2 \nis methyl or ethyl and L\n3 \nis —O—R\n4\n.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, L\n2 \nis a group (b) and these reactions involve coupling P1 to P2-P3, which results in the intermediates (1a-1) or (1a) mentioned above. In another embodiment, L\n2 \nis a N-protecting group PG, which is as specified above, and the coupling reaction results in intermediates (12d-1) or (12e-1), from which the group PG can be removed, using reaction conditions mentioned above, obtaining intermediates (12-f) or respectively (12g), which encompass intermediates (5a) and (6a) as specified above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the group L\n3 \nin the above schemes represents a group —O-PG\n1 \nwhich can be introduced on a starting material (12a) wherein L\n3 \nis hydroxy. In this instance PG\n1 \nis chosen such that it is selectively cleavable towards group L\n2 \nbeing PG.\n\n\nIn a similar way, P2 building blocks wherein X is C, which are cyclopentane or cyclopentene derivatives, can be linked to P1 building blocks as outlined in the following scheme wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, L\n3 \nare as specified above and PG\n2 \nand PG\n2\na are carboxyl protecting groups. PG\n2a \ntypically is chosen such that it is selectively cleavable towards group PG\n2\n. Removal of the PG\n2a \ngroup in (13c) yields intermediates (7a) or (8a), which can be reacted with (5b) as described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment, where X is C, R\n2 \nis H, and where X and the carbon bearing R\n2 \nare linked by a single bond (P2 being a cyclopentane moiety), PG\n2\na and L\n3 \ntaken together form a bond and the P2 building block is represented by formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBicyclic acid (14a) is reacted with (12b) or (12c) similar as described above to (14b) and (14c) respectively, wherein the lactone is opened giving intermediates (14c) and (14e). The lactones can be opened using ester hydrolysis procedures, for example using the reaction conditions described above for the alkaline removal of a PG\n1 \ngroup in (9b), in particular using basic conditions such as an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. NaOH, KOH, in particular LiOH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntermediates (14c) and (14e) can be processed further as described hereinafter.\n\n\nCoupling of P3 and P2 Building Blocks\n\n\nFor P2 building blocks that have a pyrrolidine moiety, the P3 and P2 or P3 and P2-PI building blocks are linked using a carbamate forming reaction following the procedures described above for the coupling of (5a) with (5b). A general procedure for coupling P2 blocks having a pyrrolidine moiety is represented in the following reaction scheme wherein L\n3 \nis as specified above and L\n4 \nis a group —O-PG\n2\n, a group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one embodiment L\n4 \nin (15a) is a group —OPG\n2\n, the PG\n2 \ngroup may be removed and the resulting acid coupled with cyclopropyl amino acids (12a) or (12b), yielding intermediates (12d) or (12e) wherein L\n2 \nis a radical (d) or (e).\n\n\nA general procedure for coupling P3 blocks with a P2 block or a with a P2-P1 block wherein the P2 is a cyclopentane or cyclopentene is shown in the following scheme. L\n3 \nand L\n4 \nare as specified above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment L\n3 \nand L\n4 \ntaken together may form a lactone bridge as in (14a), and the coupling of a P3 block with a P2 block is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBicyclic lactone (14a) is reacted with (5b) in an amide forming reaction to amide (16c) in which the lactone bridge is opened to (16d). The reaction conditions for the amide forming and lactone opening reactions are as described above or hereinafter. Intermediate (16d) in turn can be coupled to a P1 group as described above.\n\n\nThe reactions in the above schemes are conducted using the same procedures as described above for the reactions of (5a), (7a) or (8a) with (5b) and in particular the above reactions wherein L\n4 \nis a group (d) or (e) correspond to the reactions of (5a), (7a) or (8a) with (5b), as described above.\n\n\nThe building blocks P1, P1′, P2 and P3 used in the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) can be prepared starting from art-known intermediates. A number of such syntheses are described hereafter in more detail.\n\n\nThe individual building blocks can first be prepared and subsequently coupled together or alternatively, precursors of the building blocks can be coupled together and modified at a later stage to the desired molecular composition.\n\n\nThe functionalities in each of the building blocks may be protected to avoid side reactions.\n\n\nSynthesis of P2 Building Blocks\n\n\nThe P2 building blocks contain either a pyrrolidine, a cyclopentane, or a cyclopentene moiety substituted with a group —O—R\n4\n.\n\n\nP2 building blocks containing a pyrrolidine moiety can be derived from commercially available hydroxy proline.\n\n\nThe preparation of P2 building blocks that contain a cylopentane ring may be performed as shown in the scheme below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bicyclic acid (17b) can be prepared, for example, from 3,4-bis(methoxycarbonyl)cyclopentanone (17a), as described by Rosenquist et al. in Acta Chem. Scand. 46 (1992) 1127-1129. A first step in this procedure involves the reduction of the keto group with a reducing agent like sodium borohydride in a solvent such as methanol, followed by hydrolysis of the esters and finally ring closure to the bicyclic lactone (17b) using lactone forming procedures, in particular by using acetic anhydride in the presence of a weak base such as pyridine. The carboxylic acid functionality in (17b) can then be protected by introducing an appropriate carboxyl protecting group, such as a group PG\n2\n, which is as specified above, thus providing bicyclic ester (17c). The group PG\n2 \nin particular is acid-labile such as a t.butyl group and is introduced e.g. by treatment with isobutene in the presence of a Lewis acid or with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of a base such as a tertiary amine like dimethylaminopyridine or triethylamine in a solvent like dichloromethane. Lactone opening of (17c) using reaction conditions described above, in particular with lithium hydroxide, yields the acid (17d), which can be used further in coupling reactions with P1 building blocks. The free acid in (17d) may also be protected, preferably with an acid protecting group PG\n2\na that is selectively cleavable towards PG\n2\n, and the hydroxy function may be converted to a group —OPG\n1 \nor to a group —O—R\n4\n. The products obtained upon removal of the group PG\n2 \nare intermediates (17g) and (17i) which correspond to intermediates (13a) or (16a) specified above.\n\n\nIntermediates with specific stereochemistry may be prepared by resolving the intermediates in the above reaction sequence. For example, (17b) may be resolved following art-known procedures, e.g. by salt form action with an optically active base or by chiral chromatography, and the resulting stereoisomers may be processed further as described above. The OH and COOH groups in (17d) are in cis position. Trans analogs can be prepared by inverting the stereochemistry at the carbon bearing the OH function by using specific reagents in the reactions introducing OPG\n1 \nor O—R\n4 \nthat invert the stereochemistry, such as, e.g. by applying a Mitsunobu reaction.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the intermediates (17d) are coupled to PI blocks (12b) or (12c), which coupling reactions correspond to the coupling of (13a) or (16a) with the same PI blocks, using the same conditions. Subsequent introduction of a —O—R\n4\n-substituent as described above followed by removal of the acid protection group PG\n2 \nyields intermediates (8a-1), which are a subclass of the intermediates (7a), or part of the intermediates (16a). The reaction products of the PG\n2 \nremoval can be further coupled to a P3 building block. In one embodiment PG\n2 \nin (17d) is t.butyl which can be removed under acidic conditions, e.g. with trifluoroacetic acid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn unsaturated P2 building block, i.e. a cyclopentene ring, may be prepared as illustrated in the scheme below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA bromination-elimination reaction of 3,4-bis(methoxycarbonyl)cyclopentanone (17a) as described by Dolby et al. in J. Org. Chem. 36 (1971) 1277-1285 followed by reduction of the keto functionality with a reducting agent like sodium borohydride provides the cyclopentenol (19a). Selective ester hydrolysis using for example lithium hydroxide in a solvent like a mixture of dioxane and water, provides the hydroxy substituted monoester cyclopentenol (19b).\n\n\nAn unsaturated P2 building block wherein R\n2 \ncan also be other than hydrogen, may be prepared as shown in the scheme below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxidation of commercially available 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol (20a), in particular by an oxidizing agent like pyridinium chlorochromate, yields (20b), which is converted to the corresponding methyl ester, e.g. by treatment with acetyl chloride in methanol, followed by a bromination reaction with bromine yielding the α-bromo ester (20c). The latter can then be condensed with the alkenyl ester (20e), obtained from (20d) by an ester forming reaction. The ester in (20e) preferably is a t.butyl ester which can be prepared from the corresponding commercially available acid (20d), e.g. by treatment with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of a base like dimethylaminopyridine. Intermediate (20e) is treated with a base such as lithium diisopropyl amide in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran, and reacted with (20c) to give the alkenyl diester (20f). Cyclisation of (20f) by an olefin metathesis reaction, performed as described above, provides cyclopentene derivative (20g). Stereoselective epoxidation of (20g) can be carried out using the Jacobsen asymmetric epoxidation method to obtain epoxide (20h). Finally, an epoxide opening reaction under basic conditions, e.g. by addition of a base, in particular DBN (1,5-diazabicyclo-[4.3.0]non-5-ene), yields the alcohol (20i). Optionally, the double bond in intermediate (20i) can be reduced, for example by catalytic hydrogenation using a catalyst like palladium on carbon, yielding the corresponding cyclopentane compound. The t.butyl ester may be removed to the corresponding acid, which subsequently is coupled to a P1 building block.\n\n\nThe —O—R\n4 \ngroup can be introduced on the pyrrolidine, cyclopentane or cyclopentene rings at any convenient stage of the synthesis of the compounds according to the present invention. One approach is to first introduce the —O—R\n4 \ngroup to the said rings and subsequently add the other desired building blocks, i.e. P1 (optionally with the P1′ tail) and P3, followed by the macrocycle formation. Another approach is to couple the building blocks P2, bearing no —O—R\n4 \nsubstituent, with each P1 and P3, and to add the —O—R\n4 \ngroup either before or after the macrocycle formation. In the latter procedure, the P2 moieties have a hydroxy group, which may be protected by a hydroxy protecting group PG\n1\n.\n\n\nR\n4 \ngroups can be introduced on building blocks P2 by reacting hydroxy substituted intermediates (21a) or (21b) with intermediates (4b) similar as described above for the synthesis of (I) starting from (4a). These reactions are represented in the schemes below, wherein L\n2 \nis as specified above and L\n5 \nand L\n5a \nindependently from one another, represent hydroxy, a carboxyl protecting group —OPG\n2 \nor —OPG\n2a\n, or L\n5 \nmay also represent a P1 group such as a group (d) or (e) as specified above, or L\n5a \nmay also represent a P3 group such as a group (b) as specified above The groups PG\n2 \nand PG\n2a \nare as specified above. Where the groups L\n5 \nand L\n5a \nare PG\n2 \nor PG\n2a\n, they are chosen such that each group is selectively cleavable towards the other. For example, one of L\n5 \nand L\n5a \nmay be a methyl or ethyl group and the other a benzyl or t.butyl group.\n\n\nIn one embodiment in (21a), L\n2 \nis PG and L\n5 \nis —OPG 2, or in (21d), L\n5a \nis —OPG\n2 \nand L\n5 \nis —OPG\n2 \nand the PG\n2 \ngroups are removed as described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another embodiment the group L\n2 \nis BOC, L\n5 \nis hydroxy and the starting material (21a) is commercially available BOC-hydroxyproline, or any other stereoisomeric form thereof, e.g. BOC-L-hydroxyproline, in particular the trans isomer of the latter. Where L\n5 \nin (21b) is a carboxyl-protecting group, it may be removed following procedures described above to (21c). In still another embodiment PG in (21b-1) is Boc and PG\n2 \nis a lower alkyl ester, in particular a methyl or ethyl ester. Hydrolysis of the latter ester to the acid can be done by standard procedures, e.g. acid hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid in methanol or with an alkali metal hydroxide such as NaOH, in particular with LiOH. In another embodiment, hydroxy substituted cyclopentane or cyclopentene analogs (21d) are converted to (21e), which, where L\n5 \nand L\n5a \nare —OPG\n2 \nor —OPG\n2a\n, may be converted to the corresponding acids (21f) by removal of the group PG Removal of PG\n2a \nin (21e-1) leads to similar intermediates.\n\n\nIntermediates (4b), which are isoquinoline derivatives, can be prepared using art-known procedures. For example, US 2005/0143316 provides diverse methods for the synthesis of isoquinolines as R\n4\n—OH or R\n4\n-LG intermediates. Methodology for the synthesis of such isoquinolines has been described by N. Briet et al., Tetrahedron, 2002, 5761 and is shown below, wherein R\n4a\n, R\n4b \nand R\n4b′\n are substituents on the isoquinoline moiety having the meanings defined herein for the substituents on the R\n4\n-group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinnamic acid derivatives (22b) are converted to 1-chloroisoquinolines in a three-step process. The resulting chloroisoquinolines (22e) can be subsequently coupled to hydroxypyrrolidine, hydroxycyclopentane or hydroxycyclopentene derivatives as described herein. In a first step, the carboxyl group in the cinnamic acids (22b) is activated, for example by treatment with a C\n1-6\nalkyl (in particular methyl or ethyl) chloroformate in the presence of a base. The resulting mixed anhydrides are then treated with sodium azide yielding the acyl azides (22c). Several other methods are available for the formation of acylazides from carboxylic acids, for example the carboxylic acid can be treated with diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA) in an aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride, in the presence of a base. In a next step the acyl azides (22c) are converted to the corresponding isoquinolones (22d) in particular by heating the acylazides in a high boiling solvent such as diphenylether. The starting cinnamic acids (22d) are commercially available or can be obtained from the corresponding benzaldehydes (22a) by direct condensation with malonic acids or derivatives thereof, or by employing a Wittig reaction. The intermediate isoquinolones (22d) can be converted to the corresponding 1-chloro-isoquinolines by treatment with a halogenating agent such as phosphorous oxychloride.\n\n\nR\n4\n-groups which are isoquinolines can also be prepared following procedures as described in K. Hirao, R. Tsuchiya, Y. Yano, H. Tsue, Heterocycles 42(1) 1996, 415-422.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative method for the synthesis of the isoquinoline ring system is the Pomeranz-Fritsh procedure. This method begins with the conversion of a benzaldehyde derivative (23a) to a functionalized imine (23b), which then is converted to an isoquinoline ring system by treatment with acid at elevated temperature. This method is particularly useful for preparing isoquinoline intermediates that are substituted at the C8 position indicated by the asterisk. The intermediate isoquinolines (23c) can be converted to the corresponding 1-chloroquinolines (23e) in a two-step process. The first step comprises the formation of an isoquinoline N-oxide (23d) by treatment of isoquinoline (23c) with a peroxide such as meta-chloroperbenzoic acid in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethane. Intermediate (23d) is converted to the corresponding 1-chloroisoquinoline by treatment with a halogenating agent such as phosphorous oxychloride.\n\n\nAnother method for the synthesis of the isoquinoline ring system is shown in the scheme below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this process the anion form of ortho-alkylbenzamide derivative (24a) is obtained by treatment with a strong base such as tert-butyl lithium in a solvent such as THF and is subsequently condensed with a nitrile derivative, yielding isoquinoline (24b). The latter can be converted to the corresponding 1-chloroisoquinoline by the methods described above. R′ and R″ in (24a) are alkyl groups, in particular C\n1-4\nalkyl groups, e.g. methyl or ethyl.\n\n\nThe following scheme shows an additional method for the synthesis of isoquinolines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntermediate (24a) is deprotonated using a strong base as described above. R′ and R″ are as specified above. The resulting intermediate anion is condensed with an ester (25a), obtaining ketone intermediate (25b). In a subsequent reaction the latter intermediate (25b) is reacted with ammonia or an ammonium salt, e.g. ammonium acetate, at elevated temperature, resulting in the formation of isoquinolone (24b).\n\n\nA variety of carboxylic acids with the general structure (25a) can be used in the above synthesis. These acids are available either commercially or can be prepared via art-known procedures. An example of the preparation of 2-(substituted)aminocarboxyaminothiazole derivatives (25a-1), following the procedure described by Berdikhina et al. in Chem. Heterocycl. Compd. (Engl. Transl.) (1991), 427-433, is shown in the following reaction scheme which illustrates the preparation of 2-carboxy-4-isopropylthiazole (25a-1):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthyl thiooxamate (26a) is reacted with the β-bromoketone (26b) to form the thiazolyl carboxylic acid ester (26c) which is hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid (25a-1). The ethyl ester in these intermediates may be replaced by other carboxyl protecting groups PG\n2\n, as defined above. In the above scheme R\n4c \nis as defined above and in particular is C\n1-4\nalkyl, more in particular i.propyl.\n\n\nThe bromoketone (26b) may be prepared from 3-methyl-butan-2-one (MIK) with a sililating agent (such as TMSCl) in the presence of a suitable base (in particular LiHMDS) and bromine.\n\n\nThe synthesis of further carboxylic acids (25a), in particular of substituted amino thiazole carboxylic acids (25a-2) is illustrated herebelow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThiourea (27c) with various substituents R\n4\na, which in particular are C\n1-6\nalkyl, can be formed by reaction of the appropriate amine (27a) with tert-butylisothiocyanate in the presence of a base like diisopropylethylamine in a solvent like dichloromethane followed by removal of the tert-butyl group under acidic conditions. Subsequent condensation of thiourea derivative (27c) with 3-bromopyruvic acid provides the thiazole carboxylic acid (25a-2).\n\n\nYet an additional method for the preparation of isoquinolines is illustrated in the following reaction scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first step of this process an ortho-alkylarylimine derivative (28a) is subjected to deprotonation conditions (e.g. sec-butyl lithium, THF) and the resulting anion is condensed with an activated carboxylic acid derivative such as a Weinreb amide (28b). The resulting keto imine (28c) is converted to the isoquinoline (28d) by condensation with ammonium acetate at elevated temperatures. The thus obtained isoquinolines can be converted to the corresponding 1-chloroisoquinolines by the methods described herein.\n\n\nThe isoquinolines described herein, either as such or incorporated onto the hydroxypyrrolidine, hydroxycyclopentane or hydroxycyclopentane moieties in the compounds of formula (I) or in any of the intermediates mentioned herein, can be further functionalized. An example of such functionalization is illustrated herebelow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above scheme shows the conversion of a 1-chloro-6-fluoro-isoquinoline to the corresponding 1-chloro-6-C\n1-6\nalkoxy-isoquinoline moiety (29b), by treatment of (29a) with a sodium or potassium alkoxide in an alcohol solvent from which the alkoxide is derived. L\n6 \nin the above scheme represents halo or a group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR in the above scheme represents C\n1-6\nalkyl and LG is a leaving group. In one embodiment LG is fluoro. L\n7 \nand L\n8 \nrepresent various substituents that can be linked at these positions of the P2 moiety, in particular groups such as OL\n5\n, or L\n8 \nmay be a P1 group and L\n7 \na P3 group, or L\n7 \nand L\n8 \ntaken together may form the remainder of the macrocyclic ring system of the compounds of formula (I).\n\n\nThe following scheme provides an example for the modification of isoquinolines by Suzuki reactions. These couplings can be employed to functionalize an isoquinoline at each position of the ring system provided said ring is suitably activated or functionalized, as for example with chloro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sequence begins with 1-chloroisoquinoline (30a) which upon treatment with a peroxide such as metachloroperbenzoic acid is converted to the corresponding N-oxide (30b). The latter intermediate is converted to the corresponding 1,3-dichloroisoquinoline (30c) by treatment with a halogenating agent, e.g. phosphorous oxychloride. Intermediate (30c) can be coupled with an intermediate (30d), wherein L\n6 \nis a group PG where X is N, or L\n6 \nis a group —COOPG\n2 \nwhere X is C, using methods described herein for introducing —O—R\n4\n-groups, to provide intermediate (30e). Intermediate (30e) is derivatized using a Suzuki coupling with an aryl boronic acid, in the presence of a palladium catalyst and a base, in a solvent such as THF, toluene or a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF, to provide the C3-arylisoquinoline intermediate (30f). Heteroarylboronic acids can also be employed in this coupling process to provide C3-heteroarylisoquinolines.\n\n\nSuzuki couplings of isoquinolines systems with aryl or heteroaryl groups can also be employed at a later synthesis stage in the preparation of compounds of formula (I). The isoquinoline ring systems can also be functionalized by employing other palladium catalyzed reactions, such as the Heck, Sonogashira or Stille couplings as illustrated for example in US 2005/1043316.\n\n\nSynthesis of P1 Building Blocks\n\n\nThe cyclopropane amino acid used in the preparation of the P1 fragment is commercially available or can be prepared using art-known procedures.\n\n\nIn particular the amino-vinyl-cyclopropyl ethyl ester (12b) may be obtained according to the procedure described in WO 00/09543 or as illustrated in the following scheme, wherein PG\n2 \nis a carboxyl protecting group as specified above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment of commercially available or easily obtainable imine (31a) with 1,4-dihalobutene in presence of a base produces (31b), which after hydrolysis yields cyclopropyl amino acid (12b), having the allyl substituent syn to the carboxyl group. Resolution of the enantiomeric mixture (12b) results in (12b-1). The resolution is performed using art-known procedures such as enzymatic separation; crystallization with a chiral acid; or chemical derivatization; or by chiral column chromatography. Intermediates (12b) or (12b-1) may be coupled to the appropriate P2 derivatives as described above.\n\n\nP1 building blocks for the preparation of compounds according to general formula (I) wherein R\n1 \nis —OR\n5 \nor —NH—SO\n2\nR\n6 \ncan be prepared by reacting amino acids (32a) with the appropriate alcohol or amine respectively under standard conditions for ester or amide formation. Cyclopropyl amino acids (32a) are prepared by introducing a N-protecting group PG, and removal of PG\n2 \nand the amino acids (32a) are converted to the amides (12c-1) or esters (12c-2), which are subgroups of the intermediates (12c), as outlined in the following reaction scheme, wherein PG is as specified above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reaction of (32a) with amine (2b) is an amide forming procedure. The similar reaction with (2c) is an ester forming reaction. Both can be performed following the procedures described above. This reaction yields intermediates (32b) or (32c) from which the amino protecting group is removed by standard methods such as those described above. This in turn results in the desired intermediate (12c-1). Starting materials (32a) may be prepared from the above-mentioned intermediates (12b) by first introducing a N-protecting group PG and subsequent removal of the group PG\n2\n.\n\n\nIn one embodiment the reaction of (32a) with (2b) is done by treatment of the amino acid with a coupling agent, for example N,N′-carbonyl-diimidazole (CDI) or the like, in a solvent like THF followed by reaction with (2b) in the presence of a base such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). Alternatively the amino acid can be treated with (2b) in the presence of a base like diisopropylethylamine followed by treatment with a coupling agent such as benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (commercially available as PyBOP®) to effect the introduction of the sulfonamide group.\n\n\nIntermediates (12c-1) or (12c-2) in turn may be coupled to the appropriate proline, cyclopentane or cyclopentene derivatives as described above.\n\n\nSynthesis of the P3 Building Blocks\n\n\nThe P3 building blocks are available commercially or can be prepared according to methodologies known to the skilled in the art. One of these methodologies is shown in the scheme below and uses monoacylated amines, such as trifluoroacetamide or a Bocprotected amine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above scheme, R together with the CO group forms a N-protecting group, in particular R is t-butoxy, trifluoromethyl; R\n3 \nand n are as defined above and LG is a leaving group, in particular halogen, e.g. chloro or bromo.\n\n\nThe monoacylated amines (33a) are treated with a strong base such as sodium hydride and are subsequently reacted with a reagent LG-C\n5-8\nalkenyl (33b), in particular haloC\n5-8\nalkenyl, to form the corresponding protected amines (33c). Deprotection of (33c) affords (5b), which are building blocks P3. Deprotection will depend on the functional group R, thus if R is t-butoxy, deprotection of the corresponding Boc-protected amine can be accomplished with an acidic treatment, e.g. trifluoroacetic acid. Alternatively, when R is for instance trifluoromethyl, removal of the R group is accomplished with a base, e.g. sodium hydroxide.\n\n\nThe following scheme illustrates yet another method for preparing a P3 building block, namely a Gabriel synthesis of primary C\n5-8\nalkenylamines, which can be carried out by the treatment of a phthalimide (34a) with a base, such as NaOH or KOH, and with (33b), which is as specified above, followed by hydrolysis of the intermediate N-alkenyl imide to generate a primary C\n5-8\nalkenylamine (5b-1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above scheme, n is as defined above.\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) may be converted into each other following art-known functional group transformation reactions. For example, amino groups may be N-alkylated, nitro groups reduced to amino groups, a halo atom may be exchanged for another halo.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may be converted to the corresponding N-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its N-oxide form. Said N-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tert-butyl hydro-peroxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alcohols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.\n\n\nPure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. Diastereomers may be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g., counter-current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may be obtained as racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I), which are sufficiently basic or acidic may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid, respectively chiral base. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali or acid. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound may be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods may advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.\n\n\nIn a further aspect, the present invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) as specified herein, or a compound of any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I) as specified herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A therapeutically effective amount in this context is an amount sufficient to prophylactically act against, to stabilize or to reduce viral infection, and in particular HCV viral infection, in infected subjects or subjects being at risk of being infected. In still a further aspect, this invention relates to a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition as specified herein, which comprises intimately mixing a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), as specified herein, or of a compound of any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I) as specified herein.\n\n\nTherefore, the compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form or metal complex, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations, which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may also be administered via oral inhalation or insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in the art for administration via this way. Thus, in general the compounds of the present invention may be administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder, a solution being preferred. Any system developed for the delivery of solutions, suspensions or dry powders via oral inhalation or insufflation are suitable for the administration of the present compounds.\n\n\nThus, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition adapted for administration by inhalation or insufflation through the mouth comprising a compound of formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably, the compounds of the present invention are administered via inhalation of a solution in nebulized or aerosolized doses.\n\n\nIt is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, suppositories, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) show antiviral properties. Viral infections and their associated diseases treatable using the compounds and methods of the present invention include those infections brought on by HCV and other pathogenic flaviviruses such as Yellow fever, Dengue fever (types 1-4), St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Murray valley encephalitis, West Nile virus and Kunjin virus. The diseases associated with HCV include progressive liver fibrosis, inflammation and necrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and HCC; and for the other pathogenic flaviruses the diseases include yellow fever, dengue fever, hemorraghic fever and encephalitis. A number of the compounds of this invention moreover are active against mutated strains of HCV. Additionally, many of the compounds of this invention show a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and have attractive properties in terms of bioavailabilty, including an acceptable half-life, AUC (area under the curve) and peak values and lacking unfavourable phenomena such as insufficient quick onset and tissue retention.\n\n\nThe in vitro antiviral activity against HCV of the compounds of formula (I) was tested in a cellular HCV replicon system based on Lohmann et al. (1999) Science 285:110-113, with the further modifications described by Krieger et al. (2001) Journal of Virology 75: 4614-4624, which is further exemplified in the examples section. This model, while not a complete infection model for HCV, is widely accepted as the most robust and efficient model of autonomous HCV RNA replication currently available. Compounds exhibiting anti-HCV activity in this cellular model are considered as candidates for further development in the treatment of HCV infections in mammals. It will be appreciated that it is important to distinguish between compounds that specifically interfere with HCV functions from those that exert cytotoxic or cytostatic effects in the HCV replicon model, and as a consequence cause a decrease in HCV RNA or linked reporter enzyme concentration. Assays are known in the field for the evaluation of cellular cytotoxicity based for example on the activity of mitochondrial enzymes using fluorogenic redox dyes such as resazurin. Furthermore, cellular counter screens exist for the evaluation of non-selective inhibition of linked reporter gene activity, such as firefly luciferase. Appropriate cell types can be equipped by stable transfection with a luciferase reporter gene whose expression is dependent on a constitutively active gene promoter, and such cells can be used as a counter-screen to eliminate non-selective inhibitors.\n\n\nDue to their antiviral properties, particularly their anti-HCV properties, the compounds of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, their prodrugs, N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines, metal complexes and stereochemically isomeric forms, are useful in the treatment of individuals experiencing a viral infection, particularly a HCV infection, and for the prophylaxis of these infections. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals infected with viruses, in particular flaviviruses such as HCV.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may therefore be used as medicines. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the systemic administration to viral infected subjects or to subjects susceptible to viral infections of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with the viral infection, in particular the HCV infection.\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to the use of the present compounds or any subgroup thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or the prevention of viral infections, particularly HCV infection.\n\n\nThe present invention furthermore relates to a method of treating a warm-blooded animal infected by a virus, or being at risk of infection by a virus, in particular by HCV, said method comprising the administration of an anti-virally effective amount of a compound of formula (I), as specified herein, or of a compound of any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I), as specified herein.\n\n\nAlso, the combination of previously known anti-HCV compound, such as, for instance, interferon-α (IFN-α), pegylated interferon-α and/or ribavirin, and a compound of formula (I) can be used as a medicine in a combination therapy. The term “combination therapy” relates to a product containing mandatory (a) a compound of formula (I), and (b) optionally another anti-HCV compound, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in treatment of HCV infections, in particular, in the treatment of infections with HCV.\n\n\nAnti-HCV compounds encompass agents selected from an HCV polymerase inhibitor, an HCV protease inhibitor, an inhibitor of another target in the HCV life cycle, and immunomodulatory agent, an antiviral agent, and combinations thereof.\n\n\nHCV polymerase inhibitors include, but are not limited to, NM283 (valopicitabine), R803, JTK-109, JTK-003, HCV-371, HCV-086, HCV-796 and R-1479.\n\n\nInhibitors of HCV proteases (NS2-NS3 inhibitors and NS3-NS4A inhibitors) include, but are not limited to, the compounds of WO02/18369 (see, e.g., page 273, lines 9-22 and page 274, line 4 to page 276, line 11); BILN-2061, VX-950, GS-9132 (ACH-806), SCH-503034, and SCH-6.

The latter preferably are those HIV inhibitors that have a positive effect on drug metabolism and/or pharmacokinetics that improve bioavailabilty. An example of such an HIV inhibitor is ritonavir.\n\n\nAs such, the present invention further provides a combination comprising (a) an HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and (b) ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\nThe compound ritonavir, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and methods for its preparation are described in WO94/14436. For preferred dosage forms of ritonavir, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,157, and the documents cited therein: U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,801, Ser. No. 08/402,690, and WO95/07696 and WO95/09614. Ritonavir has the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the combination comprising (a) an HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and (b) ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, further comprises an additional anti-HCV compound selected from the compounds as described herein.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a combination as described herein, comprising the step of combining an HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An alternative embodiment of this invention provides a process wherein the combination comprises one or more additional agent as described herein.\n\n\nThe combinations of the present invention may be used as medicaments. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the systemic administration to HCV-infected subjects of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with HCV and other pathogenic flavi- and pestiviruses. Consequently, the combinations of the present invention can be used in the manufacture of a medicament useful for treating, preventing or combating infection or disease associated with HCV infection in a mammal, in particular for treating conditions associated with HCV and other pathogenic flavi- and pestiviruses.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a combination according to any one of the embodiments described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. In particular, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising (a) a therapeutically effective amount of an HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of the formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, (b) a therapeutically effective amount of ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and (c) a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Optionally, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises an additional agent selected from an HCV polymerase inhibitor, an HCV protease inhibitor, an inhibitor of another target in the HCV life cycle, and immunomodulatory agent, an antiviral agent, and combinations thereof.\n\n\nThe compositions may be formulated into suitable pharmaceutical dosage forms such as the dosage forms described above. Each of the active ingredients may be formulated separately and the formulations may be co-administered or one formulation containing both and if desired further active ingredients may be provided.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “composition” is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from the combination of the specified ingredients.\n\n\nIn one embodiment the combinations provided herein may also be formulated as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in HIV therapy. In such a case, the compound of general formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, is formulated in a pharmaceutical composition containing other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and ritonavir is formulated separately in a pharmaceutical composition containing other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Conveniently, these two separate pharmaceutical compositions can be part of a kit for simultaneous, separate or sequential use.\n\n\nThus, the individual components of the combination of the present invention can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms. The present invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term “administering” is to be interpreted accordingly. In a preferred embodiment, the separate dosage forms are administered about simultaneously.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the combination of the present invention contains an amount of ritonavir, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which is sufficient to clinically improve the bioavailability of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) relative to the bioavailability when said HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) is administered alone.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the combination of the present invention contains an amount of ritonavir, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which is sufficient to increase at least one of the pharmacokinetic variables of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) selected from t\n1/2\n, C\nmin\n, C\nmax\n, C\nss\n, AUC at 12 hours, or AUC at 24 hours, relative to said at least one pharmacokinetic variable when the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) is administered alone.\n\n\nA further embodiment relates to a method for improving the bioavailability of a HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor comprising administering to an individual in need of such improvement a combination as defined herein, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of each component of said combination.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the invention relates to the use of ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as an improver of at least one of the pharmacokinetic variables of a HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) selected from t\n1/2\n, C\nmin\n, C\nmax\n, C\nss\n, AUC at 12 hours, or AUC at 24 hours; with the proviso that said use is not practised in the human or animal body.\n\n\nThe term “individual” as used herein refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment.\n\n\nBioavailability is defined as the fraction of administered dose reaching systemic circulation. t\n1/2 \nrepresents the half life or time taken for the plasma concentration to fall to half its original value. C\nss \nis the steady state concentration, i.e. the concentration at which the rate of input of drug equals the rate of elimination. C\nmin \nis defined as the lowest (minimum) concentration measured during the dosing interval. C\nmax\n, represents the highest (maximum) concentration measured during the dosing interval. AUC is defined as the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for a defined period of time.\n\n\nThe combinations of this invention can be administered to humans in dosage ranges specific for each component comprised in said combinations. The components comprised in said combinations can be administered together or separately. The NS3/4a protease inhibitors of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, and ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, may have dosage levels of the order of 0.02 to 5.0 grams-per-day.\n\n\nWhen the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) and ritonavir are administered in combination, the weight ratio of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) to ritonavir is suitably in the range of from about 40:1 to about 1:15, or from about 30:1 to about 1:15, or from about 15:1 to about 1:15, typically from about 10:1 to about 1:10, and more typically from about 8:1 to about 1:8. Also useful are weight ratios of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors of formula (I) to ritonavir ranging from about 6:1 to about 1:6, or from about 4:1 to about 1:4, or from about 3:1 to about 1:3, or from about 2:1 to about 1:2, or from about 1.5:1 to about 1:1.5. In one aspect, the amount by weight of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors of formula (I) is equal to or greater than that of ritonavir, wherein the weight ratio of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) to ritonavir is suitably in the range of from about 1:1 to about 15:1, typically from about 1:1 to about 10:1, and more typically from about 1:1 to about 8:1. Also useful are weight ratios of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) to ritonavir ranging from about 1:1 to about 6:1, or from about 1:1 to about 5:1, or from about 1:1 to about 4:1, or from about 3:2 to about 3:1, or from about 1:1 to about 2:1 or from about 1:1 to about 1.5:1.\n\n\nThe term “therapeutically effective amount” as used herein means that amount of active compound or component or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought, in the light of the present invention, by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease being treated. Since the instant invention refers to combinations comprising two or more agents, the “therapeutically effective amount” is that amount of the agents taken together so that the combined effect elicits the desired biological or medicinal response. For example, the therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising (a) the compound of formula (I) and (b) ritonavir, would be the amount of the compound of formula (I) and the amount of ritonavir that when taken together have a combined effect that is therapeutically effective.\n\n\nIn general it is contemplated that an antiviral effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as one, two, three, four or more (sub-)doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said (sub-)doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 1 to 1000 mg, and in particular 5 to 200 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.\n\n\nThe exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight, sex, extent of disorder and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines.\n\n\nAccording to one embodiment, the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) and ritonavir may be co-administered once or twice a day, preferably orally, wherein the amount of the compounds of formula (I) per dose is from about 1 to about 2500 mg, and the amount of ritonavir per dose is from 1 to about 2500 mg. In another embodiment, the amounts per dose for once or twice daily co-administration are from about 50 to about 1500 mg of the compound of formula (I) and from about 50 to about 1500 mg of ritonavir. In still another embodiment, the amounts per dose for once or twice daily co-administration are from about 100 to about 1000 mg of the compound of formula (I) and from about 100 to about 800 mg of ritonavir. In yet another embodiment, the amounts per dose for once or twice daily co-administration are from about 150 to about 800 mg of the compound of formula (I) and from about 100 to about 600 mg of ritonavir. In yet another embodiment, the amounts per dose for once or twice daily co-administration are from about 200 to about 600 mg of the compound of formula (I) and from about 100 to about 400 mg of ritonavir. In yet another embodiment, the amounts per dose for once or twice daily co-administration are from about 200 to about 600 mg of the compound of formula (I) and from about 20 to about 300 mg of ritonavir. In yet another embodiment, the amounts per dose for once or twice daily co-administration are from about 100 to about 400 mg of the compound of formula (I) and from about 40 to about 100 mg of ritonavir.\n\n\nExemplary combinations of the compound of formula (I) (mg)/ritonavir (mg) for once or twice daily dosage include 50/100, 100/100, 150/100, 200/100, 250/100, 300/100, 350/100, 400/100, 450/100, 50/133, 100/133, 150/133, 200/133, 250/133, 300/133, 50/150, 100/150, 150/150, 200/150, 250/150, 50/200, 100/200, 150/200, 200/200, 250/200, 300/200, 50/300, 80/300, 150/300, 200/300, 250/300, 300/300, 200/600, 400/600, 600/600, 800/600, 1000/600, 200/666, 400/666, 600/666, 800/666, 1000/666, 1200/666, 200/800, 400/800, 600/800, 800/800, 1000/800, 1200/800, 200/1200, 400/1200, 600/1200, 800/1200, 1000/1200, and 1200/1200.

Isobutylene was then bubbled into the solution until the total volume had increased to approximately 250 ml which gave a turbid solution. BF\n3\n.Et\n2\nO (5.6 ml, 44.5 mmol, 0.5 eq.) was added and the reaction mixture was kept at approximately −10° C. under nitrogen. After 10 min, a clear solution was obtained. The reaction was monitored by TLC (ethyl acetate-tToluene 3:2 acidified with a few drops of acetic acid and hexane-EtOAcethyl acetate 4:1, staining with basic permanganate solution). At 70 min only traces of compound 76 remained and aqueous saturated NaHCO\n3 \n(200 ml) was added to the reaction mixture, which was then stirred vigorously for 10 min. The organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO\n3 \n(3×200 ml) and brine (1×150 ml), then dried with sodium sulfite, filtered and the residue was evaporated to an oily residue. Upon addition of hexane to the residue, the product precipitated. Addition of more hexane and heating to reflux gave a clear solution from which the product crystallized. The crystals were collected by filtration and were washed with hexane (room temp.), then air-dried for 72 h giving colourless needles (12.45 g, 58.7 mmol, 66%)\n\n\nExample 32\n\n\nActivity of Compounds of Formula (I)\n\n\nReplicon Assay\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) were examined for activity in the inhibition of HCV RNA replication in a cellular assay. The assay demonstrated that the compounds of formula (I) exhibited activity against HCV replicons functional in a cell culture. The cellular assay was based on a bicistronic expression construct, as described by Lohmann et al. (1999) Science vol. 285 pp. 110-113 with modifications described by Krieger et al. (2001) Journal of Virology 75: 4614-4624, in a multi-target screening strategy. In essence, the method was as follows.\n\n\nThe assay utilized the stably transfected cell line Huh-7 luc/neo (hereafter referred to as Huh-Luc). This cell line harbors an RNA encoding a bicistronic expression construct comprising the wild type NS3-NS5B regions of HCV type 1b translated from an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), preceded by a reporter portion (FfL-luciferase), and a selectable marker portion (neo\nR\n, neomycine phosphotransferase). The construct is bordered by 5′ and 3′ NTRs (non-translated regions) from HCV type 1b. Continued culture of the replicon cells in the presence of G418 (neo\nR\n) is dependent on the replication of the HCV RNA. The stably transfected replicon cells that express HCV RNA, which replicates autonomously and to high levels, encoding inter alia luciferase, are used for screening the antiviral compounds.\n\n\nThe replicon cells were plated in 384 well plates in the presence of the test and control compounds which were added in various concentrations. Following an incubation of three days, HCV replication was measured by assaying luciferase activity (using standard luciferase assay substrates and reagents and a Perkin Elmer ViewLux™ ultraHTS microplate imager). Replicon cells in the control cultures have high luciferase expression in the absence of any inhibitor. The inhibitory activity of the compound on luciferase activity was monitored on the Huh-Luc cells, enabling a doseresponse curve for each test compound. EC\n50 \nvalues were then calculated, which value represents the amount of the compound required to decrease by 50% the level of detected luciferase activity, or more specifically, the ability of the genetically linked HCV replicon RNA to replicate.\n\n\nInhibition Assay\n\n\nThe aim of this in vitro assay was to measure the inhibition of HCV NS3/4A protease complexes by the compounds of the present invention. This assay provides an indication of how effective compounds of the present invention would be in inhibiting HCV NS3/4A proteolytic activity.\n\n\nThe inhibition of full-length hepatitis C NS3 protease enzyme was measured essentially as described in Poliakov, 2002 Prot Expression & Purification 25 363 371. Briefly, the hydrolysis of a depsipeptide substrate, Ac-DED(Edans)EEAbuψ[COO]ASK(Dabcyl)NH\n2 \n(AnaSpec, San Jose, USA), was measured spectrofluorometrically in the presence of a peptide cofactor, KKGSVVIVGRIVLSGK (Åke Engström, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Sweden). [Landro, 1997 #Biochem 36 9340-9348]. The enzyme (1 nM) was incubated in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM DTT, 40% glycerol, 0.1% n-octyl-D-glucoside, with 25 μM NS4A cofactor and inhibitor at 30° C. for 10 min, whereupon the reaction was initiated by addition of 0.5 μM substrate. Inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO, sonicated for 30 sec. and vortexed. The solutions were stored at −20° C. between measurements.\n\n\nThe final concentration of DMSO in the assay sample was adjusted to 3.3%. The rate of hydrolysis was corrected for inner filter effects according to published procedures. [Liu, 1999 Analytical Biochemistry 267 331-335]. Ki values were estimated by non-linear regression analysis (GraFit, Erithacus Software, Staines, MX, UK), using a model for competitive inhibition and a fixed value for μm (0.15 μM). A minimum of two replicates was performed for all measurements.\n\n\nThe following Table 1 lists compounds that were prepared according to any one of the above examples. The activities of the compounds tested are also depicted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEC\n50 \n(μM)\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample nr.\n\n\nCompound nr.\n\n\nReplicon assay\n\n\nEnzymatic assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n29\n\n\n>10\n\n\n150\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n30\n\n\n3.026\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n31\n\n\n>10\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n32\n\n\n3.569\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n33\n\n\n47.492\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n34\n\n\n1.645\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n35\n\n\n20.915\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\n36\n\n\n0.072\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\n42\n\n\n>10\n\n\n620\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\n43\n\n\n2.098\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\n50\n\n\n—\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 13\n\n\n51\n\n\n0.058\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14\n\n\n52\n\n\n>10\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\n53\n\n\n>10\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 16\n\n\n54\n\n\n>10\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\n55\n\n\n>100\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 18\n\n\n56\n\n\n1.027\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 19\n\n\n57\n\n\n8.087\n\n\n210\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 20\n\n\n58\n\n\n2.309\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 22\n\n\n66\n\n\n0.323\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 23\n\n\n67\n\n\n>10\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 24\n\n\n68\n\n\n0.165\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 26\n\n\n70\n\n\n6.733\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 27\n\n\n71\n\n\n>10\n\n\n—"
