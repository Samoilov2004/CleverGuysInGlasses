Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIntracellular receptors (IR's) are a class of structurally related proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression. The steroid hormone receptors are a subset of this superfamily whose natural ligands are typically comprised of endogenous steroids such as estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol. Man-made ligands to these receptors play an important role in human health and, of these receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor has an essential role in regulating human physiology and immune response. Steroids that interact with the glucocorticoid receptor have been shown to be potent anti-inflammatory agents. The present invention is directed to a novel class of compounds that are selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators that have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity and possess advantages over steroidal glucocorticoid ligands with respect to side effects, efficacy, toxicity and/or metabolism.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to hexahydrocyclopentyl[f]imidazole carboxamides and derivatives thereof as selective glucocorticoid receptor ligands useful for treating a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases or conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use are also included.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention encompasses compounds of Formula I\n\n\n \n

The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion.

Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose, Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavouring and colouring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane dial. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Cosolvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols may also be used. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ambient temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical use, creams, ointments, gels, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing a compound of Formula I are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.)

E., et al., European Journal of Cancer, 30A: 484-490 (1994)) MDA-MB-453 (ATCC) cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco 11835-055) containing 20 mM Hepes, 4 mM L-glu, 10 μg/ml of human insulin (Sigma, I-0259), 10% FBS and 20 μg/ml of Gentamicin (Gibco#15710-072) are rinsed twice in PBS. Phenol red-free Trypsin-EDTA is diluted in the same PBS 1:10. The cell layers are rinsed with 1× Trypsin, extra Trypsin is poured out, and the cell layers are incubated at 37° C. for ˜2 min The flask is tapped and checked for signs of cell detachment. Once the cells begin to slide off the flask, the complete media is added. The cells are counted at this point, then diluted to the appropriate concentration and split into flasks or dishes for further culturing (Usually 1:3 to 1:6 dilution).\n\n\n \nPreparation of MDA-MB-453 Cell Lysate\n\n\n \n \n \nWhen the cells are 70 to 85% confluent, they are detached as described above, and collected by centrifuging at 1000 g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The cell pellet is washed twice with TEGM (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM Sodium Molybdate, pH 7.2). After the final wash, the cells are resuspended in TEGM at a concentration of 10\n7 \ncells/mL. The cell suspension is snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or ethanol/dry ice bath and transferred to −80° C. freezer on dry ice. Before setting up the binding assay, the frozen samples are left on ice-water to just thaw (˜1 hr). Then the samples are centrifuged at 12,500 g to 20,000 g for 30 min at 4° C. The supernatant is used to set-up assay right away. If using 50 μL of supernatant, the test compound can be prepared in 50 νL of the TEGM buffer.\n\n\n \nProcedure for Multiple Compound Screening\n\n\n \n \n \n1×TEGM buffer is prepared, and the isotope-containing assay mixture is prepared in the following order: EtOH (2% final concentration in reaction), \n3\nH-DEX (Amersham Biosciences) and 1×TEGM. [e.g. For 100 samples, 200 μL (100×2) of EtOH+4.25 μL of 1:10 \n3\nH-Dex stock+2300 μL (100×23) 1×TEGM]. The compound is serially diluted, e.g., if starting final conc. is 1 μM, and the compound is in 25 μL of solution, for duplicate samples, 75 μL of 4×1 μM solution is made and 3 μL of 100 μM is added to 72 μL of buffer, and 1:5 serial dilution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n25 μL of \n3\nH-DEX (6 nM) trace and 25 4 compound solution are first mixed together, followed by addition of 50 μL receptor solution. The reaction is gently mixed, spun briefly at about 200 rpm and incubated at 4° C. overnight. 100 μL of 50% HAP slurry is prepared and added to the incubated reaction which is then vortexed and incubated on ice for 5 to 10 minutes. The reaction mixture is vortexed twice more to resuspend HAP while incubating reaction. The samples in 96-well format are then washed in wash buffer using The FilterMate™ Universal Harvester plate washer (Packard). The washing process transfers HAP pellet containing ligand-bound expressed receptor to Unifilter-96 GF/B filter plate (Packard). The HAP pellet on the filter plate is incubated with 50 μL of MICROSCINT (Packard) scintillint for 30 minutes before being counted on the TopCount microscintillation counter (Packard). IC\n50\ns are calculated using DEX as a reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples 1 to 95 were tested in the ligand binding assay and demonstrated IC50s less than 1000 nM.\n\n\n \nTrans-Activation Modulation of Glucocorticoid Receptor (GRAMMER)\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to control transcription from the MMTV-LUC reporter gene in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells or MDA-MB-453 cells, a human breast cancer cell line that naturally expresses the human GR. The assay measures induction of a modified MMTV LTR/promoter linked to the LUC reporter gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe routine transient assay consists of plating 7,000-25,000 cells/well of a white, clear-bottom 96-well plate. Alternatively, 384-well plates can be used at a cell concentration of 10,000/well. The media that the cells are plated in is “exponential growth medium” which consists of phenol red-free RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine, 20mM HEPES, 10 ug/mL human insulin, and 20 ug/mL gentamicin. Incubator conditions are 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. The transfection is done in batch mode. The cells are trypsinized and counted to the right cell number in the proper amount of fresh media. It is then gently mixed with the FuGene6/DNA mix and plated onto the 96 or 384-well plate, all the wells receive 100 uL or 40 uL, respectively, of medium+lipid/DNA complex then incubated 37° C. overnight. The transfection cocktail consists of serum-free OptiMEM, FuGene6 reagent and DNA. The manufacturer's (Roche Biochemical) protocol for cocktail setup is as follows: The lipid to DNA ratio is approximately 2.5:1 and the incubation time is 20 min at room temperature. Sixteen to 24 hours after transfection, the cells are treated with dexamethasone to a final concentration of 10 nM as well as the compound of interest, such that final DMSO (vehicle) concentration is equal to or less than 1%. Each plate also contains samples that are treated with 10 nM dexamethasone alone, which is used as the 100% activity control. The cells are exposed to the compounds for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the cells are lysed by a Promega cell culture lysis buffer for approximately 30 min and then the luciferase activity in the extracts is assayed in the 96-well format luminometer. In 3 84-well format, Steady-Glo (Promega) or Steady-Lite (PerkinElmer) can be used by adding an equal volume of reagent to the media present in each well. Activity induced by 10 nM dexamethasone alone is set at 100% activity. Antagonist activity is calculated by determining the decrease in dexamethasone-induced activity in response to compound treatment relative to samples that were treated with dexamethasone alone. Results are expressed as % inhibition of 10 nM dexamethasone activity or as fold of 10 nM dexamethasone activity. This transactivation assay can be performed in an agonist and antagonist mode to identify these different activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity of test compounds is calculated as the E\nmax \nrelative to the activity obtained with 300 nM dexamethasone. Activity of test compounds is calculated as the E\nmax \nrelative to the activity obtained with 300 nM DEX. The exemplified tissue selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators of the present invention display partial agonist activity in this assay. The action of compounds is also tested in an antagonist mode (Anti-GRAMMER) in which the cells are treated with medium containing an agonist such as 10 nM DEX and the ability to agents to inhibit the activation by an agonist is measured.\n\n\n \nTransrepression Assay (GITAR)\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to control transcription from the TNFα-β-lactamase reporter gene in U937 cells, a human myelomonocytic leukemia cell line that naturally expresses the human GR. The assay measures compound dependent-repression of the TNFa promoter linked to a reporter gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe human U937cells that had been stablely transfected with the TNF-a promoter driving β-lactamase are used for this assay. U937 cells contain an endogenous glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Cells are maintained in RPMI 1640 Growth medium (Gibco Cat#11875-093) containing 25 mM HEPES, 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM Sodium pyruvate, 25 μg/ml Gentamicin (Gibco Cat#15710-064), 1:1000 2-Mercaptoethanol (Gibco Cat#21985-023) and 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Gibco Cat#10131-027). The density of the cells in the flask needs to be about 1×10\n6\n−3×10\n6\n/ml at the time of harvest. Usually, the cells are split to 1.2˜1.4×10\n5\n/ml (1:10) 3 days prior to the assay. 50,000 cells/well are plated in 96 well black-walled plates the day of assay. Test compounds are added 10 pt/well, and cells are incubated at 37° C. for 30-45 min. For assaying compounds, first dilute 1:10 in DMSO to make 1 mM, then further dilute 1:100 in medium to make 10× stock prior to adding to the cells. Add 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma, cat# P8139) 10 μL/well to a final concentration 5 ng/ml, and 1 μg/ml LPS (Sigma, cat# L4130) 10 μL/well to a final concentration 100 ng/ml. Incubate cells at 37° C. overnight for ˜18 hr. PMA is stored frozen as 100 μg/ml stock in DMSO. Dilute 1:10 in DMSO for a working stock of 10 μg/ml and store at −20C. For assaying, dilute the 1.0 μg/ml working stock 1:200 in medium to make a 10× solution (50 ng/ml). Store frozen LPS at 1 mg/ml in PBS, dilute 1:1000 in medium to make 10× (1 μg/ml) for the assay. Add 6× loading buffer (CCF2−AM) 20 μL/well, and incubate at room temperature for 70-90 min. Read plates on CytoFluor II Plate Reader according to manufacture suggested protocols. The activity repressed by 100 nM dexamethasone alone is set as 100% activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples 1 to 95 were tested in the transrepression assay and demonstrated maximal activity greater than 5%.\n\n\n \nMicroarray Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nAll cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen Life Tech, Carlsbad Calif. A549 cells were grown in phenol red-free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were grown at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n. Using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen Corp, Valencia Calif.), total RNA was extracted and purified from A549 cells treated with different GC compounds for 24 hours, at a fully active dose. These cells express large amount of the GR and are very responsive to GC treatment. All samples were compared against cells treated with vehicle. Expression levels of 23000 genes were measured using oligonucleotide microarrays purchased from Agilent Technologies, Inc. Each comparison was done on a pair of microarrays with reversed fluorophores. Raw image intensity data were processed according to the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,351,712. The method was used to remove dye bias and to derive a Rosetta probability (p) and fold change value for each gene and each sample pair. Furthermore, for each gene an ANOVA model was constructed across all treatments to derive error estimates. P values for evaluating expression differences were computed using a Bayesian adjusted t-test that was developed by Lönnstedt and Speed (2002) and extended by Smyth (2003). A gene was declared differentially expressed in any particular comparison if it satisfied two criteria:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. The Rosetta p value had to be less than 0.1 and the Rosetta fold change value had to be greater than L4 in at least one of the treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. The ANOVA p value had to be less than 0.01 and the fold change greater than 2 in the comparison under consideration.\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Inflammation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nIntact adult (6 month old) female Sprague-Dawley rats are used in the oxazolone (OX) contact dermatitis model. Rats were sensitized on the ventral abdomen with OX on Day 0. On Days 7 and 9, a randomly-selected ear was challenged (same ear each time) with OX; the other was treated with vehicle. Daily treatment begun on Day 7 and continued for 7d with test compounds at different doses and 1.3 mpk 6-methlyprednisolone or 0.1 mpk DEX as positive controls. The thickness of both ears are measured on Days 11 and 14. Necropsy occurred on Day 14. The rat is first weighed, then anesthetized in a CO\n2 \nchamber until near death. Approximately 5 ml whole blood is obtained by cardiac puncture. The rat is then examined for certain signs of death and completeness. Tissues are dissected in a highly stylized fashion. The following endpoints were evaluated: a) inhibiting ear inflammation induced by oxazalone, b) raising serum insulin, c) reducing serum ACTH, d) reducing spleen weight, e) reducing skin thickness, f) reducing body weight, g) increasing expression of bone-related genes with potential relationship to negative glucocorticoid effects on bone; e) changes in molecular markers that correlate with skin inflammation, skin thinning, muscle atrophy and glucose metabolism in liver. All blood samples were collected between 1330-1530 hours, ˜4-5 hrs after the last compound treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary data for this assay are left and right ear thickness. Inter-ear thickness difference (etd) is used for the estimating the level of inflammation and effectiveness of the compounds is determined by their ability to reduce the increase the thickness of the inflamed ear. Back of the rat skin thickness, spleen weight, serum insulin as well as the effects of gcs on the expression of molecular markers in skin inflammation, skin atrophy, muscle atrophy and glucose metabolism in liver are measured. Data are analyzed by anova plus fisher plsd post-hoc test to identify intergroup differences.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds shown in Table 1 were tested in the binding, GRAMMER and GITAR assays and demonstrated a superior activity profile. The compounds shown in Table 1 have potencies in the GRAMMER and GITAR assays (as measured by inflection points, IP) of less than 6000 nM concomitant with maximum activity in the GRAMMER assay less
