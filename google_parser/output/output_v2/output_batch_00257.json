The use of xenogeneic proteins for therapeutic purposes may be advantageous for a variety of reasons, including, for example, the established success of hybridoma technology for raising antibodies in rodents, and the possibility of higher efficacy with a xenogeneic protein than with a human counterpart. Although xenogeneic proteins are a rich source of potential therapeutic molecules, they remain a relatively untapped one. One reason for this is that nonhuman proteins are often immunogenic when administered to humans, thereby greatly reducing their therapeutic utility. Additionally, even engineered proteins of human origin may become immunogenic due to changes in the protein sequence.\n\n\nImmunogenicity is the result of a complex series of responses to a substance that is perceived as foreign, and may include production of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, formation of immune complexes, complement activation, mast cell activation, inflammation, hypersensitivity responses, and anaphylaxis. Several factors can contribute to protein immunogenicity, including but not limited to protein sequence, route and frequency of administration, and patient population. Immunogenicity may limit the efficacy and safety of a protein therapeutic in multiple ways. Efficacy can be reduced directly by the formation of neutralizing antibodies. Efficacy may also be reduced indirectly, as binding to either neutralizing or non-neutralizing antibodies typically leads to rapid clearance from serum. Severe side effects and even death may occur when an immune reaction is raised. One special class of side effects results when neutralizing antibodies cross-react with an endogenous protein and block its function.\n\n\nBecause of the clinical success of monoclonal antibodies, immunogenicity reduction of these proteins has been an intense area of investigation. Antibodies are a unique system for the development of immunogenicity reduction methods because of the large number of highly conserved antibody sequences and the wealth of high-resolution structural information. A number of strategies for reducing antibody immunogenicity have been developed. The central aim of all of these approaches has been the reduction of nonhuman, and correspondingly immunogenic content, while maintaining affinity for the antigen.\n\n\nThe dominant method in use for antibody immunogenicity reduction, referred to as “humanization”, relies principally on the grafting of “donor” (typically mouse or rat) complementarity determining regions (CDRs) onto “acceptor” (human) variable light chain (VL) and variable heavy chain (VH) frameworks (FRs) (Tsurushita & Vasquez, 2004, Humanization of Monoclonal Antibodies, Molecular Biology of B Cells, 533-545, Elsevier Science (USA)). This strategy is referred to as “CDR grafting” (Winter U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539). “Backmutation” of selected acceptor framework residues to the corresponding donor residues is often required to regain affinity that is lost in the initial grafted construct (U.S. Pat. No. 5,530,101; U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,761; U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762; U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,370; U.S. Pat. No. 5,859,205; U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337; U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,297; U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213). Despite the significant clinical application of antibodies engineered using these methods, these methods remain nonrobust with regard to their ability to reduce immunogenicity. A number of humanized antibodies have elicited substantial immune reaction in clinical studies, with incidences of immune response as high as 63% of patients (Ritter et al., 2001\n, Cancer Research \n61: 6851-6859).\n\n\nThe incomplete capacity of current humanization methods for immunogenicity reduction are due to significant limitations imposed by the donor-acceptor approach. Historically, the use of a single donor has been part of methods aimed at engineering a single xenogeneic antibody to be suitable as a human biotherapeutic. However, the use of a single acceptor is not required. On the contrary, the use of an acceptor antibody, and the use of global homology to select it, place substantial restrictions on the immunogenicity reduction process. A principal problem is that the use of overall sequence similarity between nonhuman and human sequences as a metric for human immunogenicity is fundamentally flawed. This means of measuring the degree of humanness does not accurately account for the underlying molecular mechanisms of immune response. The immune system does not recognize antigens on the basis of global sequence similarity to human proteins. Rather, immune cells, including antigen presenting cells (APCs), T cells, and B cells, recognize linear or conformational motifs comprising only a handful of residues. A key step in antigen recognition is the formation of peptide-MHC-T cell receptor complexes. APCs express MHC molecules that recognize short (approximately nine residue) linear peptide sequences, referred to as MHC agretopes. T cells express T cell receptors that recognize T cell epitopes in the context of peptide-MHC complexes. T cells that recognize MHC agretopes that are present in human proteins typically undergo apoptosis or become anergic, while T cells that recognize foreign agretopes bound to MHC molecules may participate in an immune response. Thus the relevant quantity for the immunogenicity of a protein is not its global sequence similarity to a human sequence, but rather its sequence content of individual human epitopes.\n\n\nThe donor-acceptor model and the use of global sequence homology that it imposes fails in practice. Because CDRs are treated as inviolable, structural incompatibilities are introduced at the CDR-FR boundaries. Grafting of foreign donor CDRs onto a human acceptor framework creates a substantial number of nonhuman epitopes in each variable chain, including not only the epitopes in the foreign CDRs, but also the large number of epitopes at the FR-CDR boundaries. This FR-CDR incompatibility is evident when one backs away from global homology and looks at more local sequence homologies. CDR grafting generally maximizes the donor-acceptor homology of the frameworks at the expense of the CDRs (Clark, 2000\n, Immunology Today \n21: 397-402). Ironically this frequently results in lower global homology to human antibodies. In reality, the “cut and paste” approach to imparting the functional determinants of a nonhuman antibody onto the framework of a human one is unnecessary, as careful analysis of the antigen binding determinants of antibodies shows that, in fact, the majority of CDR residues are not involved in binding antigen (MacCallum et al., 1996\n, J. Mol. Biol. \n262: 732-745). FR-CDR incompatibility causes not only immunological problems at the sequence level, but also causes conformational problems at the structural level. As a result, humanization methods based on CDR grafting often result in antigen affinity losses of 10-100-fold, necessitating backmutation to donor residues within the framework. This process of backmutation is a hallmark of essentially all current humanization efforts, and because it introduces yet additional nonhuman epitopes, highlights the inefficiency of these methods.\n\n\nMethods that take an immune epitope approach to reducing antibody immunogenicity have been explored (U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,120; US 2003/0153043). Central to these methods is the determination of sequences within a xenogeneic antibody that are in fact immunogenic epitopes. Different methods for determination of immunogenicity both theoretical and experimental have been described and include determination of potential for amphipathic helix formation, binding to MHC, reactivity in a T-cell activation assay. A distinguishing feature between these strategies and the present invention is that the present invention makes no presumption as to the immunogenicity of specific epitopes. Rather, the primary goal is to maximize the content of human linear sequence strings in the xenogeneic antibody as determined by comparison to an alignment of human sequences. The relevant sequence dataset comprises strings that are nonimmunogenic for all relevant reasons, including lack of interaction with MHC, lack of interaction with T cell receptor, lack of proper processing necessary for presentation, and tolerance.\n\n\nIt is noted that the methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,120 and US 2003/0153043 suffer additionally in that they fail to address a significant concern for local level sequence engineering, namely the requirement for maintaining protein structure, stability, solubility, and function. Thus, although the sequence string approach to immunogenicity reduction is more accurate than CDR grafting, it will be optimal when coupled with protein design methodology that takes into account both local sequence content and conformational compatibility at the local and global structural level. In addition to providing scoring functions for assessing host string content, the present invention also describes scoring functions that evaluate other relevant properties of a protein that may be employed for the simultaneous immunogenicity reduction and structural and functional optimization of proteins.\n\n\nIn summary, the donor-acceptor model imposes significant restrictions on the immunogenicity reduction process. With regard to sequence, global sequence homology is an inappropriate metric for immunogenicity. With regard to structure, backmutations are needed to repair conformational incompatibilities, thereby creating or reintroducing nonhuman epitopes. The present invention describes a novel method for antibody immunogenicity reduction that steps outside of the donor-acceptor model, and thus the sequence and structural restrictions it imposes. The central strategy of the described method is that it maximizes the content of human linear sequence strings. In this way immunogenicity is addressed at the local sequence level, typically by utilizing the local sequence information contained in an alignment of human sequences. This strategy not only provides a more accurate measure of the immunogenicity, it enables substitutions to be designed in a forward rather than backward manner to repair problems introduced by the graft. In effect, by addressing immunogenicity at the local sequence string level, the optimal balance between binding determinants and humanness can be designed.\n\n\nThe present invention describes a novel method for reducing the immunogenicity of proteins that leverages the nonimmunogenic information contained in natural human sequences to score protein sequences for immunogenic content at the sequence string level. Furthermore, the described method capitalizes on recent advances in computational sequence and structure-based protein engineering methods to quantitatively and systematically determine the optimal balance between human sequence content and protein functionality. Because of the wealth of human sequence information available for the immunoglobulin protein family, application to human antibodies is emphasized. Applications to other proteins are also possible.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention disclosed herein provides a novel method for reducing the immunogenicity of a protein, wherein the method maximizes the content of sequence strings.

Such definitions are meant to encompass grammatical equivalents.\n\n\nBy “amino acid” as used herein is meant one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids or any non-natural analogues that may be present at a specific, defined position.\n\n\nBy “amino acid modification” herein is meant an amino acid substitution, insertion, and/or deletion in a polypeptide sequence. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution.\n\n\nBy “amino acid substitution” or “substitution” herein is meant the replacement of an amino acid at a given position in a protein sequence with another amino acid.\n\n\nBy “antibody” herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more proteins substantially encoded by all or part of the recognized immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes, for example in humans, include the kappa (κ), lambda (λ), and heavy chain genetic loci, which together comprise the myriad variable region genes, and the constant region genes mu (μ), delta (δ), gamma (γ), sigma (σ), and alpha (α) which encode the IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA isotypes respectively. Antibody herein is meant to include full length antibodies and antibody fragments, and may refer to a natural antibody from any organism, an engineered antibody, or an antibody generated recombinantly for experimental, therapeutic, or other purposes. By “IgG” as used herein is meant a protein belonging to the class of antibodies that are substantially encoded by a recognized immunoglobulin gamma gene. In humans this class comprises IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4.\n\n\nBy “corresponding” or “equivalent” residues as meant herein are residues that represent similar or homologous sequence and/or structural environments between a first and second protein, or between a first protein and set of multiple proteins. In order to establish homology, the amino acid sequence of a first protein is directly compared to the sequence of a second protein. After aligning the sequences, using one or more of the homology alignment programs known in the art (for example using conserved residues as between species), allowing for necessary insertions and deletions in order to maintain alignment (i.e., avoiding the elimination of conserved residues through arbitrary deletion and insertion), the residues equivalent to particular amino acids in the primary sequence of the first protein are defined. Alignment of conserved residues preferably should conserve 100% of such residues. However, alignment of greater than 75% or as little as 50% of conserved residues is also adequate to define equivalent residues. Corresponding residues may also be defined by determining structural homology between a first and second protein that is at the level of tertiary structure for proteins whose structures have been determined. In this case, equivalent residues are defined as those for which the atomic coordinates of two or more of the main chain atoms of a particular amino acid residue of the proteins (N on N, CA on CA, C on C and O on O) are within 0.13 nm and preferably 0.1 nm of each other after alignment. Alignment is achieved after the best model has been oriented and positioned to give the maximum overlap of atomic coordinates of non-hydrogen protein atoms of the proteins.\n\n\nBy “CDR” as used herein is meant a Complementarity Determining Region of an antibody variable domain. Systematic identification of residues included in the CDRs have been developed by Kabat (Kabat et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., United States Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) and alternately by Chothia (Chothia & Lesk, 1987, J. Mol. Biol. 196: 901-917; Chothia et al., 1989, Nature 342: 877-883; Al-Lazikani et al., 1997, J. Mol. Biol. 273: 927-948). For the purposes of the present invention, CDRs are defined as a slightly smaller set of residues than the CDRs defined by Chothia. VL CDRs are herein defined to include residues at positions 27-32 (CDR1), 50-56 (CDR2), and 91-97 (CDR3), wherein the numbering is according to Chothia. Because the VL CDRs as defined by Chothia and Kabat are identical, the numbering of these VL CDR positions is also according to Kabat. VH CDRs are herein defined to include residues at positions 27-33 (CDR1), 52-56 (CDR2), and 95-102 (CDR3), wherein the numbering is according to Chothia. These VH CDR positions correspond to Kabat positions 27-35 (CDR1), 52-56 (CDR2), and 95-102 (CDR3).\n\n\nBy “framework” as used herein is meant the region of an antibody variable domain exclusive of those regions defined as CDR's. Each antibody variable domain framework can be further subdivided into the contiguous regions separated by the CDR's (FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4).\n\n\nBy “qermline” as used herein is meant the set of sequences that compose the natural genetic repertoire of a protein, and its associated alleles.\n\n\nBy “host” as used herein is meant a family, genus, species or subspecies, group of individuals or even a single individual. A host group of individuals can be selected for based upon a variety of criteria, such as MHC allele composition, etc. In a preferred embodiment, a host is canine, murine, primate, or human. In the most preferred embodiment, a host is human.\n\n\nBy “host string” or “host sequence” as used herein is meant a string or sequence that encodes any part of a naturally occurring host protein.\n\n\nBy “humanized” antibody as used herein is meant an antibody comprising a human framework region and one or more CDR's from a non-human (usually mouse or rat) antibody. The non-human antibody providing the CDR's is called the “donor” and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is called the “acceptor”. One says that the donor antibody has been “humanized”, by the process of “humanization”.\n\n\nBy “identity” as used herein is meant the number of residues in a first sequence that are identical to the residues in a second sequence after alignment of the sequences to achieve the maximum identity.\n\n\nBy “immune epitope” or “epitope” herein is meant a linear sequence of amino acids that is located in a protein of interest. Epitopes may be analyzed for their potential for immunogenicity. Epitopes may be any length, preferably 9-mers.\n\n\nBy “immunogenicity” herein is meant the ability of a protein to elicit an immune response, including but not limited to production of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, formation of immune complexes, complement activation, mast cell activation, inflammation, and anaphylaxis.\n\n\nBy “immunoglobulin (Ig)” herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more proteins substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes. Immunoglobulins include but are not limited to antibodies. Immunoglobulins may have a number of structural forms, including but not limited to full length antibodies, antibody fragments, and individual immunoglobulin domains. By “immunoglobulin (Ig) domain” herein is meant a region of an immunoglobulin that exists as a distinct structural entity as ascertained by one skilled in the art of protein structure. Ig domains typically have a characteristic β-sandwich folding topology. The known Ig domains in the IgG class of antibodies are V\nH\n, Cγ1, Cy2, Cy3, V\nL\n, and C\nL\n.\n\n\nBy “natural sequence” or “natural protein” as used herein is meant a protein that has been determined to exist absent any experimental modifications. Also included are sequences that can be predicted to exist in nature based on experimentally determined sequences. An example of such a predicted sequence is an antibody that can be predicted to exist based on the established patterns of germline recombination. In this case the large size of the predicted antibody repertoire makes the actual experimental determination of all mature recombined antibodies not practical.\n\n\nBy “parent” or “parent protein” as used herein is meant a protein that is subsequently modified to generate a variant. The parent protein may be a naturally occurring protein, or a variant or engineered version of a naturally occurring protein. Parent protein may refer to the protein itself, compositions that comprise the parent protein, or the amino acid sequence that encodes it. Accordingly, by “parent antibody” as used herein is meant an antibody that is subsequently modified to generate a variant antibody. Accordingly, by “parent sequence” as used herein is meant the sequence that encodes the parent protein or parent antibody.\n\n\nBy “position” as used herein is meant a location in the sequence of a protein. Positions may be numbered sequentially, or according to an established format, for example Kabat, Chothia, and/or the EU index as in Kabat.\n\n\nBy “protein” herein is meant at least two covalently attached amino acids, which includes proteins, polypeptides, oligopeptides and peptides. The protein may be made up of naturally occurring amino acids and peptide bonds, or synthetic peptidomimetic structures.\n\n\nBy “reduced immunogenicity” herein is meant a decreased ability to activate the immune system, when compared to the parent protein. For example, a protein variant can be said to have “reduced immunogenicity” if it elicits neutralizing or non-neutralizing antibodies in lower titer or in fewer patients than the parent protein. A protein variant also can be said to have “reduced immunogenicity” if it shows decreased binding to one or more MHC alleles or if it induces T cell activation in a decreased fraction of patients relative to the parent protein.\n\n\nBy “residue” as used herein is meant a position in a protein and its associated amino acid identity. For example, proline 9 (also referred to as Pro9, also referred to as P9) is a residue in the WT AC10 VH region.\n\n\nBy “scoring function” herein is meant any equation or method for evaluating the fitness of one or more amino acid modifications in a protein. The scoring function may involve a physical or chemical energy term, or may involve knowledge-, statistical-, sequence-based energy terms, and the like.\n\n\nBy “string” as used herein is meant a contiguous sequence that encodes any part of a protein. Strings may comprise any 2 or more linear residues, with the number of contiguous residues being defined by the “window” or “window size”. Window sizes of 2-20 are preferred, with 7-13 more preferred, with 9 most preferred.\n\n\nBy “target” as used herein is meant the molecule that is bound specifically by a protein. A target may be a protein, carbohydrate, lipid, or other chemical compound. The target of an antibody is its antigen, also referred to as its target antigen.\n\n\nBy “variable region” as used herein is meant the region of an immunoglobulin that comprises one or more Ig domains substantially encoded by any of the VL (including Vκ and Vλ) and/or V\nH \ngenes that make up the light chain (including kappa and lambda) and heavy chain immunoglobulin genetic loci respectively. A light or heavy chain variable region (VL and VH) consists of a “framework” or “FR” region interrupted by three hypervariable regions referred to as “complementarity determining regions” or “CDRs”. The extent of the framework region and CDRs have been precisely defined, for example as in Kabat (see “Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest,” E. Kabat et al., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (1983)), and as in Chothia. The framework regions of an antibody, that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, serves to position and align the CDRs, which are primarily responsible for binding to an antigen.\n\n\nBy “variant protein” or “protein variant”, or “variant” as used herein is meant a protein that differs from a parent protein by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Protein variant may refer to the protein itself, a composition comprising the protein, or the amino sequence that encodes it. Preferably, the protein variant has at least one amino acid modification compared to the parent protein, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid modifications, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid modifications compared to the parent. The protein variant sequence herein will preferably possess at least about 80% homology with a parent protein sequence, and most preferably at least about 90% homology, more preferably at least about 95% homology. Accordingly, by “immunoglobulin variant” as used herein is meant an immunoglobulin that differs from a parent immunoglobulin by virtue of at least one amino acid modification.\n\n\nBy “wild type or WT” herein is meant an amino acid sequence or a nucleotide sequence that is found in nature and includes allelic variations. A WT protein has an amino acid sequence or a nucleotide sequence that has not been intentionally modified.\n\n\nThe protein variants of the present invention may be derived from parent proteins that are themselves from a wide range of sources. The parent protein may be substantially encoded by one or more genes from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, camels, llamas, dromedaries, monkeys, preferably mammals and most preferably humans and mice and rats. Although in a preferred embodiment the parent protein is nonhuman, in some embodiments of the present invention the parent protein may be human or similar to human. The parent protein may comprise more than one protein chain, and thus may be a monomer or an oligomer, including a homo- or hetero-oligomer. In a preferred embodiment, the parent protein is an antibody, referred to as the parent antibody. The parent antibody need not be naturally occurring. For example, the parent antibody may be an engineered antibody, including but not limited to nonhuman and chimeric antibodies. The parent antibody may be fully human, obtained for example using transgenic mice (Bruggemann et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n8:455-458) or human antibody libraries coupled with selection methods (Griffiths et al., 1998\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n9:102-108). The parent antibody need not be naturally occurring. For example, the parent antibody may be an engineered antibody, including but not limited to chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies (Clark, 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:397-402). The parent antibody may be an engineered variant of an antibody that is substantially encoded by one or more natural antibody genes. In one embodiment, the parent antibody has been affinity matured, as is known in the art, or engineered in some other way. The parent antibodies of the present invention may be substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes belonging to any of the antibody classes, and may comprise sequences belonging to the IgG class of antibodies, including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4, or alternatively the IgA (including subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgM classes of antibodies.\n\n\nVirtually any binding partner or antigen may be targeted by the proteins of the present invention. A number biotherapeutic proteins and antibodies that are approved for use, in clinical trials, or in development may thus benefit from immunogenicity reduction methods of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, the less immunogenic protein of the present invention is an antibody. The less immunogenic antibody may comprise sequences belonging to the IgG (including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4), IgA (including subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgM classes of antibodies, with the IgG class being preferred. The less immunogenic antibodies of the present invention may be full length antibodies, or antibody fragments. Constant regions need not be present, but if they are, they will likely be substantially identical to human immunoglobulin constant regions.\n\n\nThe constant region of the antibody may be modified in some way to make it more effective therapeutically. For example, the constant region may comprise substitutions that enhance therapeutic properties. Most preferred substitutions and optimized effector function properties are described in U.S. Ser.

As is known in the art, the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated accordingly depending upon the manner of introduction.\n\n\nDescription of the Methodology\n\n\nThe present invention provides a novel method for reducing the immunogenicity of a protein. A central principle of the described method is that substitutions are designed to maximize the content of human linear sequence strings using an alignment of human sequences. For application to antibodies, this approach to immunogenicity reduction excludes the use of the single donor-acceptor model employed in humanization methods. By stepping outside of the limitations imposed by the need to choose a human acceptor sequence a priori, a more immunologically relevant approach to immunogenicity reduction is enabled. Sequence information and structural information may be used to score potential amino acid substitutions. The scoring results are used to design protein variant libraries, which are subsequently screened experimentally to determine favorable substitutions. Feedback from experimental data may guide subsequent iterations of design and experimental screening, ultimately enabling protein variants to be engineered with the optimal balance between biophysical and immunological constraints.\n\n\nSequences\n\n\nCentral to the method described herein is that a set of host sequences provides information as to the degree to which linear sequence strings have the potential to be immunogenic. Thus the set of sequences employed is an important parameter. In the most common embodiment, the sequences are a set of human sequences that are homologous in sequence and/or structure to the parent sequence. As is known in the art, some proteins share a common structural scaffold and are homologous in sequence. This information may be used to gain insight into particular positions in the protein family. Sequence alignments are often carried out to determine which protein residues are conserved and which are not conserved. That is to say, by comparing and contrasting alignments of protein sequences, the degree of variability at a position may be observed, and the types of amino acids that occur naturally at positions may be observed. Thus for the present invention, typically the sequences are aligned such that the conserved or similar residues that exist between the parent sequence and the set of human sequences and among the set of human sequences can be identified. Methods for sequence alignment are well known in the art, and include alignments based on sequence and structural homology.\n\n\nProtein sequence information can be obtained, compiled, and/or generated from sequence alignments of naturally occurring proteins from any organism, including but not limited to mammals. Because a preferred embodiment of present invention is directed towards immunogenicity reduction for biotherapeutics, the sequences that compose the set are most preferably human. The source of the sequences may vary widely, may be a database that is compiled publicly or privately, and may be may include one or more of the known general protein and nucleic acid sequences databases, including but not limited to SwissProt, GenBank® and Entrez®, and EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database. Because a preferred embodiment of the present invention is its application to the immunogenicity reduction of immunoglobulins, a number of immunoglobulin databases may be useful for obtaining sequences, including but not limited to the Kabat database (Johnson & Wu, 2001\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n29:205-206; Johnson & Wu, 2000\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n28:214-218), the IMGT database (IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®; Lefranc et al., 1999\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n27:209-212; Ruiz et al., 2000 \nNucleic Acids Re. \n28:219-221; Lefranc et al., 2001\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n29:207-209; Lefranc et al., 2003\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n31:307-310), and VBASE.\n\n\nAs is well known in the art, immunoglobulins possess a high degree of sequence and structural homology, and therefore alignment of sequences provides a wealth of information. Due to the existence of deletions and insertions in these alignments, numbering conventions have been adopted to enable a normalized reference to conserved positions in immunoglobulin families or subfamilies. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these conventions consist of nonsequential numbering in specific regions of an immunoglobulin sequence, and thus accordingly the positions of any given immunoglobulin as defined by any given numbering scheme will not necessarily correspond to its sequential sequence or to those in an alternate numbering scheme. For all variable regions discussed in the present invention, numbering is according to the numbering scheme of Kabat (Kabat et al., 1991\n, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5th Ed., United States Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). For all constant region positions discussed in the present invention, number is according to the EU index as in Kabat. Alternate numbering schemes may find use in the present invention, including but not limited that of Chothia (Chothia & Lesk, 1987\n, J. Mol. Biol. \n196: 901-917; Chothia et al., 1989\n, Nature \n342: 877-883; Al-Lazikani et al., 1997\n, J. Mol. Biol. \n273: 927-948).\n\n\nIn a most preferred embodiment, the set of human sequences used is an aligned set of human germline immunoglobulin sequences. For example, \nFIGS. 1\n \na\n-\n1\n \nc \n(SEQ ID NOS: 1-109) provide the set of sequences that compose the human antibody variable region germline (VH, VL, and J chains), along with the corresponding diversity at each position. The human germline repertoire for immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions and immunoglobulin light chain kappa variable regions have been reported (Matsuda et al., 1998\n, J Exp Med \n188: 2151-2162; Zachau, 2000, Biol Chem 381:951-954; Pallares et al., 1999\n, Exp Clin Immunogenet \n16(1): 36-60; Barbie & Lefranc, 1998\n, Exp Clin Immunogenet \n15(3): 171-83). The human immunoglobulin kappa variable (IGKV) genes and joining (IGKJ) segments. Barbie V, Lefranc MP). The rationale for use of this type of sequence information as a metric for humanness is that the strings that compose the human germline should be minimally immunogenic. Sequences need not be human genomic or germline sequences. In other preferred embodiments, human antibody variable region sequences are derived not from germline information, but rather from matured antibodies obtained for example from hybridoma technology or cDNA libraries.\n\n\nFor many of the genes in the human immunoglobulin germline, several different alleles have been identified. Although the polymorphisms detected in many of the alleles do not change the amino acid sequence of the gene, in a great number of cases the sequence is changed. In choosing a set of sequences to use in the method described herein, different sets of sequences may be chosen. When choosing a single allele as representative of a specific gene the most cautious approach is to choose that sequence which is closest to the consensus of the entire germline. This subset of sequences would thereby be most likely to be represented within the population as a whole. Alternatively, a much greater sequence diversity could be sampled by choosing representative sequences that are furthest from the consensus. Another approach yielding greater diversity would be to use multiple alleles where they exist for each germline. At this time, there is little or no quantitative data on allele frequency within the population. When allele frequency becomes available, a more informed decision can be made regarding the likelihood of tolerance for a specific non-consensus allele within the target patient population.\n\n\nWhen two or more possible substitutions are being evaluated for use at a specific position when both are found in the human germline, the decision may become subjective. In such a case additional information can be incorporated that may reflect different levels of expression of particular genes (Cox et al. Eur J. Immunol. 1994 April; 24(4):827-36). One underlying assumption of such a strategy would be that relative expression level of a particular germline (or corresponding sequence strings) correlates with the relative immunogenicity.\n\n\nThe sequences used for the method disclosed herein are those of homologous proteins with sufficient homology to allow their alignment with the protein whose immunogenicity is being reduced. One might argue that if a particular protein sequence is found anywhere within the expressed human genome that there is innate tolerance to that peptide. Such a proposition greatly increases the number of possible sequences that could be used to reduce the immunogenicity of a protein. In such a case however, alignment of proteins that are not structurally homologous would likely be prohibitive. In addition, the processing of a protein to produce the strings to which tolerance is developed may be structurally determined. Therefore, a specific strings may be nonimmunogenic in its native context but immunogenic in an altered structural context.\n\n\nScoring Functions\n\n\nString Content\n\n\nIn order to evaluate the fitness of protein variants, amino acid modifications in the parent protein may be scored using a variety of scoring functions. Central to preferred embodiment of immunogenicity reduction method described herein is that at least one scoring function is aimed at maximizing the content of host linear sequence strings that are present in a set of host sequences. Typically, but not always, a computer is used to score potential amino acid substitutions.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, substitutions may be scored according to their occupancy in the set of host sequences, i.e., whether or not a given amino acid is part of the diversity at a given position. The use of position-specific alignment information to generate a list of considered amino acids at a variable position is well known in the art; see for example Lehmann & Wyss, 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n12(4): 371-5; Lehmann et al., 2000\n, Biochim Biophys Acta \n1543(2):408-415; Rath & Davidson, 2000\n, Protein Sci, \n9(12):2457-69; Lehmann et al., 2000\n, Protein Eng \n13(1):49-57; Desjarlais & Berg, 1993\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n90(6):2256-60; Desjarlais & Berg, 1992\n, Proteins \n12(2):101-4; Henikoff & Henikoff, 2000\n, Adv Protein Chem \n54:73-97; Henikoff & Henikoff, 1994\n, J Mol Biol \n243(4):574-8. Thus, for example, for the parent nonhuman VLκ sequence aligned to the human sequences in \nFIG. 1\n \nb \n(SEQ ID NOS: 54-85), substitutions to be considered at \nposition\n 1 would be Ala, Asp, Glu, Asn, and Val. In a more preferred embodiment, substitutions are scored based on their frequency in the set of human sequences listed. For example, in the previous example, Asp and Glu occur most frequently at \nposition\n 1, and thus may be more preferable substitutions that Ala, Asn, or Val. The basis for this scoring function is that the frequency of a given amino acid at a given position in the alignment is proportional to its potential for being in a host string.\n\n\nOccupancy and frequency provide relatively straightforward approximations for designing substitutions that have the potential for reduced immunogenicity. Their use, however, does not take into account the context of the parent sequence. Although frequency is proportional to the potential for a substitution to increase host content of a string, it is not a direct measure. In order to more accurately incorporate the information present in an aligned set of host sequences into a measure of immunogenicity, an approach can be taken wherein the linearity or contiguity of a given position in the context of the strings that comprise it is considered. In this most preferred embodiment, substitutions in a parent sequence are scored based on the probability of removing a nonhost string and replacing it with a less immunogenic string, namely one present in the set of host sequences. This method of scoring may employ the calculation of identity or percent identity of a parent string to a host string within a window of equivalent positions. In one embodiment, the identity of a string in sequence s to a host string in sequence h, (IDstring), can be presented as the sum of amino acid sequence identities in a given window size, according to equation 1:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIDstring\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \n \ni\n \n,\n \nw\n \n \n)\n \n \n \n=\n \n \n \n∑\n \n \nj\n \n=\n \ni\n \n \n \ni\n \n+\n \nw\n \n-\n \n1\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \nδ\n \n \n \naa\n \nj\n \ns\n \n \n,\n \n \naa\n \nj\n \nh\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEquation\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere w is the string window size, i is the first position in the string, aa\ns\n \nj \nis the amino acid at position j of sequence s, aa\nh\n \nj \nis the amino acid at position j of the host sequence h, and the Kronecker delta function is used to return a value of 1 for a match (for example if the parent and host amino acids at position j are both serine) and 0 if there is no match (for example if the parent amino acid at position j is a serine but the host amino acid is a leucine). \nFIG. 2\n \na \nillustrates \nequation\n 1 using a region of the VH of murine anti-Her2 antibody m4D5 (VH_m4D5) (SEQ ID NO: 110} as the parent sequence s and the homologous region from the VH human germline (VH\n—\n1-2) as human sequence (SEQ ID NO:111)\n\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, it is assumed that the most immunologically appropriate measure of host string content at position i is the maximal identity between a string of sequence s and any host sequence in the alignment, as calculated in equation 2:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nID\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nmax\n \n \n=\n \n \n \nmax\n \n \nh\n \n∈\n \nHS\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n(\n \n \n \n∑\n \n \nj\n \n=\n \ni\n \n \n \ni\n \n+\n \nw\n \n-\n \n1\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \nδ\n \n \n \naa\n \nj\n \ns\n \n \n,\n \n \naa\n \nj\n \nh\n \n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEquation\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere HS is the set of host sequences. In other words, if IDstring at position i is equal to w for any one of the host sequences, IDmax=was well, and the i\nth \nstring is assumed to be minimally immunogenic. The concept of the IDmax quantity represented by \nEquation\n 2 is illustrated in \nFIG. 2\n \nb. \n\n\n\n\nFinally, these equations can be combined to calculate a single numerical metric for total host string content (HSC) of a sequence s by summing the IDmax values over all pertinent sequence positions, as in equation 3:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHSC\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \ns\n \n)\n \n \n \n=\n \n \n \n100\n \n·\n \n \n1\n \n \n \n(\n \n \nL\n \n-\n \nw\n \n+\n \n1\n \n \n)\n \n \n·\n \nw\n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \n∑\n \n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \n \n \nL\n \n-\n \nw\n \n+\n \n1\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nmax\n \n \nh\n \n∈\n \nHS\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n(\n \n \n \n∑\n \n \nj\n \n=\n \ni\n \n \n \ni\n \n+\n \nw\n \n-\n \n1\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \nδ\n \n \n \naa\n \nj\n \ns\n \n \n,\n \n \naa\n \nj\n \nh\n \n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEquation\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere L is the length of the sequence and HS is the set of host sequences in the alignment. A perfectly host sequence would have an HSC of 100. One might alternatively say that such a sequence is 100% host. The concept of the HSC quantity represented by \nEquation\n 3 is illustrated in \nFIG. 2\n \nc\n. In alternative embodiments, \nEquation\n 3 can be modified further such that the final score is dependent on the relative usage of each host sequence in the alignment. Strings from sequences that are more frequently expressed by hosts are expected to be more tolerized, and therefore may be given correspondingly higher influence in a scoring system.\n\n\n\nIn an alternative embodiment, one can measure the exact string content (ESC) as in Equation 3a:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nESC\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \ns\n \n)\n \n \n \n=\n \n \n \n100\n \n·\n \n \n1\n \n \n(\n \n \nL\n \n-\n \nw\n \n+\n \n1\n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \n∑\n \n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \n \n \nL\n \n-\n \nw\n \n+\n \n1\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nmax\n \n \nh\n \n∈\n \nHS\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \nδ\n \n \n \naa\n \n \n \ni\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n…\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \ni\n \n \n+\n \nw\n \n-\n \n1\n \n \ns\n \n \n,\n \n \naa\n \n \n \ni\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n…\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \ni\n \n \n+\n \nw\n \n-\n \n1\n \n \nh\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n,\n \n \n \n \n \nEquation\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n3\n \n⁢\n \na\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere the notation aa\ns\n \ni . . . i+w−1 \nrefers the contiguous sequence string in protein s from position i to position i+w−1. In this embodiment, only perfect matches of size w are counted in the score.\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that, since the scoring systems in \nEquations\n 3 and 3a are based on local sequence identity and/or similarity evaluated over windows of defined size, a sequence with high HSC can be constructed of sequence segments that are maximally similar to different members of the set of host sequences at different positions.\n\n\nThe above measure of hostness is likely to be more immunologically relevant than the more commonly used global identity measure of equation 4:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nglobalID\n \n=\n \n \n \n \n100\n \n·\n \nmax\n \n \n \nh\n \n∈\n \nHS\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n1\n \nL\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \n∑\n \n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \n \nL\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nδ\n \n \n \naa\n \ni\n \ns\n \n \n,\n \n \naa\n \ni\n \nh\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEquation\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nEquation\n 4 disregards the extent of contiguous sequence identity, which is particularly relevant for capturing the molecular behavior of the immune system.\n\n\n\nAdditional scoring functions similar to \nequations\n 3 are also possible. For example, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, there is some uncertainty regarding the hostness of a string wherein IDmax=w−1, w−2, etc. In one alternative embodiment, sequence similarity is compared instead of identity, using any of a variety of amino acid substitution matrices (e.g. PAM, BLOSUM62, etc.), providing a host string similarity (HSS) score as in equation 5:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHSS\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \ns\n \n)\n \n \n \n=\n \n \n \n100\n \n·\n \n \n1\n \n \nL\n \n-\n \nw\n \n+\n \n1\n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \n∑\n \n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \n \n \nL\n \n-\n \nw\n \n+\n \n1\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nmax\n \n \nh\n \n∈\n \nHS\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n(\n \n \nⅇ\n \n \n \n∑\n \n \nj\n \n=\n \ni\n \n \n \ni\n \n+\n \nw\n \n-\n \n1\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n(\n \n \n \nS\n \n \n \naa\n \nj\n \ns\n \n \n,\n \n \naa\n \nj\n \nh\n \n \n \n \n-\n \n \nS\n \n \n \naa\n \nj\n \ns\n \n \n,\n \n \naa\n \nj\n \ns\n \n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEquation\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere S is a substitution score comparing any two amino acids.

For example, perfect matches can be weighted greater than near perfect matches (e.g. f(w)=1, f(w−1)=0.5, etc.), and poor matches can be discarded (e.g. f(w−3)=f(w−2)=0).\n\n\nString Window Size\n\n\n\nThe fundamental binding units of class I and class II MHC proteins are both 9 amino acids. In a preferred embodiment, the window size w used to create and score parent sequences is 9. However, it is also known that additional peptide flanking residues (PFRs) can influence T-cell recognition (via the TCR) of class II MHC-peptide complexes (see for example Arnold et al., 2002\n, J Immunology \n169(2): 739-49), with the residues at positions P−1 (one position before the 1\nst \nMHC binding position) and P11 being most influential. Because these effects might influence immune tolerance, a desirable goal of the invention, larger window sizes (e.g. 12) can be used. It should be noted however, that sequences optimized with similar window sizes are highly correlated.\n\n\nOptimization of HSC\n\n\nAlthough a definition of string scoring systems is useful, an efficient process for discovering sequences with high HSC is also desirable. It is therefore a further aspect of the invention to provide methods for dynamic optimization of HSC given the described scoring systems.\n\n\nDesirable features of an optimization method include but are not limited to the following: 1) the output sequences are optimal or near-optimal (subject to design constraints) in their host string content; 2) structural constraints can be used to modulate the nature of the optimized sequences; and 3) multiple near-optimal solutions can be generated. Additionally, in some preferred embodiments, host string content may be maximized using a minimal number of substitutions.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, an iterative algorithm for optimization of HSC works as follows. 1) a parent sequence and set of host sequences are defined; 2) mutational constraints are defined at functionally or structurally important positions, referred to herein as masking—in a preferred embodiment, for antibody applications, positions within or structurally proximal to CDR residue (as defined by herein, or alternatively as defined by Kabat or Chothia) and/or interface are masked, locked, or fixed so that mutations are not possible (in some embodiments this constraint can be relaxed if the potential mutation is a conservative substitution of the parent amino acid). In a preferred embodiment, positions within 5 angstroms of a CDR residue or interface are masked. In other preferred embodiments, positions within 6.5 angstroms of a CDR residue or interface are masked; 3) host sequence segments (up to a defined length: lengths from 1-6 are typical) are collected from the alignment and stored for each position: segments that violate the mutational constraints are not collected; 4) each segment is analyzed for its potential impact on HSC, in the context of the current parent sequence, defined as String Impact (SI) in equation 7:\n\n\nSI(\nx\n \nm\n(\nz\n)→\ny\n \nm\n(\nz\n))=HSC(\ns\n(\ny\n \nm\n))−HSC(parent),  \nEquation\n 7\n\n\nwhere y\nm\n(z) is a host segment of length z replacing segment x at position m, and s(y\nm\n) and parent are versions of the parent sequence that include these segments (the parent sequence contains X\nm\n(z)). 5) a single string is randomly selected from all stored host strings; the probability of selection is biased and proportional to the impact on HSC and inversely proportional to the number of mutations relative to the current parent sequence, as in Equation 8:\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nP\n \n∝\n \n \n \nSI\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \n \n \n \nx\n \nm\n \n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \nz\n \n)\n \n \n \n→\n \n \n \ny\n \nm\n \n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \nz\n \n)\n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n∑\n \n \ni\n \n=\n \nm\n \n \n \nm\n \n+\n \nz\n \n-\n \n1\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \nδ\n \n \n \naa\n \ni\n \nparent\n \n \n,\n \n \naa\n \ni\n \n \ns\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \n \ny\n \nm\n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEquation\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThis selected string is substituted into the current parent sequence for its corresponding parent amino acids on an amino acid string by amino acid string basis. This kind of selection bias tends to optimize host string content with minimal perturbation of the original sequence. 6) steps 4 and 5 are repeated until no further optimization is possible (no segment substitutions have a favorable impact on host string content).\n\n\n\nSuch an algorithm is inherently non-deterministic, so independent runs of the algorithm will tend to generate different solutions (this is a favorable feature). In a preferred embodiment, such an algorithm is applied numerous times to generate a diverse array of unique solutions. These solutions can be further clustered such that representative sequences can be prioritized for further analysis. For example, in one embodiment, the solution sequences are clustered into groups of similar sequences according to mutational distance, using a nearest neighbor single linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm to assign sequences to related groups based on similarity scores. Clustering algorithms may be useful for classifying sequences into representative groups. Representative groups may be defined, for example, by similarity. Measures of similarity include, but are not limited to sequence similarity and energetic similarity. Thus the output sequences from computational screening may be clustered around local minima, referred to herein as clustered sets of sequences. Sets of sequences that are close in sequence space may be distinguished from other sets. In one embodiment, diversity across clustered sets of sequences may be sampled by experimentally testing only a subset of sequences within each clustered set. For example, all or most of the clustered sets could be broadly sampled by including the lowest energy sequence from each clustered set of sequences to be experimentally tested. Because the sequence space of solutions with optimized HSC can be large, additional methods can be applied to ensure that a broad set of sequences is created. In a preferred embodiment, individual framework sequences generated by the procedure are clustered separately to generate a list of nonredundant basis framework regions (FRs) with high HSC. These basis FRs are then computationally assembled in all combinations along with the CDRs to generate a secondary list of solution sequences (which will usually have some overlap with the primary set). Alternatively, the basis FRs may be combined into an experimental library, for example a combinatorial library.\n\n\nFramework Diversity\n\n\nApplication of this algorithm will generate variant protein solutions for which HSC is higher than the original parent sequence. It will also frequently generated solutions in which substituted strings are derived from different members of the alignment. The variant sequences derived using the present invention generally have unique properties relative to sequences generated using other methodologies. For example, in the context of an antibody, the protein variants of the invention frequently derive their host string content from a combination of different host germline sequences. This may be true even within a single FR. Quantification of these properties is useful for defining the nature of sequences derived using the present invention. A clear distinction emerges from a comparison of exact string content (meaning a perfect match over window w) in any single germline sequence versus exact w-mer string content within the set of all germline sequences (content of strings for which IDmax=w). Single germline exact string content (SGESC) of a variant sequence v may thus be defined as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSGESC\n\n\n⁡\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nv\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n·\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n-\n\n\n \nw\n \n \n\n\n+\n \n \n \n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\n∈\n\n\nHS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n∑\n\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n-\n\n\nw\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\nδ\n\n\n\n\n\n\naa\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n…\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nw\n\n\n-\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\naa\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n…\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nw\n\n\n-\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis quantity provides the extent to which a string-optimized sequence has string identity with the closest single germline sequence. Using this definition, it is also possible to assess the extent to which the high host string content of a given variant sequence v is derived from a single germline as opposed to multiple germline sequences.

It should be noted that a similar or identical quantity can be defined for non-antibody proteins. Alternatively, as is the case with many of the variant sequences created by the present invention, FRH values can be significantly less than 1, with values ranging from 0.4 to 1.0, indicating, as expected, that sequences with high exact string content can be discovered with contributions from multiple germline subfamilies and sequences. As described more fully in Example 5 below, variant sequences generated using the present invention have high HSC values yet many have low FRH values, indicating their HSC is derived from multiple germline frameworks.\n\n\nAdditional Scoring\n\n\nThe above methods of scoring use the information present in an aligned set of host sequences as a metric of immunogenicity to maximize the content of host linear sequence strings in a parent sequence. In addition to such scoring functions, other scoring functions and methods may be employed. Such additional scoring functions may be aimed at the same goal as the aforementioned linear string scoring function, namely immunogenicity reduction of the parent protein. Alternatively, such additional scoring functions may be used to achieve other goals, for example optimization of protein stability, solubility, expression, pharmacokinetics, and/or aspects of protein function such as affinity of the parent protein for a target ligand, specificity, effector function, and/or enzymatic activity. For example an additional scoring function may be employed to enhance the affinity of an antibody variable domain for its target antigen. Such additional scoring functions may be employed statically or dynamically for the generation of optimized protein variants. A number of embodiments are described below as preferred additional scoring functions that may be used with the aforementioned linear string scoring method of the present invention. However, these are not meant to constrain the invention to these embodiments, and it should be clear that any method of scoring the fitness of an amino acid modification in a parent protein may be coupled with the novel linear string scoring method of the present invention so that optimal protein variants may be designed.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, substitutions are scored based on their structural compatibility with the structure of the parent protein. Such methods of scoring may require the structural coordinates that describe the three-dimensional structure of the protein, for example as obtained by X-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. Suitable proteins structures may also be obtained from structural models, which may be generated by methods that are known in the art of structural biology, including but not limited to de novo and homology modeling. Structure-based scoring functions may include any number of potentials that describe or approximate physical or chemical energy terms, including but not limited to a van der Waals potential, a hydrogen bond potential, an atomic solvation potential or other solvation models, a secondary structure propensity potential, an electrostatic potential, a torsional potential, an entropy potential, and/or additional energy terms. In other preferred embodiments, scoring methods may also be derived from sequence information, including but not limited to knowledge-based potentials derived from protein sequence and/or structure statistics, threading potentials, reference energies, pseudo energies, homology-based energies, and sequence biases derived from sequence alignments. In alternately preferred embodiments, both structural and sequence-based potentials are used to generate one or more scoring functions that may be coupled with the linear string scoring method of the present invention.\n\n\nIn a most preferred embodiment, a scoring method is used wherein the structural and functional integrity of substitutions are evaluated using a sequence and structure-based scoring function described in U.S. Ser. No. 60/528,229, filed Dec. 8, 2003, entitled Protein Engineering with Analogous Contact Environments; and U.S. Ser. No. 60/602,566, filed Aug. 17, 2004, entitled Protein Engineering with Analogous Contact Environments. This method combines sequence alignment information and structural information to predict the structural compatibility of one or more substitutions with a protein structure template. Nearest neighbor structure-based scores generated by this method include Structural Consensus and Structural Precedence as provided in the Examples. This method is particularly well suited for application to evaluating the structural fitness of immunoglobulins due to their substantial sequence and structural homology.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, substitutions are scored using a scoring function or computational design program that is substantially similar to Protein Design Automation® (PDA®) technology, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,188,965; U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,312; U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312; U.S. Pat. No. 6,708,120; U.S. Pat. No. 6,804,611; U.S. Pat. No. 6,792,356; U.S. Ser. No. 09/782,004; U.S. Ser.

No. 10/888,748; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 99/24229; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. In another preferred embodiment, a computational design method substantially similar to Sequence Prediction Algorithm™ (SPA™) technology is used, as is described in (Raha et al., 2000\n, Protein Sci. \n9: 1106-1119), U.S. Ser. No. 09/877,695, and U.S. Ser. No. 10/071,859. In another preferred embodiment, the computational methods described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/339,788, are used.\n\n\nIn another preferred embodiment, optimized sequences are also assessed for surface similarity with host antibodies. Ensuring similarity may be important for reducing the probability of introducing novel 3D epitopes, which are potentially recognized by B-cell receptors. In a preferred embodiment, surface similarity at position i is quantified as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsurfscore\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \ni\n \n)\n \n \n \n=\n \n \n \nmax\n \n \nk\n \n∈\n \nHS\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \nⅇ\n \n \n \nf\n \ni\n \nexp\n \n \n·\n \n \n \n(\n \n \n \n(\n \n \n \n∑\n \n \nj\n \n=\n \n1\n \n \nL\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nproximity\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \n \ni\n \n,\n \nj\n \n \n)\n \n \n \n*\n \n \nS\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \n \n \naa\n \nj\n \ns\n \n \n,\n \n \naa\n \nj\n \nk\n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n-\n \n \n(\n \n \n \n∑\n \n \nj\n \n=\n \n1\n \n \nL\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nproximity\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \n \ni\n \n,\n \nj\n \n \n)\n \n \n \n*\n \n \nS\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \n \n \naa\n \nj\n \ns\n \n \n,\n \n \naa\n \nj\n \ns\n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n)\n \n \n/\n \nT\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEquation\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n11\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere f\ni\n \nexp \nis the fraction accessibility of position i to solvent, proximity (i,j) is the spatial proximity of positions i and j in the three-dimensional structure of the protein, S is a measure of amino acid similarity, and T is a temperature factor used to tune the stringency of the similarity comparison. It will be appreciated from the equation that if sequences are identical in the region of position i, a surfscore of 1.0 will be approached. Alternatively, a score of 1.0 can also be achieved if a position is completely buried (i.e. f\ni\n \nexp\n=0), since the position would not be accessible to B-cell receptors. Lower scores represent surface positions for which there are significant differences between the variant sequence and the most similar host sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the proximity between two positions is inversely related to their distance (e.g. a Gaussian or exponential function of the distance), and the proximity of a position to itself is 1.0. In a preferred embodiment, the decay of the proximity function is tuned such that patches of positions correspond to the size of a typical antibody epitope.\n\n\n\nOther surface properties may also be desirable. For example, optimized variant sequences may be assessed for the exposure of nonpolar amino acids, which is generally expected to decrease solubility. In such cases, variant sequences with lower nonpolar exposure can be prioritized over alternatives. Surface electrostatic properties may also be assessed for variant sequences. In a preferred embodiment, surface properties are assessed for multiple variants with optimized HSC, in order to limit the set of variants that will be experimentally screened.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, substitution matrices or other knowledge-based scoring methods are used to identify alternate sequences that are likely to retain the structure and function of the protein. Such scoring methods can be used to quantify how conservative a given substitution or set of substitutions is. In most cases, conservative mutations do not significantly disrupt the structure and function of proteins (see for example, Bowie et. al., 1990\n, Science \n247: 1306-1310, Bowie & Sauer, 1989\n, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA \n86: 2152-2156, and Reidhaar-Olson & Sauer, 1990\n, Proteins \n7: 306-316). However, non-conservative mutations can destabilize protein structure and reduce activity (see for example, Lim et al., 1992\n, Biochem. \n31: 4324-4333). Substitution matrices including but not limited to BLOSUM62 provide a quantitative measure of the compatibility between a sequence and a target structure, which can be used to predict non-disruptive substitution mutations (Topham et al., 1997\n, Prot. Eng. \n10: 7-21). The use of substitution matrices to design peptides with improved properties has been disclosed (Adenot et al., 1999\n, J. Mol. Graph. Model. \n17: 292-309). Substitution matrices include, but are not limited to, the BLOSUM matrices (Henikoff & Henikoff, 1992\n, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA \n89: 10917, the PAM matrices, the Dayhoff matrix, and the like. For a review of substitution matrices, see for example Henikoff, 1996\n, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. \n6: 353-360. It is also possible to construct a substitution matrix based on an alignment of a given protein of interest and its homologs; see for example Henikoff & Henikoff, 1996\n, Comput. Appl. Biosci. \n12: 135-143.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, other methods for scoring immunogenicity may additionally be used. Most preferably, immunogenicity may be scored using a function that considers peptide binding to one or more MHC molecules. For example, substitutions would be scored such that there are no or a minimal number of immune epitopes that are predicted to bind, with high affinity, to any prevalent MHC alleles. These methods of scoring may be useful, for example, for designing substitutions in VH CDR3, for which scoring using human germline strings may be less straightforward. Several methods of identifying MHC-binding epitopes in protein sequences are known in the art and may be used to score epitopes in an antibody. See for example WO 98/52976; WO 02/079232; WO 00/3317; U.S. Ser. No. 09/903,378; U.S. Ser. No. 10/039,170; U.S. Ser. No. 60/222,697; U.S. Ser. No. 10/339,788; PCT WO 01/21823; and PCT WO 02/00165; Mallios, 1999\n, Bioinformatics \n15: 432-439; Mallios, 2001\n, Bioinformatics \n17: 942-948; Sturniolo et al., 1999\n, Nature Biotech. \n17: 555-561; WO 98/59244; WO 02/069232; WO 02/77187; Marshall et al., 1995\n, J. Immunol. \n154: 5927-5933; and Hammer et al., 1994\n, J. Exp. Med. \n180: 2353-2358. Sequence-based information can be used to determine a binding score for a given peptide—MHC interaction (see for example Mallios, 1999\n, Bioinformatics \n15: 432-439; Mallios, 2001\n, Bioinformatics \n17: p 942-948; Sturniolo et. al., 1999\n, Nature Biotech. \n17: 555-561). It is possible to use structure-based methods in which a given peptide is computationally placed in the peptide-binding groove of a given MHC molecule and the interaction energy is determined (for example, see WO 98/59244 and WO 02/069232). Such methods may be referred to as “threading” methods. Alternatively, purely experimental methods can be used; for example a set of overlapping peptides derived from the protein of interest can be experimentally tested for the ability to induce T-cell activation and/or other aspects of an immune response. (see for example WO 02/77187). In a preferred embodiment, MHC-binding propensity scores are calculated for each 9-residue frame along the protein sequence using a matrix method (see Sturniolo et. al., supra; Marshall et. al., 1995\n, J. Immunol. \n154: 5927-5933, and Hammer et. al., 1994\n, J. Exp. Med. \n180: 2353-2358). It is also possible to consider scores for only a subset of these residues, or to consider also the identities of the peptide residues before and after the 9-residue frame of interest. The matrix comprises binding scores for specific amino acids interacting with the peptide binding pockets in different human class II MHC molecule. In the most preferred embodiment, the scores in the matrix are obtained from experimental peptide binding studies. In an alternate preferred embodiment, scores for a given amino acid binding to a given pocket are extrapolated from experimentally characterized alleles to additional alleles with identical or similar residues lining that pocket. Matrices that are produced by extrapolation are referred to as “virtual matrices”.\n\n\nIn alternate embodiments, additional scoring functions are employed that predict reactive sites within a protein, such as deamidation sites, glycosylation sites, oxidation sites, protealytic cleavage sites, and the like.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that the use of combinations of any of the aforementioned scoring functions and/or other scoring functions is contemplated. In one embodiment, this could be accomplished by evaluating the outputs of the results from separate calculations. Alternatively, scoring functions may be combined into one scoring term. This latter strategy enables different scoring terms to be weighted separately, thus providing more control over the relative contributions of the scoring terms, and a greater capacity to tune the scoring function for a desired engineering strategy.\n\n\nAdditional Optimization of Sequences\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, after optimized protein variants have been engineered using the aforementioned scoring functions, additional optimization of protein variants may be carried out. In this way, an optimized protein variant can be thought of as primary variant or template for further optimization, and variants of this primary variant can be thought of as secondary variants. Because variant sequences of the invention are preferably derived from a HSC-increasing procedure in which substitution of structurally important positions is disallowed or discouraged (for example masking), it is likely that additional optimization of HSC is possible if those positions are allowed to vary in a secondary analysis. Optimization of other properties is possible, including but are not limited to protein affinity, expression, specificity, solubility, activity, and effector function. Thus the variant sequences derived in the primary analysis can represent variants for further optimization. In a preferred embodiment, the secondary analysis comprises the steps of 1) string analysis of the template sequence to identify secondary amino acid diversity that will have neutral, positive, or minimal impact on HSC; 2) experimental production of secondary variant sequences using the diversity derived in \nstep\n 1; and 3) experimental screening of secondary variant sequences.\n\n\nFor these purposes, the string impact (SI) of a single substitution at position m from amino acid x to amino acid y can be quantified as in Equation 7 (where segment length z=1). As will be appreciated, the maximum possible string increase (for a single substitution at an internal position) is w and the maximum possible decrease is w.\n\n\nIn a most preferred embodiment, substitutions in a primary variant are chosen as those substitutions that will result in zero or positive string impact, referred to herein as string neutral and string positive substitutions respectively. In other embodiments, substitutions that result in negative string impact, i.e. string negative substitutions, may also be considered for engineering secondary variants. Secondary variants then may be constructed, expressed, and tested experimentally. Secondary substitutions that show favorable properties with respect to antigen affinity, effector function, stability, solubility, expression, and the like, may be combined in subsequent variants to generate a more optimized therapeutic candidate.\n\n\nOptimization of Non-Xenogeneic Proteins\n\n\nIt can be appreciated that the optimization described above is not restricted to immunogenicity reduction of xenogeneic proteins. Evaluation of potential substitutions for string impact provides an excellent strategy for generating substitution diversity for engineering protein variants with optimized properties. A clear advantage of this approach is that it generates protein variants with minimal immunogenicity risk, the importance of which has been discussed extensively and is a primary goal of the present invention. An additional advantage of this approach is that because the sequences being used to evaluate string impact are typically derived from a set of naturally evolved host sequences, variants designed are effectively enriched for stability, solubility, and other favorable properties. The utility of this capability lies in the fact that there are innumerable amino acid modifications that are detrimental or deleterious to proteins. By screening a quality set of variant diversity, the chances are increased that a protein variant of the desired property will be obtained. The capacity of the string impact approach to generate a quality set of variant diversity derives from the greater tolerance to mutation of positions which sample greater diversity, and the greater propensity of amino acids in a set of naturally evolved sequences to be compatible with a homologous protein's structure, stability, solubility, function, and the like.\n\n\nThis string impact approach to variant design may be applied not only to the generation of secondary variants as described above, but may also be used to engineer amino acid modifications in proteins that are presumably already minimally immunogenic. This may include, for example, natural host proteins. Alternatively, and in a preferred embodiment, the string impact strategy may be applied to engineer modifications in an antibody variable region (VH or VL) that is humanized (Clark, 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:397-402), or “fully human” as obtained for example using transgenic mice (Bruggemann et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n8:455-458) or human antibody libraries coupled with selection methods (Griffiths et al., 1998\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n9:102-108). As with optimization of primary variant sequences described above, the string impact analysis described here can be used to identify secondary diversity that will have neutral, positive, or minimal impact on HSC, as well as potentially other favorable properties. Such diversity can then be used to screen for optimized versions of these sequences without increasing the risk of immunogenicity.\n\n\nExperimental Production, Screening, and Testing\n\n\nMethods for production and screening of protein variants are well known in the art. General methods for antibody molecular biology, expression, purification, and screening are described in Antibody Engineering, edited by Duebel & Kontermann, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, 2001; and Hayhurst & Georgiou, 2001\n, Curr Opin Chem Biol \n5:683-689; Maynard & Georgiou, 2000\n, Annu Rev Biomed Eng \n2:339-76. Also see the methods described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/339,788, filed on Mar. 3, 2003, U.S. Ser. No. 10/672,280, filed Sep. 29, 2003, and U.S. Ser. No. 10/822,231, filed Mar. 26, 2004.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the library sequences are used to create nucleic acids that encode the member sequences, and that may then be cloned into host cells, expressed and assayed, if desired. These practices are carried out using well-known procedures, and a variety of methods that may find use in the present invention are described in Molecular Cloning—A Laboratory Manual, 3\nrd \nEd. (Maniatis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 2001), and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley & Sons). The nucleic acids that encode the protein variants of the present invention may be incorporated into an expression vector in order to express the protein. Expression vectors typically comprise a protein operably linked, that is placed in a functional relationship, with control or regulatory sequences, selectable markers, any fusion partners, and/or additional elements. The protein variants of the present invention may be produced by culturing a host cell transformed with nucleic acid, preferably an expression vector, containing nucleic acid encoding the protein variants, under the appropriate conditions to induce or cause expression of the protein. A wide variety of appropriate host cells may be used, including but not limited to mammalian cells, bacteria, insect cells, and yeast. For example, a variety of cell lines that may find use in the present invention are described in the ATCC cell line catalog, available from the American Type Culture Collection. The methods of introducing exogenous nucleic acid into host cells are well known in the art, and will vary with the host cell used.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, protein variants are purified or isolated after expression. Proteins may be isolated or purified in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art. Standard purification methods include chromatographic techniques, electrophoretic, immunological, precipitation, dialysis, filtration, concentration, and chromatofocusing techniques. As is well known in the art, a variety of natural proteins bind antibodies, for example bacterial proteins A, G, and L, and these proteins may find use in the present invention for purification. Purification can often be enabled by a particular fusion partner. For example, proteins may be purified using glutathione resin if a GST fusion is employed, Ni\n+2 \naffinity chromatography if a His-tag is employed, or immobilized anti-flag antibody if a flag-tag is used. For general guidance in suitable purification techniques, see Protein Purification: Principles and Practice, 3\nrd \nEd., Scopes, Springer-Verlag, NY, 1994.\n\n\nProtein variants may be screened using a variety of methods, including but not limited to those that use in vitro assays, in vivo and cell-based assays, and selection technologies. Automation and high-throughput screening technologies may be utilized in the screening procedures. Screening may employ the use of a fusion partner or label, for example an immune label, isotopic label, or small molecule label such as a fluorescent or colorimetric dye.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the functional and/or biophysical properties of protein variants are screened in an in vitro assay. In a preferred embodiment, the protein is screened for functionality, for example its ability to catalyze a reaction or its binding affinity to its target. Binding assays can be carried out using a variety of methods known in the art, including but not limited to FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) and BRET (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer)-based assays, AlphaScreen™ (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay), Scintillation Proximity Assay, ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance, also known as BIACORE®), isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, gel electrophoresis, and chromatography including gel filtration. These and other methods may take advantage of some fusion partner or label. Assays may employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic, fluorescent, luminescent, or isotopic labels. The biophysical properties of proteins, for example stability and solubility, may be screened using a variety of methods known in the art. Protein stability may be determined by measuring the thermodynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states. For example, protein variants of the present invention may be unfolded using chemical denaturant, heat, or pH, and this transition may be monitored using methods including but not limited to circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, absorbance spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry, and proteolysis. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the kinetic parameters of the folding and unfolding transitions may also be monitored using these and other techniques. The solubility and overall structural integrity of a protein variant may be quantitatively or qualitatively determined using a wide range of methods that are known in the art. Methods which may find use in the present invention for characterizing the biophysical properties of protein variants include gel electrophoresis, chromatography such as size exclusion chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, analytical ultra-centrifugation, dynamic light scattering, proteolysis, and cross-linking, turbidity measurement, filter retardation assays, immunological assays, fluorescent dye binding assays, protein-staining assays, microscopy, and detection of aggregates via ELISA or other binding assay. Structural analysis employing X-ray crystallographic techniques and NMR spectroscopy may also find use.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, protein variants are screened using one or more cell-based or in vivo assays. For such assays, purified or unpurified proteins are typically added exogenously such that cells are exposed to individual variants or pools of variants belonging to a library. These assays are typically, but not always, based on the function of the protein; that is, the ability of the protein to bind to its target and mediate some biochemical event, for example effector function, ligand/receptor binding inhibition, apoptosis, and the like. Such assays often involve monitoring the response of cells to the protein, for example cell survival, cell death, change in cellular morphology, or transcriptional activation such as cellular expression of a natural gene or reporter gene. For example, such assays may measure the ability of antibody variants to elicit ADCC, ADCP, or CDC. For some assays additional cells or components, that is in addition to the target cells, may need to be added, for example serum complement, or effector cells such as peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs), NK cells, macrophages, and the like. Such additional cells may be from any organism, preferably humans, mice, rat, rabbit, and monkey. Proteins may cause apoptosis of certain cell lines expressing the target, or they may mediate attack on target cells by immune cells which have been added to the assay. Methods for monitoring cell death or viability are known in the art, and include the use of dyes, immunochemical, cytochemical, and radioactive reagents. For example, caspase staining assays may enable apoptosis to be measured, and uptake or release of radioactive substrates or fluorescent dyes such as alamar blue may enable cell growth or activation to be monitored. In a preferred embodiment, the DELFIA® EuTDA-based cytotoxicity assay (Perkin Elmer, MA) is used. Alternatively, dead or damaged target cells may be monitored by measuring the release of one or more natural intracellular proteins, for example lactate dehydrogenase. Transcriptional activation may also serve as a method for assaying function in cell-based assays. In this case, response may be monitored by assaying for natural genes or proteins which may be upregulated, for example the release of certain interleukins may be measured, or alternatively readout may be via a reporter construct. Cell-based assays may also involve the measure of morphological changes of cells as a response to the presence of a protein. Cell types for such assays may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic, and a variety of cell lines that are known in the art may be employed. Alternatively, cell-based screens are performed using cells that have been transformed or transfected with nucleic acids encoding the variant proteins. That is, protein variants are not added exogenously to the cells. For example, in one embodiment, the cell-based screen utilizes cell surface display. A fusion partner can be employed that enables display of variants on the surface of cells (Witrrup, 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol, \n12:395-399).\n\n\nAs is known in the art, a subset of screening methods are those that select for favorable members of a library. The methods are herein referred to as “selection methods”, and these methods find use in the present invention for screening protein variants. When protein libraries are screened using a selection method, only those members of a library that are favorable, that is which meet some selection criteria, are propagated, isolated, and/or observed. As will be appreciated, because only the most fit variants are observed, such methods enable the screening of libraries that are larger than those screenable by methods that assay the fitness of library members individually. Selection is enabled by any method, technique, or fusion partner that links, covalently or noncovalently, the phenotype of a protein with its genotype, i.e., the function of a protein with the nucleic acid that encodes it. For example the use of phage display as a selection method is enabled by the fusion of library members to the gene III protein. In this way, selection or isolation of protein variants that meet some criteria, for example binding affinity to the protein's target, also selects for or isolates the nucleic acid that encodes it. Once isolated, the gene or genes encoding variants may then be amplified. This process of isolation and amplification, referred to as panning, may be repeated, allowing favorable protein variants in the library to be enriched. Nucleic acid sequencing of the attached nucleic acid ultimately allows for gene identification.\n\n\nA variety of selection methods are known in the art that may find use in the present invention for screening protein libraries. These include but are not limited to phage display (Phage display of peptides and proteins: a laboratory manual, Kay et al., 1996, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1996; Lowman et al., 1991\n, Biochemistry \n30:10832-10838; Smith, 1985\n, Science \n228:1315-1317) and its derivatives such as selective phage infection (Malmborg et al., 1997, J Mol Biol 273:544-551), selectively infective phage (Krebber et al., 1997\n, J Mol Biol \n268:619-630), and delayed infectivity panning (Benhar et al., 2000\n, J Mol Biol \n301:893-904), cell surface display (Witrrup, 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol, \n12:395-399) such as display on bacteria (Georgiou et al., 1997\n, Nat Biotechnol \n15:29-34; Georgiou et al., 1993\n, Trends Biotechnol \n11:6-10; Lee et al., 2000\n, Nat Biotechnol \n18:645-648; Jun et al., 1998\n, Nat Biotechnol \n16:576-80), yeast (Boder & Wittrup, 2000\n, Methods Enzymol \n328:430-44; Boder & Wittrup, 1997\n, Nat Biotechnol \n15:553-557), and mammalian cells (Whitehorn et al., 1995\n, Bio/technology \n13:1215-1219), as well as in vitro display technologies (Amstutz et al., 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n12:400-405) such as polysome display (Mattheakis et al., 1994\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n91:9022-9026), ribosome display (Hanes et al., 1997\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n94:4937-4942), mRNA display (Roberts & Szostak, 1997\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n94:12297-12302; Nemoto et al., 1997\n, FEBS Lett \n414:405-408), and ribosome-inactivation display system (Zhou et al., 2002\n, J Am Chem Soc \n124, 538-543).\n\n\nOther selection methods that may find use in the present invention include methods that do not rely on display, such as in vivo methods including but not limited to periplasmic expression and cytometric screening (Chen et al., 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19:537-542), the protein fragment complementation assay (Johnsson & Varshaysky, 1994\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n91:10340-10344; Pelletier et al., 1998\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95:12141-12146), and the yeast two hybrid screen (Fields & Song, 1989\n, Nature \n340:245-246) used in selection mode (Visintin et al., 1999\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n96:11723-11728). In an alternate embodiment, selection is enabled by a fusion partner that binds to a specific sequence on the expression vector, thus linking covalently or noncovalently the fusion partner and associated variant library member with the nucleic acid that encodes them. For example, U.S. Ser. No. 09/642,574; U.S. Ser. No. 10/080,376; U.S. Ser. No. 09/792,630; U.S. Ser. No. 10/023,208; U.S. Ser. No. 09/792,626; U.S. Ser. No. 10/082,671; U.S. Ser. No. 09/953,351; U.S. Ser. No. 10/097,100; U.S. Ser. No. 60/366,658; PCT WO 00/22906; PCT WO 01/49058; PCT WO 02/04852; PCT WO 02/04853; PCT WO 02/08023; PCT WO 01/28702; and PCT WO 02/07466 describe such a fusion partner and technique that may find use in the present invention. In an alternative embodiment, in vivo selection can occur if expression of the protein imparts some growth, reproduction, or survival advantage to the cell.\n\n\nA subset of selection methods referred to as “directed evolution” methods are those that include the mating or breading of favorable sequences during selection, sometimes with the incorporation of new mutations. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, directed evolution methods can facilitate identification of the most favorable sequences in a library, and can increase the diversity of sequences that are screened. A variety of directed evolution methods are known in the art that may find use in the present invention for screening protein variants, including but not limited to DNA shuffling (PCT WO 00/42561 A3; PCT WO 01/70947 A3), exon shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 6,365,377; Kolkman & Stemmer, 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19:423-428), family shuffling (Crameri et al., 1998, \nNature \n391:288-291; U.S. Pat. No. 6,376,246), RACHITT™ (Coco et al., 2001, \nNat Biotechnol \n19:354-359; PCT WO 02/06469), STEP and random priming of in vitro recombination (Zhao et al., 1998, \nNat Biotechnol \n16:258-261; Shao et al., 1998, \nNucleic Acids Res \n26:681-683), exonuclease mediated gene assembly (U.S. Pat. No. 6,352,842; U.S. Pat. No. 6,361,974), Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis™ (U.S. Pat. No. 6,358,709), Gene Reassembly™ (U.S. Pat. No. 6,358,709), SCRATCHY (Lutz et al., 2001\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n98:11248-11253), DNA fragmentation methods (Kikuchi et al., \nGene \n236:159-167), single-stranded DNA shuffling (Kikuchi et al., 2000\n, Gene \n243:133-137), and AMEsystem™ directed evolution protein engineering technology (Applied Molecular Evolution) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,514; U.S. Pat. No. 5,817,483; U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,476; U.S. Pat. No. 5,763,192; U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,323).\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the immunogenicity of the protein variants is determined experimentally to confirm that the variants do have reduced or eliminated immunogenicity relative to the parent protein. Several methods can be used for experimental confirmation of epitopes. In a preferred embodiment, ex vivo T-cell activation assays are used to experimentally quantitate immunogenicity. In this method, antigen presenting cells and naïve T cells from matched donors are challenged with a peptide or whole protein of interest one or more times. Then, T cell activation can be detected using a number of methods, for example by monitoring production of cytokines or measuring uptake of tritiated thymidine. In the most preferred embodiment, interferon gamma production is monitored using Elispot assays (Schmittel et. al., 2000, \nJ. Immunol. Meth., \n24: 17-24). If sera are available from patients who have raised an immune response to protein, it is possible to detect mature T cells that respond to specific epitopes. In a preferred embodiment, interferon gamma or IL-5 production by activated T-cells is monitored using Elispot assays, although it is also possible to use other indicators of T cell activation or proliferation such as tritiated thymidine incorporation or production of other cytokines. Other suitable T cell assays include those disclosed in Meidenbauer et al., 2000\n, \nProstate\n \n43, 88-100; Schultes & Whiteside, 2003\n, J. Immunol. Methods \n279, 1-15; and Stickler et al., 200\n, J. Immunotherapy, \n23, 654-660. In a preferred embodiment, the PBMC donors used for the above-described T cell activation assays will comprise class II MHC alleles that are common in patients requiring treatment for protein responsive disorders. For example, for most diseases and disorders, it is desirable to test donors comprising all of the alleles that are prevalent in the population. However, for diseases or disorders that are linked with specific MHC alleles, it may be more appropriate to focus screening on alleles that confer susceptibility to protein responsive disorders. In a preferred embodiment, the MHC haplotype of PBMC donors or patients that raise an immune response to the wild type or protein variant are compared with the MHC haplotype of patients who do not raise a response. This data may be used to guide preclinical and clinical studies as well as aiding in identification of patients who will be especially likely to respond favorably or unfavorably to the protein therapeutic.\n\n\nIn an alternate preferred embodiment, immunogenicity is measured in transgenic mouse systems. For example, mice expressing fully or partially human class II MHC molecules may be used. In an alternate embodiment, immunogenicity is tested by administering the protein variants to one or more animals, including rodents and primates, and monitoring for antibody formation. Nonhuman primates with defined MHC haplotypes may be especially useful, as the sequences and hence peptide binding specificities of the MHC molecules in nonhuman primates may be very similar to the sequences and peptide binding specificities of humans. Similarly, genetically engineered mouse models expressing human MHC peptide-binding domains may be used (see for example Sonderstrup et al., 1999\n, Immunol. Rev. \n172: 335-343; and Forsthuber et al., 2001, \nJ. Immunol. \n167: 119-125).\n\n\nThe biological properties of the proteins of the present invention may be characterized in cell, tissue, and whole organism experiments. As is known in the art, drugs are often tested in animals, including but not limited to mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, pigs, and monkeys, in order to measure a drug's efficacy for treatment against a disease or disease model, or to measure a drug's pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and other properties. The animals may be referred to as disease models. Therapeutics are often tested in mice, including but not limited to nude mice, SCID mice, xenograft mice, and transgenic mice (including knockins and knockouts). Such experimentation may provide meaningful data for determination of the potential of the protein to be used as a therapeutic. Any organism, preferably mammals, may be used for testing. For example because of their genetic similarity to humans, monkeys can be suitable therapeutic models, and thus may be used to test the efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, or other property of the proteins of the present invention. Tests of the in humans are ultimately required for approval as drugs, and thus of course these experiments are contemplated. Thus the proteins of the present invention may be tested in humans to determine their therapeutic efficacy, toxicity, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and/or other clinical properties.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, a variant antibody for a host as compared to a parent antibody includes two or more amino acid substitutions derived from two or more natural antibodies. In this embodiment, a first resultant variant string in the variant antibody is rendered most homologous to a first natural antibody, a second resultant variant string in the variant antibody is rendered most homologous to the corresponding string in an second natural antibody, the substitutions are not in a CDR, and at least one resultant string is not a consensus of homologous natural sequences.

If an additional embodiment, the variant antibody includes at least one substitution that is made at a position that is not surface exposed, the first, second and third natural antibodies are from different antibody groups, one of the substitutions is made at a position that is part of the VH/VL interface, and at least one amino acid substitution is not a back mutation.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the first, second and third natural antibodies are from different antibody groups.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the variant antibody includes at least one substitution that is not surface exposed.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, at least one of the substitutions is made at a position that is part of the VH/VL interface.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the variant antibody includes at least one amino acid substitution is not a back mutation.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, a variant antibody for a host as compared to a parent antibody includes a variant VH antibody region with host string content (HSC) greater than about 75%, and a framework region homogeneity (FRH) less than about 60%, wherein the HSC and FRH are calculated with a window size of 9.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, a variant antibody for a host as compared to a parent antibody includes a variant VH antibody region with exact string content greater than about 20%; and a framework region homogeneity less than about 60%, wherein the HSC and FRH are calculated with a window size of 9.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, a variant antibody for a host as compared to a parent antibody includes a variant VL antibody region with exact string content greater than about 35%, and a framework region homogeneity less than about 60%, wherein HSC and FRH are calculated with a window size of 9.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, a variant antibody for a host as compared to a parent antibody includes a first set of one or more amino acid substitutions from a first natural antibody and a second set of one or more amino acid substitutions from a second natural antibody, wherein the identity of said substituted amino acids from said second antibody differ from the corresponding amino acids of said first natural antibody, the substitutions are not in a CDR, and at least one substitution is not a consensus of homologous natural sequences. In an additional embodiment, the variant antibody further includes a third set of one or more amino acids substitutions from a third natural antibody wherein the identity of the substituted amino acids of said third set differ from the identity the corresponding amino acids from said first and second sets of amino acid substitutions. In a further embodiment, the variant antibody includes a fourth set of one or more amino acids from a fourth natural antibody wherein the identity of the substituted amino acids of said fourth set differ from the identity the corresponding amino acids from said first, second and third sets of amino acid substitutions. In other embodiments, the variant antibody includes multiple sets of one or more amino acids from multiple natural antibodies, wherein the identity of the substituted amino acids of any set differ from the identity the corresponding amino acids from the other sets of amino acid substitutions.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExamples are provided below to illustrate the present invention. These examples are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation.\n\n\nFor reference to immunoglobulin variable regions, positions are numbered according to the Kabat numbering scheme. For reference to immunoglobulin constant regions, positions are numbered according to the EU index as in Kabat (Kabat et al., 1991, \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5th Ed., United States Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda).\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nImmunogenicity Reduction of AC10\n\n\nTo illustrate application of the method described in the present invention, and to validate its broad applicability to immunogenicity reduction of proteins, a xenogeneic antibody example is provided using as the parent sequence the anti-CD30 antibody AC10 (Bowen et al. Journal of Immunology, 1993, 151: 5896). A structural model of the mouse AC10 variable region was constructed using standard antibody modeling methods known in the art. \nFIGS. 3 and 4\n show the sequences (SEQ ID NOS: 118 and 1190, host string content, and structures of the AC10 VL and VH domains (referred to as L0 AC10 VL and H0 AC10 VH respectively). A CDR graft of this antibody was constructed by placing the AC10 CDRs into the context of the frameworks of the most homologous host germlines, determined to be vlk\n—\n4-1 for VL and vh\n—\n1-3 for VH using the sequence alignment program BLAST. The sequences (SEQ ID NOS: 120 and 121) and string content of these CDR grafts are shown in \nFIGS. 5 and 6\n, along with structures of modeled AC10 highlighting the mutational differences between the CDR grafted AC10 variable chains and WT.\n\n\nAC10 variants with reduced immunogenicity were generated by applying a string optimization algorithm on the WT AC10 VL and VH sequences. This algorithm heuristically samples multiple amino acid mutations that exist in the diversity of the human VLκ and VH germline sequences, and calculates the host string content (HSC) of each sequence according to \nEquation\n 3 described above, using a window size w=9. In this set of calculations, residues in the CDRs and close to a CDR or to the VL/VH interface were masked, that is were not allowed to mutate. CDRs were defined as a slightly smaller set of residues than the CDRs defined by Chothia (Chothia & Lesk, 1987\n, J. Mol. Biol. \n196: 901-917; Chothia et al., 1989, \nNature \n342: 877-883; Al-Lazikani et al., 1997, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n273: 927-948). For the purposes of the present invention, VL CDRs are herein defined to include residues at positions 27-32 (CDR1), 50-56 (CDR2), and 91-97 (CDR3), wherein the numbering is according to Chothia. Because the VL CDRs as defined by Chothia and Kabat are identical, the numbering of these VL CDR positions is also according to Kabat. For the purposes of the present invention, VH CDRs are herein defined to include residues at positions 27-33 (CDR1), 52-56 (CDR2), and 95-102 (CDR3), wherein the numbering is according to Chothia. These VH CDR positions correspond to Kabat positions 27-35 (CDR1), 52-56 (CDR2), and 95-102 (CDR3). Masked residues in these calculations were set at positions 1-4, 25-34, 36, 38, 43, 44, 46, 48-58, 60, 63-69, 71, 87, and 89-98 for VL, and 2, 4, 24, 26-35, 37, 39, 44, 45, 47, 50-58, 60, 61, 71, 73, 76, 78, 91, and 93-106 for VH, wherein the numbering is according to Kabat. Masking of potentially critical residues is a conservative approach to generating more host antibody variants, however it is but one embodiment of the present invention, and calculations wherein positions are not masked are also contemplated. This calculation was run for AC10 VL and VH in 100 separate interactions, generating a set of diverse AC10 variants with more host string content than WT. \nFIG. 7\n shows the clustered nonredundant set of output sequences from these calculations for the AC10 VL and VH region (SEQ ID NOS:122-217), referred to as AC10 \nVL HSC Calculation\n 1 and AC10 \nVH HSC Calculation\n 1 respecitvely. For each iteration (Iter), the HSC (Equation 3), HSS (Equation 5), and number (Mut) and identity (shaded residues) of mutations from WT are presented. In addition to the HSC score, each sequence was evaluated for its structural and functional integrity using a nearest neighbor structure-based scoring method (U.S. Ser. No. 60/528,229, filed Dec. 8, 2003, entitled Protein Engineering with Analogous Contact Environments). Two measures of structural fitness, referred to as “Structural Consensus” and “Structural Precedence”, are also provided in the \nFIG. 7\n. Although the Analogous Contact Environments method is particularly well-suited for antibodies because of the wealth of sequence and structure information, any structure-based and/or sequence-based scoring method may be used to evaluate the structural and functional fitness of the variant sequences. The output sequences were clustered based on their mutational distance from the other sequences in the set, and these clusters are delineated by the horizontal black lines in the Figure. The “Cluster” column provides the quantitative mutational distance between each sequence and the rest of the sequence in its cluster; sequences with a lower cluster value are more representative of that particular sequence cluster.\n\n\nThese calculations were used to generate a set of AC10 VL and VH variants. In some cases, further substitutions were made to output sequences, using string and structural scores, as well as visual inspection of the modeled AC10 structure, to evaluate fitness. \nFIGS. 8-13\n present the sequences (SEQ ID NOS: 218-223), host string content, and mapped mutational differences on the modeled AC10 structure for each of the AC10 VL and VH variants. \nIteration\n 36 from AC10 \nVL HSC calculation\n 1 served as the precursor for L1 AC10 VL, \niteration\n 37 served as the precursor for L2 AC10 VL, and \niteration\n 3 served as the precursor for L3 AC10 VL. \nIteration\n 15 from AC10 \nVH HSC calculation\n 1 served as the precursor for H1 AC10 HL, \niteration\n 55 served as the precursor for H2 AC10 VH, and \niteration\n 18 served as the precursor for H3 AC10 VH.\n\n\nTables 1 and 2 present the number of mutations from the parent sequence, structural fitness scores, and host string scores for the AC10 VL and VH variants as compared to the WT and CDR grafted AC10 sequences. In addition to the aforementioned structural and host string analysis, each sequence was analyzed for its global homology to the host germline. The maximum identity match to the germline for each string in the sequences was also determined, referred to as N\nID\nmax. This represents the total number of strings in each sequence whose maximum identity to the corresponding strings in the host germline is the indicated value. For w=9, Tables 1 and 2 list N\n9\nmax, N\n8\nmax, N\n7\nmax, and N\n≦6\nmax for each sequence. N\n9\nmax represents the number of strings in the sequence for which 9 of 9 residues match at least one string in the host germline, N\n8\nmax represents the number of strings for which 8 of 9 residues match at least one string in the host germline, N\n7\nmax represents the number of strings for which 7 of 9 residues match at least one string in the host germline, and N≦\n8\nmax represents the number of strings for which 6 or less residues of 9 residues match at least one string in the host germline. This last category (ID≦6) could, for example, be regarded as the number of poorly scoring strings. In addition to the aforementioned structural and host string analysis, each sequence was analyzed for its global homology to the host germline; Tables 1 and 2 present the most homologous human germline sequence for each sequence (Closest Germline) and corresponding identity to that germline (ID to Closest Germline), determined using the sequence alignment program BLAST. Finally, the Framework region homogeneity (FRH) of each variant was evaluated for w=9, and is presented in Tables 1 and 2, providing the extent to which the host string content of each variant is derived from a single germline as opposed to multiple germline sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAC10 VL Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCDR\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWT\n\n\nGraft\n\n\nL1\n\n\n \nL2\n \n \nL3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutations\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n15\n\n\n16\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Consensus\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n0.59\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructuralPrecedence\n\n\n0.68\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n0.66\n\n\n0.67\n\n\n0.58\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman StringContent\n\n\n0.78\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n0.86\n\n\n0.86\n\n\n0.85\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman String\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n0.48\n\n\n0.46\n\n\n0.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFramework Region\n\n\n0.60\n\n\n0.97\n\n\n0.73\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n0.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomogeneity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n9\nmax\n\n\n15\n\n\n61\n\n\n51\n\n\n48\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n8\nmax\n\n\n27\n\n\n11\n\n\n13\n\n\n15\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n7\nmax\n\n\n31\n\n\n15\n\n\n21\n\n\n22\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n≦6\nmax\n\n\n34\n\n\n20\n\n\n22\n\n\n22\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosest Germline\n\n\n4-1\n\n\n4-1\n\n\n3-11\n\n\n1-39\n\n\n4-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID to Closest\n\n\n68/101\n\n\n86/101\n\n\n78/99\n\n\n80/99\n\n\n75/101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGermline\n \n\n\n67%\n\n\n85%\n\n\n79%\n\n\n81%\n\n\n74%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAC10 VH Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCDR\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWT\n\n\nGraft\n\n\nH1\n\n\n \nH2\n \n \nH3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutations\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n26\n\n\n16\n\n\n23\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Consensus\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n0.48\n\n\n0.48\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Precedence\n\n\n0.63\n\n\n0.67\n\n\n0.63\n\n\n0.59\n\n\n0.59\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman String Content\n\n\n0.69\n\n\n0.87\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n0.80\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman String\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n0.68\n\n\n0.41\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n0.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFramework Region\n\n\n0.60\n\n\n0.86\n\n\n0.65\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomogeneity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n9\nmax\n\n\n5\n\n\n81\n\n\n48\n\n\n45\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n8\nmax\n\n\n31\n\n\n13\n\n\n30\n\n\n32\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n7\nmax\n\n\n34\n\n\n8\n\n\n20\n\n\n21\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n≦6\nmax\n\n\n49\n\n\n17\n\n\n21\n\n\n21\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosest Germline\n\n\n1-3\n\n\n1-3\n\n\n1-3\n\n\n1-3\n\n\n7-4-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID to Closest\n\n\n69/98\n\n\n93/98\n\n\n83/98\n\n\n72/98\n\n\n76/98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGermline\n \n\n\n70%\n\n\n95%\n\n\n85%\n\n\n73%\n\n\n78%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important observation is that, whereas the CDR grafted antibodies are most homologous to a single human germline sequence (the “acceptor” sequence in humanization terminology), the present invention describes variants that are homologous to different host germline sequences in different regions of the sequence. This is evident from the significant differences in Framework region homogeneity (FRH) scores for the AC10 variants of the present invention and CDR grafted AC10 variants. Furthermore, whereas CDR grafted AC10 VL and VH are most homologous to human germline subfamilies 4 (VL) and 1 (VH) respectively across their entire sequences, a number of the AC10 variants are most homologous to different subfamilies in different frameworks. Additionally, whereas the CDR grafted antibodies are most homologous to a single germline sequence that is also the most homologous sequence to the parent sequence, the present invention presents a set of antibodies for a given antibody that are most homologous to different human germline sequences, which need not be the most homologous germline sequence to WT. For example, Table 1 shows that CDR grafted AC10 VL is most homologous to 4-1, which is also the most homologous human germline to the WT AC10 parent. However L1, L2, and L3 are most homologous to three different human germlines −3-11, 1-39, and 4-1 respectively. Thus the variants of the present invention explore a substantially greater amount of diversity than CDR grafted antibodies. One obvious advantage of this is that the method of the present invention provides a greater chance of success with respect to antigen affinity. The choice of an “acceptor” in humanization methods places a single bet; if the donor CDRs are in fact incompatible with the acceptor FRs, a set of backmutations that regain WT affinity may not exist. In contrast, the method of the present invention enables a greater diversity of sequence and structure space to be sampled in the immunogenicity reduction process, increasing the chances of obtaining a final less immunogenic version with WT affinity or better. An additional advantage of sampling greater sequence diversity is that some sequences may have more optimal properties than others, for example with regard to stability, solubility, and effector function. For example, as disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 60/614,944, and U.S. Ser. No. 60/619,409, filed Oct. 14, 2004, entitled “Immunoglobulin Variants Outside the Fc Region with Optimized Effector Function”, the variable region of an antibody may impact effector functions such as antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\nThe genes for the variable regions of AC10 WT (L0 and H0) and variants (L1, L2, L3, H1, H2, and H3) were constructed using recursive PCR, and subcloned into a the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1Zeo (Invitrogen) comprising the full length light kappa (CLκ) and heavy chain IgG1 constant regions. All sequences were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the sequence. Plasmids containing heavy chain gene (VH-CH1-CH2-CH3) (wild-type or variants) were co-transfected with plasmid containing light chain gene (VL-CLκ) in all combinations (L0/H0, L0/H1, L0/H2, L0/H3, L1/H0, L1/H1, L1/H2, L1/H3, L2/H0, L2/H1, L2/H2, L2/H3, L3/H0, L3/H1, L3/H2, L3/H3) into 293T cells. Here, for example, L2/H3 refers to the L2 AC10 VL paired with H3 AC10 VH. Media were harvested 5 days after transfection, and antibodies were purified from the supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography (Pierce, Catalog #20334).\n\n\nWT and variant antibodies were experimentally tested for their capacity to bind CD30 antigen. Binding affinity to human CD30 by the AC10 WT and variant antibodies was measured using a quantitative and extremely sensitive method, AlphaScreen™ assay. The AlphaScreen™ assay is a bead-based non-radioactive luminescent proximity assay. Laser excitation of a donor bead excites oxygen, which if sufficiently close to the acceptor bead will generate a cascade of chemiluminescent events, ultimately leading to fluorescence emission at 520-620 nm. The AlphaScreen™ assay was applied as a competition assay for screening the antibodies. WT AC10 antibody was biotinylated by standard methods for attachment to streptavidin donor beads (Perkin Elmer). Commercial CD30 was conjugated to digoxigenin (DIG) (Roche Diagnostics) for attachment to anti-DIG acceptor beads (Perkin Elmer). In the absence of competing AC10 variants, WT antibody and CD30 interact and produce a signal at 520-620 nm. Addition of untagged AC10 variant competes with the WT AC10/CD30 interaction, reducing fluorescence quantitatively to enable determination of relative binding affinities. \nFIGS. 14\n \na \nand \n14\n \nb \nshow binding of WT (H0L0) and AC10 variant antibodies to CD30 using the AlphaScreen™ assay. The data were fit to a one site competition model using nonlinear regression, and these fits are represented by the curves in the figure. These fits provide the \ninhibitory concentration\n 50% (IC50) (i.e. the concentration required for 50% inhibition) for each antibody, thus enabling the relative binding affinities relative to WT to be determined. Table 3 provides the IC50's and Fold IC50's relative to WT for fits to these binding curves. The AC10 variants display an array of CD30 binding affinities, with a number of variants binding CD30 with affinity comparable to or better affinity than WT AC10.\n\n\nAntigen affinity of the AC10 variants was also measured using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). SPR allows for the measurement of direct binding rates and affinities of protein-protein interactions, and thus provides an excellent complementary binding assay to the AlphaScreen™ assay. CD30 fused to the Fc region of IgG1 (R&D Systems) was immobilized on a Protein A SPR chip, the surface was blocked with Fc, and WT and variant AC10 antibodies were flowed over the chip at a range of concentrations. The resulting sensorgrams are shown in \nFIG. 15\n. Global Langmuir fits were carried out for the concentrations series using the BiaEvaluation curve fitting software, providing the on-rate constant (ka), off-rate constant (kd), and equilibrium binding constant (KD=kd/ka) for the curves. Table 3 provides the KDs and Fold KDs relative to WT for the SPR data. The excellent agreement between the rank ordering of the variants as determined by SPR and AlphaScreen™ assay support the accuracy of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD30 Binding of AC10 Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAC10\n\n\nSPR\n\n\nSPR\n\n\nAlphaScreen\n\n\nAlphaScreen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariant\n\n\nKD (nM)\n\n\nFold KD\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nFold IC50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2L1\n\n\n9.49\n\n\n0.36\n\n\n55.1\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2L2\n\n\n5.95\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n49.2\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1L2\n\n\n7.55\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n45.3\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1L1\n\n\n5.63\n\n\n0.60\n\n\n27.7\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2L3\n\n\n6.75\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n27.2\n\n\n0.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2L0\n\n\n8.00\n\n\n0.42\n\n\n19.4\n\n\n0.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1L3\n\n\n5.09\n\n\n0.67\n\n\n17.4\n\n\n0.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1L0\n\n\n6.39\n\n\n0.53\n\n\n9.77\n\n\n0.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH0L2\n\n\n3.48\n\n\n0.97\n\n\n7.81\n\n\n0.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH3L2\n\n\n2.86\n\n\n1.19\n\n\n6.57\n\n\n0.48\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH3L0\n\n\n3.08\n\n\n1.10\n\n\n6.18\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH3L1\n\n\n2.44\n\n\n1.39\n\n\n6.09\n\n\n0.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH0L1\n\n\n3.29\n\n\n1.03\n\n\n5.19\n\n\n0.61\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH0L3\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n1.13\n\n\n4.61\n\n\n0.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH0L0\n\n\n3.39\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n3.18\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH3L3\n\n\n2.33\n\n\n1.45\n\n\n1.99\n\n\n1.59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to assessing the antigen affinity and biophysical properties of the variants of the present invention, they may also be tested for effector functions in the context of a full length antibody. One advantage of generating multiple reduced immunogenicity variants of a parent immunoglobulin is that it enables a greater degree of sequence diversity to be sampled, diversity which may provide optimal properties. Some sequences may have more optimal properties than others, for example with regard to effector function. For example, as disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 60/614,944, and U.S. Ser. No. 60/619,409, filed Oct. 14, 2004, entitled “Immunoglobulin Variants Outside the Fc Region with Optimized Effector Function”, the variable region of an antibody may impact effector functions such as antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\nIn order to explore any differences in capacity to mediate effector function, the affinities of the AC10 variants for FcγRIIIa were measured using the AlphaScreen™ assay. The extracellular region of human V158 FcγRIIIa was obtained by PCR from a clone obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC:22630), and the receptor was fused with glutathione S-Transferase (GST) to enable screening. Tagged FcγRIIIa was transfected in 293T cells, and media containing secreted FcγRIIIa were harvested and purified. The AlphaScreen™ assay was applied as a competition assay for screening AC10 variants for binding to FcγRIIIa. Biotinylated WT AC10 antibody was bound to streptavidin donor beads (Perkin Elmer), and GST-fused human V158 FcγRIIIa was bound to anti-GST acceptor beads (Perkin Elmer). The binding data are shown in \nFIGS. 16\n \na \nand \n16\n \nb\n, and the resulting IC50's and Fold IC50's relative to WT are provided in Table 4. FcγRIIIa affinity of the AC10 variants was also measured using SPR. GST-fused human FcγRIIIa (V158 isoform) was immobilized on a chip, and WT and variant AC10 antibodies were flowed over the chip at a range of concentrations. Binding constants were obtained from fitting the data using standard curve-fitting methods.

Human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) were isolated from buffy-coat and used as effector cells, and CD30 positive L540 Hodgkin's lymphoma cells were used as target cells. L540 target cells were seeded at 20,000 per well in 96-well plates and treated with designated antibodies in triplicates starting at 1 μg/ml and in reduced concentrations in ½ log steps. PBMCs isolated using a Ficoll gradient and allotyped as FcγRIIIa 158 V/F were added at 25-fold excess of L540 cells and co-cultured for 4 hrs before processing for LDH activity using the Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (LDH, Roche Diagnostic Corporation, Indianapolis, Ind.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plates were read using a Wallac 1420 Victor\n2\n. \nFIGS. 17\n \na\n-\n17\n \nc \nshow the results. The graphs show that the antibodies differ not only in their EC50, reflecting their relative potency, but also in the maximal level of ADCC attainable by the antibodies at saturating concentrations, reflecting their relative efficacy. These two terms, potency and efficacy, are sometimes used loosely to refer to desired clinical properties. In the current experimental context, however, they are denoted as specific quantities, and therefore are here explicitly defined. By “potency” as used in the current experimental context is meant the EC50 of an EGFR targeting protein. By “efficacy” as used in the current experimental context is meant the maximal possible effector function of an antibody at saturating levels. Differences in capacity to mediate ADCC may be due to differences in antigen affinity, different capacities of the variant variable regions to effect FcγR binding, or both. Regardless, the contribution of an antibody variable region to FcγR binding and effector function may be an important parameter for selecting a clinical candidate. The choice of an antibody clinical candidate based in whole or in part on the impact on effector function of the variable region represents a novel dimension in antibody therapeutics.\n\n\nBased on the CD30 binding, FcγRIIIa binding, and ADCC results, the H3/L3 AC10 variant was chosen as a potential biotherapeutic candidate. Because this antibody is intended for clinical use as an anti-cancer therapeutic, it may be advantageous to optimize its effector function. As previously described, substitutions can be engineered in the constant region of an antibody to provide favorable clinical properties. In a most preferred embodiment, one or more amino acid modifications that provide optimized binding to FcγRs and/or enhanced effector function described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/672,280, PCT US03/30249, and U.S. Ser. No. 10/822,231, and U.S. Ser. No. 60/627,774, filed Nov. 12, 2004 and entitled “Optimized Fc Variants”, are combined with the AC10 variants of the present invention. A number of optimized Fc variants obtained from these studies, including I332E, S239D, V2641/1332E, S239D/1332E, and S239D/A330L/1332E, were constructed in the H0/L0 and H3/L0 AC10 antibodies using quick change mutagenesis (Stratagene). Antibodies were expressed and purified as described above. \nFIGS. 18\n \na \nand \n18\n \nb \nshow the results of the ADCC assay, carried out as described above, comparing WT (H0/L0) and H3/L3 AC10 in combination with the optimized Fc variants. Considerable enhancements in potency and efficacy are observed for the Fc variant antibodies as compared to H0/L0 and H3/L3 AC10.\n\n\nAs described above, because variant sequences of the invention are preferably derived from a HSC-increasing procedure in which substitution of structurally important positions is disallowed (or discouraged), it is likely that additional optimization of HSC is possible if those positions are allowed to vary in a secondary analysis. It is noted that, due to residue masking, mutations in the variants occur distal to the CDRs and VL/VH interface. This is in contrast to CDR grafted antibodies, which have mutations in the parent that are at or near these critical regions and thus have a significantly greater potential for perturbing antigen affinity. This is corroborated by the fact that CDR grafted antibodies typically require backmutations to the donor sequence to regain WT affinity for antigen. Such backmutations are usually made out of structural and immunogenic context with respect to host sequences, and cause dramatic reductions in the host string content of the final variant. In contrast, the variants presented herein are simultaneously optimized for host string and structural fitness within the same context, and no backmutations need be made. Nonetheless, one or more subsequent substitutions may be explored to increase antigen affinity or further improve HSC, for example by mutating residues that were masked in the calculations and/or residues in or close to the CDRs or VL/VH interface. Thus the H3/L3 variant can be thought of as a primary variant or template for further optimization, and variants of H3/L3 can be thought of as secondary variants. In contrast to backmutating as with CDR grafted antibodies, secondary substitutions in the variants of the present invention will comprise forward or neutral mutations with respect to the host germline, and thus are expected to only improve or unaffected HSC. An additional benefit of generating secondary variants is that, by exploring quality structural and string diversity, it is also possible that other properties can be optimized, for example affinity, activity, specificity, solubility, expression level, and effector function.\n\n\nString analysis was carried out on the H3/L3 sequence to design a set of secondary substitutions that have neutral, positive, or minimal impact on HSC, and/or that have significant potential for optimization of antigen affinity and/or effector function. Table 5 provides this set of 70 VL (Table 5a) and 64 VH (Table 5b) single mutations. The H3 column provides the WT H3 amino acid, and the Sub column provides the designed substitution. Positions are numbered according to the Kabat numbering format, with Kabat CDR positions bolded. The provided string impact, defined according to \nEquation\n 7, describes the difference in HSC between the primary variant sequence, here H3/L3, and the secondary variant sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nL3 AC10 Secondary Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPos\n\n\n \n\n\n

H3 variants comprised H3 variant VH chains (H3.1-H3.64) in combination with L3 VL, and L3 variants comprised L3 variant VL chains (L3.1-L3.70) in combination with H3 VH. The AlphaScreen™ assay was used to measure binding of the H3/L3 secondary variants to CD30 and FcγRIIIa (as described earlier), as well as to protein A using biotinylated AC10 bound directly to protein A acceptor beads and streptavidin donor beads. \nFIG. 19\n provides AlphaScreen™ binding curves for binding of select AC10 variants to CD30. The Fold IC50's relative to WT H3/L3 for binding to CD30, FcγRIIIa, and protein A are provided in Table 5. A number of H3/L3 secondary variants provide comparable or improved binding to CD30 antigen relative to the H3/L3 parent, enabling the engineering of additional variants that comprise combinations of these substitutions, which may provide further enhancements in HSC and/or antigen affinity.\n\n\nSecondary substitutions that show favorable properties with respect to antigen affinity, effector function, stability, solubility, expression, and the like, may be combined in subsequent variants to generate a more optimized therapeutic candidate. Two new VL and three new VH variants were designed that comprise combinations of the described secondary substitutions, referred to as L3.71, L3.72, H3.68, H3.69, and H3.70. \nFIGS. 20-24\n present the sequences (SEQ ID NOS: 224-228), host string content, and mapped mutational differences on the modeled AC10 structure for each of these new AC10 VL and VH variants. Table 6 presents the number of mutations from the parent sequence, structural fitness scores, host string scores, and homology scores for these AC10 VL and VH variants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAC10 Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL3.71\n\n\nL3.72\n\n\nH3.68\n\n\nH3.69\n\n\nH3.70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMutations\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n15\n\n\n23\n\n\n27\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Consensus\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n0.46\n\n\n0.46\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Precedence\n\n\n0.54\n\n\n0.52\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman String Content\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n0.87\n\n\n0.80\n\n\n0.83\n\n\n0.84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman String\n\n\n0.52\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFramework Region\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n0.33\n\n\n0.40\n\n\n0.42\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomogeneity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n9\nmax\n\n\n55\n\n\n47\n\n\n46\n\n\n55\n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n8\nmax\n\n\n19\n\n\n24\n\n\n26\n\n\n26\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n7\nmax\n\n\n14\n\n\n17\n\n\n24\n\n\n20\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n≦6\nmax\n\n\n19\n\n\n19\n\n\n23\n\n\n18\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosest Germline\n\n\n4-1\n\n\n4-1\n\n\n7-4-1\n\n\n1-3\n\n\n1-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID to Closest\n\n\n76/101\n\n\n76/101\n\n\n74/98\n\n\n77/98\n\n\n79/98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGermline\n \n\n\n75%\n\n\n75%\n\n\n76%\n\n\n79%\n\n\n81%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the provided AC10 variants antibodies are clinical candidates for anti-cancer therapeutics, it may be advantageous to optimize their effector function. As previously described, substitutions can be engineered in the constant region of an antibody to provide favorable clinical properties. Combinations of the variants of the present invention with Fc modifications that alter effector function are anticipated. In a most preferred embodiment, one or more amino acid modifications that provide optimized binding to FcγRs and/or enhanced effector function described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/672,280, PCT US03/30249, and U.S. Ser. No. 10/822,231, and U.S. Ser. No. 60/627,774, filed Nov. 12, 2004 and entitled “Optimized Fc Variants”, are combined with the AC10 variants of the present invention. The optimal anti-CD30 clinical candidate may comprise amino acid modifications that reduce immunogenicity and enhance effector function relative to a parent anti-CD30 antibody. \nFIGS. 25\n \na\n-\n25\n \nc \n(SEQ ID NOS:229-231) provide the light and heavy chain sequences of AC10 variants that comprise L3.71/H3.70 AC10 as described above, combined with a number of possible variant IgG1 constant regions, comprising one or more modifications at S239, V264, A330, and I332, that provide enhanced effector function.\n\n\nAlthough human IgG1 is the most commonly used constant region for therapeutic antibodies, other embodiments may utilize constant regions or variants thereof of other IgG immunoglobulin chains. Effector functions such as ADCC, ADCP, CDC, and serum half-life differ significantly between the different classes of antibodies, including for example human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, IgA2, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM (Michaelsen et al., 1992, Molecular Immunology, 29(3): 319-326). A number of studies have explored IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 variants in order to investigate the determinants of the effector function differences between them. See for example Canfield & Morrison, 1991, J. Exp. Med. 173: 1483-1491; Chappel et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88(20): 9036-9040; Chappel et al., 1993, Journal of Biological Chemistry 268:25124-25131; Tao et al., 1991, J. Exp. Med. 173: 1025-1028; Tao et al., 1993, J. Exp. Med. 178: 661-667; Redpath et al., 1998, Human Immunology, 59, 720-727. Using methods known in the art, it is possible to determine corresponding or equivalent residues in proteins that have significant sequence or structural homology with each other. By the same token, it is possible to use such methods to engineer amino acid modifications in an antibody or Fc fusion that comprise constant regions from other immunoglobulin classes, for example as described in U.S. Ser. No. 60/621,387 and 60/629,068, to provide optimal properties. As an example, the relatively poor effector function of IgG2 may be improved by replacing key FcγR binding residues with the corresponding amino acids in an IgG with better effector function, for example IgG1. For example, key residue differences between IgG2 and IgG1 with respect to FcγR binding may include P233, V234, A235, −236 (referring to a deletion in IgG2 relative to IgG1), and G327. Thus one or more amino acid modifications in the parent IgG2 wherein one or more of these residues is replaced with the corresponding IgG1 amino acids, P233E, V234L, A235L, −236G (referring to an insertion of a glycine at position 236), and G327A, may provide enhanced effector function. Furthermore, one or more additional amino acid modifications, for example the S239D, V264I, A330L, I332E, or combinations thereof as described above, may provide enhanced FcγR binding and effector function relative to the parent IgG2. \nFIGS. 25\n \na \n(SEQ ID NO:229), \n25\n \nd \n(SEQ ID NO:232), and \n25\n \ne \n(SEQ ID NO:233) illustrate this embodiment, providing the light and heavy chain sequences of AC10 variants that comprise L3.71/H3.70 AC10 combined with a number of possible variant IgG2 constant regions.\n\n\nThe Fc modifications defined in \nFIG. 25\n that provide enhanced effector function are not meant to constrain the invention to only these modifications for effector function optimization. For example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,056, PCT US20041000643, U.S. Ser. No. 10/370,749, and PCT/US2004/005112, the substitutions S298A, S298D, K326E, K326D, E333A, K334A, and P396L provide optimized FcγR binding and/or enhanced ADCC. Furthermore, as disclosed in Idusogie et al., 2001, J. Immunology 166:2571-2572, substitutions K326W, K326Y, and E333S provide enhanced binding to the complement protein C1q and enhanced CDC. As described in Hinton et al., 2004, J. Biol. Chem. 279(8): 6213-6216, substitutions T250Q, T250E, M428L, and M428F provide enhanced binding to FcRn and improved pharmacokinetics. Modifications need not be restricted to the Fc region. It is also possible that the mutational differences in the Fab and hinge regions may provide optimized FcγR and/or C1q binding and/or effector function. For example, as disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 60/614,944, and U.S. Ser. No. 60/619,409, filed Oct. 14, 2004, entitled “Immunoglobulin Variants Outside the Fc Region with Optimized Effector Function”, the Fab and hinge regions of an antibody may impact effector functions such as antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Thus immunoglobulin variants comprising substitutions in the Fc, Fab, and/or hinge regions are contemplated. For example, the antibodies may be combined with one or more substitutions in the VL, CL, VH, CH1, and/or hinge regions. Furthermore, further modifications may be made in non IgG1 immunoglobulins to corresponding amino acids in other immunoglobulin classes to provide more optimal properties, as described in U.S. Ser. No. 60/621,387, filed Oct. 21, 2004, entitled “IgG Immunoglobulin Variants with Optimized Effector Function”. For example, in one embodiment, an IgG2 antibody, similar to the antibody presented in \nFIG. 25\n, may comprise one or more modifications to corresponding amino acids in IgG1 or IgG3 CH1, hinge, CH2, and/or CH3. In another embodiment, an IgG2 antibody, similar to the antibody presented in \nFIG. 25\n, may comprise all of the IgG1 CH1 and hinge substitutions, i.e. said IgG2 variant comprises the entire CH1 domain and hinge of IgG1.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nImmunogenicity Reduction of C225\n\n\nTo illustrate further application of the method described in the present invention, and to validate its broad applicability to immunogenicity reduction of proteins, a second xenogeneic antibody example is provided using the variable region of C225 as the parent sequence (cetuximab, Erbitux®, Imclone®) (U.S. Pat. No. 4,943,533; PCT WO 96/40210). C225 is a murine anti-EGFR antibody, a chimeric version of which is currently approved for the treatment of cancer. A structural model of the murine C225 variable region was constructed using standard antibody modeling methods known in the art. \nFIGS. 26 and 27\n show the sequences (SEQ ID NOS:234- and 235), host string content, and structures of the C225 VL and VH domains. A CDR graft of this antibody was constructed by placing the C225 CDRs into the context of the frameworks of the most homologous human germlines, determined to be vlk\n—\n6D-21 for VL and vh\n—\n4-30-4 for VH using the sequence alignment program BLAST. The sequences (SEQ ID NOS:236 and 237) and string content of these CDR grafts are shown in \nFIGS. 28 and 29\n, along with structures of modeled C225 highlighting the mutational differences between the CDR grafted C225 variable chains and WT.\n\n\nVariants with reduced immunogenicity were generated by applying a string optimization algorithm on the WT C225 VL and VH sequences, similar to as described above for AC10 except that single instead of multiple amino acid substitutions were sampled. HSC of each sequence was optimized using a window size w=9, and the same set of CDR and VL/VH interface proximal residues were masked. The calculation was run for C225 VL and VH in 100 separate iterations, generating a set of diverse C225 variants with more host string content than WT. \nFIG. 30\n shows the nonredundant set of output sequences from these calculations for the C225 VL and VH regions (SEQ ID NOS:238-274), referred to as C225 \nVL HSC Calculation\n 1 and C225 \nVH HSC Calculation\n 1, respectively. In addition to the HSC score, the structural consensus and structural precedence of each sequence was evaluated (U.S. Ser. No. 60/528,229, filed Dec. 8, 2003, entitled Protein Engineering with Analogous Contact Environments) in order to evaluate its structural integrity.\n\n\nA second set of similar calculations were run on the C225 VL and VH sequences, except that the algorithm was allowed to sample multiple amino acid substitutions, rather than only single substitutions, in order to optimize HSC. \nFIG. 31\n shows the nonredundant set of output sequences from these calculations for the C225 VL and VH regions (SEQ ID NOS:275-378), referred to as C225 \nVL HSC Calculation\n 2 and C225 \nVH HSC Calculation\n 2, respectively. Here, two measure of structural fitness, referred to as “Structural Consensus” and “Structural Precedence” (U.S. Ser. No. 60/528,229 and U.S. Ser. No. 60/602,566), are used to evaluate the structural and functional integrity of the sequences, in addition to HSC score. The output sequences were clustered based on their mutational distance from the other sequences in the set, and these clusters are delineated by the horizontal black lines in the Figure.\n\n\nThe calculations described above and presented in \nFIGS. 30 and 31\n were used to generate a set of C225 VL and VH variants (SEQ ID NOS:238-378). In some cases, further substitutions were made to output sequences, using string and structural scores, as well as visual inspection of the modeled C225 structure, to evaluate fitness. \nFIGS. 32-40\n present the sequences (SEQ ID NOS:379-387), structural scores, string scores, and mapped mutational differences on the modeled C\n2-25 \nstructure for each of the C225 VL and VH variants. \nIteration\n 21 from C225 \nVL HSC calculation\n 1 served as the precursor for L2 C225 VL, \niteration\n 17 from C225 \nVL HSC calculation\n 2 served as the precursor for L3 C225 VL, and \niteration\n 38 from C225 \nVL HSC calculation\n 2 served as the precursor for L4 C225 VL. \nIteration\n 23 from C225 \nVH HSC calculation\n 1 served as the precursor for H3, H4, and H5C225 VH, \niteration\n 5 from C225 \nVH HSC calculation\n 2 served as the precursor for H6 C225 VH, \niteration\n 41 from C225 \nVH HSC calculation\n 2 served as the precursor for H7 C225 VH, and \niteration\n 44 from C225 \nVH HSC calculation\n 2 served as the precursor for H8 C225 VH.\n\n\nTables 7 and 8 present the mutational, structural fitness, and host string content scores for the C225 VL and VH variants as compared to the WT and CDR grafted C225 sequences. In addition, the maximum identity match to the germline for each string in the sequences was also determined, referred to as N\nID\nmax. This represents the total number of strings in each sequence whose maximum identity to the corresponding strings in the human germline is the indicated value. For w=9, Tables 7 and 8 list N\n9\nmax, N\n8\nmax, N\n7\nmax, and N\n≦6\nmax for each sequence. Also provided is the framework region homogeneity. In addition to the aforementioned structural and host string analysis, each sequence was analyzed for its global homology to the human germline; tables 7 and 8 present the most homologous human germline sequence for each sequence (Closest Germline) and corresponding identity to that germline (ID to Closest Germline), determined using the sequence alignment program BLAST.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nC225 VL Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCDR\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWT\n\n\nGraft\n\n\nL2\n\n\n \nL3\n \n \nL4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutations\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n17\n\n\n21\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Consensus\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n0.52\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n0.58\n\n\n0.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Precedence\n\n\n0.53\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n0.59\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman String Content\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n0.94\n\n\n0.91\n\n\n0.92\n\n\n0.91\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman String\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n0.65\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n0.58\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFramework Region\n\n\n \n\n\n0.97\n\n\n0.52\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n0.78\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomogeneity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n9\nmax\n\n\n13\n\n\n69\n\n\n52\n\n\n60\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n8\nmax\n\n\n27\n\n\n15\n\n\n28\n\n\n24\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n7\nmax\n\n\n37\n\n\n22\n\n\n20\n\n\n16\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n≦6\nmax\n\n\n30\n\n\n1\n\n\n7\n\n\n7\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nClosest Germline\n \n\n\n6D-21\n\n\n6D-21\n\n\n3-11\n\n\n1D-13\n\n\n6D-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID to Closest\n\n\n63/95\n\n\n87/95\n\n\n72/95\n\n\n73/94\n\n\n79/95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGermline\n \n\n\n66%\n\n\n91%\n\n\n75%\n\n\n77%\n\n\n83%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nC225 VH Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCDR\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWT\n\n\nGraft\n\n\nH3\n\n\nH4\n\n\nH5\n\n\nH6\n\n\n \nH7\n \n \nH8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutations\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n18\n\n\n21\n\n\n15\n\n\n21\n\n\n22\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Consensus\n\n\n0.44\n\n\n0.48\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n0.46\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n0.52\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n0.53\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Precedence\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n0.54\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n0.54\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n0.58\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman String Content\n\n\n0.67\n\n\n0.84\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman String\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n0.36\n\n\n0.41\n\n\n0.33\n\n\n0.36\n\n\n0.35\n\n\n0.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFramework Region\n\n\n \n\n\n0.97\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n0.52\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n0.76\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomogeneity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n9\nmax\n\n\n3\n\n\n66\n\n\n42\n\n\n48\n\n\n38\n\n\n42\n\n\n41\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n8\nmax\n\n\n23\n\n\n17\n\n\n25\n\n\n24\n\n\n17\n\n\n24\n\n\n21\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n7\nmax\n\n\n32\n\n\n10\n\n\n19\n\n\n16\n\n\n26\n\n\n23\n\n\n25\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n≦6\nmax\n\n\n61\n\n\n26\n\n\n33\n\n\n31\n\n\n38\n\n\n30\n\n\n32\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosest Germline\n\n\n4-30-4\n\n\n4-30-4\n\n\n4-30-4\n\n\n2-26\n\n\n4-30-4\n\n\n3-33\n\n\n4-30-4\n\n\n3-33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID to Closest\n\n\n56/99\n\n\n88/99\n\n\n67/99\n\n\n74/99\n\n\n64/99\n\n\n69/99\n\n\n67/99\n\n\n80/99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGermline\n \n\n\n56%\n\n\n88%\n\n\n66%\n\n\n74%\n\n\n64%\n\n\n70%\n\n\n67%\n\n\n81%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, whereas the CDR grafted C225 antibodies are most homologous to a single human germline sequence, the C225 variants of the present invention are homologous to different human germline sequences in different regions of the sequence. Whereas CDR grafted C225 VH is most homologous to \nhuman germline subfamily\n 4 across its entire sequence, H4C225 VH is most homologous to \nsubfamily\n 4 in FR1, \nsubfamily\n 3 in FR2, and \nsubfamily\n 2 in FR3. Additionally, whereas the CDR grafted antibodies are most homologous to a single germline sequence that is also the most homologous sequence to the parent sequence, the present invention presents a set of antibodies for a given antibody that are most homologous to different human germline sequences, which need not be the most homologous germline sequence to WT. For example, Table 7 shows that CDR grafted C225 VL is most homologous to vlk\n—\n6D-21, which is also the most homologous human germline to WT C225. However L2, L3, and L4 are most homologous to three different human germlines—vlk\n—\n3-11, \nvlk\n \n \n \n—\n1D-13, and \nvlk\n \n \n \n—\n6D-21 respectively. Thus the variants of the present invention explore a substantially greater amount of diversity than CDR grafted antibodies.\n\n\nThe genes for the C225 variable regions were constructed as described above, and subcloned into a modified pASK84 vector (Skerra, 1994, Gene 141: 79-84) comprising mouse constant regions for expression as Fabs. Select C225 variants were experimentally tested for their capacity to bind EGFR antigen. L2/H3 and L2/H4 C225 Fabs were expressed from the pASK84 vector in \nE. Coli \nwith a His-tag, and purified using Nickel-affinity chromatography. Antigen affinity of the C225 variants was tested using SPR similar to as described above. EGFR extracellular domain (purchased commercially from R&D Systems) was covalently coupled to the dextrane matrix of a CM5 chip using NHS-linkage chemistry. C225 Fabs were reacted with the EGFR sensor chip surface at varying concentrations. Global Langmuir fits were been carried out for the concentrations series using the BiaEvaluation curve fitting software. The on-rate constant (ka), off-rate constant (kd), equilibrium binding constant (KD=kd/ka), and predicted saturation binding signal (Rmax) derived from these fits are presented in Table 9, along with the Chi2 which quantifies the average deviation of the fit curve from the actual data curve. The data indicate that both the L2/H3 and L2/H4 C225 variants bind EGFR antigen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPR data on C225 Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRmax\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nC225\n\n\nka (1/Ms)\n\n\nkd (1/s)\n\n\nKD (M)\n\n\n(RU)\n\n\nChi2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nL2/H3\n\n\n2.79 × 10\n4\n \n\n\n5.35 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n1.92 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n174\n\n\n8.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL2/H4\n\n\n1.79 × 10\n4\n \n\n\n4.73 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n2.64 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n153\n\n\n2.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to investigate the anti-EGFR variants in the context of a full length antibody, the C225 WT (L0 and H0) and variant (L2, L3, L4, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, and H8) regions were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1Zeo (Invitrogen) as described above. All combinations of the light and heavy chain plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells, and antibodies were expressed, harvested, and purified as described above. Binding of the C225 WT (L0/H0) and variant (L0/H3, L0/H4, L0/H5, L0/H6, L0/H7, L0/H8, L2/H3, L2/H4, L2/H5, L2/H6, L2/H7, L2/H8, L3/H3, L3/H4, L3/H5, L3/H6, L3/H7, L3/H8, L4/H3, L4/H4, L4/H5, L4/H6, L4/H7, and L4/H8) antibodies was determined using SPR similar to as described above. Full length antibodies were flowed over the EGFR sensor chip described above. \nFIG. 41\n shows the SPR sensorgrams obtained from the experiments. The curves consist of a association phase and dissociation phase, the separation being marked by a little spike on each curve. As a very rough approximation the signal level reached near the end of the association phase can be used as an indicator for relative binding. For all the curves this signal level is within 25% of the average level indicating that none of the antibody variants have significantly lost their ability to bind to EGFR.\n\n\nTo assess the capacity of the anti-EGFR antibodies to mediate effector function against EGFR expressing cells, the C225 variants were tested in a cell-based ADCC assay. Human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) were used as effector cells, A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells were used as target cells, and lysis was monitored by measuring LDH activity using the Cytotoxicity Detection Kit as described above. \nFIG. 42\n shows the dose dependence of ADCC at various antibody concentrations for WT and variant C225 antibodies. The results show that a number of the C225 variants have comparable or better ADCC than WT C225 with respect to potency and efficacy. These data may be weighed together with the antigen affinity data and other data to choose the optimal anti-EGFR clinical candidate. As exemplified above with AC10 variants, combinations of the C225 variants of the present invention with amino acid modifications that alter effector function are contemplated.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nImmunogenicity Reduction of ICR62\n\n\nTo further illustrate application of the method described in the present invention, and to validate its broad applicability to immunogenicity reduction of proteins, an example is provided using as the parent sequence the anti-EGFR antibody ICR62 (Institute of Cancer Research) (PCT WO 95/20045; Modjtahedi et al., 1993, \nJ. Cell Biophys. \n1993, 22(1-3):129-46; Modjtahedi et al., 1993, \nBr J.

A structural model of the rat ICR62 variable region was constructed using standard antibody modeling methods known in the art. \nFIGS. 43 and 44\n show the sequences (SEQ ID NOS:388 and 389), host string content, and structures of the ICR62 VL and VH domains. A CDR graft of this antibody was constructed by placing the ICR62 CDRs into the context of the frameworks of the most homologous human germlines, determined to be vlk\n—\n1-17 for VL and vh\n—\n1-f for VH using the sequence alignment program BLAST. The sequences and string content of these CDR grafts are shown in \nFIGS. 45 and 46\n (SEQ ID NOS:390 and 391), along with structures of modeled ICR62 highlighting the mutational differences between the CDR grafted ICR62 variable chains and WT.\n\n\nVariants with reduced immunogenicity were generated by applying a string optimization algorithm on the WT ICR62 VL and VH sequences, similar to as described above for AC10 except that single instead of multiple amino acid substitutions were sampled. HSC of each sequence was optimized using a window size w=9, and the same set of CDR and VL/VH interface proximal residues were masked. The calculation was run for ICR62 VL and VH in 100 separate interactions, generating a set of diverse ICR62 variants with more host string content than WT. \nFIG. 47\n shows the nonredundant set of output sequences (SEQ ID NOS:392 and 431) from these calculations for the ICR62 VL and VH regions, referred to as ICR62 \nVL HSC Calculation\n 1 and ICR62 \nVH HSC Calculation\n 1 respectively. In addition to the HSC score, the structural consensus and structural precedence of each sequence was evaluated (U.S. Ser. No. 60/528,229, filed Dec. 8, 2003, entitled Protein Engineering with Analogous Contact Environments) in order to evaluate its structural integrity.\n\n\nThe calculations described above and presented in \nFIG. 47\n were used to generate a set of ICR62 VL and VH variants (SEQ ID NOS:392 and 455). In some cases, further substitutions were made to output sequences, using HSC and Structural Precedence scores, as well as visual inspection of the modeled ICR62 structure, to evaluate fitness. \nFIGS. 48-50\n present the sequences (SEQ ID NOS:456 and 458), host string content, and mapped mutational differences on the modeled ICR62 structure for each of the ICR62 VL and VH variants. \nIteration\n 20 from ICR62 \nVL HSC calculation\n 1 served as the precursor for L2 ICR62 VL. \nIteration\n 1 from ICR62 \nVH HSC calculation\n 1 served as the precursor for H9, and \niteration\n 5 from ICR62 \nVH HSC calculation\n 2 served as the precursor for H10 ICR62 VH.\n\n\nTables 10 and 11 present the mutational, structural fitness, and host string content scores for the ICR62 VL and VH variants as compared to the WT and CDR grafted ICR62 sequences. In addition, the maximum identity match to the germline for each string in the sequences, referred to as N\nID\nmax, is also provided, as well as the framework region homogeneity. In addition to the aforementioned structural and host string analysis, each sequence was analyzed for its global homology to the host germline; tables 10 and 11 present the most homologous host germline sequence for each sequence (Closest Germline) and corresponding identity to that germline (ID to Closest Germline), determined using the sequence alignment program BLAST.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nICR62 VL Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCDR\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWT\n\n\n \nGraft\n \n \nL2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMutations\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n0\n\n\n11\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStructural Consensus\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n0.60\n\n\n0.61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStructural Precedence\n\n\n0.52\n\n\n0.58\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman String Content\n\n\n0.86\n\n\n0.91\n\n\n0.90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman String\n\n\n0.38\n\n\n0.58\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSimilarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFramework Region\n\n\n0.62\n\n\n0.97\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHomogeneity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN\n9\nmax\n\n\n37\n\n\n59\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN\n8\nmax\n\n\n26\n\n\n21\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN\n7\nmax\n\n\n31\n\n\n18\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN\n≦6\nmax\n\n\n13\n\n\n9\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClosest Germline\n\n\n1-17\n\n\n1-17\n\n\n1-17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nID to Closest\n\n\n76/95\n\n\n86/95\n\n\n81/95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nGermline\n \n\n\n80%\n\n\n90%\n\n\n85%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nICR62 VH Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCDR\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWT\n\n\nGraft\n\n\nH9\n\n\nH10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nMutations\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n34\n\n\n20\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStructural Consensus\n\n\n0.43\n\n\n0.44\n\n\n0.46\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStructural Precedence\n\n\n0.42\n\n\n0.52\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman String Content\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n0.85\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman String\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n0.54\n\n\n0.28\n\n\n0.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSimilarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFramework Region\n\n\n \n\n\n1.00\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n0.85\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHomogeneity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN\n9\nmax\n\n\n1\n\n\n64\n\n\n33\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN\n8\nmax\n\n\n16\n\n\n24\n\n\n33\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN\n7\nmax\n\n\n35\n\n\n14\n\n\n28\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN\n≦6\nmax\n\n\n67\n\n\n17\n\n\n25\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClosest Germline\n\n\n1-f\n\n\n1-f\n\n\n1-f\n\n\n1-f\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nID to Closest\n\n\n60/98\n\n\n92/98\n\n\n72/98\n\n\n77/98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nGermline\n \n\n\n61%\n\n\n93%\n\n\n73%\n\n\n79%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, as observed from the significant differences in FRH and closest germlines, the ICR62 variants are homologous to different host germline sequences in different regions of the sequence. The genes for the ICR62 WT and L2/H9 variable regions were constructed as described above, and subcloned into a modified pASK84 vector (Skerra, 1994, Gene 141: 79-84). The ICR62 Fabs experimentally tested for their capacity to bind EGFR antigen. WT and L2/H9 ICR62 Fabs were expressed from the pASK84 vector in \nE. Coli \nwith a His-tag, and purified using Nickel-affinity chromatography. Antigen affinity of the ICR62 antibodies was tested using SPR similar to as described above, with EGFR covalently coupled to the CM5 chip reacted with ICR62 antibodies at varying concentrations. The fits to the data, as described above, are provided in Table 12. fits were been carried out for the concentrations series using the BiaEvaluation curve fitting software. As can be seen, L2/H9 ICR62 binds with comparable affinity as WT to the EGFR antigen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPR data on ICR62 Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRmax\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nICR62\n\n\nka (1/Ms)\n\n\nkd (1/s)\n\n\nKD (M)\n\n\n(RU)\n\n\nChi2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT\n\n\n9.86 × 10\n4\n \n\n\n2.53 × 10\n−5\n \n\n\n2.57 × 10\n−10\n \n\n\n402\n\n\n1.86\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL2/H9\n\n\n2.35 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n1.06 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n4.50 × 10\n−10\n \n\n\n508\n\n\n4.91\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nString Diversity Exploration of Immunoglobulins\n\n\nThe generation of mutational diversity based on HSC is much broader than the primary variant-secondary variant strategy described above for H3/L3 AC10. Indeed substitutions can be designed for any parent protein wherein the substitutions result in positive or neutral impact on the host string content of the parent sequence. Again, the advantage of such a strategy is that it generates a diverse set of minimally immunogenic variants that have the potential for optimized properties, including but not limited to antigen affinity, activity, specificity, solubility, expression level, and effector function. Such a set of variants may be designed, for example, to explore diversity for other parent immunoglobulins, including but not limited to nonhuman antibodies, humanized or otherwise engineered antibodies (Clark, 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:397-402), (Tsurushita & Vasquez, 2004, Humanization of Monoclonal Antibodies, Molecular Biology of B Cells, 533-545, Elsevier Science (USA)), and “fully human” antibodies, obtained for example using transgenic mice (Bruggemann et al., 1997, \nCurr Opin Biotechnol \n8:455-458) or human antibody libraries coupled with selection methods (Griffiths et al., 1998, \nCurr Opin Biotechnol \n9:102-108).\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nUnique Properties of Variant Proteins Generated by the Methods of the Present Invention\n\n\nThe methods described in the present invention generate variant proteins that possess a number of unique properties relative to variant proteins generated by other methods that attempt to achieve the same or similar goal. \nFIGS. 51 and 52\n provide the host string content (HSC, Equation 3), exact string content (ESC, Equation 3a), and framework region homogeneity (FRH, Equation 10) of the AC10, C225, and ICR62 VH (\nFIG. 51\n) and VL (\nFIG. 52\n) variants of the present invention, compared with a number of antibody variable regions “humanized” by methods in the prior art. If a variant sequence's exact string content is derived solely from a single germline sequence, the FRH would be close to 1.0. Alternatively, as is the case with many of the variant sequences created by the present invention, FRH values can be significantly less than 1, with values ranging from 0.4 to 1.0, indicating, as expected, that sequences with high exact string content can be discovered with contributions from multiple germline subfamilies and sequences. At the same time, the variant sequences engineered using the present invention have high host string content, and thus are predicted to have low potential for immunogenicity in humans. For example, as shown in \nFIG. 51\n variant VH sequences generated using the present invention have HSC values generally higher than 75%, and many of them have FRH values lower than 0.6, indicating their HSC is derived from multiple germline frameworks. As shown in \nFIG. 52\n, similar trends apply for variant VL sequences generated using the present invention\n\n\nWhereas particular embodiments of the invention have been described above for purposes of illustration, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that numerous variations of the details may be made without departing from the invention as described in the appended claims.

Description\n\n\n\n\nThis application is a national stage filing of PCT/IB2008/000731 filed Mar. 14, 2008, which claims the benefit of Provisional Patent Application No. 60/896,527 filed Mar. 23, 2007.\n\n\nThis invention relates to fused azepine derivatives potentially useful in medicine. More particularly, this invention relates to pyrimidine-fused azepine derivatives and to processes for the preparation of, intermediates used in the preparation of, compositions containing and the uses of, such derivatives.\n\n\nThe fused azepine derivatives of the present invention are modulators (preferably agonists) of the 5-HT receptor, preferably the 5-HT\n2c \nreceptor. 5-HT\n2c \nreceptor modulators/agonists are believed to have a number of therapeutic applications, particularly in the treatment of sexual dysfunction, schizophrenia, cognitive deficits including cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, epilepsy, obesity, and LUTS, among others. Preferably, the modulators/agonists are selective for the 5-HT\n2c \nreceptor over other 5-HT receptors.\n\n\nBishop, M. J. and Nilsson, B. M., “New 5-HT\n2c \nReceptor Agonists” Expert Opin. Ther. Patents, 2003, 13(11): 1691-1705, review patent applications that describe compounds having agonist activity at the 5-HT\n2c \nreceptor. The review also addresses indications for which evidence exists to support the use of 5-HT\n2c \nagonists in their treatment, such as obesity, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, sexual dysfunction, epilepsy, and urinary incontinence, among others. Toxicity and non-selectivity of ligands for the various 5-HT receptors remain a challenge. It is suspected that the non-selectivity of some ligands contributes to various adverse side effects such as hallucinations and cardiovascular complications. Therefore, there remains a need for 5-HT\n2\n, selective receptor ligands.\n\n\nIt has now been found that compounds of the present invention are modulators, preferably, agonists of the 5-HT\n2c \nreceptor, preferably selective agonists for this receptor over other 5-HT receptors. The compounds of the present invention are therefore potentially useful in the treatment of a wide range of disorders, particularly in the treatment of 5-HT\n2c \nreceptor-mediated disorders in animals including humans. The treatment of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is a preferred use. All forms of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) are potentially treatable with the compounds of the present invention including female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), female orgasmic disorder (FOD), hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), or sexual pain disorder. The treatment of male sexual dysfunction, particularly male erectile dysfunction (MED), is another preferred use. Other preferred uses of the present invention include treatment of eating disorders, promotion of weight loss, control of weight, or treatment of obesity. Other conditions that may be treated with the compounds of the present invention include psychoses, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, substance-induced psychotic disorder, personality disorder of the paranoid type, or personality disorder of the schizoid type. Compounds of the present invention may also be used for the treatment of dementia, cognitive deficit symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, alcoholic dementia or other drug-related dementia, dementia associated with intracranial tumors or cerebral trauma, dementia associated with Huntington's disease or Parkinson's disease, AIDS-related dementia, delirium, amnestic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, mental retardation, a learning disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, age-related cognitive decline, cognitive deficits associated with psychoses, or cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Conditions that may be treated with the compounds of the present invention also include benign prostactic hyperplasia, overactive bladder or LUTS.\n\n\nThe terms “treating”, “treat”, or “treatment” as used herein are intended to embrace both prevention and control i.e., prophylactic, and palliative treatment of the indicated conditions.\n\n\nVarious pyrimidoazepine derivatives useful for the treatment of diseases associated with the 5-HT\n2c \nreceptor are referred to in WO2006044762. Pyrimidine fused heterocycles useful for the treatment of diseases associated with leucocyte activation are referred to in US2003191143. N-containing heterocyclic compounds useful for the treatment of diseases such as thrombosis, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disorder, circulatory disorders, migraine, diabetic peripheral nerve disorder and neuralgia afer herpes zoster are disclosed in JP11171865. JP2005162673A refers to quaternary ammonium salts of bicyclic pyrimidine derivatives useful for the treatment of inflammation and allergic and autoimmune diseases. International Patent Application publication number WO2007019083 refers to pyrimidine fused compounds as 5-HT receptor modulators.\n\n\nThere is a need to provide new 5-HT\n2c \nagonists that are good drug candidates. In particular, preferred compounds should bind potently to the 5-HT\n2c \nreceptor whilst showing little affinity for other receptors and show functional activity as agonists. They should be well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, be metabolically stable and possess favourable pharmacokinetic properties. When targeted against receptors in the central nervous system they should cross the blood brain barrier freely and when targeted selectively against receptors in the peripheral nervous system they should not cross the blood brain barrier. They should be non-toxic and demonstrate few side-effects. Furthermore, the ideal drug candidate will exist in a physical form that is stable, non-hygroscopic and easily formulated.\n\n\nIn particular, compounds of the present invention are selective agonists of the 5-HT\n2c \nreceptor. Advantageously, compounds of the invention show little or no affinity for the 5-HT\n2a \nand 5-HT\n2b \nreceptors. In addition, preferred compounds of the invention are metabolically stable.\n\n\nThe present invention therefore provides a compound of formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate (including a hydrate), or prodrug thereof, wherein:\n\n \n \nR\n1 \nis H, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, (C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl, fluoro(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloaolkyl, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, —NR\n4\nR\n5\n, —OR\n10\n, or Het\n1\n, said alkyl, cycloalkyl and alkoxy being optionally substituted by one or more hydroxyl;\n \nHet\n1 \nis a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring containing one nitrogen atom at the point of attachment, and comprising up to 2 further heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, said ring being optionally substituted by 1 to 3 groups selected from amino, —NH[(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl], —N[(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl]\n2\n, hydroxyl, halogen, cyano, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, said alkyl and alkoxy being optionally substituted by one or more hydroxyl;\n \nR\n2 \nis —(CH\n2\n)\np\n-phenyl, —CH(R\n6\n)-phenyl, —C(R\n6\n)\n2\n-phenyl, —NR\n7\nR\n8\n, or —NR\n9\n-—(CH\n2\n)\np\n-phenyl wherein in each instance the phenyl radical is optionally substituted by up to four groups selected from amino, —NH[(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl], —N[(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl]\n2\n, hydroxyl, halogen, cyano, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, said alkyl and alkoxy being optionally substituted by one or more hydroxyl;\n \nR\n3a\n, R\n3b\n, R\n3c \nand R\n3d \nare independently H, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl or fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl;\n \nR\n4 \nis H, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl or fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl;\n \nR\n5 \nis (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, (C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkylmethyl, fluoro(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkylmethyl, said alkyl and cycloalkyl being optionally substituted by one or more hydroxyl, phenyl, or —(CH\n2\n)\nq\n-Het\n2\n;\n \nHet\n2 \nis a 5-membered heterocyclic ring containing 1 or 2 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen and oxygen, said ring being optionally substituted by 1 to 3 groups selected from amino, —NH[(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl], —N[(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl]\n2\n, hydroxyl, halogen, cyano, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, said alkyl and alkoxy being optionally substituted by one or more hydroxyl;\n \neach R\n6 \nis independently (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, hydroxyl, or fluorine; when R\n2 \nis —C(R\n6\n)\n2\n-phenyl, both R\n6 \ncan be taken together to form a (C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl or a fluoro(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl group with the carbon atom to which they are bound;\n \nR\n7 \nis H, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, (C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl or fluoro(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl;\n \nR\n8 \nis (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, (C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl, (C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkylmethyl, or fluoro(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl;\n \nor R\n7 \nand R\n8\n, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bound, form a 4- to 6-membered heterocyclic ring optionally comprising 1 further heteroatom selected from oxygen and sulphur, said ring being optionally fused to a phenyl ring;\n \nR\n9 \nis H, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl or fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl;\n \nR\n10 \nis (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl optionally substituted by —(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl, —(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, —CF\n3\n, —N[(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl]\n2\n, phenyl optionally substituted by cyano, or Het\n3\n;\n \nHet\n3 \nis a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring containing 1 or 2 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen and oxygen, said ring being optionally substituted by (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl;\n \np is 1 or 2;\n \nq is 0, 1 or 2;\n\n\nand R\n100 \nis H or a NH prodrug moiety, such as are described in Fleischer et al, \nAdvanced Drug Delivery Reviews, \n19(1996), 115-130, e.g. CO\n2\nR\n101 \nwherein R\n101 \nis a C\n1-10 \nalkyl group and C(O)R\n102 \nwherein R\n102 \nis a C\n1-10 \nalkyl group.\n\n \n\n\nIn the description and appended claims, the term “alkyl” refers to a straight-chain or branched-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing the specified number of carbon atoms.

acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) include the acid addition and base salts thereof.\n\n\nSuitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the acetate, adipate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bicarbonate/carbonate, bisulphate/sulphate, borate, camsylate, citrate, cyclamate, edisylate, esylate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hexafluorophosphate, hibenzate, hydrochloride/chloride, hydrobromide/bromide, hydroiodide/iodide, isethionate, lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, mesylate, methylsulphate, naphthylate, 2-napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate/hydrogen phosphate/dilhydrogen phosphate, pyroglutamate, saccharate, stearate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, tosylate, trifluoroacetate and xinofoate salts.\n\n\nSuitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the aluminium, arginine, benzathine, calcium, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine, olamine, potassium, sodium, tromethamine and zinc salts.\n\n\nHemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulphate and hemicalcium salts.\n\n\nFor a review on suitable salts, see \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use \nby Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, 2002), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I may be prepared by one or more of three methods:\n\n \n \n(i) by reacting the compound of formula I with the desired acid or base;\n \n(ii) by removing an acid-or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of the compound of formula I or by ring-opening a suitable cyclic precursor, for example, a lactone or lactam, using the desired acid or base; or\n \n(iii) by converting one salt of the compound of formula I to another by reaction with an appropriate acid or base or by means of a suitable ion exchange column.\n \n\n\nAll three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisation in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from fully amorphous to fully crystalline. The term ‘amorphous’ refers to a state in which the material lacks long range order at the molecular level and, depending upon temperature, may exhibit the physical properties of a solid or a liquid. Typically such materials do not give distinctive X-ray diffraction patterns and, while exhibiting the properties of a solid, are more formally described as a liquid. Upon heating, a change from solid to liquid properties occurs which is characterized by a change of state, typically second order (‘glass transition’). The term ‘crystalline’ refers to a solid phase in which the material has a regular ordered internal structure at the molecular level and gives a distinctive X-ray diffraction pattern with defined peaks. Such materials when heated sufficiently will also exhibit the properties of a liquid, but the change from solid to liquid is characterised by a phase change; typically first order (‘melting point’).\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may also exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. The term ‘solvate’ is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising a compound of formula (I) and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term ‘hydrate’ is employed when said solvent is water.\n\n\nA currently accepted classification system for organic hydrates is one that defines isolated site, channel, or metal-ion coordinated hydrates—see \nPolymorphism in Pharmaceutical Solids \nby K. R. Morris (Ed. H. G. Brittain, Marcel Dekker, 1995), incorporated herein by reference. Isolated site hydrates are ones in which the water molecules are isolated from direct contact with each other by intervening organic molecules. In channel hydrates, the water molecules lie in lattice channels where they are next to other water molecules. In metal-ion coordinated hydrates, the water molecules are bonded to the metal ion.\n\n\nWhen the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm.\n\n\nAlso included within the scope of the invention are multi-component complexes (other than salts and solvates) wherein the drug and at least one other component are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Complexes of this type include clathrates (drug-host inclusion complexes) and co-crystals. The latter are typically defined as crystalline complexes of neutral molecular constituents which are bound together through non-covalent interactions, but could also be a complex of a neutral molecule with a salt. Co-crystals may be prepared by melt crystallisation, by recrystallisation from solvents, or by physically grinding the components together—see Chem Commun, 17, 1889-1896, by O. Almarsson and M. J. Zaworotko (2004), incorporated herein by reference. For a general review of multi-component complexes, see J Pharm Sci, 64 (8), 1269-1288, by Haleblian (August 1975), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (1) may also exist in a mesomorphic state (mesophase or liquid crystal) when subjected to suitable conditions. The mesomorphic state is intermediate between the true crystalline state and the true liquid state (either melt or solution). Mesomorphism arising as the result of a change in temperature is described as ‘thermotropic’ and that resulting from the addition of a second component, such as water or another solvent, is described as ‘lyotropic’. Compounds that have the potential to form lyotropic mesophases are described as ‘amphiphilic’ and consist of molecules which possess an ionic (such as —COO\n−\nNa\n+\n, —COO\n31 \nK\n+\n, or —SO\n3\n \n−\nNa\n+\n) or non-ionic (such as —N\n−\nN\n+\n(CH\n3\n)\n3\n) polar head group. For more information, see \nCrystals and the Polarizing Microscope \nby N. H. Hartshorne and A. Stuart, 4\nth \nEdition (Edward Arnold, 1970), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nHereinafter all references to compounds of formula (I) include references to salts, solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals thereof and to solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals of salts thereof.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention include compounds of formula (I) as hereinbefore defined, including all polymorphs and crystal habits thereof, prodrugs and isomers thereof (including optical, geometric and tautomeric isomers) as hereinafter defined and isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I).\n\n\nAs indicated, so-called ‘prodrugs’ of the compounds of formula (I) are also within the scope of the invention. Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula (I) which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of formula (I) having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as ‘prodrugs’. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in \nPro\n-\ndrugs as Novel Delivery Systems\n, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T. Higuchi and W. Stella) and \nBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design\n, Pergamon Press, 1987 (Ed. E. B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nProdrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of formula (I) with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as ‘pro-moieties’ as described, for example, in \nDesign of Prodrugs \nby H. Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985) and Fleischer et al, \nAdvanced Drug Delivery Reviews, \n19(1996), 115-130, incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nSome examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) where the compound of formula I contains an alcohol functionality (—OH), an ether thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the alcohol functionality of the compound of formula I is replaced by (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxymethyl; and\n \n(ii) where the compound of formula I contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (—NH\n2 \nor —NHR where R≠H), an amide thereof, for example, a compound wherein, as the case may be, one or both hydrogens of the amino functionality of the compound of formula I is/are replaced by (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkanoyl or CO\n2\n(C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkyl.\n \n \n \n\n\nFurther examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.\n\n\nMoreover, certain compounds of formula (I) may themselves act as prodrugs of other compounds of formula (I).\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may have asymmetric carbon atoms. The bonds from an asymmetric carbon in compounds of the present invention may be depicted herein using a solid line (—), a solid wedge \n or a dotted wedge \n The use of a solid line to depict bonds from asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers at that carbon atom are included. The use of either a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds from asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that only the stereoisomer shown is meant to be included. It is possible that compounds of formula (I) may contain more than one asymmetric carbon atom. In those compounds, the use of a solid line to depict bonds from asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers are meant to be included. Where a compound of formula (I) contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible. Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric isomerism (‘tautomerism’) can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of formula (I) containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or so-called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.\n\n\nIncluded within the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I), including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, d-lactate or l-lysine, or racemic, for example, dl-tartrate or dl-arginine.\n\n\nCis/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallisation.\n\n\nConventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\n\nAlternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound of formula I contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1-phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.\n\n\nChiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% by volume of isopropanol, typically from 2 to 20%, and may contain from 0 to 5% by volume of an alkylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture. The absolute composition of the mobile phase will be dependent upon the chiral stationary phase (asymmetric resin) selected.\n\n\nStereoisomeric conglomerates may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art—see, for example, \nStereochemistry of Organic Compounds \nby E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley, New York, 1994).\n\n\nThe present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I) wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates in nature.\n\n\nExamples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, such as \n2\nH and \n3\nH, carbon, such as \n11\nC, \n13\nC and \n14\nC, chlorine, such as \n36\nCl, fluorine, such as \n18\nF, iodine, such as \n123\nI and \n125\nI, nitrogen, such as \n13\nN and \n15\nN, oxygen, such as \n15\nO, \n17\nO and \n18\nO, phosphorus, such as \n32\nP, and sulphur, such as \n35\nS.\n\n\nCertain isotopically-labelled compounds of formula I, for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e. \n14\nC, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. A variety of disorders (including diseases and/or conditions) have been shown to be modulated by 5-HT\n2c \nreceptor Uganda. See, e.g., Bishop, Michael J., and Bjorn M. Nilsson, “New 5-HT2c receptor agonist” \nExpert Opin, Ther Patents, \n13(11), 1591-1705 (2003). Of particular interest are those disorders including sexual dysfunction, lower urinary tract symptoms, eating disorders (e.g., binge eating disorder, anorexia, and bulimia), weight loss or control (e.g., reduction in calorie or food intake, and/or appetite suppression), obesity, depression, atypical depression, bipolar disorders, psychoses, schizophrenia, behavioral addictions, suppression of reward-related behaviors (e.g., conditioned place avoidance, such as suppression of cocaine- and morphine-induced conditioned place preference), substance abuse, addictive disorders, impulsivity, alcoholism (e.g., alcohol abuse, addiction and/or dependence including treatment for abstinence, craving reduction and relapse prevention of alcohol intake), tobacco abuse (e.g., smoking addiction, cessation and/or dependence including treatment for craving reduction and relapse prevention of tobacco smoking), premenstrual syndrome or late luteal phase syndrome, migraine, panic disorder, anxiety, post-traumatic syndrome, dementia (including memory loss, Alzheimer's disease, dementia of aging, vascular dementia, mild cognitive impairment, age-related cognitive decline, and mild neurocognitive disorder), seizure disorders, epilepsy, gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., dysfunction of gastrointestinal motility or intestinal propulsion), attention deficit disorders or attention hyperactivity disorders (ADD/ADHD), disruptive behavior disorders, impulse control disorders, borderline personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, anorexia nervosa, disorders of sleep (e.g., sleep apnea), autism, epilepsy, mutism, spinal cord injury, damage of the central nervous system (e.g., trauma, stroke, neurodegenerative diseases or toxic or infective CNS diseases (e.g., encephalitis or meningitis)), cardiovascular disorders (e.g., thrombosis), Parkinson's disease, diabetes insipidus, and type II diabetes.\n\n\nThe invention relates to compounds of formula (I), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs, which may be used in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of sexual dysfunction.\n\n\nSexual dysfunction (SD) is a significant clinical problem which can affect both males and females. The causes of SD may be both organic as well as psychological. Organic aspects of SD are typically caused by underlying vascular diseases, such as those associated with hypertension or diabetes mellitus, by prescription medication and/or by psychiatric disease such as depression. Physiological factors include fear, performance anxiety and interpersonal conflict. SD impairs sexual performance, diminishes self-esteem and disrupts personal relationships thereby inducing personal distress. In the clinic, SD disorders have been divided into female sexual dysfunction (FSD) disorders and male sexual dysfunction (MSD) disorders (Melman el at \nJ. Urology, \n1999, 161, 5-11).\n\n\nFSD can be defined as the difficulty or inability of a woman to find satisfaction in sexual expression. FSD is a collective term for several diverse female sexual disorders (Leiblum, S. R. (1998). Definition and classification of female sexual disorders. \nInt. J. Impotence Res., \n10, S104-S106; Berman, J. R., Berman, L. & Goldstein, I. (1999). Female sexual dysfunction: Incidence, pathophysiology, evaluations and treatment options. \nUrology, \n54, 385-391). The woman may have lack of desire, difficulty with arousal or orgasm, pain with intercourse or a combination of these problems. Several types of disease, medications, injuries or psychological problems can cause FSD. Treatments in development are targeted to treat specific subtypes of FSD, predominantly desire and arousal disorders.\n\n\nThe categories of FSD are best defined by contrasting them to the phases of normal female sexual response: desire, arousal and orgasm (Leiblum, S. R. (1998). Definition and classification of female sexual disorders, \nInt. J. Impotence Res., \n10, S104-S106). Desire or libido is the drive for sexual expression. Its manifestations often include sexual thoughts either when in the company of an interested partner or when exposed to other erotic stimuli. Arousal is the vascular response to sexual stimulation, an important component of which is genital engorgement and includes increased vaginal lubrication, elongation of the vagina and increased genital sensation/sensitivity. Orgasm is the release of sexual tension that has culminated during arousal.\n\n\nHence, FSD occurs when a woman has an inadequate or unsatisfactory response in any of these phases, usually desire, arousal or orgasm. FSD categories include hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic disorders and sexual pain disorders. Although the compounds of the invention will improve the genital response to sexual stimulation (as in female sexual arousal disorder), in doing so it may also improve the associated pain, distress and discomfort associated with intercourse and so treat other female sexual disorders.\n\n\nHypoactive sexual desire disorder is present if a woman has no or little desire to be sexual, and has no or few sexual thoughts or fantasies. This type of FSD can be caused by low testosterone levels, due either to natural menopause or to surgical menopause. Other causes include illness, medications, fatigue, depression and anxiety.\n\n\nFemale sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is characterised by inadequate genital response to sexual stimulation. The genitalia do not undergo the engorgement that characterises normal sexual arousal. The vaginal walls are poorly lubricated, so that intercourse is painful. Orgasms may be impeded. Arousal disorder can be caused by reduced oestrogen at menopause or after childbirth and during lactation, as well as by illnesses, with vascular components such as diabetes and atherosclerosis. Other causes result from treatment with diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants (e.g. SSRIs) or antihypertensive agents.\n\n\nSexual pain disorders (e.g. dyspareunia and vaginismus) is characterised by pain resulting from penetration and may be caused by medications which reduce lubrication, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, inflammatory bowel disease or urinary tract problems.\n\n\nThe prevalence of FSD is difficult to gauge because the term covers several types of problem, some of which are difficult to measure, and because the interest in treating FSD is relatively recent. Many women's sexual problems are associated either directly with the female ageing process or with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension.\n\n\nBecause FSD consists of several subtypes that express symptoms in separate phases of the sexual response cycle, there is not a single therapy. Current treatment of FSD focuses principally on psychological or relationship issues. Treatment of FSD is gradually evolving as more clinical and basic science studies are dedicated to the investigation of this medical problem. Female sexual complaints are not all psychological in pathophysiology, especially for those individuals who may have a component of vasculogenic dysfunction (eg FSAD) contributing to the overall female sexual complaint. There are at present no drugs licensed for the treatment of FSD. Empirical drug therapy includes oestrogen administration (topically or as hormone replacement therapy), androgens or mood-altering drugs such as buspirone or trazodone. These treatment options are often unsatisfactory due to low efficacy or unacceptable side effects.\n\n\nSince interest is relatively recent in treating FSD pharmacologically, therapy consists of the following: psychological counselling, over-the-counter sexual lubricants, and investigational candidates, including drugs approved for other conditions. These medications consist of hormonal agents, either testosterone or combinations of oestrogen and testosterone and more recently vascular drugs that have proved effective in male erectile dysfunction. None of these agents has been demonstrated to be very effective in treating FSD.\n\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV of the American Psychiatric Association defines Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD) as being: “a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity adequate lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement. The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.”\n\n\nThe arousal response consists of vasocongestion in the pelvis, vaginal lubrication and expansion and swelling of the external genitalia. The disturbance causes marked distress and/or interpersonal difficulty. FSAD is a highly prevalent sexual disorder affecting pre-, peri- and post menopausal (±HRT) women. It is associated with concomitant disorders such as depression, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and UG disorders.\n\n\nThe primary consequences of FSAD are lack of engorgement/swelling, lack of lubrication and lack of pleasurable genital sensation. The secondary consequences of FSAD are reduced sexual desire, pain during intercourse and difficulty in achieving an orgasm.\n\n\nIt has recently been hypothesised that there is a vascular basis for at least a proportion of patients with symptoms of FSAD (Goldstein et al., Int. J. Impot. Res., 10, S84-S90,1998) with animal data supporting this view (Park et al., Int. J. Impot. Res., 9, 27-37, 1997). Drug candidates for treating FSAD, which have been under investigation for efficacy, are primarily erectile dysfunction therapies that promote circulation to the male genitalia. They consist of two types of formulation, oral or sublingual medications (Apomorphine, Phentolamine, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors e.g. Sildenafil), and prostaglandin (PGE\n1\n) that are injected or administered transurethrally in men, and topically to the genitalia in women.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) are advantageous by providing a means for restoring a normal sexual arousal response—namely increased genital blood flow leading to vaginal, clitoral and labial engorgement. This will result in increased vaginal lubrication via plasma transudation, increased vaginal compliance and increased genital sensitivity. Hence, the compounds of the invention provide means to restore, or potentiate, the normal sexual arousal response.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) find application in the following sub-populations of patients with FSD: the young, the elderly, pre-menopausal, peri-menopausal, post-menopausal women with or without hormone replacement therapy.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) find application in patients with FSD arising from:\n\n \n \n \n \ni) Vascylogenic etiologies eg cardiovascular or atherosclerotic diseases, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, diabetes, hypertension, radiation and perineal trauma, traumatic injury to the iliohypogastric pudendal vacular system.\n \nii) Neurogenic etiologies such as spinal cord injuries or diseases of the central nervous system including multiple sclerosis, diabetes, Parkinsonism, cerebrovascular accidents, peripheral neuropathies, trauma or radical pelvic surgery.\n \niii) Hormonal/endocrine etiologies such as dysfunction of the hypothalamic/pituitary/gonadal axis, or dysfunction of the ovaries, dysfunction of the pancreas, surgical or medical castration, androgen deficiency, high circulating levels of prolactin eg hyperprolactinemia, natural menopause, premature ovarian failure, hyper and hypothyroidism.\n \niv) Psychogenic etiologies such as depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety disorder, postnatal depression/“Baby Blues”, emotional and relational issues, performance anxiety, marital discord, dysfunctional attitudes, sexual phobias, religious inhibition or a traumatic past experiences.\n \nv) Drug-induced sexual dysfunction resulting from therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRis) and other antidepressant therapies (tricyclics and major tranquillizers), anti-hypertensive therapies, sympatholytic drugs, chronic oral contraceptive pill therapy.\n \n \n \n\n\nMale sexual dysfunction (MSD) is generally associated with either erectile dysfunction, also known as male erectile dysfunction (MED) and/or ejaculatory disorders such as premature ejaculation, anorgasmia (unable to achieve orgasm) or desire disorders such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (lack of interest in sex), Patients with mild to moderate MED should benefit from treatment with a compound of formula (I) and patients with severe MED may also respond. However, early investigations suggest that the responder rate of patients with mild, moderate and severe MED will be greater in combination with a PDE5 inhibitor. Mild, moderate and severe MED will be terms known to the man skilled in the art, but guidance can be found in \nThe Journal of Urology\n, vol 151, 54-61 (Jan 1994).\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) find application in the following sub-populations of patients with MED: psychogenic, endocrinologic, neurogenic, arteriogenic, drug-induced sexual dysfunction (lactogenic) and sexual dysfunction related to cavernosal factors, particularly venogenic causes. These patient groups are described in more detail in Clinical Andrology vol 23, no. 4, p 773-782, and chapter 3 of the book by I. Eardley and K. Sethia “Erectile Dysfunction—Current Investigation and Management, published by Mosby-Wolfe.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs, may also be useful in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), overactive bladder (OAB) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).\n\n\nLUTS comprise three groups of urinary symptoms, which may be defined as storage (irritative), voiding (obstructive) and post-micturition symptoms. Storage symptoms comprise urgency, frequency, nocturia, urgency incontinence and stress incontinence, which can be associated with OAB and BPH. Voiding symptoms comprise hesitancy, poor flow, intermittency, straining and dysuria. Post-micturition symptoms comprise terminal dribbling, post-void dribbling and a sense of incomplete emptying.\n\n\nOver Active Bladder (OAB) is defined as urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia [Abrams et al, Neurourology and Urodynamics 21:167-178 (2002)]. Prevalence of OAB in men and women is similar, with approximately 16% of the population of the USA suffering from the condition [Stewart et al, Prevalence of Overactive Bladder in the United States: Results from the NOBLE Program; Abstract Presented at the 2\nnd \nInternational Consultation on Incontinence, July 2001, Paris, France].\n\n\nThe terms OAB Wet and OAB Dry describe OAB patients with or without urinary incontinence respectively. Until recently, the cardinal symptom of OAB was believed to be urinary incontinence. However, with the advent of the new terms this is clearly not meaningful for the large number of sufferers who are not incontinent (i.e. OAB Dry patients). Thus, a recent study from Liberman et al [‘Health Related Quality of Life Among Adults with Symptoms of Overactive Bladder: Results From A US Community-Based Survey’; Urology 57(6), 1044-1050, 2001] examined the impact of all OAB symptoms on the quality of life of a community-based sample of the US population. This study demonstrated that individuals suffering from OAB without any demonstrable loss of urine have an impaired quality of life when compared with controls.\n\n\nBPH is a chronically progressive disease that can lead to complications such as acute urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infections, bladder stones and renal dysfunction. The prevalence and average severity of LUTS associated with BPH in men increases with age. BPH leads to an increase in prostate volume, creating urethral and bladder outflow obstruction as well as secondary changes in bladder function. The effects of this are manifested by both storage (irritative) and voiding (obstructive) symptoms.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs, may also be useful in the treatment of psychotic disorders and conditions such as schizophrenia, delusional disorders and drug induced psychosis; anxiety disorders such as panic and obsessive-compulsive disorder; and movement disorders including Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.\n\n\nExamples of psychotic disorders that can be treated according to the present invention include, but are not limited to, schizophrenia, for example of the paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, or residual type; schizophreniform disorder; schizoaffective disorder, for example of the delusional type or the depressive type; delusional disorder; substance-induced psychotic disorder, for example psychosis induced by alcohol, amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, or phencyclidine; personality disorder of the paranoid type; and personality disorder of the schizoid type.\n\n\nIn use to treat psychotic disorders of the schizophrenic types, the compounds of formula (I) would be useful for removing or ameliorating such symptoms as anxiety, agitation, excessive aggression, tension, and social or emotional withdrawal in psychotic patients. In addition, the compounds of formula (I) may be useful in the blocking of serotonin-induced contractions of bronchial tissues and of blood vessels, arteries as well as veins. The compounds of formula (I) may also be useful as sedating-, anxiolytic-, anti-aggressive-, anti-stress-, muscular protectant-, and cardiovascular protectant agents and, consequently, they would be useful to protect warm-blooded animals, for example, in stress situations, e.g., during transport periods and the like situations.\n\n\nExamples of movement disorders that can be treated according to the present invention include, but are not limited to, Huntington's disease and dyskinesia associated with dopamine agonist therapy, Parkinson's disease, restless leg syndrome, and essential tremor.\n\n\nOther disorders that can be treated according to the present invention are obsessive/compulsive disorders, Tourette's syndrome and other tic disorders.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs, may also be useful in the treatment of an anxiety disorder or condition. Examples of anxiety disorders that can be treated according to the present invention include, but are not limited to, panic disorder, agoraphobia, a specific phobia, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs, may also be useful in the treatment of a drug addiction, for example an alcohol, amphetamine, cocaine, or opiate addiction. A “drug addiction”, as used herein, means an abnormal desire for a drug and is generally characterized by motivational disturbances such a compulsion to take the desired drug and episodes of intense drug craving.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs, may also be useful in the treatment of a disorder or condition comprising as a symptom a deficiency in attention and/or cognition. The phrase “deficiency in attention and/or cognition” as used herein in refers to a subnormal functioning in one or more cognitive aspects such as memory, intellect, or learning and logic ability, in a particular individual relative to other individuals within the same general age population. “Deficiency in attention and/or cognition” also refers to a reduction in any particular individual's functioning in one or more cognitive aspects, for example as occurs in age-related cognitive decline.\n\n\nExamples of disorders that comprise as a symptom a deficiency in attention and/or cognition that can be treated according to the present invention are dementia, for example Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, alcoholic dementia or other drug-related dementia, dementia associated with intracranial tumors or cerebral trauma, dementia associated with Huntington's disease or Parkinson's disease, or AIDS-related dementia; delirium; amnestic disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder; mental retardation; a learning disorder, for example reading disorder, mathematics disorder, or a disorder of written expression; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; age-related cognitive decline; cognitive deficits associated with psychoses, and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs, may also be useful in the treatment of a mood disorder or mood episode. Examples of mood disorders and mood episodes that can be treated according to the present invention include, but are not limited to, major depressive episode of the mild, moderate or severe type, a manic or mixed mood episode, a hypomanic mood episode; a depressive episode with atypical features; a depressive episode with melancholic features; a depressive episode with catatonic features; a mood episode with postpartum onset; post-stroke depression; major depressive disorder; dysthymic disorder; minor depressive disorder; premenstrual dysphoric disorder; post-psychotic depressive disorder of schizophrenia; a major depressive disorder superimposed on a psychotic disorder such as delusional disorder or schizophrenia; a bipolar disorder, for example bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, and cyclothymic disorder.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs, may also be useful in the treatment of a neurodegenerative disorder or condition. As used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, a “neurodegenerative disorder or condition” refers to a disorder or condition that is caused by the dysfunction and/or death of neurons in the central nervous system. The treatment of these disorders and conditions can be facilitated by administration of an agent which prevents the dysfunction or death of neurons at risk in these disorders or conditions and/or enhances the function of damaged or healthy neurons in such a way as to compensate for the loss of function caused by the dysfunction or death of at-risk neurons. The term “neurotrophic agent” as used herein refers to a substance or agent that has some or all of these properties.\n\n\nExamples of neurodegenerative disorders and conditions that can be treated according to the present invention include, but are not limited to, Parkinson's disease; Huntington's disease; dementia, for example Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, AIDS-related dementia, and Fronto temperal Dementia; neurodegeneration associated with cerebral trauma; neurodegeneration associated with stroke, neurodegeneration associated with cerebral infarct; hypoglycemia-induced neurodegeneration; neurodegeneration associated with epileptic seizure; neurodegeneration associated with neurotoxin poisoning; and multi-system atrophy.

Such formulations may be employed as fillers in soft or hard capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) and typically comprise a carrier, for example, water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, or a suitable oil, and one or more emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents. Liquid formulations may also be prepared by the reconstitution of a solid, for example, from a sachet.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may also be used in fast-dissolving, fast-disintegrating dosage forms such as those described in Expert Opinion in Therapeutic Patents, 11 (6), 981-986, by Liang and Chen (2001), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nFor tablet dosage forms, depending on dose, the drug may make up from 1 weight % to 80 weight % of the dosage form, more typically from 5 weight % to 60 weight % of the dosage form. In addition to the drug, tablets generally contain a disintegrant. Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, lower alkyl-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, starch, pregelatinised starch and sodium alginate. Generally, the disintegrant will comprise from 1 weight % to 25 weight %, preferably from 5 weight % to 20 weight % of the dosage form.\n\n\nBinders are generally used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation. Suitable binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, sugars, polyethylene glycol, natural and synthetic gums, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pregelatinised starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Tablets may also contain diluents, such as lactose (monohydrate, spray-dried monohydrate, anhydrous and the like), mannitol, xylitol, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate.\n\n\nTablets may also optionally comprise surface active agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80, and glidants such as silicon dioxide and talc. When present, surface active agents may comprise from 0.2 weight % to 5 weight % of the tablet, and glidants may comprise from 0.2 weight % to 1 weight % of the tablet.\n\n\nTablets also generally contain lubricants such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and mixtures of magnesium stearate with sodium lauryl sulphate. Lubricants generally comprise from 0.25 weight % to 10 weight %, preferably from 0.5 weight % to 3 weight % of the tablet.\n\n\nOther possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colourants, flavouring agents, preservatives and taste-masking agents.\n\n\nExemplary tablets contain up to about 80% drug, from about 10 weight % to about 90 weight % binder, from about 0 weight % to about 85 weight % diluent, from about 2 weight % to about 10 weight % disintegrant, and from about 0.25 weight % to about 10 weight % lubricant.\n\n\nTablet blends may be compressed directly or by roller to form tablets. Tablet blends or portions of blends may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt congealed, or extruded before tabletting. The final formulation may comprise one or more layers and may be coated or uncoated; it may even be encapsulated. The formulation of tablets is discussed in \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets\n, Vol. 1, by H. Lieberman and L. Lachman (Marcel Dekker, New York, 1980), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nConsumable oral films for human or veterinary use are typically pliable water-soluble or water-swellable thin film dosage forms which may be rapidly dissolving or mucoadhesive and typically comprise a compound of formula (I), a film-forming polymer, a binder, a solvent, a humectant, a plasticiser, a stabiliser or emulsifier, a viscosity-modifying agent and a solvent. Some components of the formulation may perform more than one function.\n\n\nThe compound of formula (I) may be water-soluble or insoluble. A water-soluble compound typically comprises from 1 weight % to 80 weight %, more typically from 20 weight % to 50 weight %, of the solutes. Less soluble compounds may comprise a greater proportion of the composition, typically up to 88 weight % of the solutes. Alternatively, the compound of formula (I) may be in the form of multiparticulate beads.\n\n\nThe film-forming polymer may be selected from natural polysaccharides, proteins, or synthetic hydrocolloids and is typically present in the range 0.01 to 99 weight %, more typically in the range 30 to 80 weight %.\n\n\nOther possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colorants, flavourings and flavour enhancers, preservatives, salivary stimulating agents, cooling agents, co-solvents (including oils), emollients, bulking agents, anti-foaming agents, surfactants and taste-masking agents.\n\n\nFilms in accordance with the invention are typically prepared by evaporative drying of thin aqueous films coated onto a peelable backing support or paper. This may be done in a drying oven or tunnel, typically a combined coater dryer, or by freeze-drying or vacuuming.\n\n\nSolid formulations for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nSuitable modified release formulations for the purposes of the invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,106,864, incorporated herein by reference. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found in \nPharmaceutical Technology On\n-\nline, \n25(2), 1-14, by Verma et al (2001), incorporated herein by reference. The use of chewing gum to achieve controlled release is described in WO 00/35298, incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nParenteral Administration\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ. Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular, intrasynovial and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.\n\n\nParenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water.\n\n\nThe preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilisation, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe solubility of compounds of formula (I) used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.\n\n\nFormulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. The compounds of formula (I) may be formulated as a suspension or as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropic liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug-coated stents and semi-solids and suspensions comprising drug-loaded poly(dl-lactic-coglycolic)acid (PGLA) microspheres.\n\n\nTopical Administration\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may also be administered topically, (intra)dermally, or transdermally, to the skin or mucosa. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibres, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Penetration enhancers may be incorporated—see, for example, J Pharm Sci, 88 (10), 955-958, by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nOther means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and microneedle or needle-free (e.g. Powderject™, Bioject™, etc.) injection.\n\n\nFormulations for topical administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nInhaled/Intranasal Administration\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler, as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane, or as nasal drops. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.\n\n\nThe pressurized container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of formula (I) comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilising, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid.\n\n\nPrior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.\n\n\nCapsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of formula (I), a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as l-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.\n\n\nA suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1 μg to 20 mg of the compound of formula (I) per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1 μl to 100 μl. A typical formulation may comprise a compound of formula (I), propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.\n\n\nSuitable flavours, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled/intranasal administration.\n\n\nFormulations for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, PGLA. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. In the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve which delivers a metered amount. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or “puff” containing from 1 μg to 10 mg of the compound of formula (I). The overall daily dose will typically be in the range 1 μg to 200 mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day.\n\n\nRectal/Intravaginal Administration\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate.\n\n\nFormulations for rectal/vaginal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nOcular/Aural Administration\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronised suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, gels, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis.\n\n\nFormulations for ocular/aural administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, or programmed release.\n\n\nOther Technologies\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.\n\n\nDrug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubiliser. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in International Patent Applications Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148, incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nKit-of-Parts\n\n\nInasmuch as it may desirable to administer a compound of formula (I) in combination with another therapeutic agent, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at feast one of which contains a compound of formula (I), may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions.\n\n\nThus the kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or prodrug or derivative thereof, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.\n\n\nThe kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically comprises directions for administration and may be provided with a so-called memory aid.\n\n\nDosage\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention can be administered to a patient at dosage levels in the range of from about 0.1 mg to about 1,000 mg per day (preferably, about 1 mg to about 500 mg per day, more preferably, about 25 mg to about 250 mg per day, most preferably about 5 mg to about 100 mg per day). For a normal adult human having a body weight of about 70 kg, a dosage in the range of from about 0.01 mg to about 20 mg per kilogram body weight is typically sufficient, depending, of course, on the mode of administration, the age, condition and weight of the patient, and will in any case be at the ultimate discretion of the physician. The total daily dose may be administered in single or divided doses.\n\n\nCombination Therapy\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or prodrugs may be administered alone or as part of a combination therapy. Thus included within the scope of the present invention are aspects comprising co-administration of, and compositions which contain, in addition to a compound of formula (I), one or more additional pharmaceutical agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered simultaneously or sequentially and in any order.

Additionally, the binding activity of a compound was determined by measuring its affinity for the human recombinant 5-HT\n2c \nreceptor membranes from Swiss 3T3 cells (Method 2).\n\n\nMethod 1\n\n\nThe agonist affinity of the compounds were tested by measuring their ability to induce a fluorescent based Ca\n2+\n mobilization signal in a FLIPR assay using CHO K1 cells expressing recombinant human 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor. Both agonist affinity (EC\n50\n) and efficacy (E\nmax\n) were determined.\n\n\nCell Culture\n\n\nChinese hamster ovary cells (CHO K1) stably transfected with the 5-HT\n2c \nreceptor were cultured under standard cell culture techniques. Specifically, cells were grown at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nin Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) culture media supplemented with 10% dialysed foetal calf serum (FCS), 1% non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 800 μg/mL geneticin and 50 μg/ml zeocin. Cells were harvested for passaging and storage using trypsin-EDTA, centrifugation and resuspension in culture medium. Cells were grown to 60-80% confluency, harvested and adjusted to 15-20×10\n6 \ncells/ml/vial in medium/10% DMSO and stored long-term at −80° C.\n\n\nPreparation of Cell Plates\n\n\nCells were seeded into black-walled clear-bottomed 384 well plates 24 h before use. Frozen cells were defrosted in a 37° C. water bath and immediately transferred into 1 mL/vial 37° C. culture medium, diluted to 10 ml and DMSO removed by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 15 ml/vial of cell culture medium, counted and adjusted to give 500,000 cells/mL (10,000 cells/well). 200 □L/well of cell suspension was added to the 384 well plates which were then incubated overnight at 37° C.\n\n\nPreparation of Compound Plates\n\n\nTest compounds were prepared at 4 mM in 100% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and diluted in Dulbeccos PBS (+CaCl\n2\n, +MgCl\n2\n) with 0.9% DMSO and 0.05% pluronic F-127 to give appropriate test concentrations. The maximum agonist response was determined with 5-HT at a final assay concentration of 10 μM in the diluent above. The minimum response was determined with Dulbeccos PBS (+CaCl\n2\n, +MgCl\n2\n) with 0.9% DMSO and 0.05% pluronic F-127. Test compounds, maximum and minimum controls were added to a 384 well polypropylene plate.\n\n\nPreparation of FLIPR Dye\n\n\nThe FLIPR calcium assay reagent was diluted with assay buffer (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS))/20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid (diluted with 1M Sodium hydroxide and DPBS (+CaCl\n2\n, +MgCl\n2\n)).\n\n\nRunning the Assay Using FLIPR\n\n\n20 μl/well FLIPR calcium assay reagent was added to the cell plates, which were incubated for 1 h at 37° C. Cell plates and compound plates were then transferred onto the FLIPR. The assay was run using the appropriate FLIPR program, which initiates the reaction by transferring 15 μL compound into the corresponding, well of the cell plate.\n\n\nData Analysis\n\n\nThe statistical parameter exported from each well was the max peak height of the response. The mean minimum was subtracted from all values and then the activity was expressed as a percentage of the mean maximal response to 10 μM 5-HT and dose-response curves plotted from which both agonist affinity (EC\n50\n) and efficacy (E\nmax\n) were determined.\n\n\nMethod 2\n\n\nThe compounds were tested for biological activity by their ability to inhibit binding of the radioligand \n3\nH-meselurgine at the human recombinant 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor expressed in the Swiss 3T3 cells using a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) technology.\n\n\nCell Culture\n\n\nSwiss 3T3 stably transfected with the 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor were cultured under standard cell culture techniques. Specifically, cells were grown in 50 mL growth medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) culture media supplemented with 10% dialysed foetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM penicillin/streptomycin and 20 μg/mL geneticin) in 225 cm\n2 \nflasks at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. Cells were grown to 60-80% confluency, harvested using trypsin-EDTA and pelleted by centrifugation for long-term storage at −80° C.\n\n\nCell Membrane Preparation\n\n\nCell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in 3 mL of membrane preparation buffer (see Media and Buffers for composition) per 1 mL of packed cell. The suspension was homogenised on ice for several 5 s intervals using a hand-held homogeniser. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4° C.\n\n\nThe supernatants were then collected and retained. Initial cell & nuclei pellets (P1) were subsequently rehomogenised and centrifuged using the conditions cited above, and the supernatants collected and pooled with those retained from the first spin.\n\n\nThe pooled supernatants were centrifuged at 19,500 rpm for 45 min at 4° C., and the supernatants discarded. The pellets (P2) were then resuspended in 3 mL of membrane preparation buffer per 1 mL of the original packed cell volume. Protein concentrations were subsequently measured and the membrane suspension was finally frozen in aliquots of set volume and stored at −80° C. prior to use in assays.\n\n\nDetermination of Optimal Assay Conditions for Individual Membranes\n\n\nFor each batch of membrane used, optimal concentrations of Polylysine YSi SPA beads and membrane were determined. The assay free radioligand concentration was expressed as a percentage of the total free radioligand concentration to give an estimate of the radioligand depletion. The radioligand depletion in the assay was less than 10% to ensure that there was sufficient radioligand available for binding.\n\n\nThe affinity of \n3\nH-meselurgine for the human recombinant 5-HT\n2c \nreceptor was determined for each membrane batch at the selected protein and bead concentrations. This was achieved by the determination of the K\nD\n, the concentration of free radioligand at which 50% of the receptor binding sites were occupied. The mean K\nD \nfor \n3\nH-meselurgine at a batch of membranes was determined from data from a minimum of three separate assays. The mean K\nD \nwas subsequently used for all assays using the membrane batch profiled to enable determination of K\ni \nvalues of compounds studied using the method determined by Cheng and Prussoff (Cheng Y C and Prusoff W H. Relationship between the inhibition constant (K\ni\n) and the concentration of inhibitor which causes 50% inhibition of an enzymatic reaction. Biochem Pharmacol 1973; 22:2099-3108.)\n\n\nAssay Protocol\n\n\nBead/Receptor Membrane Complex Preparation\n\n\nThe required amount of membrane, was thawed on ice and added to a pre-determined volume of bead suspension in 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. The beads were then pre-coupled by incubating the predetermined protein quantity per mg of bead on a roller 4° C. for 1 h. Subsequently, the bead/membrane complex was spun down at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in assay buffer at the specific concentration required for the final assay.\n\n\nLigand Preparation\n\n\nAn aliquot of [\n3\nH]-meselurgine stock was diluted in binding assay buffer to give a pre-determined final assay concentration less than the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) value.\n\n\nCompound Plate Preparation\n\n\nAll test compounds were prepared at a concentration of 4 mM in 100% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) from dry samples. Compounds were diluted in 2.5% DMSO in Dulbeccos PBS with 0.05% Pluronic F-127 to give appropriate test concentrations in a 384 well plate to give a final volume of 5 μL.\n\n\nThe same volume of assay buffer was added to specific wells of the plate to enable subsequent measurement of total radioligand binding. Furthermore, 5 μL of Mianserin at 25 μM (2.5 μM final assay concentration was subsequently added to pre-determined wells to determine non-specific binding (NSB).\n\n\nFor the assay, 20 μL of the corresponding bead/membrane complex was added to each well of the final assay plate, ensuring that the suspension was mixed well. 25 μL of \n3\nH-meselurgine was added to each well of the final assay plates (containing compound solutions). Subsequently, 25 μL of \n3\nH-meselurgine was added to each well of the final assay plates (containing compound solutions). The plates were then sealed and incubated, with shaking, for 2 h 30 min at room temperature. The plates were subsequently left to settle for 10 min with dark adaptation, prior to reading.\n\n\nData Analysis\n\n\nThe assay window (specific binding) per plate was calculated by subtracting the mean NSB readings (in counts per minute, or cpm) from the mean of total binding readings. Subsequently the cpm read per well (with mean NSB subtracted) were expressed as a percentage of the plate window to determine the amount of radioligand bound to the receptor-bead complex.\n\n\nThese values were plotted against the concentration of the compound tested and a sigmoidal inhibitory concentration effect curve was fitted to the data using a four-parameter logisitic equation and free-fitting parameters to give an IC\n50 \nvalue (the concentration of compound required to inhibit 50% of the specific binding at the 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor).\n\n\nThe inhibitory dissociation constant (K\ni\n) value was then calculated from the IC\n50 \nvalue using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.\n\n\nFollowing determination of individual K\ni \nvalues for compounds tested, an overall geometric mean was calculated together with 95% confidence intervals and n values, where n is the total number of individual K\ni \nvalues.\n\n\nBuffers\n\n\nMembrane Preparation Buffer\n\n\n50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 at room temperature, stored at 4° C.

The rabbits are tracheotomised using a Portex™ uncuffed endotracheal tube 3 ID (internal diameter), connected to ventilator and maintained at a ventilation rate of 30-40 breaths per minute, with an approximate tidal volume of 18-20 mL, and a maximum airway pressure of 10 cm H\n2\nO. Anaesthesia is then switched to Isoflurane® and ventilation continued with O\n2 \nat 2 l/min. The right marginal ear vein is cannulated using a 23 G or 24 G catheter, and Lactated Ringer solution perfused at 0.5 mL/min. The rabbit is maintained at 3% Isoflurane® during invasive surgery, dropping to 2% for maintenance anaesthesia.\n\n\nThe left groin area of the rabbit is shaved and a vertical incision is made approximately 5 cm in length along the thigh. The femoral vein and artery are exposed, isolated and then cannulated with a PVC catheter (17 G) for the infusion of drugs and compounds. Cannulation is repeated for the femoral artery, inserting the catheter to a depth of 10 cm to ensure that the catheter has reached the abdominal aorta. This arterial catheter is linked to a Gould system to record blood pressure. Samples for blood gas analysis are also taken via the arterial catheter. Systolic and diastolic pressures are measured, and the mean arterial pressure calculated using the formula (diastolic×2+systolic)÷3. Heart rate is measured via the pulse oxymeter and Po-ne-mah data acquisition software system (Ponemah Physiology Platform, Gould Instrument Systems Inc).\n\n\nA ventral midline incision is made into the abdominal cavity. The incision is about 5 cm in length just above the pubis. The fat and muscle is bluntly dissected away to reveal the hypogastric nerve which runs down the body cavity. It is essential to keep close to the side curve of the pubis wall in order to avoid damaging the femoral vein and artery, which lie above the pubis. The sciatic and pelvic nerves lie deeper and are located after further dissection on the dorsal side of the rabbit. Once the sciatic nerve is identified, the pelvic nerve is easily located. The term pelvic nerve is loosely applied; anatomy books on the subject fail to identify the nerves in sufficient detail. However, stimulation of the nerve causes an increase in vaginal and clitoral blood flow, and innervation of the pelvic region. The pelvic nerve is freed away from surrounding tissue and a Harvard bipolar stimulating electrode is placed around the nerve. The nerve is slightly lifted to give some tension, then the electrode is secured in position. Approximately 1 mL of light paraffin oil is placed around the nerve and electrode. This acts as a protective lubricant to the nerve and prevents blood contamination of the electrode. The electrode is connected to a Grass S88 Stimulator. The pelvic nerve is stimulated using the following parameters: −5V pulse width 0.5 ms, duration of stimulus 10 s and a frequency range of 2 to 16 Hz. Reproducible responses are obtained when the nerve is stimulated every 15-20 min. A frequency response curve is determined at the start of each experiment in order to determine the optimum frequency to use as a sub-maximal response, normally 4 Hz. A ventral midline incision is made, at the caudal end of the pubis, to expose the pubic area. Connective tissue is removed to expose the tunica of the clitoris, ensuring that the wall is free from small blood vessels. The external vaginal wall is also exposed by removing any connective tissue. One laser Doppler flow probe is inserted 3 cm into the vagina, so that half the probe shaft is still visible. A second probe is positioned so that it lay just above the external clitoral wall. The position of these probes is then adjusted until a signal is obtained. A second probe is placed just above the surface of a blood vessel on the external vaginal wall. Both probes are clamped in position.\n\n\nVaginal and clitoral blood flow is recorded either as numbers directly from the Flowmeter using Po-ne-mah data acquisition software (Ponemah Physiology Platform, Gould Instrument Systems Inc), or indirectly from Gould chart recorder trace. Calibration is set at the beginning of the experiment (0-125 mL/min/100 g tissue). All data are reported as mean±standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). Significant changes are identified using Student's t-tests.\n\n\nMED Method\n\n\nThe antidepressant trazodone and its non-selective 5-HT\n2 \nagonist metabolite, m-CPP, are associated with proerectile activity in man. Studies have shown that m-CPP, a non selective 5-HT\n2 \nreceptor agonist and the selective 5-HT\n2 \nagonist, Ro-60-0175 enhance penile erection in conscious rats and monkeys following i.v., i.p., s.c. or i.m. administration. These responses are blocked by 5-HT\n2B/2C \nantagonists but not by 5-HT\n2B \nor 5-HT\n2A \nantagonists. Further data from Nortran Pharmaceuticals demonstrates that centrally-acting non selective 5-HT\n2C \nagonists (e.g. RSD992) induced erection and facilitated male copulatory behaviour in rodents and primates, with little effect in the absence of a female. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the compounds of formula (I) would be useful for treatment of male erectile dysfunction.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may be screened for effect of penile intracavernosal pressure (ICP) in the conscious male rat according to the methods described hereinbelow.\n\n\nICP Protocol: Intra cavernosal pressure (ICP) can be measured in the conscious rat by means of telemetric recording. A catheter is surgically implanted into the corpus cavernosum. The end of the catheter is linked to a device, which senses, processes, and transmits information digitally from within the animal. A receiver converts the radio-frequency signal from the implant to a digital pulse stream that is readable by a data collection system. The PC-based system collects telemetred data from the animal.\n\n\nSurgery: Induce and maintain general anaesthesia using 5% Isoflurane® in a carrier gas of 0.5 liter/minute oxygen and 1 liter/minute nitrous oxide to induce anaesthesia, reducing to 2% Isoflurane for maintenance anaesthesia. Administer 5 mg/kg sub cutaneously (s.c.) Carprofen (Rimadyl® Large Animal Injection, 50 mg/mL, Pfizer Animal Health) at induction of anaesthesia, at end of day of surgery and on the morning of first day post-surgery to minimize pain and discomfort.\n\n\nImplantation of corpus cavernosal probe: Shave the skin of the ventral abdomen and extend to include the area around the penis and ventral scrotum. Clean and disinfect the shaved area. Place the rat in dorsal recumbency. Make a mid-line incision from the external base of the penis, running caudally for approximately 2 cm. Locate and expose the internal structure of the penis and identify the corpus cavernosum. Make a mid-line laparotomy, approximately 4 cm in length to access the abdominal cavity. Pierce the abdominal wall via the caudal incision with a suitable trocar and cannula, taking care not to damage any internal organs. Place the implant body in the abdominal cavity with the catheter orientated caudally and pass the catheter tip through the body wall via the preplaced cannula. A model TA11PA-C40, 8 mm catheter implant may be used with a modified 3 mm tip (Data Sciences International Inc.). Secure the implant body to the abdominal wall using non-absorbable sutures and partially close the abdominal incision. Reflect the tip of the penis cranially and retract the caudal incision to optimize the surgical field. Carefully isolate approximately 10 mm of the internal structure of the penis from the surrounding tissue. Carefully reflect the corpus spongiosum to one side to give access to the corpus cavernosum. Access the corpus cavernosum using a modified over-the-needle catheter to puncture the tunica. Introduce the catheter tip via the preplaced catheter and advance until fully inserted. Carefully remove the access catheter and apply a suitable tissue adhesive to the insertion site. Observe for leakage. Close the subcutaneous fat layer in the caudal incision before closing with an appropriate absorbable suture. Instil approximately 5 mL of warm saline through the abdominal incision and complete closure of the mid-line incision. Close the skin incision with an appropriate absorbable suture.\n\n\nPostoperative care: Measure food and water intake and monitor bodyweight daily for at least 7 days post surgery, then 2-3 times weekly. Give Lectade® (Pfizer Animal Health) in drinking water for 3 days post surgery. House rats singly, and transfer to reverse light/dark conditions 5 days post surgery. Named Veterinary Surgeon (or Deputy) to issue a certificate of fitness to continue 2 days post surgery. Start using rats experimentally 7 days post surgery.\n\n\nExperimental Procedure: Perform experiment in room with reverse light/dark conditions. On day of experiment, place rat in home cage on receiver pad (PhysioTel® Model RPC-1, Data Sciences International Inc.) and leave to acclimatize for approximately one hour. Ensure that the rat has food and water ad lib. Take baseline reading of intra cavernosal pressure (ICP) for approximately 5 minutes. Transfer the data via a floppy disk to an Excel spreadsheet. Inject the rat with compound subcutaneously or via the jugular vein catheter (JVC). If using the JVC, flush through with sterile saline after dosing and seal with a saline/glucose lock solution. The interval between administration of compound and ICP measurement will vary with the compound to be tested. An interval of 30-60 min post s.c. injection is a good guide. The test compounds are dissolved in 50% β-cyclodextrin in saline. They are administered at a dose of 5-10 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.). Apomorphine hydrochloride hemihydrate (Sigma™ A-4393) at 60 μg/kg s.c. is used as a positive control as it has pro-erectile properties. Record ICP over a 15 min period, starting at 30 min post injection i.e. from 30 to 35 minutes and repeat for two further 15 min periods commencing at 60 min post injection and 120 minutes post injection respectively. Record ICP for 15 min: A signal from the receiver pad feeds through to the Data Exchange Matrix® and hence to the software (Dataquest ART® acquisition system, Data Sciences International Inc.). Transfer the data via a floppy disk to an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.\n\n\nCombination with PDE51 for Treatment of MED\n\n\nThe effects of concomitant administration of a compound of formula (I) in combination with a PDE5 inhibitor on the penile intracavernosal pressure (ICP) in an anaesthetised rabbit model of erection can be measured according to the following protocol.\n\n\nExperimental Protocol\n\n\nMale New Zealand rabbits (˜2.5kg) are pre-medicated with a combination of Medetomidine (Domitor®) 0.5 mL/kg inramuscularly (i.m.), and Ketamine (Vetalar®) 0.25 mL/kg i.m. whilst maintaining oxygen intake via a face mask. The rabbits are tracheotomised using a Portex™ uncuffed endotracheal tube 3 ID (internal diameter), connected to ventilator and maintained at a ventilation rate of 30-40 breaths per minute, with an approximate tidal volume of 18-20 mL, and a maximum airway pressure of 10 cm H\n2\nO. Anaesthesia is then switched to Isoflurane® and ventilation continued with O\n2 \nat 2 litres/min. The right marginal ear vein is cannulated using a 23 G or 24 G catheter, and Lactated Ringer solution perfused at 0.5 mL/min. The rabbit is maintained at 3% Isoflurane during invasive surgery, dropping to 2% for maintenance anaesthesia. The left jugular vein is exposed, isolated and then cannulated with a PVC catheter (17 gauge/17 G) for the infusion of drugs and the test compounds.\n\n\nThe left groin area of the rabbit is shaved and a vertical incision is made approximately 5 cm in length along the thigh. The femoral vein and artery are exposed, isolated and then cannulated with a polyvinylchloride (PVC) catheter (17 G) for the infusion of drugs and compounds. Cannulation is repeated for the femoral artery, inserting the catheter to a depth of 10 cm to ensure that the catheter reaches the abdominal aorta. This arterial catheter is linked to a Gould system to record blood pressure. Samples for blood gas analysis are also taken via the arterial catheter. Systolic and diastolic pressures are measured, and the mean arterial pressure calculated using the formula (diastolic×2+systolic)÷3. Heart rate is measured via the pulse oxymeter and a Po-ne-mah data acquisition software system (Ponemah Physiology Platform, Gould Instrument Systems Inc).\n\n\nA ventral midline incision is made into the abdominal cavity. The incision is about 5 cm in length just above the pubis. The fat and muscle is bluntly dissected away to reveal the hypogastric nerve which runs down the body cavity. It is essential to keep close to the side curve of the pubis wall in order to avoid damaging the femoral vein and artery which lie above the pubis. The sciatic and pelvic nerves lie deeper and are located after further dissection on the dorsal side of the rabbit. Once the sciatic nerve is identified, the pelvic nerve is easily located. The term pelvic nerve is loosely applied; anatomy books on the subject fail to identify the nerves in sufficient detail. However, stimulation of the nerve causes an increase in intracavernosal pressure and cavernosal blood flow, and innervation of the pelvic region. The pelvic nerve is freed away from surrounding tissue and a Harvard bipolar stimulating electrode is placed around the nerve. The nerve is slightly lifted to give some tension, then the electrode is secured in position. Approximately 1 mL of light paraffin oil is placed around the nerve and electrode. This acts as a protective lubricant to the nerve and prevents blood contamination of the electrode. The electrode is connected to a Grass S88 Stimulator. The pelvic nerve is stimulated using the following parameters: −5V, pulse width 0.5 ms, duration of stimulus 20 s with a frequency of 16 Hz. Reproducible responses are obtained when the nerve is stimulated every 15-20 min. Several stimulations using the above parameters are performed to establish a mean control response. The compounds to be tested are infused, via the jugular vein, using a Harvard 22 infusion pump allowing a continuous 15 min stimulation cycle. The skin and connective tissue around the penis is removed to expose the penis. A catheter set (Insyte-W, Becton-Dickinson 20 Gauge 1.1×48 mm) is inserted through the tunica albica into the left corpus cavernosal space and the needle removed, leaving a flexible catheter. This catheter is linked via a pressure transducer (Ohmeda 5299-04) to a Gould system to record intracavernosal pressure (ICP). Once an intracavernosal pressure is established, the catheter is sealed in place using Vetbond (tissue adhesive, 3M). Heart rate is measured via the pulse oxymeter and a Po-ne-mah data acquisition software system (Ponemah Physiology Platform, Gould Instrument Systems Inc).\n\n\nIntracavernosal blood flow is recorded either as numbers directly from the Flowmeter using Po-ne-mah data acquisition software (Ponemah Physiology Platform, Gould Instrument Systems Inc), or indirectly from Gould chart recorder trace. Calibration is set at the beginning of the experiment (0-125 mL/min/100 g tissue).\n\n\nAll data is reported as mean±s.e.m. (standard error of the mean). Significant changes are identified using Student's t-tests. The test compounds are dissolved in 50% β-cyclodextrin in saline. They are administered at a dose of 5-10 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.).\n\n\nObesity and Related Disorders\n\n\nThe practice of the present invention for treating obesity or related eating disorders (including promoting weight loss or reducing weight gain) can be evidenced by activity in one or both of the protocols described hereinbelow.\n\n\nSpontaneous Food Intake\n\n\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats may be obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, Mass.). The rats are individually housed and fed powdered chow. They are maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle and receive food and water ad libitum. The animals are acclimated to the vivarium for a period of one week before, testing is conducted. Rats are transferred to individual test cages 30 h before the study. The rats are administered test compound or vehicle alone (no compound) 15-30 min prior to the onset of the dark cycle. The test compounds are dosed at ranges between 0.1 and 100 mg/kg depending upon the compound. The standard vehicle is 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose or 30% β-cyclodextrin in water and the standard route of administration is oral. However, different vehicles and routes of administration are used to accommodate various compounds when required.\n\n\nFood intake is monitored using an automated Columbus Instruments system (Columbus, OH). Individual rat food intake is recorded continuously at 10 min intervals, starting at the time of dosing, for a period of at least 12 h. Compound efficacy is determined by comparing the food intake pattern of compound-treated rats to vehicle.\n\n\nOxygen Consumption\n\n\nWhole body oxygen consumption is measured using an indirect calorimeter (Oxymax from Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) in male Sprague Dawley rats (if another rat strain or female rats is used, it will be specified). Rats (300-380 g body weight) are placed in the calorimeter chambers and the chambers are placed in activity monitors. These studies are done during the light cycle. Prior to the measurement of oxygen consumption, the rats are fed standard chow ad libitum. During the measurement of oxygen consumption, food is not available. Basal pre-dose oxygen consumption and ambulatory activity are measured every 10 min for 2.5 to 3 h. At the end of the basal pre-dosing period, the chambers are opened and the animals are administered a single dose of compound (the usual dose range is 0.001 to 10 mg/kg) by oral gavage (or other route of administration as specified, i.e. s.c., i.p., i.v.). Drugs are prepared in methylcellulose, water or other specified vehicle (examples include PEG400, 30% beta-cyclo dextran and propylene glycol). Oxygen consumption and ambulatory activity are measured every 10 min for an additional 1-6 h post-dosing.\n\n\nThe Oxymax calorimeter software calculates the oxygen consumption (mL/kg/h) based on the flow rate of air through the chambers and difference in oxygen content at inlet and output ports. The activity monitors have 15 infrared light beams spaced one inch apart on each axis, ambulatory activity is recorded when two consecutive beams are broken and the results are recorded as counts.\n\n\nResting oxygen consumption, during pre- and post-dosing, is calculated by averaging the 10-min O\n2 \nconsumption values, excluding periods of high ambulatory activity (ambulatory activity count>100) and excluding the first 5 values of the pre-dose period and the first value from the post-dose period. Change in oxygen consumption is reported as percent and is calculated by dividing the post-dosing resting oxygen consumption by the pre-dose oxygen consumption×100. Experiments will typically be done with n=4-6 rats and results reported are mean±SEM.\n\n\nAn increase in oxygen consumption of >10% is considered a positive result. Historically, vehicle-treated rats have no change in oxygen consumption from pre-dose basal.\n\n\nSchizophrenia and Related Disorders\n\n\nThe practice of the present invention for treating schizophrenia and related disorders can be evidenced by activity in the protocol described hereinbelow. For example, the compounds of formula (I) may be assessed in a number of standard behavioral tests predictive of antipsychotic activity. For example, apomorphine-induced climbing behavior and hypothermia in mice (see, e.g., Moore, N. A. et al. \nPsychopharmacology \n94 (2), 263-266 (1988), and 96, 539 (1988)). Conditioned Avoidance Responding (inhibition of CAR) has been a classic and effective test used for the detection of drugs with potential antipsychotic activity, primarily developed to test neuroleptics acting through dopamine receptor blockade). Similarly, d-Amphetamine locomotor (antagonism of the increased activity produced by d-amphetamine to show dopamine receptor blockade) and PCP locomotor (antagonism of the increased activity produced by the activation of dopamine neuronal function by the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist; phencyclidine (PCP)) assays can be used to predict anti-psychotic activity.\n\n\nLocomotor Activity\n\n\nThe locomotor activity boxes consist of 48 individual plexiglass behavioral chambers (30 cm×30 cm) enclosed in sound attenuating cabinets. A single 10 watt bulb in each cabinet is controlled by a 24 h timer, which allows the behavioral to be maintained on any light/dark cycle desired. The plexiglass chambers are fitted with grid floors which are divided into quadrants and a metal touchplate positioned 7 cm from the floor on all four walls of the chamber. Horizontal locomotor activity is measured as the number of cross-avers an animal makes from one quadrant to another within its chamber. When the animal stands up (rears) and makes contact with the metal touchplate it is recorded by the computer as vertical locomotor activity. Subjects are placed in the chambers overnight (approx. 15 h) prior to the experiment. The next day each animal is weighed and treated with the test compound and then immediately returned to the test chamber. At a set pretreatment time, subjects are removed from the test chamber and treated with phencyclidine hydrochloride (3.2 mg/kg, s.c.), or d-Amphetamine sulphate (1 mg/kg, s.c.) and then immediately returned to the test chamber. Horizontal movements (cross-overs) are recorded by a computer for a three-hour test period.\n\n\nIn order to measure spontaneous locomotor activity, each animal is weighed and treated with the test compound one hour prior to being placed in the activity box. The test is always started as soon after the dark cycle (4 pm) as possible so that the effects of the compound can be observed during the animals' most active time. The apparatus is programmed to collect data overnight for a 12 h period.\n\n\nThe computer is programmed to perform statistical analysis at given intervals. A one-way ANOVA is used to determine whether a difference due to treatment exists and is followed by Dunnett's multiple range test to determine differences between the control and experimental groups. Timed intervals of data (cross-avers) are analyzed individually and cumulatively for the duration of the experiment.\n\n\nConditioned Avoidance Response\n\n\nMale CF rats (Charles River, Fisher-344 strain) are used in all experiments. Weights are approximately 350-400 g at the time of testing. Animals are housed 2 per cage in environmentally controlled animal quarters (light/dark-4 am/4 pm). The conditioned avoidance shuttle chambers consist of 8 individual Plexiglas behavior chambers (Coulbourn Instruments™) each divided by a guillotine door into two sides, enclosed in sound attenuating cabinets. The Plexiglas chambers are fitted with metal grid floors, which are equipped with scrambled/constant current shockers.\n\n\nRats are trained to avoid the onset of footshock (1.5 mA, preceded for 5 s by activation of house lights, que lights, and the opening of the guillotine door) by moving to the opposite side of the chamber. Thirty trials are completed per daily session, and the number of avoidance's (max 30), escapes (max 30), escape failures (max 30), latency to avoid (max 5 s.), latency to escape (max. 10 s.), and adaptation crossovers (number of crossovers for a 5 min period before the onset of trials, dark chamber) are recorded by the computer program. Inter-trial intervals are 15 s with the guillotine door closed. Drug treatment begins (30 min prior to session, s.c.) when rats have reached criteria of 80% avoidances for a session. Testing is performed during the lights on period of the light/dark cycle, typically between 8 am and 10 am.\n\n\nVehicle treatment is performed one day every week and statistical analysis is done comparing each drug treatment on separate days vs. the vehicle treatment that week. Testing is performed during the lights on period of the light/dark cycle, typically between 8 am and 10 am. The data is analyzed following importation into a spreadsheet using a t-test.\n\n\nAnxiety and Related Disorders\n\n\nActivity of compounds of the present invention for the treatment of anxiety and related disorders can be demonstrated in models using well-established procedures. For example, the following model may be used.\n\n\nAcute Stress-Related Cerebellar cGMP Assay\n\n\nAcute Stress Procedure: CF-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories) weighing 19-22 g are ordered one week prior to testing and are handled for two days before the experiment to reduce stress-related changes in basal cGMP levels. Animals are housed on a 12 hr light:dark schedule (6 a-6 p) in a temperature and humidity controlled room with free access to food and water.\n\n\nAfter dosing (typically 30-60 min depending on drug), animals to be stressed are placed into a Coulbourn chamber with a steel grid floor and shocked at 1 mA for 10 seconds. Immediately following the stressor mice are placed into a plastic restraint tube and sacrificed using a beam of microwave irradiation focused on the head (2.0 kW for 0.9 sec) using a Gerling-Moore Metabostat. The cerebellum is then rapidly removed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 C prior to the cGMP assay. Non-stressed animals are taken directly from their home cages, sacrificed by microwave irradiation and processed the same.\n\n\ncGMP Assay: Whole cerebella are weighed and then homogenized in 1 ml of 1% perchloric acid in dd-water using a Brinkman Polytron at 15,000 rpm for about 15 sec each and placed on ice until all samples are homogenized.\n\n\nSamples are then placed into an 85 C water bath for 5 min, centrifuged at 2500×g for 15 min at 4 C, and about 0.5 ml of the supernatant is collected for analysis.\n\n\nSupernatants are diluted 1:5 in 0.05M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.8). All other assay steps proceed according to the directions of the manufacturer of the cGMP EIA kits (Amersham Biosciences). Diluted samples are incubated overnight in treated 96-well plates and processed the following day. Samples are read at 450 nm optical wavelength and converted to pmol cGMP/mg tissue using a standard curve generated in the same experiment.\n\n\nLower Urinary Tract Symptoms\n\n\nKnown 5-HT\n2c \nagonists (e.g., m-CPP, Ro 60-0175, YM348) have shown doses related increases in bladder capacity and urethral EMG activity in the anaesthetized guinea-pg cystometry and urethral EMG models. These effects were dose dependently abolished by a selective 5-HT\n2c \nantagonist. In the anaesthetized dog urethral pressure model, which has been validated for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) with duloxetine, the 5-HT\n2c \nagonist Ro60-0175 increased urethral pressure in a dose-dependent manner, with at least similar efficacy to duloxetine. Hence, it is reasonable to believe that the compounds of formula (I) would be useful for the treatment of conditions involving lower urinary tract dysfunction.\n\n\nActivity of the compounds of formula (I) for lower urinary tract function, and thus their potential usefulness in treating conditions involving lower urinary tract dysfunction, can be investigated and assessed utilizing a number of standard in vivo models known to those skilled in the art and frequently described in the literature (Morrison, J., et al., Neurophysiology and Neuropharmacology. In: Incontinence, Ed. Abrams, P., Cardozo, C., Khoury, S. and Wein, A. Report of the World Health Organisation Consensus Conference. Paris, France: Health Publications Ltd., 2002: 83-163; Brune M E et al. Comparison of alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists in canine urethral pressure profilometry and abdominal leak point pressure models. J Urol. 2001, 166:1555-9). As an example the compounds of formula (I) can be tested for such effects in the models described herein below.\n\n\nInvestigation of Bladder Capacity and External Urethral Sphincter (EUS) Function in the Guinea-Pig\n\n\nExperiments are performed in adult female guinea pigs, weighing approx 500 g. All animals are initially anaesthetised with halothane (4%), carried in oxygen (3-4 L min\n−1\n) and maintained at an appropriate surgical plane with urethane (25% w/v; 0.5 mL 100 g\n−1 \nbody weight). The trachea, a jugular vein and a carotid artery are cannulated for respiratory ventilation, injection of test compound and monitoring of blood pressure, respectively. A midline laporatomy is performed to expose the urinary bladder and a cystometry tube inserted through a small incision in the dome of the bladder and secured in place. The abdominal wound is then closed tightly around the externalised cystometry tube, which, in turn, is connected to an infusion pump and pressure transducer, for filling the bladder and recording intravesical pressure, respectively. Electromyographic (EMG) wire leads are inserted into the EUS striated muscle layer opposed to the dorsal surface of the symphysis pubis. The EMG leads are connected to an appropriate amplification and electrical filter system and changes in EUS electrical activity displayed on an oscilloscope and recorded through appropriate computer software.\n\n\nFollowing a 30 min post surgery stabilization period, the bladder is filled at a rate of 150 μl min\n−1 \nwith physiological saline (room temperature), until initiation of a micturition reflex is observed. Following micturition, the bladder is drained via the externalised cystometry tube. Bladder filling is then repeated at least 3 times (or until repeatable filling cycles are achieved) in order to establish a mean bladder threshold capacity for initiation of micturition. EUS EMG activity and intravesical (bladder) pressure are recorded throughout bladder filling. Subsequently, test compound or vehicle is injected intravenously utilizing either a bolus dose or constant infusion and bladder filling re-initiated (150 μl min\n−1\n) until micturition occurs, the bladder is then drained as before and the process repeated with addition of increasing doses of test compound (2 micturition responses are measured at each compound concentration). Changes in threshold bladder capacity initiating micturition and/or in EUS EMG activity are indicative of compound activity on lower urinary tract function.\n\n\nInvestigation of Abdominal Leak Point Pressure in the Guinea-Pig\n\n\nExperiments are performed in adult female guinea pigs, weighing approx 500 g. All animals are initially anaesthetized with halothane (4%), carried in oxygen (3-4 L min\n−1\n) and maintained at an appropriate surgical plane with urethane (25% w/v; 0.5 mL 100 g\n−1 \nbody weight). The trachea, a jugular vein and a carotid artery are cannulated for respiratory ventilation, injection of test compound and monitoring of blood pressure, respectively. A midline laporatomy is performed to expose the urinary bladder and a cystometry tube inserted through a small incision in the dome of the bladder and secured in place. The abdominal wound is then closed tightly around the externalised cystometry tube, which, in turn, is connected to an infusion pump and pressure transducer, for filling the bladder and recording intravesical pressure, respectively. Electromyographic (EMG) wire leads are inserted into the EUS striated muscle layer opposed to the dorsal surface of the symphysis pubis. The EMG leads are connected to an appropriate amplification and electrical filter system and changes in EUS electrical activity displayed on an oscilloscope and recorded through appropriate computer software.\n\n\nFollowing a 30 min post surgery stabilization period, the bladder is filled at a rate of 150 μl min\n−1 \nwith physiological saline (room temperature), until initiation of a micturition reflex is observed. Following micturition, the bladder is drained via the externalized cystometry tube. Bladder filling is then repeated at least 3 times (or until repeatable filling cycles are achieved) in order to establish a mean bladder threshold capacity for initiation of micturition. EUS EMG activity and intravesical (bladder) pressure are recorded throughout bladder filling. Subsequently, the bladder is filled (150 μl min\n−1\n) to 75% of this threshold volume with physiological saline and, through the use of a specially constructed frame, increasing weight is applied to the ventral surface of the abdomen of the animal just rostral to the position of the bladder until leakage of fluid is observed at the urethral meatus. This process is repeated at least 3 times in order to establish control responses; EUS EMG activity and intravesical pressure being recorded throughout. Subsequently increasing concentrations of test compound or vehicle is injected intravenously utilizing either a bolus dose or constant infusion and weight induced leak responses re-investigated at each concentration. Changes in the abdominal weight required to induce leak and/or the maximum EUS EMG activity recorded immediately prior to leak are indicative of compound activity on lower urinary tract function.\n\n\nInvestigation of Guinea-Pig Urethral Pressure Profilometry:\n\n\nExperiments are performed in adult female guinea pigs, weighing approx 500 g. All animals are initially anaesthetized with halothane (4%), carried in oxygen (3-4 L min\n−1\n) and maintained at an appropriate surgical plane with urethane (25% wlv; 0.5 mL 100 g\n−1 \nbody weight). The trachea, a jugular vein and a carotid artery are cannulated for respiratory ventilation, injection of test compound and monitoring of blood pressure, respectively. A midline laporatomy is performed to expose the urinary bladder and a cystometry tube inserted through a small incision in the dome of the bladder and secured in place. The abdominal wound is then closed tightly around the externalised cystometry tube, which, in turn, is connected to an infusion pump and pressure transducer, for filling the bladder and recording intravesical pressure, respectively. Electromyographic (EMG) wire leads are inserted into the EUS striated muscle layer opposed to the dorsal surface of the symphysis pubis. The EMG leads are connected to an appropriate amplification and electrical filter system and changes in EUS electrical activity displayed on an oscilloscope and recorded through appropriate computer software.\n\n\nFollowing a 30 min post surgery stabilization period, the bladder is filled at a rate of 150 μl min\n−1 \nwith physiological saline (room temperature), until initiation of a micturition reflex is observed. Following micturition, the bladder is drained via the externalized cystometry tube. Bladder filling is then repeated at least 3 times (or until repeatable filling cycles are achieved) in order to establish a mean bladder threshold capacity for initiation of micturition. Subsequently, the bladder is filled (150 μl min\n−1\n) to 75% of this threshold volume and urethral tone (peak urethral pressure (PUP), functional urethral length (FUL) and closing pressure (CP)) assessed with the aid of a 3F Millar pressure transducer (Millar Instruments, Texas, US) inserted into the bladder through the external meatus. The urethral Millar pressure transducer is then retracted along the length of the urethra (urethral pull through) at a rate of 1 cm/min enabling the determination of PUP, FUL and CP. Urethral pull throughs are repeated every 2 min until 4 reproducible urethral profiles are observed. Subsequently increasing concentrations of test compound or vehicle is injected intravenously utilising either a bolus dose or constant infusion and a further 4 urethral pull throughs carried out at each concentration investigated. Changes in the PUP, FUL, CP or EUS EMG activity are indicative of compound activity on lower urinary tract function.\n\n\nInvestigation of Dog Urethral Pressure Profilometry\n\n\nFemale beagle dogs (10-15 kg) are anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (60 mg/mL solution) administered intravenously (IV) at 0.5 mL/kg via the right cephalic vein. Immediately following induction of anaesthesia the dog is intubated and respiration supported by artificial ventilation with oxygen. End tidal CO\n2 \nis monitored continuously, using a Datex CO\n2\n/O\n2 \nmonitor and maintained between 4.5 and 4.8% and body temperature maintained between 37° C. and 38° C. An incision is made in the right medial thigh and a polyethylene catheter (6F) inserted into the right femoral vein for administration of compounds and fluid maintenance; immediately venous access is achieved a bolus IV dose of α-chloralose (1% wlv) is administered at 35 mg/kg. A polyethylene catheter (4F) is inserted into the right femoral artery for blood sampling. An incision is made in the right foreleg and the brachial vein and artery isolated, maintenance of anaesthesia is achieved with α-chloralose/borax administered IV at the rate of 10 mg/kg/h via a polyethylene catheter (6F) inserted into the right brachial vein. A laparotomy is performed from the umbilicus to the top of the pubic symphysis via the midline to expose the peritoneum in order to expose the bladder. Both ureters are cannulated towards the kidneys with polyethylene catheters (6F) and urine collected externally; the bladder is catheterized through the dome with a polyethylene catheter (6F), which is in turn connected to a pressure transducer. In order to maintain constant bladder pressure at 10-15 mmHg, urine is removed and ambient temperature saline infused into the bladder. Immediately following the completion of the surgical procedures a further bolus dose of α-chloralose/borax solution is administered IV at 35 mg/kg and the animal allowed to stabilise for a period period ca. 1 h, during which time haemodynamic and urological parameters were monitored.\n\n\nUrethral tone (peak urethral pressure (PUP), functional urethral length (FUL) and closing pressure (CP)) is assessed with the aid of an 8F Millar pressure transducer (Millar Instruments, Texas, US) inserted into the bladder through the external meatus. The urethral Millar pressure transducer is then retracted along the length of the urethra (urethral pull through) at a rate of 1 cm/min enabling the determination of PUP, FUL and CP. Urethral pull throughs are repeated every 6 min until 4 reproducible urethral profiles are observed. Subsequently increasing concentrations of test compound or vehicle is injected intravenously utilising either a bolus dose or constant infusion and a further 4 urethral pull throughs carried out at each concentration investigated. Changes in the PUP, FUL or CP are indicative of compound activity on lower urinary tract function.\n\n\nInvestigation of Bladder Capacity and External Urethral Sphincter (EUS) Function in the Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat\n\n\nExperiments are performed in adult female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), weighing approx 250-300 g. All animals are initially anaesthetized with isoflurane (4%), carried in oxygen (3-4 L min\n−1\n) and maintained at an appropriate surgical plane with urethane (25% w/v; 0.5 mL 100 g\n−1 \nbody weight). The trachea, a jugular vein and a carotid artery are cannulated for respiratory ventilation, injection of test compound and monitoring of blood pressure, respectively. A midline laporatomy is performed to expose the urinary bladder and a cystometry tube inserted through a small. incision in the dome of the bladder and secured in place. The abdominal wound is then closed tightly around the externalised cystometry tube, which, in turn, is connected to an infusion pump and pressure transducer, for filling the bladder and recording intravesical pressure, respectively. Electromyographic (EMG) wire leads are inserted into the EUS striated muscle layer opposed to the dorsal surface of the symphysis pubis. The EMG leads are connected to an appropriate amplification and electrical filter system and changes in EUS electrical activity displayed on an oscilloscope and recorded through appropriate computer software.\n\n\nFollowing a 30 min post surgery stabilization period, the bladder is filled at a rate of between 45 and 100 μl min\n−1 \nwith physiological saline (room temperature), until initiation of a micturition reflex is observed. Following micturition, the bladder is drained via the externalized cystometry tube. Bladder filling is then repeated at least 3 times (or until repeatable filling cycles are achieved) in order to establish a mean bladder threshold capacity for initiation of micturition. EUS EMG activity and intravesical (bladder) pressure are recorded throughout bladder filling. Subsequently, test compound or vehicle is injected intravenously utilizing either a bolus dose or constant infusion and bladder filling re-initiated until micturition occurs, the bladder is then drained as before and the process repeated with addition of increasing doses of test compound (2 micturition responses are measured at each compound concentration). Changes in threshold bladder capacity initiating micturition and/or in EUS EMG activity are indicative of compound activity on lower urinary tract function.\n\n\nInvestigation of Voided Volume in Conscious Ovariectomised Mice\n\n\nOvariectomised adult female mice are dosed (either orally or sub-cutaneously) with vehicle or increasing concentrations of compound and placed in individual metaboles with free access to water for 3 h. Urine voided by each mouse is captured on a conical sponge within a container placed beneath each metabole, this sponge also deflects faecal pellets. The total volume of urine voided within the 3 h period and the volume of urine per void is measured by a balance placed directly beneath the collection container. The average volume of urine per void and the frequency of voiding events are compared between vehicle and compound treated groups (up to n=16 per group), changes in these parameters in the absence of changes in the total urine output are indicative of compound activity on lower urinary tract function.\n\n\nInvestigation of Voided Volume and Bladder Activity in Conscious Telemeterized Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats\n\n\nAdult female spontaneously hypertensive rats are dosed (either orally or sub-cutaneously) with vehicle or increasing concentrations of compound and placed in individual metaboles with free access to water for 3 h. Urine voided by each rat is captured on a conical sponge within a container placed beneath each metabole, this sponge also deflects faecal pellets. The total volume of urine voided within the 3 h period and the volume of urine per void is measured by a balance placed directly beneath the collection container. The average volume of urine per void and the frequency of voiding events are compared between vehicle and compound treated groups (up to n=16 per group), changes in these parameters in the absence of changes in the total urine output are indicative of compound activity on lower urinary tract function.\n\n\nOther aspects of the invention are enumerated in the claims.\n\n\nBiological Data\n\n\nBiological activity of the compounds of the invention is illustrated in the table below.

Characteristic chemical shifts (δ) are given in parts-per-million downfield from tetramethylsilane using conventional abbreviations for designation of major peaks: e.g. s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br, broad. The mass spectra (m/z) were recorded using either electrospray ionisation (ESI) or atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI). The following abbreviations have been used for common solvents: CDCl\n3\n, deuterochloroform; D\n6\n-DMSO, deuterodimethylsulphoxide; CD\n3\nOD, deuteromethanol; THF, tetrahydrofuran. ‘Ammonia’ refers to a concentrated solution of ammonia in water possessing a specific gravity of 0.88. Where thin layer chromatography (TLC) has been used, it refers to silica gel TLC using silica gel 60 F\n254 \nplates, R\nf \nis the distance travelled by a compound divided by the distance travelled by the solvent front on a TLC plate. The term “Catalyst 1” refers to a catalyst (available from ASDI) of the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nHPLC, unless otherwise indicated, was performed as follows:\n\n \n \nMethod A: Column: Sunfire C18 4.6×50 mm id; Mobile Phase A: 0.05% formic acid in water; Mobile Phase B: 0.05% formic acid in acetonitrile.\n \nMethod B: Column: Xterra 4.6×50 mm id; Mobile Phase A: 0.05% ammonia in water; Mobile Phase B: 0.05% ammonia in acetonitrile\n \nMethod C: Column: Luna C8 4.6×50 mm id; Mobile Phase A: 10 mM ammonium acetate in water; Mobile Phase B: 10 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile\n \nMethod D: Column: C18 4.6×50 mm id; Mobile Phase A: 0.1% formic acid in water; Mobile Phase B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile.\n \n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n2-Benzyl-4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5H-pyrimido[4,5-d]azepine and 2-benzyl-4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5H-pyrimido[4,5-d]azepine hydrochloride\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPyrazole (192 mg, 2.80 mmol) was added to a solution of the triflate of Preparation 1, step B (686 mg, 1.40 mmol) in MeCN (5.0 mL) at room temperature with stirring. The mixture was heated to 80° C. and stirred for 20 h. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and a solution of HCl in dioxane (2.0 mL, 4M, 8.0 mmol) was added and the resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was quenched by addition of saturated sodium bicarbonate and extracted into CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. The combined organics were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to provide the crude product as a brown gum. The product was purified by flash column chromatography eluting with ethyl acetate:MeOH:NH\n3 \n(85:15:2) to yield the title compound as a yellow gum (353 mg, 82% yield). This was taken up in methanol and a solution of HCl in diethyl ether added to convert the product to the HCl salt. The resulting solution was concentrated to yield a yellow solid. Recrystallisation from MeOH provided the hydrochloride salt as a white solid.\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHZ, CDCl\n3\n) free base δ: 2.99-3.08 (m, 4H); 3.19-325 (m, 2H); 3.39-3.42 (m, 2H); 4.20 (s, 2H); 6.42 (dd, 1H); 7.19-7.33 (m, 3H); 7.39 (d, 2H); 7.75 (dd, 1H); 8.34 (d, 1H).\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHZ, CDCl\n3\n) HCl salt δ: 3.42-3.48 (m, 6H); 3.69-3.73 (m, 2H); 4.23 (s, 2H); 6.58 (dd, 1H); 7.19-7.24, (m, 1H); 7.26-7.32 (m, 2H); 7.35-7.39.
