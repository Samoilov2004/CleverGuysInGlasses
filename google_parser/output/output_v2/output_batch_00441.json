In certain embodiments, these cyclodextrin-containing polymers improve drug stability and/or solubility, and/or reduce toxicity, and/or improve efficacy of the topoisomerase inhibitor when used in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, by selecting from a variety of linker groups that link or couple CDP to a topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative, and/or targeting ligands, the rate of drug release from the polymers can be attenuated for controlled delivery. The invention also relates to methods of treating subjects with compositions described herein. The invention further relates to methods for conducting a pharmaceutical business comprising manufacturing, licensing, or distributing kits containing or relating to the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore generally, the present invention provides water-soluble, biocompatible polymer conjugates comprising a water-soluble, biocompatible polymer covalently attached to the topoisomerase inhibitor through attachments that are cleaved under biological conditions to release the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymeric conjugates featured in the methods described herein may be useful to improve solubility and/or stability of a bioactive/therapeutic agent, such as camptothecin, reduce drug-drug interactions, reduce interactions with blood elements including plasma proteins, reduce or eliminate immunogenicity, protect the agent from metabolism, modulate drug-release kinetics, improve circulation time, improve drug half-life (e.g., in the serum, or in selected tissues, such as tumors), attenuate toxicity, improve efficacy, normalize drug metabolism across subjects of different species, ethnicities, and/or races, and/or provide for targeted delivery into specific cells or tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative.

A cyclodextrin moiety optionally comprises a linker moiety that forms a covalent linkage between the cyclic structure and the polymer backbone, preferably having from 1 to 20 atoms in the chain, such as alkyl chains, including dicarboxylic acid derivatives (such as glutaric acid derivatives, succinic acid derivatives, and the like), and heteroalkyl chains, such as oligoethylene glycol chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCyclodextrins are cyclic polysaccharides containing naturally occurring D-(+)-glucopyranose units in an α-(1,4) linkage. The most common cyclodextrins are alpha ((α)-cyclodextrins, beta (β)-cyclodextrins and gamma (γ)-cyclodextrins which contain, respectively six, seven, or eight glucopyranose units. Structurally, the cyclic nature of a cyclodextrin forms a torus or donut-like shape having an inner apolar or hydrophobic cavity, the secondary hydroxyl groups situated on one side of the cyclodextrin torus and the primary hydroxyl groups situated on the other. Thus, using (β)-cyclodextrin as an example, a cyclodextrin is often represented schematically as follows.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe side on which the secondary hydroxyl groups are located has a wider diameter than the side on which the primary hydroxyl groups are located. The present invention contemplates covalent linkages to cyclodextrin moieties on the primary and/or secondary hydroxyl groups. The hydrophobic nature of the cyclodextrin inner cavity allows for host-guest inclusion complexes of a variety of compounds, e.g., adamantane. (Comprehensive Supramolecular Chemistry, Volume 3, J. L.

In still other embodiments, linker groups with one or more terminal hydroxyl, thiol, or amino groups may be incorporated into the polymer. In preferred embodiments, one or more of these terminal hydroxyl groups may be capped by covalently attaching them to a therapeutic agent, a targeting moiety, or a cyclodextrin moiety via an (thio)ester, amide, carbonate, carbamate, thiocarbonate, or thiocarbamate bond. In certain embodiments, these (thio)ester, amide, (thio)carbonate or (thio)carbamates bonds may be biohydrolyzable, i.e., capable of being hydrolyzed under biological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a linker group represents a hydrocarbylene group wherein one or more methylene groups is optionally replaced by a group Y (provided that none of the Y groups are adjacent to each other), wherein each Y, independently for each occurrence, is selected from, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, or —O—, C(═X) (wherein X is NR\n1\n, O or S), —OC(O)—, —C(═O)O, —NR\n1\nCO—, —C(O)NR\n1\n—, —S(O)\nn\n— (wherein n is 0, 1, or 2), —OC(O)—NR\n1\n, —NR\n1\n—C(O)—NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\n—C(NR\n1\n)—NR\n1\n—, and —B(OR\n1\n)—; and R\n1\n, independently for each occurrence, represents H or a lower alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a linker group, e.g., between a topoisomerase inhibitor and the CDP, comprises a self-cyclizing moiety. In certain embodiments, a linker group, e.g., between a topoisomerase inhibitor and the CDP, comprises a selectivity-determining moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, a linker group, e.g., between a topoisomerase inhibitor and the CDP, comprises a self-cyclizing moiety and a selectivity-determining moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the topoisomerase inhibitor or targeting ligand is covalently bonded to the linker group via a biohydrolyzable bond (e.g., an ester, amide, carbonate, carbamate, or a phosphate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the CDP comprises cyclodextrin moieties that alternate with linker moieties in the polymer chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the linker moieties are attached to topoisomerase inhibitors or prodrugs thereof that are cleaved under biological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, at least one linker that connects the topoisomerase inhibitor or prodrug thereof to the polymer comprises a group represented by the formula\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\nP is phosphorus;\n\n\nO is oxygen;\n\n\nE represents oxygen or NR\n40\n;\n\n\nK represents hydrocarbyl;\n\n\nX is selected from OR\n42 \nor NR\n43\nR\n44\n; and\n\n\nR\n40\n, R\n41\n, R\n42\n, R\n43\n, and R\n44 \ndependently represent hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, E is NR\n40 \nand R\n40 \nis hydrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, K is lower alkylene (e.g., ethylene).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, at least one linker comprises a group selected from\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, X is OR\n42\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the linker group comprises an amino acid or peptide, or derivative thereof (e.g., a glycine or cysteine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the linker is connected to the topoisomerase inhibitor through a hydroxyl group. In certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the linker is connected to the topoisomerase inhibitor through an amino group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the linker group that connects to the topoisomerase inhibitor may comprise a self-cyclizing moiety, or a selectivity-determining moiety, or both. In certain embodiments, the selectivity-determining moiety is a moiety that promotes selectivity in the cleavage of the bond between the selectivity-determining moiety and the self-cyclizing moiety. Such a moiety may, for example, promote enzymatic cleavage between the selectivity-determining moiety and the self-cyclizing moiety. Alternatively, such a moiety may promote cleavage between the selectivity-determining moiety and the self-cyclizing moiety under acidic conditions or basic conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, any of the linker groups may comprise a self-cyclizing moiety or a selectivity-determining moiety, or both. In certain embodiments, the selectivity-determining moiety may be bonded to the self-cyclizing moiety between the self-cyclizing moiety and the polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, any of the linker groups may independently be or include an alkyl chain, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, polysuccinic anhydride, poly-L-glutamic acid, poly(ethyleneimine), an oligosaccharide, an amino acid chain, or any other suitable linkage. In certain embodiments, the linker group itself can be stable under physiological conditions, such as an alkyl chain, or it can be cleavable under physiological conditions, such as by an enzyme (e.g., the linkage contains a peptide sequence that is a substrate for a peptidase), or by hydrolysis (e.g., the linkage contains a hydrolyzable group, such as an ester or thioester). The linker groups can be biologically inactive, such as a PEG, polyglycolic acid, or polylactic acid chain, or can be biologically active, such as an oligo- or polypeptide that, when cleaved from the moieties, binds a receptor, deactivates an enzyme, etc. Various oligomeric linker groups that are biologically compatible and/or bioerodible are known in the art, and the selection of the linkage may influence the ultimate properties of the material, such as whether it is durable when implanted, whether it gradually deforms or shrinks after implantation, or whether it gradually degrades and is absorbed by the body. The linker group may be attached to the moieties by any suitable bond or functional group, including carbon-carbon bonds, esters, ethers, amides, amines, carbonates, carbamates, sulfonamides, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, any of the linker groups may independently be an alkyl group wherein one or more methylene groups is optionally replaced by a group Y (provided that none of the Y groups are adjacent to each other), wherein each Y, independently for each occurrence, is selected from aryl, heteroaryl, carbocyclyl, heterocyclyl, or —O—, C(═X) (wherein X is NR\n1\n, O or S), —OC(O)—, —C(═O)O—, —NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\nCO—, —C(O)NR\n1\n—, —S(O)\nn\n— (wherein n is 0, 1, or 2), —OC(O)—NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\n—C(O)—NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\n—C(NR\n1\n)—NR\n1\n—, and —B(OR\n1\n)—; and R\n1\n, independently for each occurrence, is H or lower alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the present invention contemplates a CDP, wherein a plurality of topoisomerase inhibitors are covalently attached to the polymer through attachments that are cleaved under biological conditions to release the therapeutic agents as discussed above, wherein administration of the polymer to a subject results in release of the therapeutic agent over a period of at least 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 24, 36, 48 or even 72 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the conjugation of the topoisomerase inhibitor to the CDP improves the aqueous solubility of the topoisomerase inhibitor and hence the bioavailability. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention, the topoisomerase inhibitor has a log P>0.4, >0.6, >0.8, >1, >2, >3, >4, or even >5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate of the present invention preferably has a molecular weight in the range of 10,000 to 500,000; 30,000 to 200,000; or even 70,000 to 150,000 amu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the present invention contemplates attenuating the rate of release of the topoisomerase inhibitor by introducing various tether and/or linking groups between the therapeutic agent and the polymer. Thus, in certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates of the present invention are compositions for controlled delivery of the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDP-Topoisomerase Inhibitor Conjugate Characteristics\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP and/or CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition as described herein have polydispersities less than about 3, or even less than about 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention provides an improved delivery of certain topoisomerase inhibitor by covalently attaching one or more topoisomerase inhibitors to a CDP. Such conjugation can improve the aqueous solubility and hence the bioavailability of the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein preferably have molecular weights in the range of 10,000 to 500,000; 30,000 to 200,000; or even 70,000 to 150,000 amu. In certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the compound has a number average (M\nn\n) molecular weight between 1,000 to 500,000 amu, or between 5,000 to 200,000 amu, or between 10,000 to 100,000 amu. One method to determine molecular weight is by gel permeation chromatography (“GPC”), e.g., mixed bed columns, CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nsolvent, light scattering detector, and off-line do/dc. Other methods are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is biodegradable or bioerodable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the topoisomerase inhibitor, e.g., the camptothecin, camptothecin derivative, or prodrug thereof makes up at least 3% (e.g., at least about 5%) by weight of the polymer. In certain embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor, e.g., the camptothecin, camptothecin derivative or prodrug thereof makes up at least 20% by weight of the compound. In certain embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor, e.g., the camptothecin, camptothecin derivative or prodrug thereof makes up at least 5%, 10%, 15%, or at least 20% by weight of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions of the present invention may be useful to improve solubility and/or stability of the topoisomerase inhibitor, reduce drug-drug interactions, reduce interactions with blood elements including plasma proteins, reduce or eliminate immunogenicity, protect the topoisomerase inhibitor from metabolism, modulate drug-release kinetics, improve circulation time, improve topoisomerase inhibitor half-life (e.g., in the serum, or in selected tissues, such as tumors), attenuate toxicity, improve efficacy, normalize topoisomerase inhibitor metabolism across subjects of different species, ethnicities, and/or races, and/or provide for targeted delivery into specific cells or tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be a flexible or flowable material. When the CDP used is itself flowable, the CDP composition of the invention, even when viscous, need not include a biocompatible solvent to be flowable, although trace or residual amounts of biocompatible solvents may still be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile it is possible that the biodegradable polymer or the biologically active agent may be dissolved in a small quantity of a solvent that is non-toxic to more efficiently produce an amorphous, monolithic distribution or a fine dispersion of the biologically active agent in the flexible or flowable composition, it is an advantage of the invention that, in a preferred embodiment, no solvent is needed to form a flowable composition. Moreover, the use of solvents is preferably avoided because, once a polymer composition containing solvent is placed totally or partially within the body, the solvent dissipates or diffuses away from the polymer and must be processed and eliminated by the body, placing an extra burden on the body's clearance ability at a time when the illness (and/or other treatments for the illness) may have already deleteriously affected it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, when a solvent is used to facilitate mixing or to maintain the flowability of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, it should be non-toxic, otherwise biocompatible, and should be used in relatively small amounts. Solvents that are toxic should not be used in any material to be placed even partially within a living body. Such a solvent also must not cause substantial tissue irritation or necrosis at the site of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable biocompatible solvents, when used, include N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, ethanol, propylene glycol, acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, caprolactam, oleic acid, or 1-dodecylazacylcoheptanone. Preferred solvents include N-methylpyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide, and acetone because of their solvating ability and their biocompatibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions are soluble in one or more common organic solvents for ease of fabrication and processing. Common organic solvents include such solvents as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, 2-butanone, butyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, acetone, ethyl acetate, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein, upon contact with body fluids, undergo gradual degradation. The life of a biodegradable polymer in vivo depends upon, among other things, its molecular weight, crystallinity, biostability, and the degree of crosslinking. In general, the greater the molecular weight, the higher the degree of crystallinity, and the greater the biostability, the slower biodegradation will be.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a subject composition is formulated with a topoisomerase inhibitor or other material, release of the topoisomerase inhibitor or other material for a sustained or extended period as compared to the release from an isotonic saline solution generally results. Such release profile may result in prolonged delivery (over, say 1 to about 2,000 hours, or alternatively about 2 to about 800 hours) of effective amounts (e.g., about 0.0001 mg/kg/hour to about 10 mg/kg/hour, e.g., 0.001 mg/kg/hour, 0.01 mg/kg/hour, 0.1 mg/kg/hour, 1.0 mg/kg/hour) of the topoisomerase inhibitor or any other material associated with the polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of factors may affect the desired rate of hydrolysis of CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions, the desired softness and flexibility of the resulting solid matrix, rate and extent of bioactive material release. Some of such factors include the selection/identity of the various subunits, the enantiomeric or diastereomeric purity of the monomeric subunits, homogeneity of subunits found in the polymer, and the length of the polymer. For instance, the present invention contemplates heteropolymers with varying linkages, and/or the inclusion of other monomeric elements in the polymer, in order to control, for example, the rate of biodegradation of the matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo illustrate further, a wide range of degradation rates may be obtained by adjusting the hydrophobicities of the backbones or side chains of the polymers while still maintaining sufficient biodegradability for the use intended for any such polymer. Such a result may be achieved by varying the various functional groups of the polymer. For example, the combination of a hydrophobic backbone and a hydrophilic linkage produces heterogeneous degradation because cleavage is encouraged whereas water penetration is resisted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne protocol generally accepted in the field that may be used to determine the release rate of a therapeutic agent such as a topoisomerase inhibitor or other material loaded in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles or compositions of the present invention involves degradation of any such matrix in a 0.1 M PBS solution (pH 7.4) at 37° C., an assay known in the art. For purposes of the present invention, the term “PBS protocol” is used herein to refer to such protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the release rates of different CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions of the present invention may be compared by subjecting them to such a protocol. In certain instances, it may be necessary to process polymeric systems in the same fashion to allow direct and relatively accurate comparisons of different systems to be made. For example, the present invention teaches several different methods of formulating the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions. Such comparisons may indicate that any one\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition releases incorporated material at a rate from about 2 or less to about 1000 or more times faster than another polymeric system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a comparison may reveal a rate difference of about 3, 5, 7, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 or 750 times. Even higher rate differences are contemplated by the present invention and release rate protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, when formulated in a certain manner, the release rate for CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions of the present invention may present as mono- or bi-phasic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelease of any material incorporated into the polymer matrix, which is often provided as a microsphere, may be characterized in certain instances by an initial increased release rate, which may release from about 5 to about 50% or more of any incorporated material, or alternatively about 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or 40%, followed by a release rate of lesser magnitude.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe release rate of any incorporated material may also be characterized by the amount of such material released per day per mg of polymer matrix. For example, in certain embodiments, the release rate may vary from about 1 ng or less of any incorporated material per day per mg of polymeric system to about 500 or more ng/day/mg. Alternatively, the release rate may be about 0.05, 0.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500 ng/day/mg. In still other embodiments, the release rate of any incorporated material may be 10,000 ng/day/mg, or even higher. In certain instances, materials incorporated and characterized by such release rate protocols may include therapeutic agents, fillers, and other substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the rate of release of any material from any CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition of the present invention may be presented as the half-life of such material in the matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the embodiment involving protocols for in vitro determination of release rates, in vivo protocols, whereby in certain instances release rates for polymeric systems may be determined in vivo, are also contemplated by the present invention. Other assays useful for determining the release of any material from the polymers of the present system are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhysical Structures of the CDP-Topoisomerase Inhibitor Conjugates, Particles and Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions may be formed in a variety of shapes. For example, in certain embodiments, CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates may be presented in the form of microparticles or nanoparticles. Microspheres typically comprise a biodegradable polymer matrix incorporating a drug. Microspheres can be formed by a wide variety of techniques known to those of skill in the art. Examples of microsphere forming techniques include, but are not limited to, (a) phase separation by emulsification and subsequent organic solvent evaporation (including complex emulsion methods such as oil in water emulsions, water in oil emulsions and water-oil-water emulsions); (b) coacervation-phase separation; (c) melt dispersion; (d) interfacial deposition; (e) in situ polymerization; (f) spray drying and spray congealing; (g) air suspension coating; and (h) pan and spray coating. These methods, as well as properties and characteristics of microspheres are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,438,253; U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,441; U.S. Pat. No. 5,100,669; U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,768; U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; U.S. Pat. No. 5,889,110; U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,175; and European Patent 0258780, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo prepare microspheres, several methods can be employed depending upon the desired application of the delivery vehicles. Suitable methods include, but are not limited to, spray drying, freeze drying, air drying, vacuum drying, fluidized-bed drying, milling, co-precipitation and critical fluid extraction. In the case of spray drying, freeze drying, air drying, vacuum drying, fluidized-bed drying and critical fluid extraction; the components (stabilizing polyol, bioactive material, buffers, etc.) are first dissolved or suspended in aqueous conditions. In the case of milling, the components are mixed in the dried form and milled by any method known in the art. In the case of co-precipitation, the components are mixed in organic conditions and processed as described below. Spray drying can be used to load the stabilizing polyol with the bioactive material. The components are mixed under aqueous conditions and dried using precision nozzles to produce extremely uniform droplets in a drying chamber. Suitable spray drying machines include, but are not limited to, Buchi, NIRO, APV and Lab-plant spray driers used according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe shape of microparticles and nanoparticles may be determined by scanning electron microscopy. Spherically shaped nanoparticles are used in certain embodiments, for circulation through the bloodstream. If desired, the particles may be fabricated using known techniques into other shapes that are more useful for a specific application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to intracellular delivery of a topoisomerase inhibitor, it also possible that particles of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, such as microparticles or nanoparticles, may undergo endocytosis, thereby obtaining access to the cell. The frequency of such an endocytosis process will likely depend on the size of any particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the surface charge of the molecule is neutral, or slightly negative. In some embodiments, the zeta potential of the particle surface is from about −80 mV to about 50 mV.\n\n\n \nCDPs, Methods of Making Same, and Methods of Conjugating CDPs to Topoisomerase Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nGenerally, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein can be prepared in one of two ways: monomers bearing topoisomerase inhibitors, targeting ligands, and/or cyclodextrin moieties can be polymerized, or polymer backbones can be derivatized with topoisomerase inhibitors, targeting ligands, and/or cyclodextrin moieties. Exemplary methods of making CDPs and CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,270,808, the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDPs described herein can be made using a variety of methods including those described herein. In some embodiments, a CDP can be made by: providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors; providing comonomer precursors which do not contain cyclodextrin moieties (comonomer precursors); and copolymerizing the said cyclodextrin moiety precursors and comonomer precursors to thereby make a CDP wherein CDP comprises at least four cyclodextrin moieties and at least four comonomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the at least four cyclodextrin moieties and at least four comonomers alternate in the water soluble linear polymer. In some embodiments, the method includes providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors modified to bear one reactive site at each of exactly two positions, and reacting the cyclodextrin moiety precursors with comonomer precursors having exactly two reactive moieties capable of forming a covalent bond with the reactive sites under polymerization conditions that promote reaction of the reactive sites with the reactive moieties to form covalent bonds between the comonomers and the cyclodextrin moieties, whereby a CDP comprising alternating units of a cyclodextrin moiety and a comonomer is produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin momomers comprise linkers to which the topoisomerase inhibitor may be further linked\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the comonomer precursor is a compound containing at least two functional groups through which reaction and thus linkage of the cyclodextrin moieties is achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer precursor comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thio, acyl halide, —HC═CH—, —C≡C— group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the two functional groups are the same and are located at termini of the comonomer precursor. In some embodiments, a comonomer contains one or more pendant groups with at least one functional group through which reaction and thus linkage of a therapeutic agent can be achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer pendant group comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thiol, acyl halide, ethylene, ethyne group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the pendant group is a substituted or unsubstituted branched, cyclic or straight chain C1-C10 alkyl, or arylalkyl optionally containing one or more heteroatoms within the chain or ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moiety comprises an alpha, beta, or gamma cyclodextrin moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP is suitable for the attachment of sufficient topoisomerase inhibitor such that up to at least 3%, 5%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, or even 35% by weight of the CDP, when conjugated, is topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP has a molecular weight of 10,000-500,000 amu. In some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moieties make up at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% or 80% of the CDP by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP of the following formula can be made by the scheme below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein R is of the form:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncomprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nreacting a compound of the formula below:\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwith a compound of the formula below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein the group\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nhas a Mw of 3.4 kDa or less and n is at least four,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nin the presence of a non-nucleophilic organic base in a solvent.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, is\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the solvent is a polar aprotic solvent.

Accordingly, the loading of the topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin, by weight of the polymer, can vary. Therefore, while Scheme XIII depicts CPT at each cysteine residue of each polymer subunit, the CDP-CPT conjugate can have less than 2 CPT molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-CPT conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include two, one or no CPT attached at each cysteine residue of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-CPT conjugates having two, one or no CPT attached at each cysteine residue of each polymer subunit of the CDP-CPT conjugate and the conjugates include a mixture of CDP-CPT conjugates that can vary as to the number of CPTs attached to the gly at each of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate can be made by providing a CDP comprising cyclodextrin moieties and comonomers which do not contain cyclodextrin moieties (comonomers), wherein the cyclodextrin moieties and comonomers alternate in the CDP and wherein the CDP comprises at least four cyclodextrin moieties and at least four comonomers; and attaching a topoisomerase inhibitor to the CDP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more of the topoisomerase inhibitor moieties in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate can be replaced with another therapeutic agent, e.g., another anticancer agent or anti-inflammatory agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer via a linker. In some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer through an attachment that is cleaved under biological conditions to release the topoisomerase inhibitor. In some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer at a cyclodextrin moiety or a comonomer. In some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer via an optional linker to a cyclodextrin moiety or a comonomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moieties comprise linkers to which therapeutic agents are linked\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP is made by a process comprising: providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors, providing comonomer precursors, and copolymerizing said cyclodextrin moiety precursors and comonomer precursors to thereby make a CDP comprising cyclodextrin moieties and comonomers. In some embodiments, the CDP is conjugated with a topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin to provide a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the method includes providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors modified to bear one reactive site at each of exactly two positions, and reacting the cyclodextrin moiety precursors with comonomer precursors having exactly two reactive moieties capable of forming a covalent bond with the reactive sites under polymerization conditions that promote reaction of the reactive sites with the reactive moieties to form covalent bonds between the comonomers and the cyclodextrin moieties, whereby a CDP comprising alternating units of a cyclodextrin moiety and a comonomer is produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the CDP via a linker. In some embodiments, the linker is cleaved under biological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor makes up at least 5%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, or even 35% by weight of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the comonomer comprises polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 3,400 Da, the cyclodextrin moiety comprises beta-cyclodextrin, the theoretical maximum loading of camptothecin on a CDP-camptothecin conjugate is 13%, and camptothecin is 6-10% by weight of the CDP-camptothecin conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the comonomer precursor is a compound containing at least two functional groups through which reaction and thus linkage of the cyclodextrin moieties is achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer precursor comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thio, acyl halide, —HC═CH—, —C≡C— group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the two functional groups are the same and are located at termini of the comonomer precursor. In some embodiments, a comonomer contains one or more pendant groups with at least one functional group through which reaction and thus linkage of a therapeutic agent is achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer pendant group comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thiol, acyl halide, ethylene, ethyne group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the pendant group is a substituted or unsubstituted branched, cyclic or straight chain C1-C10 alkyl, or arylalkyl optionally containing one or more heteroatoms within the chain or ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moiety comprises an alpha, beta, or gamma cyclodextrin moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is poorly soluble in water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition to a subject results in release of the topoisomerase inhibitor over a period of at least 6 hours. In some embodiments, administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition to a subject results in release of the topoisomerase inhibitor over a period of 6 hours to a month. In some embodiments, upon administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition to a subject the rate of topoisomerase inhibitor release is dependent primarily upon the rate of hydrolysis as opposed to enzymatic cleavage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition has a molecular weight of 10,000-500,000 amu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moieties make up at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% or 80% of the polymer by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP-polymer conjugate of the following formula can be made as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nproviding a polymer below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand coupling the polymer with a plurality of L-D moieties, wherein L is a linker, or absent and D is topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative, to provide:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein the group\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nhas a Mw of 3.4 kDa or less and n is at least 4, wherein on the final product, L can be a linker, a bond, or OH, and D can be a topoisomerase inhibitor (e.g., camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative) or absent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more of the topoisomerase inhibitor moieties in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate can be replaced with another therapeutic agent, e.g., another anticancer agent or anti-inflammatory agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction scheme as provided above includes embodiments where L-D is absent in one or more positions as provided above. This can be achieved, for example, when less than 100% yield is achieved when coupling the topoisomerase inhibitor-linker to the polymer and/or when less than an equivalent amount of topoisomerase inhibitor-linker is used in the reaction. Accordingly, the loading of the topoisomerase inhibitor, by weight of the polymer, can vary, for example, the loading of the topoisomerase inhibitor can be at least about 3% by weight, e.g., at least about 5%, at least about 8%, at least about 10%, at least about 11%, at least about 12%, at least about 13%, at least about 14%, at least about 15%, or at least about 20%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, at least a portion of the L moieties of L-D is absent. In some embodiments, each L is independently an amino acid or derivative thereof (e.g., glycine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the coupling of the polymer with the plurality of L-D moieties results in the formation of a plurality of amide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the CDPs are random copolymers, in which the different subunits and/or other monomeric units are distributed randomly throughout the polymer chain. Thus, where the formula X\nm\n—Y\nn\n—Z\no \nappears, wherein X, Y and Z are polymer subunits, these subunits may be randomly interspersed throughout the polymer backbone. In part, the term “random” is intended to refer to the situation in which the particular distribution or incorporation of monomeric units in a polymer that has more than one type of monomeric units is not directed or controlled directly by the synthetic protocol, but instead results from features inherent to the polymer system, such as the reactivity, amounts of subunits and other characteristics of the synthetic reaction or other methods of manufacture, processing, or treatment.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a composition, e.g., a pharmaceutical composition, comprising a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate or particle and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or adjuvant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition may include a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound described herein, e.g., a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acid salts include acetate, adipate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, butyrate, citrate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, formate, fumarate, glycolate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, palmoate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, salicylate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, tosylate and undecanoate. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N-(alkyl)\n4\n \n+\n salts. This invention also envisions the quaternization of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds described herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such quaternization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gailate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition may include a liquid used for suspending a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, which may be any liquid solution compatible with the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, which is also suitable to be used in pharmaceutical compositions, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic liquid. Suitable suspending liquids including but are not limited to suspending liquids selected from the group consisting of water, aqueous sucrose syrups, corn syrups, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition described herein may also include another component, such as an antioxidant, antibacterial, buffer, bulking agent, chelating agent, an inert gas, a tonicity agent and/or a viscosity agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is provided in lyophilized form and is reconstituted prior to administration to a subject. The lyophilized CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be reconstituted by a diluent solution, such as a salt or saline solution, e.g., a sodium chloride solution having a pH between 6 and 9, lactated Ringer's injection solution, or a commercially available diluent, such as PLASMA-LYTE A Injection pH 7.4® (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a lyophilized formulation includes a lyoprotectant or stabilizer to maintain physical and chemical stability by protecting the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition from damage from crystal formation and the fusion process during freeze-drying. The lyoprotectant or stabilizer can be one or more of polyethylene glycol (PEG), a PEG lipid conjugate (e.g., PEG-ceramide or D-alpha-\ntocopheryl polyethylene glycol\n 1000 succinate), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), polyoxyethylene esters, poloxomers, Tweens, lecithins, saccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and polyols (e.g., trehalose, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, sucrose, glucose and dextran), salts and crown ethers. In one embodiment, the lyoprotectant is mannitol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the lyophilized CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is reconstituted with a mixture of equal parts by volume of Dehydrated Alcohol, USP and a nonionic surfactant, such as a polyoxyethylated castor oil surfactant available from GAF Corporation, Mount Olive, N.J., under the trademark, Cremophor EL. In some embodiments, the lyophilized CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is reconstituted in water for infusion. The lyophilized product and vehicle for reconstitution can be packaged separately in appropriately light-protected vials, e.g., amber or other colored vials. To minimize the amount of surfactant in the reconstituted solution, only a sufficient amount of the vehicle may be provided to form a solution having a concentration of about 2 mg/mL to about 4 mg/mL of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. Once dissolution of the drug is achieved, the resulting solution is further diluted prior to injection with a suitable parenteral diluent. Such diluents are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These diluents are generally available in clinical facilities. It is, however, within the scope of the present invention to package the subject CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition with a third vial containing sufficient parenteral diluent to prepare the final concentration for administration. A typical diluent is Lactated Ringer's Injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe final dilution of the reconstituted CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be carried out with other preparations having similar utility, for example, 5% Dextrose Injection, Lactated Ringer's and Dextrose for Injection (D5W), Sterile Water for Injection, and the like. However, because of its narrow pH range, pH 6.0 to 7.5, Lactated Ringer's Injection is most typical. Per 100 mL, Lactated Ringer's Injection contains Sodium Chloride USP 0.6 g, Sodium Lactate 0.31 g, Potassium chloride USP 0.03 g and Calcium Chloride2H2O USP 0.02 g. The osmolarity is 275 mOsmol/L, which is very close to isotonicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The dosage form can be, e.g., in a bog, e.g., a bag for infusion or intraperitoneal administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 1 percent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 percent to about 70 percent, most preferably from about 10 percent to about 30 percent.\n\n\n \nRoutes of Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be administered orally, parenterally (e.g., via intravenous, subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional or intracranial injection), topically, mucosally (e.g., rectally or vaginally), nasally, buccally, ophthalmically, via inhalation spray (e.g., delivered via nebulzation, propellant or a dry powder device) or via an implanted reservoir. Typically, the compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions. The preferred mode of administration is, e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration comprise\n\n\n \n \n \n \none or more CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate(s), particle(s) or composition(s) in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the agent from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition in an oil vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, gums, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouthwashes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of an agent as an active ingredient. A compound may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered peptide or peptidomimetic moistened with an inert liquid diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTablets, and other solid dosage forms, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuspensions, in addition to the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for topical administration are useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical application. For application topically to the skin, the pharmaceutical composition should be formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the a particle described herein include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated with a suitable lotion or cream containing the active particle suspended or dissolved in a carrier with suitable emulsifying agents. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by rectal suppository formulation or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches are also included herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration. Suppositories may be prepared by mixing one or more CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein with one or more suitable non-irritating excipients which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature. The composition will therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. Such materials include, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate. Compositions of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOphthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosages and Dosing Regimens\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular subject, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered to a subject at a dosage of, e.g., about 1 to 40 mg/m\n2\n, about 3 to 35 mg/m\n2\n, about 9 to 40 mg/m\n2\n, e.g., about 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 mg/m\n2 \nof the topoisomerase inhibitor. Administration can be at regular intervals, such as weekly, or every 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 weeks. The administration can be over a period of from about 10 minutes to about 6 hours, e.g., from about 30 minutes to about 2 hours, from about 45 minutes to 90 minutes, e.g., about 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours or more. The CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be administered, e.g., by intravenous or intraperitoneal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered as a bolus infusion or intravenous push, e.g., over a period of 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes or less.

Preferably, the dosing schedule is a dosing schedule described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be administered as a first line therapy, e.g., alone or in combination with an additional agent or agents. In other embodiments, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered after a subject has developed resistance to, has failed to respond to or has relapsed after a first line therapy. The CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be administered in combination with a second agent. Preferably, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with a second agent described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKits\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein may be provided in a kit. The kit includes a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein and, optionally, a container, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or informational material.

In some embodiments, a component of the kit is stored under inert conditions (e.g., under Nitrogen or another inert gas such as Argon). In some embodiments, a component of the kit is stored under anhydrous conditions (e.g., with a desiccant). In some embodiments, a component of the kit is stored in a light blocking container such as an amber vial.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein can be provided in any form, e.g., liquid, frozen, dried or lyophilized form. It is preferred that a composition including the conjugate, particle or composition, e.g., a composition comprising a particle or particles that include a conjugate described herein be substantially pure and/or sterile. When a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein is provided in a liquid solution, the liquid solution preferably is an aqueous solution, with a sterile aqueous solution being preferred. In one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is provided in lyophilized form and, optionally, a diluent solution is provided for reconstituting the lyophilized agent. The diluent can include for example, a salt or saline solution, e.g., a sodium chloride solution having a pH between 6 and 9, lactated Ringer's injection solution, D5W, or PLASMA-LYTE A Injection pH 7.4® (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kit can include one or more containers for the composition containing a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein. In some embodiments, the kit contains separate containers, dividers or compartments for the composition and informational material. For example, the composition can be contained in a bottle, vial, IV admixture bag, IV infusion set, piggyback set or syringe, and the informational material can be contained in a plastic sleeve or packet. In other embodiments, the separate elements of the kit are contained within a single, undivided container. For example, the composition is contained in a bottle, vial or syringe that has attached thereto the informational material in the form of a label. In some embodiments, the kit includes a plurality (e.g., a pack) of individual containers, each containing one or more unit dosage forms (e.g., a dosage form described herein) of a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein. For example, the kit includes a plurality of syringes, ampules, foil packets, or blister packs, each containing a single unit dose of a particle described herein. The containers of the kits can be air tight, waterproof (e.g., impermeable to changes in moisture or evaporation), and/or light-tight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kit optionally includes a device suitable for administration of the composition, e.g., a syringe, inhalant, pipette, forceps, measured spoon, dropper (e.g., eye dropper), swab (e.g., a cotton swab or wooden swab), or any such delivery device. In one embodiment, the device is a medical implant device, e.g., packaged for surgical insertion.\n\n\n \nCombination Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be used in combination with other known therapies. Administered “in combination”, as used herein, means that two (or more) different treatments are delivered to the subject during the course of the subject's affliction with the disorder, e.g., the two or more treatments are delivered after the subject has been diagnosed with the disorder and before the disorder has been cured or eliminated or treatment has ceased for other reasons. In some embodiments, the delivery of one treatment is still occurring when the delivery of the second begins, so that there is overlap in terms of administration. This is sometimes referred to herein as “simultaneous” or “concurrent delivery”. In other embodiments, the delivery of one treatment ends before the delivery of the other treatment begins. In some embodiments of either case, the treatment is more effective because of combined administration. For example, the second treatment is more effective, e.g., an equivalent effect is seen with less of the second treatment, or the second treatment reduces symptoms to a greater extent, than would be seen if the second treatment were administered in the absence of the first treatment, or the analogous situation is seen with the first treatment. In some embodiments, delivery is such that the reduction in a symptom, or other parameter related to the disorder is greater than what would be observed with one treatment delivered in the absence of the other. The effect of the two treatments can be partially additive, wholly additive, or greater than additive. The delivery can be such that an effect of the first treatment delivered is still detectable when the second is delivered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and the at least one additional therapeutic agent can be administered simultaneously, in the same or in separate compositions, or sequentially. For sequential administration, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be administered first, and the additional agent can be administered second, or the order of administration can be reversed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with other therapeutic treatment modalities, including surgery, radiation, cryosurgery, and/or thermotherapy. Such combination therapies may advantageously utilize lower dosages of the administered agent and/or other chemotherapeutic agent, thus avoiding possible toxicities or complications associated with the various monotherapies. The phrase “radiation” includes, but is not limited to, external-beam therapy which involves three dimensional, conformal radiation therapy where the field of radiation is designed to conform to the volume of tissue treated; interstitial-radiation therapy where seeds of radioactive compounds are implanted using ultrasound guidance; and a combination of external-beam therapy and interstitial-radiation therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered with at least one additional therapeutic agent, such as a chemotherapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agent, e.g., with one or more chemotherapeutic agents described herein.

Immunosuppressive agents suitable for the combination include, but are not limited to natalizumab (Tysabri®), azathioprine (Imuran®), mitoxantrone (Novantrone®), mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept®), cyclosporins (e.g., Cyclosporin A (Neoral®, Sandimmun®, Sandimmune®, SangCya®), cacineurin inhibitors (e.g., Tacrolimus (Prograf®, Protopic®), sirolimus (Rapamune®), everolimus (Afinitor®), cyclophosphamide (Clafen®, Cytoxan®, Neosar®), or methotrexate (Abitrexate®, Folex®, Methotrexate®, Mexate®)), fingolimod, mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept®), mycophenolic acid (Myfortic®), anti-CD3 antibody, anti-CD25 antibody (e.g., Basiliximab (Simulect®) or daclizumab (Zenapax®)), and anti-TNFα antibody (e.g., Infliximab (Remicade®) or adalimumab (Humira®)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole (Nizoral®, Xolegel®), itraconazole (Sporanox®), clarithromycin (Biaxin®), atazanavir (Reyataz®), nefazodone (Serzone®, Nefadar®), saquinavir (Invirase®), telithromycin (Ketek®), ritonavir (Norvir®), amprenavir (also known as Agenerase, a prodrug version is fosamprenavir (Lexiva®, Telzir®), indinavir (Crixivan®), nelfinavir (Viracept®), delavirdine (Rescriptor®) or voriconazole (Vfend®)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen employing the methods or compositions, other agents used in the modulation of tumor growth or metastasis in a clinical setting, such as antiemetics, can also be administered as desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen formulating the pharmaceutical compositions featured in the invention the clinician may utilize preferred dosages as warranted by the condition of the subject being treated. For example, in one embodiment, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be administered at a dosing schedule described herein, e.g., once every one, two, three or four weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in general, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and an additional chemotherapeutic agent(s) do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. For example, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be administered intravenously while the chemotherapeutic agent(s) may be administered orally. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered once every three weeks and an additional therapeutic agent (or additional therapeutic agents) may also be administered every three weeks for as long as treatment is required. Examples of other chemotherapeutic agents which are administered one every three weeks include: an antimetabolite (e.g., floxuridine (FUDF®), pemetrexed (ALIMTA®), 5FU (Adrucil®, Efudex®, Fluoroplex®)); an anthracycline (e.g., daunorubicin (Cerubidine®, Rubidomycin®), epirubicin (Ellence®), idarubicin (Idamycin®), mitoxantrone (Novantrone®), valrubicin (Valstar®)); a vinca alkaloid (e.g., vinblastine (Velban®, Velsar®), vincristine (Vincasar®, Oncovin®), vindesine (Eldisine®) and vinorelbine (Navelbine®)); a taxane (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel, larotaxel and cabazitaxel); and a platinum-based agent (e.g., cisplatin (Platinol®), carboplatin (Paraplat®, Paraplatin®), oxaliplatin (Eloxatin®)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered once every two weeks in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agent that is administered orally. For example, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be administered once every two weeks in combination with one or more of the following chemotherapeutic agents: capecitabine (Xeloda®), estramustine (Emcyt®), erlotinib (Tarceva®), rapamycin (Rapamune®), SDZ-RAD, CP-547632; AZD2171, sunitinib (Sutent®), sorafenib (Nexavar®) and everolimus (Afinitor®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe actual dosage of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and/or any additional chemotherapeutic agent employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the subject and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small amounts until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, when a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agent, the additional chemotherapeutic agent (or agents) is administered at a standard dose. For example, a standard dosage for cisplatin is 75-120 mg/m\n2 \nadministered every three weeks; a standard dosage for carboplatin is within the range of 200-600 mg/m\n2 \nor an AUC of 0.5-8 mg/ml×min; e.g., at an AUC of 4-6 mg/ml×min; a standard dosage for irinotecan is within 100-125 mg/m\n2\n, once a week; a standard dosage for gemcitabine is within the range of 80-1500 mg/m\n2 \nadministered weekly; a standard dose for UFT is within a range of 300-400 mg/m\n2 \nper day when combined with leucovorin administration; a standard dosage for leucovorin is 10-600 mg/m\n2 \nadministered weekly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosure also encompasses a method for the synergistic treatment of cancer wherein a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with an additional chemotherapeutic agent or agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particular choice of conjugate, particle or composition and anti-proliferative cytotoxic agent(s) or radiation will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the subject and the appropriate treatment protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation are not administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously, then the initial order of administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, and the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation, may be varied. Thus, for example, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be administered first followed by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation; or the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation may be administered first followed by the administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. This alternate administration may be repeated during a single treatment protocol. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in accordance with experience and knowledge, the practicing physician can modify each protocol for the administration of a component (CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, anti-neoplastic agent(s), or radiation) of the treatment according to the individual subject's needs, as the treatment proceeds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe attending clinician, in judging whether treatment is effective at the dosage administered, will consider the general well-being of the subject as well as more definite signs such as relief of disease-related symptoms, inhibition of tumor growth, actual shrinkage of the tumor, or inhibition of metastasis. Size of the tumor can be measured by standard methods such as radiological studies, e.g., CAT or MRI scan, and successive measurements can be used to judge whether or not growth of the tumor has been retarded or even reversed. Relief of disease-related symptoms such as pain, and improvement in overall condition can also be used to help judge effectiveness of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosed CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions are useful in treating proliferative disorders, e.g., treating a tumor, e.g., a primary tumor, and/or metastases thereof, wherein the tumor is a primary tumor or a metastases thereof, e.g., a cancer described herein or a metastases of a cancer described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods described herein can be used to treat a solid tumor, a soft tissue tumor or a liquid tumor.

The study was composed of two parts. Part 1 of the Phase 1 study had a primary objective to determine the safety profile, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of CRLX101 when administered weekly for 3 consecutive weeks of every 4-week cycle (the initial dosing regimen, sometimes referred to herein as “weekly ×3”). In \npart\n 2, after the first twelve patients were enrolled, an every other week schedule was initiated for the remainder of the Phase 1 program (sometimes referred to herein as “biweekly”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEligibility Criteria. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable solid tumors refractory to standard therapy, or for which no standard curative or palliative therapy existed, were eligible for this trial. Prior treatment with topoisomerase inhibitors was allowed. Main eligibility criteria included male or female patients, at least 18 years of age, with advanced, histologically confirmed solid tumor refractory to standard treatment, or for which no standard therapy existed, measurable or evaluable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≦2, acceptable organ and bone marrow function, no evidence of clinically significant conduction abnormalities or ischemia, and ejection fraction ≧45%. Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or investigational therapy had to be completed within a prescribed interval before enrollment, could not have included high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue bone marrow transplantation, and patients could not have been refractory to prior treatment with a topoisomerase I inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis trial was conducted at City of Hope (COH) (Duarte, Calif.) following approval of the Clinical Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (CPRMC) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB). After the initial 18 patients were enrolled, an additional site was added at TGen (Scottsdale, Ariz.) following the approval of WIRB (Western Institutional Review Board).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudy design and drug administration. This was an open-labeled, single-arm dose-escalation phase 1 study of CRLX101. In part 1, CRLX101 was administered at 6, 12, or 18 mg/m\n2 \non a weekly schedule three weeks per month. In \npart\n 2, CRLX101 was administered at 12, 15 or 18 mg/m\n2 \non an every other week schedule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn part 1, CRLX101 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 followed by a 7 day rest period (28 day cycle). In \npart\n 2, CRLX101 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15, every 28 days. CRLX101 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15, every 28 days for the last six patients in \npart\n 2 of the Phase 1 study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe starting dose in part 1 was 6 mg/m\n2\n. Dose escalation was done using an accelerated Simon design (Simon et al., “Accelerated Titration Designs for Phase I Clinical Trials in Oncology” \nJ Natl Cancer Inst. \n89:1138-47, 1997) with a modified Fibonacci dose escalation scheme. In brief, patients were accrued in cohorts of one at escalating doses until the occurrence of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first cycle. Once a DLT occurred, additional patients were accrued in that dosage group to provide for either 3 or 6 patients as provided in a standard dose escalation with the intent of determining the maximum tolerated dose. Concurrent accrual was allowed within the same dose level. No intrapatient dose escalation was permitted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity Assessment. Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCl) common toxicity criteria (CTCAE) version 3.0. The DLT in a given patient was defined as any treatment-related grade III non-hematologic toxicity, any grade IV hematologic toxicity, or persisting toxicities of any grade requiring delay of scheduled treatment by more than 2 weeks. DLT was based on the first course of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRules for dose escalation. One patient was treated at each dose level. If a DLT attributable to the study drug(s) was experienced, up to 5 additional patients were subsequently treated at that dose level. If no additional DLTs were observed at the expanded dose level (i.e., at most ⅙ with an attributable DLT), the dose was escalated. Escalation was terminated when two of six patients experienced any DLT attributable to the study drug at a given dose level. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the dose level preceding the dose at which ≧2/6 patients experienced a first-course DLT. Treatment was continued in an individual patient for a total of 6 cycles at the same dose level if no DLT was observed and if clinical benefit was observed. Therapy was discontinued in any patient if excessive toxicity was experienced. No intra-patient dose escalation was permitted. Patients who completed 6 cycles with clinical benefit had the option of continuing treatment at the same dose level every other week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSafety and efficacy evaluations. Patients were seen, examined and a complete blood count with differential and serum chemistry was obtained before each dose. Radiographic assessments of tumor response (as evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor criteria RECIST) were performed every two cycles (Therasse et al., “New Guidelines to Evaluate the Response to Treatment in Solid Tumors. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, National Cancer Institute of the United States, National Cancer Institute of Canada” \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst. \n92:205-16, 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment modification. Patients who experienced a DLT during the initial cycle, or a severe or life threatening non-hematologic toxicity at any time during the study, were dose reduced at the next dose administration when their DLT returned to Grade 1. If a non-hematologic DLT occurred in the interval between dose administrations within a cycle, and the toxicity was not life threatening and resolved rapidly, the next dose administration within the cycle was to be at the next lower dose level. If a hematologic DLT occurred in the interval between dose administrations within a cycle, the next dose administration was to be at the next lower dose level, even if the blood cell counts recovered by the date of the next scheduled administration. Dosing was to be held for any non-hematologic toxicity grade ≧2, except for \ngrade\n 2 fatigue and anorexia. After the first cycle, dose modifications were based on interval toxicity, and platelet and granulocyte counts were obtained on the day of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHematologic toxicity: On day 1 of a cycle, administration of CRLX101 required an absolute granulocyte count (AGC) of ≧1500 and platelet count of ≧100,000. On day 8, if the AGC was ≧1000 and platelet count ≧75,000, then CRLX101 was given at full dose and in the same manner for day 15. If the AGC was <1000, the treating physicians could delay the dose of CRLX101 on days 8 and 15. If unacceptable hematologic toxicity persisted >7 days, the CRLX101 dose was reduced to the next lower dose level. Similar standards were used in the biweekly part.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-hematologic toxicity: Any \ngrade\n 2 toxicity that was intolerable to the patients, or any grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity that was attributed to CRLX101, had to return to grade 1 before a new cycle of treatment was started. Any treatment delay >2 weeks because of toxicity due to CRLX101 would result in the patient being removed from the study. If a patient experienced any grade 3 genitourinary (GU) toxicity, the dose of CRLX101 was reduced to the next lower dose level, as CPT has been reported to cause hematuria, cystitis or other GU toxicities, which can be irreversible. If the patient experienced grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities that did not recover to grade 1 before the next treatment, treatment was held until recovery and then reduced by one dose level. If the patient experienced grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities that did not recover to grade 1 before the next treatment, then the dose was reduced by 50% in subsequent cycles. If there were conflicting dose attenuations by hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity, the greater dose reduction was applied. All dose modifications were permanent. Criteria for removal from treatment included disease progression, clinical progression, excessive toxicity, or patient withdrawal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma/urine sampling and analysis. Whole blood samples (5 mL) were collected in heparinized tubes at the following times during cycle one: pre-dose, during dosing at 30 minutes, 60 minutes and just prior to end of administration (90 minutes), and then at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, (48-72 hr optional), 168 hours (1 week), and 336 hours (only for patients on biweekly schedule) following the first dose. A spot trough PK blood sample was collected prior to dosing on Day 1 and Day 15 of every cycle. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 1,300×g for 10 minutes at 4° C. Plasma was immediately frozen at −20° C., and stored frozen until analysis. For determination of urinary excretion of polymer conjugated and unbound CPT, total urine collections were performed following dose 1 of the first cycle (0-24 and 24-48 hours post administration. A spot urine sample (15 mL) was collected at 8, 24, 48, 168 (1 wk), and 336 hours (pre-second dose) for more accurate determination of total to free CPT ratio. Once each urine collection was complete, the actual collection times and total volume of urine was recorded and a 5-10 mL aliquot of each was frozen for subsequent drug level analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples were extracted and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry) using a validated method. In order to determine total CPT in samples, a 20 μL, aliquot was incubated with 5 μL, 0.2N NaOH for 1 hour to release all CPT from the polymer conjugate. The solution was acidified with 7 μL 44% formic acid. Proteins were precipitated by addition of 160 μL cold (<−20° C.) methanol containing the internal standard 9-nitro camptothecin (9-NC) at a concentration of 8 ng/mL, incubation for 30 minutes on ice, and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of 0.5 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 3.5, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to determine unconjugated CPT in samples, a 20 μL, aliquot was acidified with 3 μL 44% formic acid. Proteins were precipitated by addition of 160 μL cold (<−20° C.) methanol containing 9-NC at a concentration of 8 ng/mL, incubation for 30 minutes on ice, and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of 0.5 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 3.5 and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLC-MS/MS was performed on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Palo Alto, Calif.) coupled to a Micromass Quattro Ultima Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Micromass, Inc., Beverly, Mass.). HPLC separation was achieved using a Synergy Hydro-RP 4 \nμm\n 75×2 mm analytical column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif.) preceded by a C\n18 \nguard column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif.). The isocratic mobile phase consisted of 34% acetonitrile, 66% 0.5 mM ammonium acetate, pH 3.5 at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min at room temperature. MassLynx version 3.5 software was used for data acquisition and processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunohistochemical analysis of topoisomerase I expression. Ascites fluid from one patient with ovarian cancer was obtained pre-treatment and on \nday\n 2 post treatment with CRLX101 at 6 mg/m\n2\n. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and the pellet frozen. The pellet was formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 5 μm thick sections. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene followed by 100% ethanol. Samples were then quenched in 3% hydrogen peroxide and pretreated to promote antigen retrieval by steam in DIVA/citrate buffer (pH 6.0, Biocare Medical, Concord, Calif.) solution. After antigen retrieval, slides were incubated in Protein Block for 20 minutes. Slides were then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4° C. Topoisomerase I antibody was rabbit polyclonal from Abcam (Cambridge, Mass.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe next day, slides were washed in Dako Buffer (DB) and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 30 minutes at room temperature. After washes in DB, slides were incubated with the chromogen diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB), counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTopoisomerase I enzymatic activity assay. Lysates containing total cellular protein were made from the plain frozen ascites cells according to the method of Minagawa et al. (“Enhanced Topoisomerase I Activity and Increased Topoisomerase II Alpha Content in Cisplatin-Resistant Cancer Cell Lines” \nJpn J Cancer Res. \n88:1218-23, 1997), a procedure used specifically for frozen cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe catalytic activity of topoisomerase I was determined by measuring the relaxation of supercoiled plasmid substrate DNA using the Topo I assay kit (TopoGEN, Port Orange, Fla.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, reaction mixtures consisted of supercoiled plasmid substrate DNA (0.5 μg), whole cell lysate (0.25 μg or 0.5 μg, as indicated in data) and the assay buffer (final concentrations: 10 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.9], 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.1 mM spermidine, and 5% glycerol). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes, and terminated by adding 5 μL stop buffer/gel loading buffer. Samples were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel in 1×TAE buffer (40 mM Tris base [pH 8.3, adjusted in the 50× stock buffer using glacial acetic acid], 2.5 mM NaOAc, and 0.05 mM EDTA) and electrophoresed at 4-5 volts per centimeter for 3-4 hours. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) and relaxed DNA (0.5 μg) provided by the Topo I assay kit were used as the control markers. The gel was stained with 0.2 μg/mL ethidium bromide for 20 minutes at room temperature, destained in water for 20 minutes and photographed under ultraviolet (UV) light.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. Plasma concentration versus time data were analyzed using the ADAPT II (Biomedical Simulations Resource, Los Angeles) non-compartmental model. Results are summarized using descriptive statistics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatient Enrollment. Twenty-four patients were enrolled from June 2006 to April 2010. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The patients had a variety of solid tumors, and lung cancer was the most common tumor type.

The results of a CT scan performed on this patient are shown in \nFIGS. 1A and 1B\n. Four patients experienced prolonged (>6 months) SD (stable disease), one patient with renal cancer with lung metastases, two patients with non-small cell lung cancer patient, and one patient with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

All patients in the first twelve enrolled (weekly ×3) experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities at doses above 6 mg/m\n2\n. The weekly ×3 schedule was stopped after these first twelve patients due to the severe toxicity observed in all patients treated at doses higher than 6 mg/m\n2\n. One patient tolerated 9 mg/m\n2 \non a weekly ×3 schedule for five cycles (three doses per cycle).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo patients in the second twelve patients enrolled at the bi-weekly schedule experienced severe toxicity until the MTD was reached. \nGrade\n 2 DLTs included the following.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne bladder cancer patient experienced \ngrade\n 2 anemia in \ncycle\n 2, day 8. This \ngrade\n 2 hematologic toxicity resolved in two weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne lung cancer patient experienced elevated amylase in laboratory tests but no clinical manifestation of pancreatitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne head and neck cancer patient (nasopharyngeal with heavy previous chemotherapy) experienced delayed \nonset grade\n 2 transaminitis in \ncycle\n 2, day 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne lung cancer patient experienced \ngrade\n 2 hematologic toxicity which resolved in two weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the highest dose tested, two patients experienced DLT hematological toxicities. The first patient, a breast cancer patient, who had metastatic disease to lung and other organs and had previously received multiple chemotherapy regimens, developed grade 3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. This patient required platelet transfusions. The second patient had metastatic lung cancer, and had previously received carboplatin and paclitaxel with a brief response. This patient developed grade 3 neutropenia, requiring dose reduction and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. This hematological toxicity in 2 of 3 patients established 18 mg/m\n2 \nas the DLT level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne pancreatic cancer patient experienced \ngrade\n 2 anemia on \ncycle\n 5, day 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne patient with hepatocellular cancer passed away one week after cycle 3, day 1 due to progressive disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne patient with lung cancer who had received multiple prior regimens, developed \ngrade\n 2 neutropenia on cycle 3, day 15. This patient required a dose reduction and G-CSF support.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the long terminal half-life of polymer conjugated, and especially unconjugated, CPT (see \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n), the protocol was amended in \npart\n 2 to evaluate an every other week schedule. A total of 12 patients were treated on this schedule, three at 12 mg/m\n2 \nand six at 15 mg/m\n2 \nand three at 18 mg/m\n2\n. Except for one occurrence of grade 3 neutropenia, no grade 3/4 hematologic events were recorded at dose level 12 mg/m\n2 \nand 15 mg/m\n2\n. At \ndose level\n 18 mg/m\n2 \none grade 4 leukopenia, two grade 4 neutropenia, two grade 4 thrombocytopenia and one grade 3 anemia were reported under hematological toxicities. This determined the DLT of bone marrow suppression at 18 mg/m\n2 \non this schedule. The only other notable non hematologic event was a grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction. (Table 4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 4 shows a summary of all grade 3/4 treatment related toxicities for all evaluable patients. Four patients on the weekly schedule developed delayed onset (after cycle 4) mild hematuria and mild dysuria that may have been related to treatment as previously reported for CPT (Muggia et al., “Phase I Clinical Trial of Weekly and Daily Treatment with Camptothecin (NSC-100880): Correlation with Preclinical Studies” \nCancer Chemother Rep \n56:515-521, 1972). However, upon evaluation by a urologist, cystitis could not be confirmed.

Samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected from all patients during cycle 1. Results from this analysis are summarized in \nFIGS. 2A\n, \n2\nB and Table 5. The mean elimination half-lives were 31.8±5.7 hr and 43.8±9.7 hr for conjugated and unconjugated CPT, respectively. Volume of distribution of the polymer conjugate was 4.2±1.1 liter and was independent of dose. The low volume of distribution suggests that CRLX101 is initially retained in plasma and avoids rapid first pass clearance. C\nmax \nand AUC\n0-inf \nwere linear across doses and similar when normalized for dose/m\n2\n. \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n summarize pharmacokinetic parameters measured for polymer conjugated and unconjugated CPT for both schedules. Unconjugated CPT was slowly released from CRLX101 as shown by increasing plasma concentrations that peaked at 20.2±9.7 hrs. Plasma concentrations of unconjugated CPT were significantly below the plasma concentrations of conjugated CPT at all timepoints, with unconjugated CPT accounting for an average of 8.7±2.7% of total CPT plasma exposure. \nFIG. 2A\n shows average plasma time-concentration curves for the biweekly 12 mg/m cohort Systemic plasma clearance of conjugated CPT was 0.12±0.2 L/h, significantly below the kidney and liver blood flows in humans, and was also independent of dose. \nFIG. 2B\n shows average urinary excretion of polymer conjugated and unconjugated CPT in the first 48 hours following CRLX101 administration. Urinary loss of total CPT was variable with an average of 22.8±12.1% of dose excreted during the first 48 hours, of which 78±9% was in the conjugated form. Interestingly, urinary excretion of the polymer conjugate was primarily in the first 24 hours (16.4%±10.0% of dose) compared to the second 24 hours (1.5±1.3% of dose) post administration. Urinary excretion of unconjugated CPT remained approximately constant over both 24 hour periods (2.0±1.1% vs. 2.9±1.4% of dose). Toxicokinetic analysis of the two schedules showed that the predicted monthly exposure for conjugated and unconjugated CPT was similar for 6 mg/m\n2 \nweekly vs. 12 mg/m\n2 \nbi-weekly and 12 mg/m\n2 \nweekly vs. 15 mg/m\n2 \nbi-weekly; however, fewer patients experienced cycle one drug related adverse events with the bi-weekly regimen.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters and toxicokinetic summary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nT\n1/2, β\n \n\n\nAUC\n\n\nPer cycle AUC\n\n\n# Pt with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDose/\n\n\nC\nmax \nmg/L\n\n\nhr\n\n\nmg/L/hr\n\n\nmg/L/hr\n\n\nDR AE ≧\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\nN\n\n\nBound\n\n\nFree\n\n\nBound\n\n\nFree\n\n\nBound\n\n\nFree\n\n\nBound\n\n\nFree\n\n\nGrade. 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 mg/\nm\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n3.55 ±\n\n\n0.10 ±\n\n\n31.1 ±\n\n\n43.7 ±\n\n\n114.4 ±\n\n\n11.9 ±\n\n\n343.2 ±\n\n\n35.7 ±\n\n\n2 (33%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweekly × 3\n\n\n \n\n\n0.46\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n14.6\n\n\n21.5\n\n\n7.0\n\n\n64.5\n\n\n21.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 mg/m\n2\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n5.55 ±\n\n\n0.18 ±\n\n\n33.8 ±\n\n\n61.5 ±\n\n\n188.5 ±\n\n\n18.3 ±\n\n\n565.6 ±\n\n\n54.9 ±\n\n\n1 (33%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweekly × 3\n\n\n \n\n\n1.33\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n5.9\n\n\n37.6\n\n\n56.7\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n170.1\n\n\n11.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 mg/m\n\n\n3\n\n\n7.90 ±\n\n\n0.24 ±\n\n\n37.7 ±\n\n\n38.3 ±\n\n\n248.3 ±\n\n\n23.7 ±\n\n\n744.8 ±\n\n\n71.1 ±\n\n\n3 (100%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweekly × 3\n\n\n \n\n\n1.18\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n29.2\n\n\n5.9\n\n\n87.5\n\n\n17.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 mg/m\n2\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n5.56 ±\n\n\n0.22 ±\n\n\n27.8 ±\n\n\n32.5 ±\n\n\n182.0 ±\n\n\n14.6 ±\n\n\n364.0 ±\n\n\n29.0 ±\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbiweekly\n\n\n \n\n\n0.37\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n21.6\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n43.1\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 mg/m\n2\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n8.63 ±\n\n\n0.27 ±\n\n\n30.4 ±\n\n\n48.3 ±\n\n\n276.7 ±\n\n\n23.5 ±\n\n\n553.8 ±\n\n\n47.0 ±\n\n\n1 (33%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbiweekly\n\n\n \n\n\n0.76\n\n\n0.13\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n28.3\n\n\n18.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues are in geometric means ± standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCorrelative Studies. Ascites cells were collected from one patient with ovarian cancer pre-treatment and on \n \nDays\n \n 2 and 25 post-treatment. Pellets of these cells were frozen for later analysis. Levels of polymer conjugated and unconjugated CPT were also determined in the ascites fluid pre-treatment and on \nday\n 2 post-treatment. On \nday\n 2, the concentrations detected were 46.6 μg/L for conjugated CPT and 19.6 μg/L for fully active, unconjugated CPT. For each amount of lysate used, there was less topoisomerase I unwinding activity (i.e., more remaining supercoiled DNA) in the \nDay\n 2 samples than in the pretreatment or \nDay\n 25 samples. This suggests an inhibitory effect of CRLX101 on these cells at this early time point after administration. The ascites cells were also used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess the levels of topoisomerase I. Basic agreement was observed between the topoisomerase I activity assay and topoisomerase I IHC. As seen in \nFIGS. 3A and 3B\n, there was a reduction of approximately 30% in staining in the nucleus of ovarian cancer cells isolated from the patient's \nascites fluid\n 2 days after treatment (\nFIG. 3B\n), compared to a similar sample taken before drug administration (\nFIG. 3A\n). The decrease in topoisomerase I levels directly seen by IHC in these cells at 48 hours explains why much of the supercoiled DNA remains present in lanes of \nFIG. 3C\n with reactions from \nDay\n 2 lysates; i.e., there is much less enzyme available to act on these substrate molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSummary. In the phase I trial reported above, two dosing schedules, weekly ×3 and every other week (biweekly), were investigated. In the weekly ×3 schedule the maximum tolerated dose was approximately 9 mg/m\n2\n. Hematologic toxicity and cystitis were the DLTs in this schedule. Non-hematologic grade 3/4 adverse events included fatigue in 3 patients (25%), delayed onset hematuria/dysuria in 2 patients (17%), elevated CPK (creatine phosphokinase) in 1 patient (8%), and dehydration in 1 patient (8%), all of which were reversible. Cumulative bladder toxicity in some patients on this schedule was primarily observed post cycle one and may have been related to the long terminal half-life of unconjugated CPT, which is primarily cleared through the kidneys, leading to cumulative bladder irritation. Based on this observation, it was decided to investigate a biweekly schedule as a strategy to reduce cumulative toxicity while maintaining dose delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biweekly schedule allowed for similar per cycle plasma exposure to be achieved in patients but with a significantly reduced incidence of adverse events. The only observed grade 3/4 adverse event was grade 3 neutropenia in one patient that was reversible. One dose reduction was required on this schedule. On this schedule, CRLX101 was well tolerated without the toxicities normally associated with camptothecin analogs, such as severe diarrhea and hemorrhagic cystitis. The MTD on this schedule was determined to be 15 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic analysis of CRLX101 was performed after the first dose for all patients. Consistent with preclinical data, the pharmacokinetics of CRLX101 were characterized by a low volume of distribution and limited systemic clearance. Preclinical studies showed accumulation of CRLX101 in tumors and tissues of the reticuloendothelial system such as liver and spleen. Increased release of active CPT from the conjugate was also observed in these tissues. This study also confirmed that release kinetics of CPT were such that plasma levels of unconjugated CPT remained significantly below levels of conjugate at all times. After one week, approximately 10% of the maximum recorded concentration of unconjugated CPT was still detected in plasma, possibly leading to the cumulative toxicity observed on the weekly ×3 schedule. On the biweekly schedule however, unconjugated CPT levels dropped below the limit of quantitation before the second dose, which may explain the lack of urinary side effects on this schedule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, CRLX101 was well tolerated and myelosuppression was the DLT. Ten out of twenty-four patients demonstrated stable disease on CT scan evaluation at the end of \ncycle\n 2. One pancreatic cancer patient remained stable for 22.8 months. Serum and urine PK data from all the treated patients indicated that the mean elimination half-lives for conjugated and unconjugated CPT were 31.8 hr and 43.8 hr, respectively. C\nmax \nand AUC\n0-inf \nwere linear across doses and similar when normalized for dose/m\n2\n. The biweekly schedule allowed for similar per cycle plasma exposure to be achieved in patients, but with a significantly reduced incidence of adverse events.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nSynthesis of 6\nA\n,6\nD\n-Bis-(2-amino-2-carboxylethylthio)-6\nA\n,6\nD\n-dideoxy-β-cyclodextrin, 4 (CD-BisCys)\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n167 mL of 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer were degassed for 45 minutes in a 500 mL 2-neck round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a condenser and septum.

The resulting suspension was heated at a reflux temperature for 4.5 h until the solution turned clear (colorless). The solution was then cooled to room temperature and acidified to pH 3 using 1N HCl. The product was precipitated by slow addition of acetone (3 times weight ratio of the solution). This afforded 9.0 g crude material containing CD-biscysteine (90.0%), unreacted cyclodextrin, CD-mono-cysteine and cystine. The resulting solid was subjected to anionic exchange column chromatography (SuperQ650M, Tosoh Bioscience) using a gradient elution of 0-0.4M ammonium bicarbonate. All fractions were analyzed by HPLC. The desired fractions were combined and the solvent was reduced to 100 mL under vacuum.

When 2.3 eq. of DIEA were added, the viscosity of the polymerization solution increased dramatically after 4-6 hours of reaction. DIEA deprotonates the amino groups of 4 to render them more nucleophilic for coupling with PEG-DiSPA. There were essentially no differences in the polymerizations if other bases, such as TEA or DMAP, were used (36b-c, Table 6). Polymerization using 4 recovered by the two different precipitation methods (acetone and methanol) produced polymers with different MWs. 4 that was purified by the methanol-precipitation method (contains no free cystine) gave higher MW polymer (36d-e) as compared to the less pure 4 that was obtained from the acetone-precipitation method (36a).

Reaction of 4 with PEG-DiSBA gave polymer 36g with similar linkages as 36a-f (amide bond, but one more —CH\n2 \ngroup than 36a-f at the linker) with M\nw \nover 100 kDa, while reaction of 4 with PEG-DiBTC and PEG-DiNPC generated polymers 36h and 36i, respectively, with connecting carbamate moiety and M\nw\n's over 50 kDa (Table 6).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolymerization of 4 with difunctionalized PEG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPoly-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEG\n\n\n \n\n\nmerization\n\n\nM\nw\n \n\n\nM\nn\n \n\n\nM\nw\n/\n\n\nYield\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDP\n\n\nComonomer\n\n\nBase\n\n\ntime (h)\n\n\n(kDa)\n\n\n(kDa)\n\n\nM\nn\n \n\n\n(%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36a\na\n \n\n\nPEG-DiSPA\n\n\nDIEA\n\n\n120\n\n\n57.4\n\n\n41.7\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36b\na\n \n\n\nPEG-DiSPA\n\n\nDMAP\n\n\n120\n\n\n54.2\n\n\n38.1\n\n\n1.42\n\n\n91\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36c\na\n \n\n\nPEG-DiSPA\n\n\nTEA\n\n\n120\n\n\n57.4\n\n\n42.6\n\n\n1.35\n\n\n91\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36d\nb\n \n\n\nPEG-DiSPA\n\n\nDIEA\n\n\n120\n\n\n93.6\n\n\n58.0\n\n\n1.48\n\n\n96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36e\nb\n \n\n\nPEG-DiSPA\n\n\nDIEA\n\n\n144\n\n\n97.3\n\n\n58.0\n\n\n1.67\n\n\n94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36f\nb\n \n\n\nPEG-\nDiSPA\n \n \nDIEA\n \n \n\n\n2\n\n\n35.3\n\n\n25.6\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36g\n\n\n\n\nPEG-DiSBA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIEA\n\n\n\n\n120\n\n\n114.7\n\n\n77.9\n\n\n1.47\n\n\n96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36h\n\n\nPEG-DiBTC\n\n\nDIEA\n\n\n120\n\n\n67.6\n\n\n39.4\n\n\n1.47\n\n\n95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36i\n\n\nPEG-DiNPC\n\n\nDIEA\n\n\n120\n\n\n86.5\n\n\n57.2\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\n4 was washed with acetone before polymerization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\n4 was washed with methanol before polymerization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymers 36a-i are highly soluble in aqueous solution.

The polymer was precipitated with ethyl ether (1 L). The ether was poured out and the precipitate was washed with CH\n3\nCN (3×100 mL). The precipitate was dissolved in water 600 mL. Some insoluble solid was filtered through 0.2 μm filters. The solution was dialyzed using 25,000 MWCO membrane (Spectra/Por 7) for 10 h at 10-15° C. in DI water. Dialysis water was changed every 60 minutes. The polymer-drug conjugate solution was sterilized by passing it through 0.2 μM filters.

The yield of LGGG10 was 83%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of Poly(CDDCys-PA-PEG)-Gly-CPT (HG6) Conjugation of 11 to 36e was performed in a manner similar to that used to produce HGGG6. The yield of HG6 was 83%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of Poly(CDDCys-PA-PEG)-GlyGlyGly-CPT (HGGG10) 36e (1.5 g, 0.33 mmol of repeat unit) was dissolved in dry DMSO (150 mL). The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes. 12 (941 mg, 1.49 mmol, 4.5 eq), DIEA (0.258 mL, 1.49 mmol, 4.5 eq), EDC (283 mg, 1.49 mmol, 4.5 eq), and NHS (113 mg, 0.99 mmol, 3 eq) was added to the polymer solution and stirred for ca. 24 hours. Another portion of EDC (142 mg, 0.75 mmol, 2.3 eq) and NHS (56 mg, 0.5 mmol, 1.5 eq) were added to the conjugation solution. The polymer was stirred for an additional 22 hours. The workup procedure was the same as that for the synthesis of HGGG6.

An aliquot of corresponding stock solution was diluted to 100 μg/mL using 1 N NaOH. CPT was completely hydrolyzed in this basic solution and transformed to its carboxylate form within 2 h at room temperature. An aliquot of this solution was diluted to 10 μg/mL using 8.5% H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and the CPT carboxylate form was transformed to its lactone form. 30 μL of this solution was injected into the HPLC. The peak area from the CPT lactone form was integrated and compared to a standard curve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n11 and 12 were conjugated to 36e or 36f (Table 2) using conventional coupling methods. Due to the instability of the ester linker of 11 and 12 in aqueous solution, the conjugation was conducted in anhydrous DMSO under argon. An organic base was required to deprotonate the TFA salts of 11 and 12 to facilitate the coupling. For polymer conjugation with 12, the weight percent (wt %) drug loading was around 6-10%. The theoretical maximum drug loading is around 13% using PEG with MW of 3400 Da; maximum values can be increased by decreasing the MW of the PEG segments. Solubilities of all conjugates in water or PBS were more than 200 mg/mL (equivalent to a 12-20 mg CPT/mL for 6-10 wt % drug loading, respectively).

This solution was added to a lyophilized powder of human plasma to reconstitute 100% human plasma by the recommended amount. The solution was divided into equal volume (250 μL) to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, incubated at 37° C., and stopped at selected time point. Samples were stored at −80° C. until the analysis. Samples were separated from plasma by solid phase extraction columns The solid phase extraction cartridge (Oasis HLB 1 cc cartridge from Waters) was pre-conditioned with 1 mL of acetonitrile and then with 1 mL of 8.5% H\n3\nPO\n4 \nbefore loading. Samples were acidified with equal volume of 8.5% H\n3\nPO\n4 \nprior to loading. After the acidified solution was loaded on the cartridge, the bed was washed with 3×1 mL of water.

Therefore, a particle comprising conjugates described above may include a conjugate reacted at all positions available for attachment and particles that have less than all of the positions available for attachment containing the drug, e.g., the particle can include CPD reacted at one or none of the positions available for attachment. Thus, while Scheme VI depicts CPT at every point of attachment of each polymer subunit, the CDP-CPT conjugate can have less than 2 CPT molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-CPT conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include two, one or no CPT attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-CPT conjugates having two, one or no CPT attached to each polymer subunit of the CDP-CPT conjugate and the conjugates can also include a mixture of CDP-CPT conjugates that can vary as to the number of CPTs attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethod II.

CD-BisCys-Peg-GluBis(GlyCPT) 43 is precipitated with CH\n3\nCN and washed with the same solvent until no free drug is detected using UV or TLC. 43 is dried under high vacuum. While Scheme VII shows that the drug is attached at all available positions, not all positions may be reacted. Therefore, a particle comprising conjugates described above may include a conjugate reacted at all positions available for attachment and particles that have less than all of the positions available for attachment containing the drug, e.g., the particle can include CDP reacted at three, two, one or none of the positions available for attachment. Thus, while Scheme VII depicts CPT at every point of attachment of each polymer subunit, the CDP-CPT conjugate can have less than 4 CPT molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-CPT conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include four, three, two, one or no CPT attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-CPT conjugates having four, three, two, one or no CPT attached to each polymer subunit of the CDP-CPT conjugate and the conjugates can also include a mixture of CDP-CPT conjugates that can vary as to the number of CPTs attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nSynthesis and In vitro Analysis of CDP-Gly-SN-38\n\n\n \n \n \nSN-38 was derivatized with the amino acid glycine at the 20-OH position as shown in Scheme VIII. Briefly, 20(S)-7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38, 1.0 g, mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of 70 mL dimethylformamide (DMF) and 30 mL pyridine. A solution of di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate (0.83 g, 3.8 mmol) in 10 mL DMF was added and the mixture stirred at room temperature overnight (12 hours). The solvent was removed under vacuum to yield a yellow solid and re-crystallized from boiling 2-propanol (75 mL) to yield 20(s)-10-tert-butoxycarbonyloxy-7-ethyl-camptothecin (Boc-SN-38) as a yellow solid (0.6 g, 48% yield).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoc-SN-38 (0.73 g, 1.5 mmol), N-(tertbutoxycarbonyl)glycine (0.26 g, 1.5 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 0.18 g, 1.5 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous methylene chloride (30 mL) and chilled to 0° C. 1,3-Diisopropyl-carbodiimide (DIPC, 0.19 g, 1.5 mmol) was added, the mixture stirred at 0° C. for 30 minutes followed by stirring for 4 hours at room temperature. The mixture was diluted with methylene chloride to 100 mL, washed twice with an aqueous solution of 0.1N hydrochloric acid (25 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent removed under vacuum. The resulting yellow solid was purified by flash chromatography in methylene chloride:acetone (9:1) followed by solvent removal under vacuum to yield 20-O—(N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl) glycyl)-10-tert-butyoxycarbonyloxy-7-ethylcamptothecin (diBoc-Gly-SN-38, 640 mg, 67% yield).\n\n\n \n \nScheme VIII: Derivatization of SN-38 to 20-O—(N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl) glycyl)-10-tert-butyoxycarbonyloxy-7-ethylcamptothecin (diBOC-Gly-SN-38)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nCDP was synthesized as previously described (Cheng et al.

The polymer was precipitated by addition of 50 mL acetone followed by 50 mL diethyl ether. Precipitate was centrifuged, washed twice with 20 mL acetone each, and dissolved in water acidified to pH 3.0 with hydrochloric acid. Polymer solution was dialized for 24 hours against pH 3.0 water using a 25 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane. The resulting solution was lyophilized to yield CDP-Gly-SN-38 (180 mg, 67% yield). The polymer was analyzed for total and free SN-38 content by HPLC using SN-38 as a standard curve as previously described (Cheng et al. (2003) Bioconjugate Chemistry 14(5):1007-1017). Total SN-38 content was 7.66% w/w of which 97.4% was polymer bound.

Therefore, a particle comprising conjugates described above may include a conjugate reacted at all positions available for attachment and particles that have less than all of the positions available for attachment containing the drug, e.g., the particle can include CPD reacted at one or none of the positions available for attachment. Thus, while Scheme IX depicts SN-38 at every point of attachment of each polymer subunit, the CDP-SN-38 conjugate can have less than 2 SN-38 molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-SN-38 conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include two, one or no Sn-38 attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-SN-38 conjugates having two, one or no Sn-38 attached to each polymer subunit of the CDP-Sn-38 conjugate and the conjugates can also include a mixture of CDP-Sn-38 conjugates that can vary as to the number of Sn-38s attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \n \nIn vitro Evaluation of CDP-Gly-SN-38\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDP-Gly-SN-38 was evaluated in A2780 human ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe human ovarian carcinoma A2780 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a concentration of 5,000 cells per well and grown in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37° C. for 24 h in a humidified 5% CO\n2 \natmosphere. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the test compound at concentrations ranging from 0.01 nmol/L to 1 μmol/L. Triplicate wells per plate were treated at each concentration. Controls were vehicle-treated cells and medium only blank. Plates were incubated at 37° C. for 72 h. MTS assay reagent was prepared by diluting CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution (Promega) 5-fold into PBS/glucose (4.5 g/L). Cell culture medium was aspirated and 100 μL of MTS reagent were added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37° C. for 1 h. The plates were shaken for 5 min and the absorbance was measured at 485 nm using a SPECTRAFluor Plus plate reader (Tecan). The percentage of cell survival was calculated relative to untreated cells, and IC50s were estimated from the graphs of log dose (nmol/L) versus % cell survival (GraphPad Prizm).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of this experiment are shown in Table 9 below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 of SN-38 and CDP-Gly-SN-38 on A2780 ovarian cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSN-38\n\n\n2.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDP-PEG-Gly-SN-38\n\n\n7.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments are in the claims."

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/532,861, which is a United States national-stage application of PCT international application No. PCT/US2009/031819, filed Jan. 23, 2009, which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/023,617, filed Jan. 25, 2008. Each of the aforementioned applications is incorporated by reference in its entirety as though each were fully set forth herein.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to chemical compounds useful as inhibitors of the activity of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase IV (PDE4), synthetic methods for their manufacture, and methods for use of such compounds.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nTumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), also referred to as TNF, DIF, TNF-alpha, TNFA, and TNFSF2, is a cell-associated cytokine that is processed from a 26 kd precursor form to a 17 kd soluble form. TNF-α has been shown to be a primary mediator in humans and in animals of inflammation, fever, and acute phase responses, similar to those observed during acute infection and shock. Excess TNF-α has been shown to be lethal. There is now considerable evidence that blocking the effects of TNF-α by use of soluble TNF receptor or with specific neutralizing antibodies can be beneficial in a variety of circumstances including autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM or Type II diabetes), and Crohn's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor necrosis factor (TNF) was first found in the serum of mice and rabbits infected with \nBacillus \nCalmette-Guerin or injected with endotoxin, and was recognized on the basis of its cytotoxic, antitumor and metabolic properties. Many cell and tissues can produce TNF but its production is largely accomplished by macrophages and monocytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTNF can have a positive effect on the host organism by stimulating neutrophils and monocytes and by inhibiting the replication of viruses. Moreover, TNF-α activates the immune defenses against parasites and acts directly or indirectly as a mediator in immune reactions, inflammatory processes, and other processes in the body, although the mechanisms by which it works have not yet been clarified in a number of cases. The administration of TNF-α can also be accompanied by harmful phenomena such as shock and tissue damage, which can be remedied by means of antibodies against TNF-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTNF-α appears to be a mediator of cachexia which can occur in chronically invasive, for example, parasitic, diseases. TNF-α also appears to play a major part in the pathogenesis of shock caused by gram negative bacteria, for example, endotoxic shock; TNF-α would also appear to be implicated in some if not all the effects of lipopolysaccharides. TNF-α has also been postulated to have a function in the tissue damage which occurs in inflammatory processes in the joints and other tissues, and in the lethality and morbidity of the graft-versus host reaction (GVHR, Transplant Rejection). A correlation has also been reported between the concentration of TNF in the serum and the fatal outcome of meningococcal diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration of TNF-α over a lengthy period causes a state of anorexia and malnutrition which has symptoms similar to those of cachexia, which accompany neoplastic and chronic infectious diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA protein derived from the urine of fever patients has a TNF inhibiting activity; the effect of this protein is presumed to be due to a competitive mechanism at the level of the receptors (similar to the effect of the interleukin 1 inhibitor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-TNF-α antibodies (cA2) are effective in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which discovery led to an increased interest in finding novel TNF-α inhibitors as possible potent drugs for RA. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease characterized by irreversible pathological changes in the joints. In addition to RA, TNF-α antagonists may also be used in numerous pathological conditions and diseases. Some proofs indicating the biological importance of TNF-α were obtained by in vivo experiments in mice, in which mouse genes for TNF-α or its receptor were inactivated. Such animals are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis and to endotoxin-caused shock. In animal assays where the TNF-α level was increased, a chronic inflammatory polyarthritis occurred and its pathological picture was alleviated by inhibitors of TNF-α production. The treatment of such inflammatory and pathological conditions usually includes the application of non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and, in more severe cases, gold salts, D-pencillinamine or methotrexate are administered. These drugs act symptomatically, but they do not stop the pathological process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNovel approaches in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis are based upon drugs such as tenidap, leflunomide, cyclosporin, FK-506 and upon biomolecules neutralizing the TNF-α action. Commercially available therapies include etanercept (Enbrel®, Immunex), a fusion protein of the soluble TNF-α receptor, and infliximab (Remicade®, Centocor), a chimeric monoclonal human and mouse antibody. Additionally, etanercept and infliximab are also registered for the therapy of Crohn's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds which inhibit the production of TNF-α are believed useful in a wide variety of diseases and disorders through mechanism based therapeutic intervention. TNF-α inhibitors are believed useful for diseases including but not limited to viral, alcoholic, or drug-induced acute and fulminant hepatitis, hepatic steatosis, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, viral and non-viral hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, Wilson's disease, myasthenia gravis, idiopathic sprue, autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, endocrine ophthalmopathy, Grave's disease, sarcoidosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, pancreatitis, nephritis, endotoxin shock, septic shock, haemodynamic shock, sepsis syndrome, post ischemic reperfusion injury, malaria, mycobacterial infection, meningitis, psoriasis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), eosinophilia, congestive heart failure, fibrotic diseases, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, renal fibrosis, cachexia, graft rejection, rejection by transplantation, cancer, diseases involving angiogenesis, autoimmune diseases, ankylosing spondylitis, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, autoimmune hematological disorders, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, pure red cell anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polychondritis, scleroderma, Wegener granulomatosis, dermatomyositis, Reiter's syndrome, non infection uveitis, autoimmune keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, interstitial lung fibrosis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis and other benign or malignant proliferative skin diseases, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, neurodegenerative disorders, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, acute and chronic multiple sclerosis, cancer, viral infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cachexia, thrombosis, skin inflammatory diseases, osteoarthritis (OA), osteoporosis, RA, emphysema, chronic bronchiolitis, allergic rhinitis, radiation damage, hyperoxic alveolar injury, periodontal disease, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type II diabetes), and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Juvenile or Type I diabetes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhosphodiesterases (PDEs) comprise a superfamily of enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis and inactivation of the second messengers cyclic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Eleven different PDE families have been identified to date (PDE1 to PDE11) which differ in substrate preference, catalytic activity, sensitivity to endogenous activators and inhibitors, and encoding genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PDE4 isoenzyme family exhibits a high affinity for cyclic AMP but has weak affinity for cyclic GMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels caused by PDE4 inhibition are associated with the suppression of cell activation in a wide range of inflammatory and immune cells, including lymphocytes, macrophages, basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Moreover, PDE4 inhibition decreases the release of the cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of these physiological effects, PDE4 inhibitors of varied chemical structures have been recently disclosed for the treatment or prevention of chronic and acute inflammatory diseases and of other pathological conditions, diseases and disorders known to be susceptible to amelioration by inhibition of PDE4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPDE4 are thought to be useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of a variety of diseases/conditions, especially inflammatory and/or allergic diseases, in mammals such as humans, for example: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (e.g. chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema), atopic dermatitis, urticaria, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, eosinophilic granuloma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic shock, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, reperfusion injury of the myocardium and brain, chronic glomerulonephritis, endotoxic shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome, multiple sclerosis, cognitive impairment (e.g. in a neurological disorder such as Alzheimer's disease), depression, or pain. Ulcerative colitis and/or Crohn's disease are collectively often referred to as inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention includes a compound of Formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nor a salt thereof, wherein\n\n\n \nA\n1 \nis O or S;\n\n\nA\n2 \nis O or S;\n\n\n \n \n \nU is N or C—(CH\n2\n)\nu\nR\nU\n;\n\n\nV is N or C—(CH\n2\n)\nv\nR\nV\n;\n\n\nW is N or C—(CH\n2\n)\nw\nR\nW\n;\n\n\nX is N or C—(CH\n2\n)\nx\nR\nX\n;\n\n\nY is N or C—(CH\n2\n)\ny\nR\nY\n;\n\n\nZ is N or C—(CH\n2\n)\nz\nR\nZ\n;\n\n\nR\n1 \nis —(CH\n2\n)\nq\nR\nQ\n;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis —(CH\n2\n)\ns\nR\nS\n;\n\n\nwherein\n\n \n \n \n \n \neach of q, s, u, v, w, x, y, and z individually is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4;\n \neach of R\nQ\n, R\nS\n, R\nU\n, R\nV\n, R\nW\n, R\nX\n, R\nY\n, and R\nZ \nis independently selected from the group consisting of\n        \n \nalkyl;\n \nalkyl substituted with one or more R\nak\n;\n \nalkenyl;\n \nalkynyl;\n \naryl;\n \naryl substituted with one or more R\na\n;\n \nazido;\n \ncyano;\n \ncycloalkyl;\n \ncycloalkyl substituted with one or more R\nc\n;\n \nfused cycloalkylaryl substituted with one or more R\nf1\n;\n \nfused arylcycloalkyl substituted with one or more R\nf2\n;\n \nfused heterocyclyaryl substituted with one or more R\nf3\n;\n \nfused arylheterocyclyl substituted with one or more R\nf4\n;\n \nfused cycloalkylheteroaryl substituted with one or more R\nf5\n;\n \nfused heteroarylcycloalkyl substituted with one or more R\nf6\n;\n \nfused heterocyclylheteroaryl substituted with one or more R\nf7\n;\n \nfused heteroarylheterocyclyl substituted with one or more R\nf8\n;\n \nhalogen;\n \nhaloalkyl;\n \nheterocyclyl;\n \nheterocyclyl substituted with one or more R\nhc\n;\n \nheteroaryl;\n \nheteroaryl substituted with one or more R\nha\n;\n \nhydrogen;\n \n—NR\n3\nR\n4\n;\n \n—C(O)NR\n3\nR\n4\n;\n \n—C(O)R\n5\n;\n \n—C(O)\n2\nR\n6\n;\n \n—S(O)\nj\nR\n7\n;\n \n—OR\n8\n; and\n \nnitro;\n \nwherein\n            \n \neach of R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nis independently selected from the group consisting of H, acyl, alkyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, alkylsulfonyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl and heteroaryl;\n \nj is 0, 1, or 2;\n \neach R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, and R\n8 \nis independently selected from the group consisting of\n                \n \nhydrogen;\n \nalkyl;\n \nalkyl substituted with one or more R\nak\n;\n \nalkenyl;\n \nalkynyl;\n \nalkoxy;\n \naryl;\n \naryl substituted with one or more R\na\n;\n \ncycloalkyl;\n \ncycloalkyl substituted with one or more R\nc\n;\n \nhalogen;\n \nhaloalkyl;\n \nheterocyclyl;\n \nheterocyclyl substituted with one or more R\nhc\n;\n \nheteroaryl;\n \nheteroaryl substituted with one or more R\nha\n;\n \nwherein each R\na\n, R\nc\n, R\nf1\n, R\nf2\n, R\nf3\n, R\nf4\n, R\nf5\n, R\nf6\n, R\nf7\n, R\nhc \nand R\nha \nis independently selected from the group consisting of acyl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, amide, amino, aryl, cyano, cycloalkyl, halogen, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, heteroaryl, hydroxy, nitro, —C(O)OR\n9\n, —SO\n2\nR\n10\n, —SR\n11\n, —C(O)R\n12\n, —C(O)NR\n13\n, —NH—SO\n2\n—R\n14\n, —SO\n2\n—NR\n15\nR\n16\n, and —SO\n2\n—CH\n2\n—SO\n2\n—CH\n3\n; and wherein\n \n each R\n9\n, R\n10\n, R\n11\n, R\n12\n, R\n13\n, R\n14\n, R\n15\n, and R\n16 \nis independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, and heteroaryl,\n\n\nprovided that when R\n1 \nis hydrogen, R\nS \nis selected from the group consisting of\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nalkyl;\n \nalkyl substituted with one or more R\nak\n;\n \nalkenyl;\n \nalkynyl;\n \naryl;\n \naryl substituted with one or more R\na\n;\n \nazido;\n \ncyano;\n \ncycloalkyl;\n \ncycloalkyl substituted with one or more R\nc\n;\n \nfused cycloalkylaryl substituted with one or more R\nf1\n;\n \nfused arylcycloalkyl substituted with one or more R\nf2\n;\n \nfused heterocyclyaryl substituted with one or more R\nf3\n;\n \nfused arylheterocyclyl substituted with one or more R\nf4\n;\n \nfused cycloalkylheteroaryl substituted with one or more R\nf5\n;\n \nfused heteroarylcycloalkyl substituted with one or more R\nf6\n;\n \nfused heterocyclylheteroaryl substituted with one or more R\nf7\n;\n \nfused heteroarylheterocyclyl substituted with one or more R\nf8\n;\n \nheterocyclyl;\n \nheterocyclyl substituted with one or more R\nhc\n;\n \nheteroaryl;\n \nheteroaryl substituted with one or more R\nha\n;\n \n—NR\n3\nR\n4\n;\n \n—C(O)NR\n3\nR\n4\n;\n \n—C(O)R\n5\n;\n \n—C(O)\n2\nR\n6\n;\n \n—S(O)\nj\nR\n7\n;\n \n—OR\n8\n; and\n \nnitro.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formula (I) or a salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides methods for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formula (I) or a salt thereof.

Representative salts include acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, calcium edetate, camsylate, carbonate, clavulanate, citrate, dihydrochloride, edisylate, estolate, esylate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glutamate, glycollylarsanilate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroxynaphthoate, iodide, isethionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methylsulfate, monopotassium maleate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, N-methylglucamine, oxalate, pamoate (embonate), palmitate, pantothenate, phosphate/diphosphate, polygalacturonate, potassium, salicylate, sodium, stearate, subacetate, succinate, sulfate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate, triethiodide, trimethylammonium, and valerate salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase “effective amount” means that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal, or human that is being sought, for instance, by a researcher or clinician. The phrase “therapeutically effective amount” means any amount which, as compared to a corresponding subject who has not received such amount, results in improved treatment, healing, prevention, or amelioration of a disease, disorder, or side effect, or a decrease in the rate of advancement of a disease or disorder. The term also includes within its scope amounts effective to enhance normal physiological function. For use in therapy, therapeutically effective amounts of a compound of formulae of the present, as well as salts thereof, may be administered as the raw chemical. Additionally, the active ingredient may be presented as a pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention will depend upon a number of factors. For example, the species, age and weight of the recipient, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, the nature of the formulation and the route of administration are all factors to be considered. The therapeutically effective amount ultimately should be at the discretion of the attendant or veterinarian. Regardless, an effective amount of a compound of the present invention for the treatment of humans, generally, should be in the range of 0.01 to 100 mg/kg body weight of recipient (mammal) per day. More usually the effective amount should be in the range of 1 to 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Thus, for a 70 kg adult mammal the actual amount per day would usually be from 70 to 700 mg. This amount may be given in a single dose per day or in a number (such as two, three, four, five, or more) of sub-doses per day such that the total daily dose is the same. An effective amount of a salt may be determined as a proportion of the effective amount of the compound of the formulae of the present invention per se. Similar dosages should be appropriate for treatment of the other conditions referred to herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention demonstrate utility as inhibitors of TNF-α activity. In an embodiment, the invention provides a method for inhibiting TNF-α activity comprising contacting a cell in which inhibition of TNF-α is desired with a TNF-α inhibitor of the present invention. In an embodiment, the TNF-α inhibitor interacts with and reduces the activity of TNF-α in a cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, reference is made to one or more disorder, condition, or disease mediated by TNF-α or amplified by TNF-α and such shall include diseases associated with or implicating TNF-α activity, for example, the overactivity of TNF-α, and conditions that accompany with these diseases with reference to: 1) TNF-α expression in cells which normally do not express TNF-α; 2) TNF-α activity by cells which normally do not possess active TNF-α; 3) increased TNF-α expression leading to unwanted cell proliferation; or 4) mutations leading to constitutive activation of TNF-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions that include effective amounts of compounds of the formulae of the present invention and salts thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients. The compounds of the formulae of the present invention, including salts thereof, are as herein described. The carrier(s), diluent(s), or excipient(s) must be acceptable, in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient of the pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with another aspect of the invention there is also provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation including admixing a compound of the formulae of the present invention, including a salt thereof, with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations may be presented in unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Such a unit may contain, as a non-limiting example, 0.5 mg to 1 g of a compound of the present invention, depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration, and the age, weight, and condition of the patient. Typical unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. Such pharmaceutical formulations may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmacy art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example by an oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual or transdermal), vaginal, or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intradermal) route. Such formulations may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier(s) or excipient(s). By way of example, and not meant to limit the invention, with regard to certain conditions and disorders for which the compounds of the present invention are believed useful, certain routes will be preferable to others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions, each with aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil liquid emulsions. For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Generally, powders are prepared by comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing with an appropriate pharmaceutical carrier such as an edible carbohydrate, as, for example, starch or mannitol. Flavorings, preservatives, dispersing agents, and coloring agents can also be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCapsules are made by preparing a powder, liquid, or suspension mixture and encapsulating with gelatin or some other appropriate shell material. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, or solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the mixture before the encapsulation. A disintegrating or solubilizing agent such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate or sodium carbonate can also be added to improve the availability of the medicament when the capsule is ingested. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Examples of suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth, or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLubricants useful in these dosage forms include, for example, sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant, and pressing into tablets. A powder mixture may be prepared by mixing the compound, suitably comminuted, with a diluent or base as described above. Optional ingredients include binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatins, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, solution retardants such as paraffin, resorption accelerators such as a quaternary salt, and/or absorption agents such as bentonite, kaolin, or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be wet-granulated with a binder such as syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials, and forcing through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be run through the tablet machine and the result is imperfectly formed slugs broken into granules. The granules can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet-forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The compounds of the present invention can also be combined with a free flowing inert carrier and compressed into tablets directly without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A clear or opaque protective coating consisting of a sealing coat of shellac, a coating of sugar or polymeric material, and a polish coating of wax can be provided. Dyestuffs can be added to these coatings to distinguish different unit dosages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere appropriate, dosage unit formulations for oral administration can be microencapsulated. The formulation can also be prepared to prolong or sustain the release as for example by coating or embedding particulate material in polymers, wax or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOral fluids such as solutions, syrups, and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of the compound. Syrups can be prepared, for example, by dissolving the compound in a suitably flavored aqueous solution, while elixirs are prepared through the use of a non-toxic alcoholic vehicle. Suspensions can be formulated generally by dispersing the compound in a nontoxic vehicle. Solubilizers and emulsifiers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxy ethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives; flavor additives such as peppermint oil, or natural sweeteners, saccharin, or other artificial sweeteners; and the like can also be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable packaging for the pharmaceutical solution formulations may be all approved containers intended for parenteral use, such as plastic and glass containers, ready-to-use syringes and the like. In an embodiment, the container is a sealed glass container, such as a vial or an ampoule. A hermetically sealed glass vial is one example of a sealed glass container. According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided, in a sealed glass container, a sterile, injectable solution comprising a compound of the present invention in a physiologically acceptable solvent, and which has an appropriate pH for stability. Acid salts of the compounds of the present invention may be more soluble in aqueous solutions than their free base counter parts, but when the acid salts are added to aqueous solutions the pH of the solution may be too low to be suitable for administration. Thus, solution formulations having a pH above pH 4.5 may be combined prior to administration with a diluent solution of pH greater than 7 such that the pH of the combination formulation administered is pH 4.5 or higher. In one embodiment, the diluent solution comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable base such as sodium hydroxide and the pH of the combined formulation administered is between pH 5.0 and 7.0. One or more additional components such as co-solubilizing agents, tonicity adjustment agents, stabilizing agents and preservatives, for instance of the kind previously specified, may be added to the solution prior to passing the solution through the sterilizing filter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration may be formulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols, or oils.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor treatments of the eye or other external tissues, for example mouth and skin, the formulations may be applied as a topical ointment or cream. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredient may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in-oil base. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administrations to the eye include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges, pastilles, and mouthwashes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for nasal administration, where the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns. The powder is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oil solutions of the active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for administration by inhalation include fine particle dusts or mists, which may be generated by means of various types of metered dose pressurized aerosols, nebulizers, or insufflators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the compositions of the present invention may also be in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the compounds of the invention. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will thus melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols, for example. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for rectal administration may be presented as suppositories or as enemas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExtemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question. For example, formulations suitable for oral administration may include flavoring or coloring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment to this aspect and described hereinbelow in further detail, the invention encompasses a combination therapy for treating or preventing a disorder mediated by TNF-α in a subject. The combination therapy comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of the present invention and one or more other therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, gene therapy, and immunotherapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the compound of the present invention may be administered in combination with other therapeutic compounds.

Additionally, yet to emerge agents are contemplated as being useful in combination with the compound of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, the compounds of the present invention may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, including other compounds of the present invention. Such a combination of pharmaceutically active agents may be administered together or separately and, when administered separately, administration may occur simultaneously or sequentially, in any order. The amounts of the compounds or agents and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. The administration in combination of a compound of the formulae of the present invention including salts thereof with other treatment agents may be in combination by administration concomitantly in: (1) a unitary pharmaceutical composition including both compounds; or (2) separate pharmaceutical compositions each including one of the compounds. Alternatively, the combination may be administered separately in a sequential manner wherein one treatment agent is administered first and the other second or vice versa. Such sequential administration may be close in time or remote in time. The compounds of the present invention may be used in the treatment of a variety of disorders and conditions and, as such, the compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with a variety of other suitable therapeutic agents useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of those disorders or conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention may be made by a variety of methods, including well-known standard synthetic methods. An illustrative general synthetic method is set out in the following reaction Scheme (in which variables are as defined before or are defined) using readily available starting materials, and reagents. In these reactions, it is also possible to make use of variants which are themselves known to those of ordinary skill in this art, but are not mentioned in greater detail. Specific compounds of the invention are prepared in the working Examples.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn all of the examples described below, protecting groups for sensitive or reactive groups are employed where necessary in accordance with general principles of synthetic chemistry. Protecting groups may be manipulated according to standard methods of organic synthesis. These groups may be removed at a convenient stage of the compound synthesis using methods that are readily apparent to those skilled in the art. The selection of processes as well as the reaction conditions and order of their execution shall be consistent with the preparation of compounds of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art will recognize if a stereocenter exists. As noted hereinabove, the present invention includes all possible stereoisomers and includes not only racemic compounds but the individual enantiomers as well. When a compound is desired as a single enantiomer, such may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis, by resolution of the final product or any convenient intermediate, or by chiral chromatographic methods as are known in the art. Resolution of the final product, an intermediate, or a starting material may be affected by any suitable method known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method for the synthesis of compounds useful as intermediates in the preparation of compounds of the present invention along with methods for their preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds can be prepared according to the following General procedures. In these reactions, variants may be employed which are themselves known to those of ordinary skill in this art, but are not mentioned in greater detail. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the format and designation of variable substituent groups in the following procedures may be different from that used in the Formulae of the present invention.\n\n\n \nDescription of General Synthetic Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nGeneral procedure A: Preparation of 4-chloro-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester analogues\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo a substituted aniline (5 mmol) in chlorobenzene (15 mL) is added diethyl ethoxymethylene-malonate (5 mmol) and stirred at 140° C. for 12-16 h.

The samples are serially diluted with PBS+1% BSA to find the proper dilution condition for the cell prep.\n\n\n \nPDE4 Inhibition Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nA TR-FRET-based phosphodiesterase assay kit from “Molecular Devices” was used to test whether these compounds were indeed direct inhibitors of the PDE4 enzyme. Using Roflumilast as a positive control, compounds of the present invention were tested against fluorescein-labeled cAMP substrate. The principle of the assay is based on the binding of a nucleotide monophosphate generated upon cAMP conversion to 5′ AMP by PDE to an “IMAP binding reagent”, which in turn is also ligated to a separate complex carrying terbium (Tb)-donor molecule. Proximity of the fluoreceinated 5′AMP to the Tb donor generates Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer. A PDE inhibitor will reduce the conversion of cAMP to 5′AMP, thus reducing monophosphate that can bind to the IMAP binding reagent and reduce the resulting FRET signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following procedures were taken to obtain the experimental data described below:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay buffer was prepared by diluting 5× supplied Tween-based buffer in 1:5 in water to make 1× buffer. Add desired additive to buffer (DTT or MnCl\n2\n). In a separate 96-well polypropylene plate, compound dilutions were prepared in assay buffer. Separate microcentrifuge tubes were prepared of PDE4B and PDE4D according to assay template—in assay buffer. The tubes were kept on ice. The enzyme concentration shown on the template were diluted by 1:4. FAM-cAMP substrate solution was prepared according to assay template. 5 μl compound was transferred from polypropylene plate into black 384-well plate. This plate was centrifuged briefly to make sure all 5 μl is on the bottom. Up to 80 μl of prepared PDE4B enzyme solution was transferred into alternate wells on row ‘N’ of 384-well plate starting from cell N1. Up to 80 μl of prepared PDE4D enzyme solution was transferred into alternate wells on row ‘O’ of 384-well plate, starting from cell O2. cAMP substrate solution was transferred into bottom row of separate 96-well plate. 5 μl of enzyme solution from the “reservoir” row (N or O) was transferred to each of the wells containing compounds, per layout map. Next, 10 μl of cAMP substrate was transferred to these wells. The order of substrate-first or enzyme-first can be switched depending on what is optimal. The final cAMP concentration was 100 nM in the reaction. 20 μl of assay buffer was pipetted into 4 separate wells—these are the blanks. The plate was sealed with an aluminum strip and incubated at 30° C. for 90 minutes. A TR-FRET solution was prepared. 4 ml of 1× IMAP Buffer A was added to 6 ml of IMAP Buffer B. 25 μl (1/800 of 20 ml) of binding beads was added to this and mix by inverting. 60 μl of this mixture was pipetted into 2 of the wells containing the “blank” assay buffer. Next, 49.7 μl (1/400 of remaining volume) of Tb donor solution was added to the remaining TR-FRET solution and mixed by inverting. 60 μl of this solution was pipetted into remaining 2 “blank” assay buffer-containing wells. The TR-FRET solution was poured into a pipette boat and a multichannel pipette was used to drop 60 μl of solution into all assay wells. The wells were covered with a foil strip and incubated for at least 3 hours or overnight protected from light (e.g. in a drawer) at room temperature.

Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to dual-targeting cytotoxic derivatives and their preparation. The described compounds are endowed with tumour specific action, incorporating three functional units: a tumour recognition moiety and a tumour selective enzymatic substrate sequence. These conjugates are designed to guarantee serum stability and, at the same time, the desired action inside the tumour cells as a result of enzymatic cleavability.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nTraditional cancer chemotherapy is based on the assumption that rapidly proliferating cancer cells are more likely killed than quiescent cells of physiological tissues. Actually, cytotoxic agents have very poor specificity, causing severe undesirable effects. In the last three decades, various systems have been explored to selectively deliver drugs at their site of action. Recent improvements in the knowledge of typical receptors over expressed by cancer cells during their proliferation allow the exploitation of selective ligands, which, conjugated with cytotoxic agents, are able to preferentially address them to the tumours. Unlike the common pro-drugs, the linker between the ligand and the drug must be stable in the circulation and, following internalization of the whole conjugate into the cancer cell, should be readily cleaved, by chemical or enzymatic mechanism, to regenerate the cytotoxic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent advances in tumour-targeting drug conjugates entail monoclonal antibodies, polyunsaturated fatty acids, hyaluronic acid and oligopeptides as ligands of tumour-associated receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present, several immunoconjugates are in clinical trials: Maytansin (Liu C., et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci., \n1996, 93, 8618), doxorubicin (Saleh M. N., et al., \nJ. Clin. Oncol., \n2000, 18, 11, 2282), herceptin (Baselga J., et al., \nJ. Clin. Oncol., \n1996, 14, 737), calicheamicin (Bross P. F., et al., \nClin. Cancer Res., \n2001, 7, 1490; Chan S. Y., et al., \nCancer Immunol. Immunother., \n2003, 52, 243). Regarding the latter, Mylotarg, a CD33 antibody-linked calicheamicin, was approved by FDA in 2000 for the treatment of acute leukaemia (Hammann P. R., et al., \nBioconjugate Chem., \n2002, 13, 1, 47).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe practical use of immunoconjugates is only suitable for highly potent drugs, because a limited amount of antigens are over expressed on tumour cell surface and only a limited number of molecules can be loaded on each mAb without decreasing the binding affinity and increasing the immunogenicity. Recently, a number of conjugates of cytotoxic agents with oligopeptides addressed to different receptors over expressed by tumoural cells have been studied as potential selective antitumoural chemotherapeutics. Among oligopeptides, the most promising seem to be somatostatin (Pollak M. N., et al., \nProc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., \n1998, 217, 143; Fuselier J. A., et al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., \n2003, 13, 799), bombesin (Moody T. W., et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n2004, 279, 23580), integrins-mediated RGD peptides (WO200117563, Ruoslahti E., \nNature reviews Cancer, \n2002, 2, 83; Dickerson E. B., et al., \nMol. Cancer. Res., \n2004, 2, 12, 663; de Groot F. M., et al., \nMol. Cancer. Ther., \n2002, 1, 901; Chen X., et al., \nJ. Med. Chem., \n2005, 48, 1098). Generally experimented chemical linkers between the tumour-recognition moiety and the anticancer drug involves hydrazones, disulfides and peptides substrates of lysosomial enzymes. The nature of the linker is the prerequisite to determine the fate of the conjugate in vivo, its stability, solubility and bioavailability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tumour-targeting conjugates of the present invention are made of three functional units (a tumour recognition moiety and an anticancer drug) connected together by means of a spacer (linker).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO05111064, in the name of the Applicant, describes cyclopeptides presenting the RGD unit, endowed with anti-integrin activity. WO05111063, in the name of the Applicant, reports 7-imino camptothecin derivatives conjugated to integrin-recognizing cyclic peptides via a spacer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO05110487, in the name of the Applicant, reports camptothecin derivatives conjugated in \nposition\n 20 to integrin antagonist.\n\n\n \nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe object of the present invention is the development of tumour-targeting conjugates containing an integrin α\nv \nβ\n3 \nand α\nv \nβ\n5 \nrecognition moiety connected to a cytotoxic drug by new molecular bridges containing three units. The latter are made of a spacer, a peptide cleavable by tumour-associated enzymes and a self-immolative functional unit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selected spacers are made of small flexible glycols alternate with hydrophilic amino acids or heterocyclic structures functioning as rigid moieties, that confer solubility to the whole conjugate, without interfering with the binding to the receptor. These particular spacers are superior to the widely used high molecular weight glycols, which possess great solubilizing properties, but are not advisable for their tendency to form loops that disturb the binding area.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of linker-containing peptides as substrates of Cathepsin B have already been described, for example, Phe-Lys, Val-Cit (Dubowchick G. M., et al, \nBioconjugate Chem., \n2002, 13, 4, 855); Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly (Rejmanova P., et al, \nBiomaterials, \n1985, 6, 1, 45); D-Ala-Phe-Lys (de Groot F. M. H., et al., \nMol. Cancer. Ther., \n2002, 1, 901). Some of these peptides have been successfully applied when attached to antibodies, which, due to their bulkiness, can shield them from plasma peptidases. However, when we experimented these peptide sequences applied to conjugates containing small ligands, as in the case of oligopeptides, they were immediately cleaved releasing the cytotoxic agent into the circulation, contrary to what described by other authors. In particular, the Phe-Lys linker containing peptide (ST3280) resulted highly unstable in various assays conducted. The above cited paper from Dubowchick deals with cathepsin B-labile dipeptide ligands. The same authors also published four years before another study about the influence of the amino acid at position P\n2 \nwhen Cit amino acid was at P\n1 \nposition, concluding that the best amino acid in such a position was Val because of hydrophobic interactions within the binding site of cathepsin B (Dubowchick G. M., et al, \nBioorg. Med. Chem., \n1998, 8, 3341), meanwhile the analogue containing Ala instead of Val contributed to slower noticeably the release of doxorubicin, which was clearly contrary to the objective of the study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly, it has now been found that Ala-Cit or D-Ala-Cit, which, unexpectedly, showed to be stable in the murine blood and cleavable inside the tumour cell are particularly well suited as a mean for allowing the release of the cytotoxic motif at the site of action.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe presence of a self-immolative group is also compulsory for exalting the endopeptidases action (Carl P. L., et al \nJ. Med. Chem., \n1981, 24, 5, 479; Shamis M. L., et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc., \n2004, 126, 6, 1726). These new linkers better guarantee the required pharmacological properties of the relative conjugates, such as metabolic stability and further release of the cytotoxic agent after internalization within the cell, together with an optimal solubility and bioavailability. Furthermore, they have been designed in order to have size and conformation compatible with the binding of the targeting device to the receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe new linkers are versatile molecular bridges that can be applied to a variety of ligands as well as to different antitumoural drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention comprises compounds of general formula I\n\n\n \n \n \n[(L-D)\nn\nE]\nm\n-F-D-PI-SI-CT  Formula I\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein,\n\n\nL is a recognizing α-integrin receptor cyclic peptide of formula II\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc\n(R\n1\n-Arg-Gly-Asp-R\n2\n)  Formula II\n\n\n\n \nR\n1 \nis Amp, Lys or Aad;\n\n\n \n \n \nR\n2 \nis Phe, Tyr or Amp with the R-configuration;\n\n\nD at each occurrence can be the same or different, is absent or is a divalent group of formula III\n\n\n\n \n \n \n-SP\n1\n-A\n1\n-SP\n2\n-A\n2\n-SP\n3\n-  Formula III\n\n\n\n \n \nSP\n1 \nis absent or is R\n3\n—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—(OCH\n2\n—CH\n2\n)\nq\n—O—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—R\n4\n;\n\n\nR\n3 \nand R\n4\n, the same or different, are absent, or —CO—, —COO—, —NH—, —O—, or a divalent radical of formula IV, formula VIII or formula IX\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nq at each occurrence can be the same or different and are independently an integer comprised between 0-6;\n\n\nA\n1 \nis absent or a natural or unnatural, (L) or (D)-amino acid bearing a hydrophilic side chain;\n\n\nSP\n2 \nis absent or the same as SP\n1\n;\n\n\nA\n2 \nis absent or the same as A\n1\n;\n\n\nSP\n3 \nis absent or the same as SP\n1\n;\n\n\nm=1 or 2;\n\n\nn=1 or 2;\n\n\nE at each occurrence can be the same or different and is Glu, Lys or is absent;\n\n\nF is the same as E or is absent or is a histidine analogue of formula X;\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein the triazole ring is linked to the D-PI-SI-CT moiety, the carbonyl moiety is linked to the L-containing moiety and SP\n1 \nis as defined above; PI is a natural or unnatural oligopeptide, made of (L) or (D) amino acids selected between Ala and Cit;\n\n\nSI is the divalent radical p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl;\n\n\nCT represents a cytotoxic radical;\n\n\ntheir tautomers, their geometrical isomers, their optically active forms such as enantiomers, diastereomers and their racemate forms, as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof;\n\n\nwith the following proviso:\n\n\nat least one D should be present;\n\n\nand when E is present, it is linked to the portion bearing the L group through its amino moieties when E is Lys, or through its carboxyl moieties when E is Glu.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn embodiment of this invention is that of compounds of formula I, wherein CT represents a camptothecin derivative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of this invention is that of compounds of formula I, wherein CT represents a camptothecin derivative, R\n1 \nis Amp and R\n2 \nis Phe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further embodiment of this invention is that of compounds of formula I, wherein PI represents an oligopeptide comprising two or three amino acids residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn even further embodiment of this invention is that of compounds of formula I, wherein m=1 and n=1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother preferred embodiment of this invention is that of compounds of formula I, wherein m=1 and n=2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula I, can be obtained using standard coupling method well known to those skilled in the art.

Such carriers include antibodies and other polypeptides, genes and other therapeutic agents such as liposomes, provided that the carrier does not itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition, and which may be administered without undue toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable carriers may be large, slowly metabolised macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers and inactive virus particles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers is available in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Pub. Co., N.J. 1991). Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers in therapeutic compositions may additionally contain liquids such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, and the like, may be present in such compositions. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical compositions to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, and the like, for ingestion by the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce formulated, the compositions of the invention can be administered directly to the subject. The subjects to be treated can be animals; in particular, human subjects can be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe medicament of this invention may be administered by any number of routes including, but not limited to, oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-arterial, intramedullary, intrathecal, intraventricular, transdermal or transcutaneous applications, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, enteral, topical, sublingual, intravaginal, rectal means or locally on the diseased tissue after surgical operation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule. A further object of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition containing at least one formula (I) compound as an active ingredient, in an amount such as to produce a significant therapeutic effect.

To measure the effects of the compounds on cell growth, PC3 human prostate carcinoma and A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells were used. A2780 and PC3 tumour cells were grown RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumour cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at approximately 10% confluence and were allowed to attach and recover for at least 24 h. Varying concentrations of the drugs were then added to each well to calculate their IC\n50 \nvalue (the concentration which inhibits the 50% of cell survival). The plates were incubated at 37° C. for 72 h. At the end of the treatment, the plates were washed by removal of the supernatant and addition of \nPBS\n 3 times. 200 μl PBS and 50 μl of cold 80% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) were added. The plates were incubated on ice for at least 1 h. TCA was removed and the plates were washed 3 times by immersion in distilled-water and dried on paper and at 40° C. for 5 min. Then 200 μl of 0.4% sulphorodamine B in 1% acetic acid were added. The plates were incubated at RT for further 30 min. Sulphorodamine B was removed, the plates were washed by immersion in 1% \nacetic acid\n 3 times, then they were dried on paper and at 40° C. for 5 min. Then 200 \nμl Tris\n 10 mM were added, the plates were kept under stirring for 20 min. The cell survival was determined by means of optical density using a Multiskan spectrofluorimeter at 540 nm. The amount of cells killed was calculated as the percentage decrease in sulphorodamine B binding compared with control cultures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IC\n50 \nvalues were calculated with the “ALLFIT” program.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antiproliferative activity of the three conjugates was compared on two human tumour cell lines (A2780 ovarian tumour cells with high levels of integrin and PC3 prostate tumour cells with low levels of integrin). The molecules showed a marked cytotoxic potency on tumour cells with IC\n50 \nvalues 8 nM as shown in table 4. All the conjugates revealed a minor effect on PC3 tumour cells with low levels of integrin (IC\n50 \nvalues ranged from 1 to 4.6 μM). In particular, three compounds presented a rather specific antiproliferative effect on A2780 tumour cells with respect to that observed on PC3 tumour cells (table 4) with a potency roughly hundred fold greater on the former.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCytotoxicity of the conjugates on A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells and PC3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprostate carcinoma cells (72 h of treatment)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPC3\n\n\nA2780\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nIC50 ± SD, μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nST3280\n\n\n 0.2 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.0084 ± 0.0006\n\n\n\n\n\n\nST3833\n\n\n4.6 ± 0.8\n\n\n0.095 ± 0.02 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nST4167\n\n\n1.0 ± 0.1\n\n\n0.030 ± 0.003\n\n\n\n\n\n\nST4215\n\n\n2.5 ± 0.7\n\n\n 0.009 ± 0.0007\n\n\n\n\n\n\nST5744TF1\n\n\n 1.0 ± 0.02\n\n\n 0.008 ± 0.0005\n\n\n\n\n\n\nST5745TF1\n\n\n 1.0 ± 0.01\n\n\n 0.008 ± 0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Evaluation of Antitumour Activity of the Conjugate ST3833 on Tumour Growth of Ovarian Carcinoma Xenografted in CD1 Nude Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nTumour cell lines (3×10\n6\n) were injected s.c. into the right flank of CD1 nude mice (Harlan). Each experimental group included 10 mice. Tumours were implanted on \nday\n 0, and tumour growth was followed by biweekly measurements of tumour diameters with a Vernier caliper. Tumour volume was calculated according to the formula: TV (mm\n3\n)=d\n2\n×D/2, where d and D are the shortest diameter and the longest diameter respectively. Drug treatment started when tumours were just measurable on \nday\n 3 after tumour inoculation. The drug was administered subcutaneously for two weeks according to the schedule qd×5/w×2w at different doses in a volume of 10 ml/kg. Control mice were treated with the vehicle (10% DMSO).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrug efficacy was assessed as described below.\n\n \n \n \n \n \na) TVI in drug-treated versus control mice was expressed as follows: TVI (%)=100−(mean TV treated/mean TV control)×100. TVI was evaluated 6 days after the last treatment, this timing corresponding to the time necessary to observe a doubling of tumour volume in the control mice.\n \nb) Log cell kill (LCK) was calculated using the following formula: LCK=(T−C)/3.32×DT where T and C are the mean time (in days) required for treated (T) and control (C) tumours, respectively to reach a determined volume, and DT is the time necessary to observe a doubling of tumour volume in the control mice.\n \nc) CR was defined as disappearance of the tumour lasting at least 6 days after the end of treatments. Tumours that had not regrown by the end of the experiment were considered “cured”.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nToxic effects of drug treatment were assessed as described below.\n\n \n \n \n \n \na) BWL was calculated as follows: BWL (%)=100−(mean body weight day x/mean body weight day 1)×100, where \nday\n 1 is the first day of treatment, and day x is any day thereafter. The highest (maximum) BWL is reported in the table. Mice were weighed every day throughout the period of treatment.\n \nb) Lethal toxicity was defined as any death in treated groups occurring before any control death. Mice were inspected daily for mortality.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nTI (therapeutic index) was calculated as ratio MTD/ED80.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antitumour activity of ST3833 was investigated against the tumour most responsive in vitro xenografted in CD1 nude mice. The molecule showed an approximate maximum tolerate dose (MTD) of 25 mg/kg delivered s.c. according to the schedule qd×5/w×2w since BWL was 25% and 1 out 10 mice died. ST3833 revealed a potent antitumour effect since it produced a complete regression of all tumours (cured mice at day 90 were 100% at the MTD) (table 5). At ⅓ MTD (8.3 mg/kg) 50% cured mice were observed. At lower doses (2.77 and 0.92 mg/kg), cured mice were 30%. The persistence of effect after the last treatment and the good tolerability of the conjugate showed a high therapeutic index (TI=8.9), suggesting a high therapeutic potential for the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntitumour activity of ST3833 delivered subcutanously (qdx5/wx2w)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nagainst A2780 ovarian ca. xenografted in CD1 nude mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \na\nDose\n\n\n \n\n\n \nc\nLethal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nmg/10 ml/kg\n\n\n \nb\nBWL %\n\n\ntoxicity\n\n\n \nd\nTVI %\n\n\n \ne\nCR\n\n\n \nf\nCured\n\n\n \ng\nLCK\n\n\n \nh\nTI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nST3833\n\n\n25\n\n\n24\n\n\n1/10\n\n\n100\n\n\n9/9 \n\n\n9/9 \n\n\n>11.4\n\n\n8.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8.3\n\n\n0\n\n\n0/10\n\n\n100\n\n\n5/10\n\n\n4/10\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2.77\n\n\n0\n\n\n0/10\n\n\n75\n\n\n3/10\n\n\n3/10\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.92\n\n\n0\n\n\n0/10\n\n\n60\n\n\n3/10\n\n\n3/10\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nSubcutanous dose used in each administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\nMaximum BWL percentage due to the drug treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nc\nDead/treated animals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nd\nTVI percentage versus control mice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ne\nCR: disappearance of tumour for at least 10 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nf\nCured: mice without lesion 90 days after tumour injection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ng\nLCK, see Methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nh\nTI: therapeutic index (MTD/ED80).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Evaluation of Antimetastatic Activity of the Conjugate ST3833 on Bone Metastases Induced by Intracardiac Injection of PC3 Human Prostate Carcinoma\n\n\n \n \n \nMale CD1 nude mice were anesthetized by 4 ml/kg of a mixture (xylazine:ketavet 100) given i.p.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/127,098, filed May 9, 2008.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides certain NMDA receptor blockers, including pH-sensitive NMDA receptor blockers, in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety and other related diseases.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nGlutamate and aspartate play dual roles in the central nervous system as essential amino acids and as the principal excitatory neurotransmitters (hereinafter referred to as excitatory amino acids or EAAs). There are at least four classes of EAA receptors: NMDA, AMPA (2-amino-3-(methyl-3-hydroxyisoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid), kainate and metabotropic receptors. These EAA receptors mediate a wide range of signaling events that impact all physiological brain functions. For example, it has been reported that NMDA receptor antagonists produce an analgesic effect under certain conditions (Wong, et al. (1995) \nActa Anaesthesiologica. Sinica \n33, 227-232).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe NMDA subtype of glutamate-gated ion channels mediates excitatory synaptic transmission between neurons in the central nervous system (Dingledine et al. (1999), \nPharmacological Reviews \n51:7-61). NMDA receptors participate in a wide range of both physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system. A high density of NMDA receptors has been found in the cortico-limbic regions of the brain which have been postulated to play a role in emotional functions, anxiety and depression (Tzschentke™ (2002) \nAmino Acids \n23:147-152). Extensive studies have demonstrated antidepressant-like effects of various antagonists of the NMDA receptors. The antidepressant-like activity of competitive and non-competitive antagonists and inorganic inhibitors of NMDA receptor (zinc and magnesium) has been reported (see Decollogne, et al. (1997) \nPharmacol Biochem Behav \n58:261-268; Kroczka, et al. (2001) \nBrain Res Bull \n55:297-300; Kroczka, et al. (2000) \nPol J. Pharmacol. \n52:403-406; Poleszak, et al. (2004) \nPharmacol Biochem Behav \n78:7-12; Poleszak, et al. (2007) \nPharmacol Biochem Behav \n88:158-164; Poleszak, et al. (2007) \nPharmacol Rep \n57:654-658; Przegaliñski, et al. (1997) \nNeuropharmacology \n36:31-37; Przegaliñski, et al. (1998) \nPol J Pharmacol \n50: 349-354; Skolnick P \nEur J Pharmacol \n375:31-40; Skolnick, et al. (2001) \nPharmacol Res \n43:411-423; and Trullas, et al. (1990) \nEur Pharmacol \n185:1-10). Poleszak, et al. showed that the NMDA receptor binding of certain antagonists, specifically CGP 37849 and L-701,324, are directly related to their antidepressant-like effects (Poleszak, et al. (2007) \nPharm. Reports \n59:595-600).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNMDA receptors are composed of NR1, NR2 (A, B, C, and D), and NR3 (A and B) subunits, which determine the functional properties of native NMDA receptors. Expression of the NR1 subunit alone does not produce a functional receptor. Co-expression of one or more NR2 subunits is required to form functional channels. In addition to glutamate, the NMDA receptor requires the binding of a co-agonist, glycine, to allow the receptor to function. A glycine binding site is found on the NR1 and NR3 subunits, whereas the glutamate binding site is found on NR2 subunits. At resting membrane potentials, NMDA receptors are largely inactive due to a voltage-dependent block of the channel pore by magnesium ions. Depolarization releases this channel block and permits passage of calcium as well as other ions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe NMDA receptor is modulated by a number of endogenous and exogenous compounds including, sodium, potassium and calcium ions that can not only pass through the NMDA receptor channel but also modulate the activity of receptors. Zinc blocks the channel through NR2A- and NR2B-containing receptors noncompetitive and voltage-independent manner. Polyamines can also either potentiate or inhibit glutamate-mediated responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and mood disorders affect more than 60 million Americans each year. Four basic forms of mood disorders are major depression, cyclothymia (a mild form of bipolar disorder), SAD (seasonal affective disorder) and mania (euphoric, hyperactive, over inflated ego, unrealistic optimism.) About 20% of the U.S. population reports at least one depressive symptom in a given month, and 12% report two or more in a year. A survey conducted in 1992 found rates of major depression reaching 5% in the previous 30 days, 17% for a lifetime. Bipolar disorder is less common, occurring at a rate of 1% in the general population, but some believe the diagnosis is often overlooked because manic elation is too rarely reported as an illness.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepression, formally called major depression, major depressive disorder or clinical depression, is a medical illness that involves the mind and body. Most health professionals today consider depression a chronic illness that requires long-term treatment, much like diabetes or high blood pressure. Although some people experience only one episode of depression, most have repeated episodes of depression symptoms throughout their life. Depression is also a common feature of mental illness, whatever its nature and origin. A person with a history of any serious psychiatric disorder has almost as high a chance of developing major depression as someone who has had major depression itself in the past. Most people with major depression also show some signs of anxiety, and 15-30% have panic attacks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepression is associated with physical illness as well. Some 25% of hospitalized medical patients have noticeable depressive symptoms and about 5% are suffering from major depression. Chronic medical conditions associated with depression include heart disease, cancer, vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, hepatitis, and malaria. Depression also is a common effect of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, multiple sclerosis, strokes, and brain tumors. Even moderate depressive symptoms are associated with a higher than average rate of arteriosclerosis, heart attacks, and high blood pressure. Depression can mimic medical illness and any illness feels worse to someone suffering from depression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt's not known specifically what causes depression. As with many mental illnesses, it's thought that a variety of biochemical, genetic and environmental factors may cause depression. Despite the many advances that occurred from a better understanding of neuropharmacology, many psychiatric diseases remain untreated or inadequately treated with current pharmaceutical agents. In addition, many of the current agents interact with a number of cellular targets, potentially resulting in side effects that can greatly influence the overall outcome of therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous treatments for depression are available, including dozens of medications. Typical protocols include a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro). Other common first choices for antidepressants include serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), combined reuptake inhibitors and receptor blockers, and tetracyclic antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are also effective, but because TCAs tend to have more numerous and more severe side effects, they are often less prescribed. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are often prescribed as a last resort, when other medications haven't worked.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFunctional antagonists of the NMDA receptor complex exhibit antidepressant-like activity in the rodent test and models of depression. In 1990, Trullas and Skolnick demonstrated the antidepressant activity of AP-7, MK-801 and ACPC in the mouse forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) (Trullas R, Skolnick P (1990) \nEur J Pharmacol \n185:1-10). Since then, a number of reports have confirmed and extended this finding. The NMDA antagonists are active in the FST in mice (Layer™, et al. (1995) \nPharmacol Biochem Behav \n52:621-627; Maj et al. (1992) \nPol J Pharmacol \n44:337-346) and rats (Moryl, et al. (1993) \nPharmacol Toxicol \n72:394-397; Przegaliñski, et al (1997) \nNeuropharmacology \n36:31-37) and tail suspension test in mice (Layer, et al. (1995) \nPharmacol Biochem Behav \n52:621-627), and in learned helplessness (Meloni, et al. (1993) \nPharmacol Biochem Behav \n46:423-426), chronic unpredicted stress (Ossowska, et al. (1997) \nJ Physiol Pharmacol \n48:127-135), chronic mild stress (Papp, et al. \nEur J Pharmacol \n263:1-7), and bulbectomy models (Redmond, et al. (1997) \nPharmacol Biochem Behav \n58:355-359). NMDA antagonists also demonstrate efficacy in clinical studies. Ketamine appears effective in major depression (Berman, et al. (2000) \nBiol Psychiatry \n47:351-354; Zarate, et al. (2006) \nArch Gen Psychiatry \n63:856-864), although the clinical efficacy of memantine is not as clear (Ferguson, et al. (2007) \nClin Neuropharmacol \n30:136-144; Zarate, et al. (2006) \nAm J Psychiatry \n163:153-155). Furthermore, the palliative effect of non-specific NMDA antagonist (amantadine and zinc) supplementation to antidepressant therapy has been suggested. On the other hand, antidepressants induce adaptive changes in the NMDA receptor complex (Skolnick, et al. (1996) \nPharmacopsychiatry \n29:23-26; Skolnick, et al. (2001) \nPharmacol Res \n43:411-423). Alterations in this receptor complex were demonstrated in the animal paradigm used for antidepressant screening (FST), in models of depression (Nowak, et al. (1998) \nPol J Pharmacol \n50:365-369; Nowak, et al. (1995) \nJ Neurochem \n64:925-927) and suicide victims (Nowak, e t al. (1995) \nBrain Res \n675:157-164). Thus, depression may be associated with enhanced NMDA signal transduction and the mechanism of antidepressant effect is related to reduction of this transmission.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 7,019,016 to Pfizer provides methods for treating certain disorders including depression which comprise administration of certain NR2B subunit selective NMDA antagonists. The disorders that can be treating by the invention include hearing loss, vision loss, neurodegeneration caused by epileptic seizures, neurotoxin poisoning, Restless Leg Syndrome, multi-system atrophy, non-vascular headache, and depression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,710,168 claims the use of certain compounds having NR2B subunit selectivity for treating a disease or condition which is susceptible to treatment by blocking of NMDA receptor sites, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord trauma, pain, psychotic conditions, drug addiction, migraine, hypoglycemia, anxiolytic conditions, urinary incontinence, and ischemic events arising from CNS surgery, open heart surgery or any procedure during which the function of the cardiovascular system is compromised.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,479,553 to AstraZeneca provides certain compounds, in particular memantine, budipine, amantidine, 5-aminocarbonyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine, dextromethorphan and NPS 1506, and the compounds disclosed in EP 279 937 and EP 633 879, specifically (S)-1-phenyl-2-(2-pyridyl)ethanamine as potentially useful as antidepressant agents. In particular, the compounds were expected to be useful in the treatment of depression associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,432,985 to Hoffman La-Roche provides certain neuroprotective substituted piperidine compounds with activity as NMDA NR2B subtype selective antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT Publication No. WO 06/017409 to Merck & Co. provides certain 1,3-disubstituted heteroaryl compounds are N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists useful for treating neurological condition e.g. pain, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, epilepsy and stroke.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT Publication No. WO 02/072542 to Emory University describes a class of pH-dependent NMDA receptor antagonists that exhibit pH sensitivity tested in vitro using an oocyte assay and in an experimental model of epilepsy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile NMDA-receptor antagonists might be useful to treat a number of very challenging disorders, to date, dose-limiting side effects have prevented clinical use of NMDA receptor antagonists for these conditions. Thus, despite the potential for glutamate antagonists to treat many serious diseases, the severity of the side effects have caused many to abandon hope that a well-tolerated NMDA receptor antagonist could be developed (Hoyte L. et al (2004) \nCurr. Mol. Med. \n4(2): 131-136; Muir, K. W. and Lees, K. R. (1995) \nStroke \n26:503-513; Herrling, P. L., ed. (1997) “Excitatory amino acid clinical results with antagonists” Academic Press; Parsons et al. (1998) \nDrug News Perspective II: \n523 569).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere remains a need for improved neuroprotective compounds and methods for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, there is a need for compounds that have enhanced efficacy in treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, there remains a need for effective compounds that exhibit reduced side effects upon administration. In particular there is a need for improved treatments for depression and anxiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide new pharmaceutical compositions and methods for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, and in particular for the treatment of depression and anxiety.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula I, II, III and IV are provided for the treatment or prophylaxis of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Typically, these compounds act as NMDA antagonists. In particular, compounds of Formulas I, II, III and IV are provided for treatment of mood disorders including depression or anxiety. In certain instances, the disorders are specifically known to result from NMDA receptor activation. In certain embodiments, the compounds are allosteric NMDA inhibitors. In one embodiment, the IC\n50 \nvalue of the compound is 0.01 to 10 μM, 0.01 to 9 μM, 0.01 to 8 μM, 0.01 to 7 μM, 0.01 to 6 μM, 0.01 to 5 μM, 0.01 to 4 μM, 0.01 to 3 μM, 0.01 to 2 μM, 0.01 to 1 μM, 0.05 to 7 μM, 0.05 to 6 μM, 0.05 to 5 μM, 0.05 to 4 μM, 0.05 to 3 μM, 0.05 to 2 μM, 0.05 to 1 μM, 0.05 to 0.5 μM, 0.1 to 7 μM, 0.1 to 6 μM, 0.1 to 5 μM, 0.1 to 4 μM, 0.1 to 3 μM, 0.1 to 2 μM, 0.1 to 1 μM, 0.1 to 0.5 μM, 0.1 to 0.4 μM, 0.1 to 0.3 μM, or 0.1 to 0.2 μM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain NMDA receptor antagonists described herein have enhanced activity in tissue having lower-than-normal pH.

Xing, et al. (2002) Schizophr Res. 58:21-30.) A reduced brain pH can be harnessed as a switch to activate the neuroprotective agents described herein. In this way side effects are minimized in unaffected tissue since drug at these sites are less active.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, the compound is pH sensitive.

The compounds of the invention can generally be administered to a host at risk of, or suffering from, a neuropsychiatric disorder related to NMDA receptor activation. Representative neuropsychiatric disorders include, without limitation, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcohol and substance abuse, and attention-deficit disorders such as ADH or ADHD. In particular embodiments, the disorders are neuropsychiatric mood disorders, non-limiting examples of which include depression, including major depression, bipolar disorders including cyclothymia (a mild form of bipolar disorder), affective disorders such as SAD (seasonal affective disorder) and mania (euphoric, hyperactive, over inflated ego, unrealistic optimism). In certain embodiments, a method of treatment a neuropsychiatric disorder is provided including administering a compound of the invention, alone or in combination to a host diagnosed with the disorder. Uses of the compounds in the treatment or manufacture of a medicament for such disorders are also provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the compounds are used for the treatment of depression in a host diagnosed with the disorder. Depression, formally called major depression, major depressive disorder or clinical depression, is a medical illness that involves the mind and body. Most health professionals today consider depression a chronic illness that requires long-term treatment, much like diabetes or high blood pressure. Although some people experience only one episode of depression, most have repeated episodes of depression symptoms throughout their life. Depression is also a common feature of mental illness, whatever its nature and origin. In some instances, the host or patient has a history of a major psychiatric disorder, such as schizophrenia. In other instances, the host does not have a history of a major psychiatric disorder but has been diagnosed with suffering from at least one depressive episode. In other instances, the host has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The host may also have been diagnosed as suffering from panic attacks or anxiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention are used to diminish the severity of a depressive episode.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, the host is not suffering from a chronic disorder but is at risk of a depressive episode, anxiety or a panic attack due to environmental circumstances. The compounds may be given prophylactically to prevent onset of such an episode. For instance, in certain instances the compounds can be provided to a host before a plane trip, a public speech, or other potential stressful even that could lead to an episode. In some embodiments, therefore, a method of prevention of a neuropsychiatric episode is provided, including administering a compound of the invention to a host at risk of suffering from such an episode.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention are used to prevent a future depressive episode.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the compounds are administered to a host suffering from or at risk of suffering from age-related depression. The compounds can be administered prophylactically to a host over the age of 60, or over the age of 70, or over the age of 80 to prevent or reduce the severity of depressive episodes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepression is associated with physical illness as well. Chronic medical conditions associated with depression include heart disease, cancer, vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, hepatitis, and malaria. Depression also is a common effect of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, multiple sclerosis, strokes, and brain tumors. Even moderate depressive symptoms are associated with a higher than average rate of arteriosclerosis, heart attacks, and high blood pressure. Depression can mimic medical illness and any illness feels worse to someone suffering from depression. In certain other embodiments, the compounds are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with a medical condition, including but not limited to heart disease, cancer, vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, hepatitis, and malaria by admistering the compound to a host suffering from the medical condition. In other instances, the compounds are useful in treatment or prophylaxis of a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with a neurological disorder or physiological insult by administering the compound to a host suffering from a neurological disorder or physiological insult. In non-limiting embodiments, these can include Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, multiple sclerosis, strokes, and brain tumors. In some instances, the compounds are useful for treatment or prophylaxis of disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder associated with an injury or with aging. The compounds may also be useful in treatment or prophylaxis of schizophrenia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain other embodiments, the compounds are used for treatment of a bipolar disorder in a host diagnosed with the disorder. The compounds can also be used to diminish the severity of manic episodes or prevent future episodes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, methods of treating seasonal disorders is provided including administering the compound to a host at risk of suffering from a SAD. In particular, the compounds can be provided on a seasonal basis. In some embodiments, the host has been diagnosed or is at risk of SAD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the host is suffering from an attention deficit disorders such as ADH or ADHD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain NMDA receptor antagonists described herein have enhanced activity in tissue having lower-than-normal pH. The tissue can be brain tissue. In certain embodiments, the reduced pH is associated with neuropsychiatric conditions. In some embodiments, the conditions can be associated with a physiological insult. In other embodiments, the conditions are mood disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds provided herein block the NR2B-containing NMDA receptors, have varying activity against receptors containing NR2A or NR2D, and may be selective for other members of the NMDA receptor family (NR2C, NR3A and NR3B). In one embodiment, the compounds are selective NMDA receptor blockers. General blocking of NMDA receptors throughout the brain causes adverse effects such as ataxia, memory deficits, hallucinations and other neurological problems. In one embodiment, the compounds are NMDA receptors antagonists selective for NR2B, NR2A, NR2C, NR2D, NR3A, and/or NR3B that do not interact with other receptors or ion channels at therapeutic concentrations. In one embodiment, the compound is a selective NR1/NR2A NMDA receptor and/or a NR1/NR2B NMDA receptor antagonist. In one particular embodiment, the compounds can bind to the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. In another particular embodiment, the compounds are selective for the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. In one embodiment, the compound is not an NMDA receptor glutamate site antagonist. In another embodiment, the compound is not an NMDA receptor glycine site antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compound does not exhibit substantial toxic side effects, such as, for example, motor impairment or cognitive impairment. In a particular embodiment, the compound has a therapeutic index equal to or greater than at least 2. In another embodiment, the compound is at least 10 times more selective for binding to an NMDA receptor than any other glutamate receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, compounds selected according to the methods or processes described herein can be used prophylactically to prevent or protect against such diseases or neurological conditions, such as those described herein. In one embodiment, patients with a predisposition for a neuropsychiatric disorder, in particular a mood disorder, such as a genetic predisposition, can be treated prophylactically with the methods and compounds described herein.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nMammals, and specifically humans, suffering from or at risk of neuropsychiatric disorders can be treated by either targeted or systemic administration, via oral, inhalation, topical, trans- or sub-mucosal, subcutaneous, parenteral, intramuscular, intravenous or transdermal administration of a composition comprising an effective amount of the compounds described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug thereof, optionally in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds or composition is typically administered by oral administration. Alternatively, compounds can be administered by inhalation. In another embodiment, the compound is administered transdermally (for example via a slow release patch), or topically. In yet another embodiment, the compound is administered subcutaneously, intravenously, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, parenterally, or submucosally. In any of these embodiments, the compound is administered in an effective dosage range to treat the target condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, compounds of the present invention are administered orally. Oral compositions will generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They may be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compound is administered orally in the form of a dosage unit such as a tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like, these can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder (such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin); an excipient (such as starch or lactose), a disintegrating agent (such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch); a lubricant (such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes); a glidant (such as colloidal silicon dioxide); a sweetening agent (such as sucrose or saccharin); and/or a flavoring agent (such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring). When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to material of the above type, a liquid carrier (such as a fatty oil). In addition, dosage unit forms can contain various other materials which modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar, shellac, or other enteric agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound or its salts can also be administered orally as a component of an elixir, suspension, syrup, wafer, chewing gum or the like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active compounds, a sweetening agent (such as sucrose, saccharine, etc.) and preservatives, dyes and colorings and flavors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be also administered in specific, measured amounts in the form of an aqueous suspension by use of a pump spray bottle. The aqueous suspension compositions of the present invention may be prepared by admixing the compounds with water and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The aqueous suspension compositions according to the present invention may contain, inter alia, water, auxiliaries and/or one or more of the excipients, such as: suspending agents, e.g., microcrystalline cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxpropyl-methyl cellulose; humectants, e.g. glycerin and propylene glycol; acids, bases or buffer substances for adjusting the pH, e.g., citric acid, sodium citrate, phosphoric acid, sodium phosphate as well as mixtures of citrate and phosphate buffers; surfactants, \ne.g. Polysorbate\n 80; and antimicrobial preservatives, e.g., benzalkonium chloride, phenylethyl alcohol and potassium sorbate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a separate embodiment, the compounds of the invention are in the form of an inhaled dosage. In this embodiment, the compounds may be in the form of an aerosol suspension, a dry powder or liquid particle form. The compounds may be prepared for delivery as a nasal spray or in an inhaler, such as a metered dose inhaler. Pressurized metered-dose inhalers (“MDI”) generally deliver aerosolized particles suspended in chlorofluorocarbon propellants such as CFC-11, CFC-12, or the non-chlorofluorocarbons or alternate propellants such as the fluorocarbons, HFC-134A or HFC-227 with or without surfactants and suitable bridging agents. Dry-powder inhalers can also be used, either breath activated or delivered by air or gas pressure such as the dry-powder inhaler disclosed in the Schering Corporation International Patent Application No. PCT/US92/05225, published 7 Jan. 1993 as well as the Turbuhaler™ (available from Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Inc.) or the Rotahaler™ (available from Allen & Hanburys) which may be used to deliver the aerosolized particles as a finely milled powder in large aggregates either alone or in combination with some pharmaceutically acceptable carrier e.g. lactose; and nebulizers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, subcutaneous, or topical application can include at least some of the following components: a sterile diluent (such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents); antibacterial agents (such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens); antioxidants (such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfate); chelating agents (such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid); buffers (such as acetates, citrates or phosphates); and/or agents for the adjustment of tonicity (such as sodium chloride or dextrose). The pH of the solution or suspension can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable vehicles or carriers for topical application can be prepared by conventional techniques, such as lotions, suspensions, ointments, creams, gels, tinctures, sprays, powders, pastes, slow-release transdermal patches, suppositories for application to rectal, vaginal, nasal or oral mucosa. In addition to the other materials listed above for systemic administration, thickening agents, emollients, and stabilizers can be used to prepare topical compositions. Examples of thickening agents include petrolatum, beeswax, xanthan gum, or polyethylene, humectants such as sorbitol, emollients such as mineral oil, lanolin and its derivatives, or squalene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf administered intravenously, carriers can be physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL™ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) are also preferred as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). For example, liposome formulations may be prepared by dissolving appropriate lipid(s) (such as stearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine, stearoyl phosphatidyl choline, arachadoyl phosphatidyl choline, and cholesterol) in an inorganic solvent that is then evaporated, leaving behind a thin film of dried lipid on the surface of the container. An aqueous solution of the compound is then introduced into the container. The container is then swirled by hand to free lipid material from the sides of the container and to disperse lipid aggregates, thereby forming the liposomal suspension.\n\n\n \nDosing\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compound is administered for a sufficient time period to alleviate the undesired symptoms and the clinical signs associated with the condition being treated. In one embodiment, the compounds are administered less than three times daily. In one embodiment, the compounds are administered in one or two doses daily. In one embodiment, the compounds are administered once daily. In some embodiments, the compounds are administered in a single oral dosage once a day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent in an amount sufficient to deliver to a patient a therapeutic amount of compound in vivo in the absence of serious toxic effects. An effective dose can be readily determined by the use of conventional techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. In determining the effective dose, a number of factors are considered including, but not limited to: the species of patient; its size, age, and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree of involvement or the severity of the disease; the response of the individual patient; the particular compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; and the use of concomitant medication.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical systemic dosages for the herein described conditions are those ranging from 0.01 mg/kg to 1500 mg/kg of body weight per day as a single daily dose or divided daily doses. Preferred dosages for the described conditions range from 0.5-1500 mg per day. A more particularly preferred dosage for the desired conditions ranges from 5-750 mg per day. Typical dosages can also range from 0.01 to 1500, 0.02 to 1000, 0.2 to 500, 0.02 to 200, 0.05 to 100, 0.05 to 50, 0.075 to 50, 0.1 to 50, 0.5 to 50, 1 to 50, 2 to 50, 5 to 50, 10 to 50, 25 to 50, 25 to 75, 25 to 100, 100 to 150, or 150 or more mg/kg/day, as a single daily dose or divided daily doses. In one embodiment, the daily dose is between 10 and 500 mg/day. In another embodiment, the dose is between about 10 and 400 mg/day, or between about 10 and 300 mg/day, or between about 20 and 300 mg/day, or between about 30 and 300 mg/day, or between about 40 and 300 mg/day, or between about 50 and 300 mg/day, or between about 60 and 300 mg/day, or between about 70 and 300 mg/day, or between about 80 and 300 mg/day, or between about 90 and 300 mg/day, or between about 100 and 300 mg/day, or about 200 mg/day. In one embodiment, the compounds are given in doses of between about 1 to about 5, about 5 to about 10, about 10 to about 25 or about 25 to about 50 mg/kg. Typical dosages for topical application are those ranging from 0.001 to 100% by weight of the active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of active compound in the drug composition will depend on absorption, inactivation, and excretion rates of the drug as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. It is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that the dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition. The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at varying intervals of time.\n\n\n \nCombination Treatment\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compound can also be mixed with other active materials which do not impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired action. The active compounds can be administered in conjunction, i.e. combination or alternation, with other medications used in the treatment or prevention neuropsychiatric disorders, such as those in which NMDA receptor activation is involved. In certain embodiments, the combination can be synergistic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the compound is administered in combination or alternation with a compound useful for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRT), norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), combined reuptake inhibitor and receptor blocker, tetracyclic antidepressant, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (although TCAs tend to have numerous and severe side effects), or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can also be used to treat depression in conjunction with administration of a compound of the invention. Nontraditional treatment options include vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro). SSRIs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration specifically to treat depression are: Citalopram (Celexa), Escitalopram (Lexapro), Fluoxetine (Prozac, Prozac Weekly), Paroxetine (Paxil, Paxil CR) and Sertraline (Zoloft).

Emsam is the first skin (transdermal) patch for depression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the compounds of the invention can be administered in combination with another active agent. In certain embodiments, the second active is one that is effective in treatment of a neuropsychiatric disorder. However, in certain other embodiments, the second active is one that is effective against an underlying disorder that is associated with a neuropsychiatric symptom. Examples of such disorders are heart disease, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's diseases. In certain embodiments, the compounds can be administered in combination in a single dosage form or injection, or administered concurrently. In other embodiments, the compounds are administered in alternation.\n\n\n \nSide Effects\n\n\n \n \n \nIn an additional aspect of the methods and processes described herein, the compound does not exhibit substantial toxic an/or psychotic side effects. Toxic side effects include, but are not limited to: agitation, hallucination, confusion, stupor, paranoia, delirium, psychotomimetic-like symptoms, rotarod impairment, amphetamine-like stereotyped behaviors, stereotypy, psychosis memory impairment, motor impairment, anxiolytic-like effects, increased blood pressure, decreased blood pressure, increased pulse, decreased pulse, hematological abnormalities, electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, cardiac toxicity, heart palpitations, motor stimulation, psychomotor performance, mood changes, short-term memory deficits, long-term memory deficits, arousal, sedation, extrapyramidal side-effects, ventricular tachycardia. Lengthening of cardiac repolarisation, ataxia, cognitive deficits and/or schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, in another embodiment, the compounds selected or identified according to the processes and methods described herein do not have substantial side effects associated with other classes of NMDA receptor antagonists. In one embodiments, such compounds do not substantially exhibit the side effects associated with NMDA antagonists of the glutamate site, such as selfotel, D-CPPene (SDZ EAA 494) and AR-R15896AR (ARL 15896AR), including, agitation, hallucination, confusion and stupor (Davis et al. (2000) \nStroke \n31(2):347-354; Diener et al. (2002), \nJ Neurol \n249(5):561-568); paranoia and delirium (Grotta et al. (1995), \nJ Intern Med \n237:89-94); psychotomimetic-like symptoms (Loscher et al. (1998), \nNeurosci Lett \n240(1):33-36); poor therapeutic ratio (Dawson et al. (2001), \nBrain Res \n892(2):344-350); amphetamine-like stereotyped behaviors (Potschka et al. (1999), \nEur J Pharmacol \n374(2):175-187). In another embodiment, such compounds do not exhibit the side effects associated with NMDA antagonists of the glycine site, such as HA-966, L-701,324, d-cycloserine, CGP-40116, and ACEA 1021, including significant memory impairment and motor impairment (Wlaz, P (1998), \nBrain Res Bull \n46(6):535-540). In a still further embodiment, such compounds do not exhibit the side effects of NMDA high affinity receptor channel blockers, such as MK-801 and ketamine, including, psychosis-like effects (Hoffman, D C (1992), \nJ Neural Transm Gen Sect \n89:1-10); cognitive deficits (decrements in free recall, recognition memory, and attention; Malhotra et al (1996), \nNeuropsychopharmacology \n14:301-307); schizophrenia-like symptoms (Krystal et al (1994), \nArch Gen Psychiatry \n51:199-214; Lahti et al. (2001), \nNeuropsychopharmacology \n25:455-467), and hyperactivity and increased stereotypy (Ford et al (1989) \nPhysiology and behavior \n46: 755-758.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further additional or alternative embodiment, the compound has a therapeutic index equal to or greater than at least 2:1, at least 3:1, at least 4:1, at least 5:1, at least 6:1, at least 7:1, at least 8:1, at least 9:1, at least 10:1, at least 15:1, at least 20:1, at least 25:1, at least 30:1, at least 40:1, at least 50:1, at least 75:1, at least 100:1 or at least 1000:1. The therapeutic index can be defined as the ratio of the dose required to produce toxic or lethal effects to dose required to produce therapeutic responses. It can be the ratio between the median toxic dose (the dosage at which 50% of the group exhibits the adverse effect of the drug) and the median effective dose (the dosage at which 50% of the population respond to the drug in a specific manner). The higher the therapeutic index, the more safe the drug is considered to be. It simply indicates that it would take a higher dose to invoke a toxic response that it does to cause a beneficial effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe side effect profile of compounds can be determined by any method known to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment, motor impairment can be measured by, for example, measuring locomotor activity and/or rotorod performance. Rotorod experiments involve measuring the duration that an animal can remain on an accelerating rod. In another embodiment, memory impairment can be assessed, for example, by using a passive avoidance paradigm; Sternberg memory scanning and paired words for short-term memory, or delayed free recall of pictures for long-term memory. In a further embodiment, anxiolytic-like effects can be measured, for example, in the elevated plus maze task. In other embodiments, cardiac function can be monitored, blood pressure and/or body temperature measured and/or electrocardiograms conducted to test for side effects. In other embodiments, psychomotor functions and arousal can be measured, for example by analyzing critical flicker fusion threshold, choice reaction time, and/or body sway. In other embodiments, mood can be assessed using, for example, self-ratings. In further embodiments, schizophrenic symptoms can be evaluated, for example, using the PANSS, BPRS, and CGI, side-effects were assessed by the HAS and the S/A scale.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are provided to illustrate the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope thereof.

Quality of synthesized cRNA was assessed by gel electrophoresis, and quantity was estimated by spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis. Stage V and VI oocytes were surgically removed from the ovaries of large, well-fed and healthy \nXenopus laevis \nanesthetized with 3-amino-benzoic acid ethyl ester (3 gm/l) as previously described. Clusters of isolated oocytes were incubated with 292 U/ml Worthington (Freehold, N.J.) type IV collagenase or 1.3 mg/ml collagenase (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.; 17018-029) for 2 hr in Ca\n2+\n-free solution comprised of (in mM) 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.5, with slow agitation to remove the follicular cell layer. Oocytes were then washed extensively in the same solution supplemented with 1.8 mM CaCl\n2 \nand maintained in Barth's solution comprised of (in mM): 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO\n3\n, 10 HEPES, 0.82 MgSO\n4\n, 0.33 Ca(NO\n3\n)\n2\n, and 0.91 CaCl\n2 \nand supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamycin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml penicillin. Oocytes were manually defolliculated and injected within 24 hrs of isolation with 3-5 ng of NR1 subunit cRNA and 7-10 ng of NR2 cRNA subunit in a 50 nl volume, or 5-10 ng of AMPA or kainate receptor cRNAs in a 50 nl volume, and incubated in Barth's solution at 18° C. for 1-7 d. Glass injection pipettes had tip sizes ranging from 10-20 microns, and were backfilled with mineral oil.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nTwo Electrode Voltage Clamp Recording from \nXenopus laevis \nOocytes\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo electrode voltage-clamp recordings were made 2-7 days post-injection as previously described. Oocytes were placed in a dual-track plexiglass recording chamber with a single perfusion line that splits in a Y-configuration to perfuse two oocytes. Dual recordings were made at room temperature (23° C.) using two Warner OC725B two-electrode voltage clamp amplifiers, arranged as recommended by the manufacturer. Glass microelectrodes (1-10 Megaohms) were filled with 300 mM KCl (voltage electrode) or 3 M KCl (current electrode). The bath clamps communicated across silver chloride wires placed into each side of the recording chamber, both of which were assumed to be at a reference potential of 0 mV. Oocytes were perfused with a solution comprised of (in mM) 90 NaCl, 1 KCl, 10 HEPES, and 0.5 BaCl\n2\n; pH was adjusted by addition of 1-3 M NaOH of HCl. Oocytes were recorded under voltage clamp at −40 mV. Final concentrations for control application of glutamate (50 μM) plus glycine (30 μM) were achieved by adding appropriate volumes from 100 and 30 mM stock solutions, respectively. In addition, 10 μM final EDTA was obtained by adding a 1:1000 dilution of 10 mM EDTA, in order to chelate contaminant divalent ions such as Zn\n2+\n. Concentration-response curves for experimental compounds were obtained by applying in successive fashion maximal glutamate/glycine, followed by glutamate/glycine plus variable concentrations of experimental compounds. Dose response curves consisting of 4 to 8 concentrations were obtained in this manner. The baseline leak current at −40 mV was measured before and after recording, and the full recording linearly corrected for any change in leak current. Oocytes with glutamate-evoked responses smaller than 50 nA were not included in the analysis. The level of inhibition by applied experimental compounds was expressed as a percent of the initial glutamate response, and averaged together across oocytes from a single frog. Each experiment consisted of recordings from 3 to 10 oocytes obtained from a single frog. Results from 3-6 experiments were pooled, and the average percent responses at antagonist concentrations were fitted by the equation,\n\n\n \n \n \nPercent Response=(100−minimum)/(1+([conc]/IC\n50\n)\nnH\n)+minimum\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere minimum is the residual percent response in saturating concentration of the experimental compounds, IC\n50 \nis the concentration of antagonist that causes half of the achievable inhibition, and nH is a slope factor describing steepness of the inhibition curve. Minimum was constrained to be greater than or equal to 0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssay results for test compounds are reported in Tables 17-21.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

ether-a-go-go potassium channel (hERG) expressed in HEK293 cells by displacement of \n3\n[H]-astemizole according to the methods by Finlayson et al. (K. Finlayson., L. Turnbull, C. T. January, J. Sharkey, J. S. Kelly; \n3\n[H]Dofetilide binding to HERG transfected membranes: a potential high throughput preclinical screen. \nEur. J. Pharmacol. \n2001, 430, 147-148). Compounds were incubated at 1 or 10 μM final concentration, in duplicate, and the amount of displaced \n3\n[H]-astemizole determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. In some cases, a seven concentration (each concentration in duplicate) displacement curve was generated to determine an IC\n50\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding to the rat alpha-1 adrenergic receptor in rat brain membranes was determined by displacement of \n3\n[H]-prazosin (P. Greengrass and R. Bremner; Binding characteristics of 3H-prazosin to rat brain a-adrenergic receptors. \nEur. J. Pharmacol. \n1979, 55: 323-326).

E. Clarke and P. Jeffrey; Utility of metabolic stability screening: comparison of in vitro and in vivo clearance. \nXenobiotica \n2001. 31: 591-598). At 60 min the samples were extracted and analyzed for the presence of the parent compound by LC-MS/MS. The parent material remaining in the sample at 60 min was compared to that at 0 min and expressed as a percentage. A control compound, testosterone, was run in parallel.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nPlasma Half-Life and Brain Exposure\n\n\n \n \n \nRats (n=3 per dose) were administered compounds at a doses of 1-4 mg/kg in a single bolus i.v. infusion (2 ml/kg body weight) via the tail vein formulated in 2% dimethyl acetamide/98% 2-hydroxy-propyl cyclodextrin (5%). Animals were fasted overnight prior to dose administration and food returned to the animals two hours after dosing. Following IV dosing, blood samples (\nca\n 200 μL) were collected into separate tubes containing anticoagulant (K-EDTA) via the orbital plexus at various times post administration. Plasma samples were prepared immediately after collection by centrifugation for ten minutes using a tabletop centrifuge, and stored at −80° C. Brain tissue was weighed, homogenized on ice in 50 mM phosphate buffer (2 ml per brain) and the homogenate stored at −80° C. Plasma and brain homogenate samples were extracted by the addition of 5 volumes of cold acetonitrile, mixed well by vortexing and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatant fractions were analyzed by LC-MS/MS operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). The amount of parent compound in each sample was calculated by comparing the response of the analyte in the sample to that of a standard curve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPenetration Classification (Table 24) using the in vitro cell permeability assay to predict bran penetration potential: Transwell® wells containing MDR1-MDCK cell monolayers that express the multidrug transporter P-gp were used for measuring the percent recovery of compound after dosing both sides of a cell monolayer with the test article. Monolayers were grown for 7-11 days at which time 5 μM of the test article was made by dilution from DMSO stocks into a Hank's balanced salt solution (pH 7.4), final DMSO not greater than 1%, and added to: a) the apical side for A-B permeability (apical to basal) assessment, or separately b) the basal side for the B-A permeability (basal to apical) assessment, all at pH 7.4. After a 2 hr incubation (37° C.) both the apical and the basal compartments were sampled and the amount of test article present determined by generic LC-MS/MS methods against a ≧4 point calibration curve. Experiments were done in duplicate. Apparent permeability (P\napp \nunits are reported×10−6 cm/s) are determined for the A−B and the B−A directions as well as the Efflux ratio (P\napp\nB−A/P\napp \nA−B). The blood-brain barrier penetration potential is classified as follows: “High” when P\napp \nA−B≧3.0×10−6 cm/s, and efflux<3.0; “Moderate” when P\napp \nA−B≧3.0×10−6 cm/s, and 10>efflux≧3.0; and “Low” when either P\napp \nA−B≧3.0×10−6 cm/s, and efflux≧10, or when P\napp \nA−B<3.0×10−6 cm/s.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasma Stability Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.v.\n\n\nAUC (0-last h)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPK-i.v.\n\n\nCmax\n\n\ni.v.

All compounds were administered as intraperitoneal injections. Animals were placed into a beaker (15 cm diameter) of water held at 25° C. with a depth of 15 \ncm\n 30 min after compound administration. Behavior was videotaped for 6 minutes from the side of the beaker and scored subsequently for struggling behavior. Results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni tests. Immobility time date from the forced swim tests is shown in \nFIGS. 1 and 2\n. Total immobility time refers to the time that the animal spends floating or engaged in minimal activity to keep afloat for at least 3 seconds. Subtle movements of feet, tail or head required to maintain the eyes, ears, and nose above the surface of the water were excluded as immobility.

Animals were given vehicle, imipramine, or a dose of a test compound. All compounds were administered as intraperitoneal injections. Activity was summated at 5 minute intervals over the 90 min period of testing. At 60 minutes, the mice were injected with 10 mg/kg NP10075, 10 mg/kg NP10076 or a vehicle. Locomotion was measured in terms of the total distance traveled (horizontal activity). Results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni tests. Neither NP10075 or NP10076 altered mouse open field activity at a dosage of 10 mg/kg. Data for these tests is shown in \nFIG. 3\n.\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nPlasma and Brain Exposure Assessment\n\n\n \n \n \nMice were administered a dose of test compound (10 mg/kg by i.p.) and blood and brain tissue samples collected at the indicated times post drug administration (n=3-5). Blood samples were collected in K-EDTA tubes and centrifuged for ten minutes immediately after collection, and the plasma was stored at −80° C. until analysis. Brains were immediately removed from the skull and the meninges and cerebellum removed, rinsed with ice-cold PBS, weighed and then homogenized at 4° C. in 2-3 volumes of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and stored at −80° C. until analysis. Plasma and brain homogenates were extracted by the addition of 5 volumes of cold acetonitrile, mixed well by vortexing and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatant fractions were analyzed by LC-MS/MS operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) and analyzed for the parent compound to determine the plasma or brain concentration. Internal standards were added to calibrate each sample. An eight point standard curve was prepared similarly in naïve plasma and brain for each compound of interest. Plasma and brain exposure assessment data is provided in Table 27. Based on occupancy studies of other NR2B antagonists in rodents (CP-101,606, Ro25-6981, and Merck20j), plus plasma levels achieved in Preskorn et al., brain exposures for the test compounds were consistent with “anticipated levels” required for efficacy.

The test is initiated by placing mice on a rotating rod (5 rpm) that is 3.8 cm diameter by 8 cm wide and suspended 30 cm from the floor of a chamber. After 10 sec the rotation is accelerated from 5 to 35 rpm over a 5 minute period. The time the mouse falls from the rod (the latency time) is recorded automatically with a light-activated sensor in the bottom of the chamber. Animals were trained four times each day for two days, with a within-day inter-trial interval of 20-25 min and a between-day interval of 24 hrs. On \nday\n 3, mice were randomly assigned to groups and injected in a blinded fashion with either vehicle, positive control (0.3 mg/kg (+)MK−801 or 10 mg/kg ifenprodil), or doses of NP compound. All drugs were administered i.p. Results were analyzed by ANOVA and Dunnett's tests. Data is shown in \nFIG. 4\n.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\nCell Toxicity in Cortical Neuron Culture\n\n\n \n \n \nPrimary cultures of rat cerebral cortex were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rat embryos (E16-E19). Cells were plated into 24 well plates at a density of 3×105 per well, in Neurobasal medium supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (5 U/ml), streptomycin (10 μg/ml) and B-27. After 14-22 days in culture, cells were treated with test compounds (in triplicate wells) at 10 μM, final, and incubated for 24 hrs. Cell death was assessed by measuring the amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the culture medium (Tox-7 kit; Sigma Chemical Co, St. Louis, Mo.). Released LDH was expressed as the fraction of total LDH present in each well. Maximal cell death was determined by treating separate wells (in triplicate) with saturating concentrations of NMDA (100 μM) and glycine (10 μM) for 24 hrs. Results shown are the Mean±SEM from a minimum of three separate cultures cell toxicity was assessed by % total LDH release after 24 hr incubation of 10 μM compound in cell culture. For each compound, three cultures were treated with 10 μM compound. Data is shown in \nFIG. 5\n.\n\n\n \nExample 19\n\n\nAmes Test for Genotoxicity\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Ames test determines the ability of a compound to reverse an introduced mutation in two strains of \nSalmonella typhimurium \n(selected from TA98, TA100, TA15345, TA1537, and TA102). (See for example Maron, D. M. and Ames, B. N., \nMutat. Res., \n1983, 113, 173-215.) Compounds were tested at eight dose levels 1.5, 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, 1500, and 5000 μg/plate in both the presence and absence of S-9 microsomal fraction in two bacterial strains (TA98, TA102). After incubation at 37° the number of revertant colonies was compared with the number of spontaneous revertants on negative (vehicle) plates. Positive control plates containing a known mutagen active in each of the strains in the presence of S-9 extract (2-aminoanthracene at 1-5 ug/plate) were also run.

Binding studies were performed either at a single concentration of 10 uM (in duplicate) or binding IC\n50 \nvalues determined from displacement curves (four-six concentrations, each point in duplicate) fit by a non-linear, least squares, regression analysis using MathIQ (ID Business Solutions Ltd., UK). Data is shown in \nFIG. 6\n. Compounds were evaluated for binding to the human ether-a-go-go potassium channel (hERG) expressed in HEK293 cells by displacement of 3[H]-astemizole. Binding studies were performed either at a single concentration of 10 uM (in duplicate) or binding IC\n50 \nvalues determined from displacement curves (four-six concentrations, each point in duplicate) fit by a non-linear, least squares, regression analysis using MathIQ (ID Business Solutions Ltd., UK). Functional hERG channel block was determined using patch clamp methods with stable hERG channel transfectants in HEK293 cells. All experiments were performed at ambient temperature. Each cell acted as its own control. Three to five concentrations of the test article was applied at 5 minute intervals via micropipette tips to cells expressing hERG (n≧3 cells/concentration). Duration of exposure to each test article concentration was 5 minutes. After vehicle application, the positive control was applied in the same manner to verify sensitivity to hERG blockade. Intracellular solution for whole cell recordings consisted of (composition in mM): potassium aspartate, 130; MgCl2, 5; EGTA, 5; ATP, 4; HEPES, 10; pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. After establishment of a whole-cell configuration, membrane currents were recorded using QPatch HT® system. Before digitization, the current records were low-pass filtered at one-fifth of the sampling frequency. Onset and block of hERG current was measured using a stimulus voltage pattern consisting of a 200 ms prepulse to −40 mV (leakage subtraction), a 2-second activating pulse to +40 mV, followed by a 2-second test pulse to −40 mV. The pulse pattern was repeated continuously at 10 s intervals, from a holding potential of −80 mV. Peak tail currents were measured during the −40 mV test pulse. Leakage current was calculated from the current amplitude evoked by the prepulse and subtracted from the total membrane current recorded. Data acquisition and analysis was performed using the suite of Assay Software programs (Sophion Bioscience A/S, Denmark). Steady state was defined by the limiting constant rate of change with time (linear time dependence). The steady state before and after test article application was used to calculate the percentage of current inhibited at each concentration. Concentration-response data were fit to the following equation:\n\n\n \n \n \n% Block={1−1/[1+([Test]/IC50)\nN]}*\n100\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere [Test] is the concentration of test article, IC50 is the concentration of the test article producing half-maximal inhibition, N is the Hill coefficient, and % Block is the percentage of hERG potassium current inhibited at each concentration of the test article. Data were fit by a nonlinear least squares fits with the Solver add-in for Excel 2000 (Microsoft, Redmond, Wash.). Data is shown in \nFIG. 6\n.\n\n\n \nExample 21\n\n\nLangendorff Heart Preparation and Measurement of QT Effects\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effects of test compounds on the QT-interval of the electrocardiogram were evaluated in vitro using an isolated retrograde perfused rabbit (New Zealand white female) heart preparation (Langendorff) with an ablated AV node and stimulated at a basic cycle length of 1 s. Test article concentrations were prepared by diluting stock solutions in DMSO into Kreb-Henseleit (KH) solution (composition in mM): NaCl, 129; KCl, 3.7; CaCl\n2\n, 1.3; MgSO4, 0.64; Na-Pyruvate, 2.0; NaHCO3, 17.8; Glucose, 5. The solution was aerated with a mixture of 95% O\n2 \nand 5% CO2 (pH 7.3-7.45). All test solutions contained 0.3% DMSO, final. Briefly, rabbits were heparinized and anesthetized with sodium pentothal and hearts rapidly removed via a midsternal thoracotomy and placed in chilled oxygenated (95% O2+5% CO2) KH solution. The heart was mounted in a Langendorff heart perfusion apparatus and perfused at a constant flow with KH solution (37° C.) in a retrograde fashion through the aorta. The A-V node was ablated to slow the intrinsic heart rate to a ventricular escape less than 60 beats/min. Following immersion of the heart into the bath the volume-conducted ECG was recorded via bath-mounted electrodes. Three Ag/AgCl pellet electrodes were positioned in the bath chamber to form an equilateral triangle centered on the heart. Each heart was paced by repetitive electrical stimuli (0.1-5 ms, approximately 1.5×threshold) by a pulse generator. The ECG signals were conditioned by an AC-coupled preamplifier (Grass Model P511) with low-pass filtering to achieve a bandwidth of 10-300 Hz. A stabilization period was at least 30 minutes long before obtaining baseline control responses. Test article concentrations were applied sequentially, in ascending order for exposure periods of at least 15 minutes/concentration to allow equilibration with the tissue. The average responses from at least three hearts were analyzed for each test condition. The QT interval was calculated and the Mean±SEM values from the last four beats in the equilibration period were measured. Test results are shown in \nFIG. 7\n.\n\n\n \nExample 22\n\n\nPCP Discrimination Test\n\n\n \n \n \nDevelopment of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists for a variety of disorders has been hindered by their production of phencyclidine (PCP)-like psychological effects and abuse potential. Drug discrimination studies allow direct comparisons to be made among the discriminative stimulus effects of drugs (Balster, 1990; Holtzman, 1990) and are considered to be predictive of subjective effects in humans. Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate 2 mg/kg (i.p.) PCP or saline when administered intraperitoneally 15 min before the session under a double alternation schedule. Rats were placed in the operant chambers and the session initiated, as signaled by illumination of the chamber houselight. Completion of a FR32 on the correct lever resulted in delivery of a 45-mg food pellet (PJ Noyes Company, Inc., Lancaster, N.H., USA). Incorrect responding reset the FR for correct-lever responding. Training was continued until the animals respond reliably and complete the first FR with more than 80% of total responses on the correct lever during a minimum of four consecutive sessions. Subsequent to acquisition of the PCP-saline discrimination, test sessions commenced on when animals met the following criteria on the most recent PCP and saline training sessions: (i) first FR completed on the correct lever, and (ii) greater than 85% correct-lever responding over the entire session. The animals were tested with different doses of test drug (as shown), generally given in an ascending order across test days. Various doses of PCP and test compounds were administered intraperitoneally 15 min before session initiation. To demonstrate the degree of stimulus control, tests with 2 mg/kg PCP and saline were carried out before and after each dose-response curve. In addition vehicle was also tested. Between test sessions, animals continued to train with PCP and saline injections. Illumination of lights, recording of responses and pellet delivery was controlled by a microcomputer using MEDPC software (Med Associates). For data analysis the mean (±SE) percentage PCP-lever responding and response rate (resp/s) effects was evaluated for all test sessions. Full substitution for PCP required greater than 80% PCP-lever responding, partial substitution as producing between 20 and 80% PCP-lever responding, and less than 20% PCP-lever responding will be indicative of a lack of PCP-like discriminative stimulus effects. Additionally, the mean response rate for all animals during each test session was determined to reveal any nonspecific effects on behavior.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData for 93-31 (NP031) and 93-97 (NP097) compared to PCP are shown in \nFIG. 8\n."
