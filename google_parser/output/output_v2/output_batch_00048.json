No. 61/012,209, filed Dec. 7, 2007, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/074,794, filed Jun. 23, 2008. The contents of the prior applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF FEDERAL RESEARCH SUPPORT\n\n\n \n \n \nWork for this invention was partially funded by a grant under GM54237 awarded by the National Institute of Health. The government may have certain rights in this invention.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nTransmembrane proteins are key components of essential cellular functions. One particular class of transmembrane proteins, ion channels, are commonly characterized by the method utilized to open or close the channel protein, either permitting or preventing specific ions from permeating the channel protein and crossing the cellular membrane. For example, one type of channel protein is the voltage-gated channel protein, which is opened or closed in response to changes in electrical potential across the cell membrane. Another type of channel protein is mechanically gated, such that mechanical stress on the protein opens or closes the channel. Still another type is ligand-gated, such that it opens or closes depending on whether a particular ligand is bound the protein. The ligand can be either an extracellular moiety, such as a neurotransmitter, or an intracellular moiety, such as an ion or nucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransmembrane proteins such as ion channels are involved in a wide variety of biological process, such as cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle contraction, nerve function, epithelial transport of nutrients and ions, T-cell activation and pancreatic beta-cell insulin release. For example, one common type of channel proteins, K\n+\n ion channels, control heart rate, regulate the secretion of hormones such as insulin into the blood stream, generate electrical impulses central to information transfer in the nervous system, and control airway and vascular smooth muscle tone. Thus, K\n+\n ion channels participate in cellular control processes that are abnormal, such as cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, seizure disorder, asthma and hypertension.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the search for new drugs, diagnostics, or research tools, transmembrane proteins are therefore a common target.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present disclosure provides systems and methods for identifying or detecting a ligand in a sample. Such systems and methods include contacting at least one receptor with a sample comprising at least one toxin peptide; and determining whether a toxin peptide in the sample selectively binds to the at least one receptor, thereby identifying or detecting a ligand in a sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the at least one receptor is expressed in cells, and the method includes transfecting the cells with a nucleic acid encoding the at least one receptor. The at least one receptor can include a receptor that is heterologous to the cell in which it is expressed. The at least one receptor can include a receptor that is native to the cell in which it is expressed. The at least one receptor can include a receptor that is stably expressed in a cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, transfected cells include at least two cells comprising a first cell expressing a first receptor and a second cell expressing a second receptor different from the first receptor. In some embodiments, the at least one receptor is immobilized on a substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe at least one receptor can include a transmembrane protein, e.g., a channel protein, e.g., a channel protein selected from the group consisting of a sodium ion channel, a potassium ion channel, a calcium ion channel, a chloride ion channel, a non-specific ion channel. In some embodiments, a transmembrane protein includes a potassium ion channel. In some embodiments, a potassium ion channel is a Kv1.3 channel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a sample includes a library of toxin peptides, e.g., a phage display library. In some embodiments, toxin peptides are about 5-200 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, toxin peptides are about 5-100 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, toxin peptides are about 5-50 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, toxin peptides are about 20-50 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, toxin peptides are about 30-50 amino acids in length. Toxin peptides can include sequences found in a toxin that is naturally expressed in an organism (e.g., a snake toxin, a snail toxin, a scorpion toxin, a sea anemone toxin, a spider toxin, a lizard toxin). In some embodiments, a toxin peptide includes six cysteine residues. In some embodiments, spacing of the cysteine residues is conserved with the spacing of cysteine residues found in a natural toxin. In some embodiments, a disulfide bonding pattern is conserved with a disulfide bonding pattern found in a natural toxin. For example, in some embodiments, a toxin peptide includes at least 35 amino acids, and has an amino acid sequence including at least six cysteine residues, so that the cysteine residues are located at each of the following positions within the 35 amino acids: 7 or 8, 13 or 14, 27 or 28, 32 or, 33, and 34 or 35. In some embodiments, a toxin peptide library includes toxin peptides in which a disulfide bonding pattern is conserved with a disulfide bonding pattern found in a natural toxin, and in which residues other than cysteines are altered (e.g., by randomization of residues at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 positions of a toxin sequence).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, toxin peptides have an amino acid sequence that allow variability at “X” residues, e.g., toxin peptides have an amino acid sequence that includes: (X)\nm\nC(X)\nn\nC(X)\nn\nC(X)\no\nC(X)\nn\nCXC(X)\nm \n(SEQ ID NO:______), wherein X is any amino acid, and wherein m=0-10 amino acids, n=2-10 amino acids, and o=2-20 amino acids.

Methods of identifying ligands described herein permit selection of ligands that exhibit a desired degree of specificity, affinity, and/or biological activity for a target of interest. The present disclosure encompasses the discovery of novel ligands (e.g., ligands identified from variegated libraries of toxin peptides) having a high degree of selectivity for specific receptors such as ion channels, as well as methods for producing and using the ligands to modulate receptor activity. Exemplary ligands described herein include mokatoxin-1, mokatoxin-2, and mokatoxin-3, each of which specifically bind to the receptor Kv1.3. Other ligands and receptors are also described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains. In case of conflict, the present document, including definitions, will control. Preferred methods and materials are described below, although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure. All publications, patent applications, patents, references to amino acid and nucleic acid sequence database identifiers, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. The materials, methods, and examples disclosed herein are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “characteristic sequence element” or “sequence element” refers to a stretch of contiguous amino acids, typically 5 amino acids, e.g., at least 5-500, 5-250, 5-100, 5-75, 5-50, 5-25, 5-15, or 5-10 amino acids, that shows at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity with another polypeptide. In some embodiments, a characteristic sequence element participates in or confers function on a polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “corresponding to” is often used to designate the position/identity of an amino acid residue in a polypeptide (e.g., in a toxin). Those of ordinary skill will appreciate that, for purposes of simplicity, a canonical numbering system (based on wild type toxins) is utilized herein (as illustrated, for example, in \nFIGS. 2\n, \n9\n, \n14\n, and \n15\n), so that an amino acid “corresponding to” a residue at position 7, for example, need not actually be the 7\nth \namino acid in a particular amino acid chain but rather corresponds to the residue found at 7 in a wild type polypeptide (e.g., in a toxin); those of ordinary skill in the art readily appreciate how to identify corresponding amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “library” refers to a collection of members. A library may be comprised of any type of members. For example, in some embodiments, a library comprises a collection of phage particles. In some embodiments, a library comprises a collection of peptides. In some embodiments, a library comprises a collection of cells. A library typically includes diverse members (i.e., members of a library differ from each other by virtue of variability in an element, such as a peptide sequence, between members). For example, a library of phage particles can include phage particles that express unique peptides. A library of peptides can include peptides having diverse sequences. A library can include, for example, at least 10\n1\n, 10\n2\n, 10\n3\n, 10\n4\n, 10\n5\n, 10\n6\n, 10\n7\n, 10\n8\n, 10\n9\n, or more unique members.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “ligand” refers to any agent that binds to a receptor. Ligands can include, but are not limited to, small molecules (whether synthetic or isolated from natural sources), biodegradable cofactors, proteins, synthetic peptides, and polymers, both synthetic and naturally occurring, including DNA. In many embodiments, ligands are polypeptides. For example, ligands can be protein/peptide toxins and/or other venom/poison components of animal, plant, or microbial origin or natural or synthetic derivatives of the same. In some embodiments, a ligand is a toxin peptide as defined herein. In some embodiments, ligands are expressed and/or presented to a receptor as part of a library, e.g., a phage display library. In some embodiments, ligands are expressed and/or presented singly. A ligand can be presented to a receptor in any other mean or form (e.g., removed from the phage, or expressed in a comparable/other expression systems) suitable for ligand-target selection and/or ligand validation. In some embodiments, a ligand is a phage-only peptide to monitor or alter a selection process. According to methods described herein, ligands can be selected on any of a variety of bases, including for example on the basis of a particular affinity, specificity, or activity toward a receptor of interest. In certain embodiments, a ligand binds to a receptor with a K\nD \nof 1×10\n−6 \nM or less, 1×10\n−7 \nM or less, 1×10\n−8 \nM or less, 1×10\n−9 \nM or less, 1×10\n−10 \nM or less, 1×10\n−11 \nM or less, or 1×10\n−12 \nM or less. In certain embodiments, a ligand binds a receptor which is a channel, and inhibits an activity of the channel (e.g., ion transport) with an IC\n50 \nof 1×10\n−6 \nM or less, 1×10\n−7 \nM or less, 1×10\n−8 \nM or less, 1×10\n−9 \nM or less, 1×10\n−10 \nM or less, 1×10\n−11 \nM or less, or 1×10\n−12 \nM or less. In some embodiments, a ligand has specificity a particular receptor such that the ligand binds to the receptor and/or modulates an activity of the receptor with an affinity/potency that is at least twice, 4 times, 5 times, 10 times, 100 times, 1000 times as great as for another receptor in the same class. To give one example, in some embodiments, a ligand binds to one type of potassium channel, Kv1.3, with an affinity that is at least 10 or 100 times greater than its affinity for another potassium channel (e.g., Kv1.1 or Kv1.2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “receptor” (also referred to herein as a “target”) refers to a molecule, part of a molecule, chimera of more than one molecule or parts of it, or an assembly of molecules that serves as an interacting partner for a ligand. In some embodiments, a receptor is a receptor for a toxin peptide. In some embodiments, a receptor is a channel polypeptide. For example, receptors for toxin peptides include, but are not limited to, Ca\n2+\n channel, Na\n+\n channels, K\n+\n channels, NMDA receptor, alpha1-adrenoceptor, neurotensin receptor, Cl\n−\n channel, noradrenaline transporter, vasopressin receptor, acetylcholinesterase, endothelin receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor, GPIIb/IIIa integrin receptor, muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), neuronal-type nAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor, serotonin (5-HT) receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme. Antibodies and other specific molecular partners for toxin peptides are also defined as receptors. Receptors may be wild-type receptors or natural or synthetic variants of wild-type receptors. “Receptor” further refers to all protein families (types or superfamilies) that include at least one member (also known as subtype or isoform) that are receptors for toxin peptides. For example, a receptor subtype Kv2.1 K\n+\n channel has no known toxin peptide ligand, but at least one other member of the K\n+\n channel protein family (for example subtype Kv1.3) has a toxin ligand and therefore, members of the K\n+\n channel family in its entirety are considered “receptors.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “scaffold” is a structural element, or set of elements, that is common to a set of structurally related compounds. For example, a toxin peptide scaffold may include one or more particular amino acids located at particular positions along the polypeptide chain of a toxin. In some embodiments, a toxin peptide scaffold may include a specific number and arrangement of disulfide bridges. A scaffold can include a sequence having 50% or higher sequence identity with the toxin, or less that 50% identity if residues required for interaction with a receptor are the same or similar. In some embodiments, two toxins are said to share a scaffold if the toxins include a similar number of amino acid residues and cysteine residues found within the sequences having similar spacing. Alternatively or additionally, a toxin peptide scaffold may include one or more amino acids found at particular positions within a sequence element (typically at least 5-20 amino acids long) found in a toxin. In some embodiments, at least 50% of the amino acid residues in a given sequence element are scaffold amino acids. In some embodiments, at least 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more of the amino acids in a sequence element are scaffold amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substantial identity” of amino acid sequences (and of polypeptides having these amino acid sequences) typically means sequence identity of at least 40% compared to a reference sequence as determined by comparative techniques known in the art. For example, a variety of computer software programs are well known for particular sequence comparisons. In some embodiments, the BLAST is utilized, using standard parameters, as described. In some embodiments, the preferred percent identity of amino acids can be any integer from 40% to 100%. In some embodiments, sequences are substantially identical if they show at least 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical residues in corresponding positions. In some embodiments, polypeptides are considered to be “substantially identical” when they share amino acid sequences as noted above except that residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid changes. Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, aspartic acid-glutamic acid, and asparagine-glutamine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, one example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity is the BLAST algorithm, which is described in Altschul et al., 1977, Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402. BLAST is used, with the parameters described herein, to determine percent sequence identity for the nucleic acids and proteins of the present disclosure. Software for performing BLAST analysis is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (available at the following internet address: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always>0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always<0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) or 10, M=5, N=−4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff & Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:10915 (1989)) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=−4, and a comparison of both strands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin & Altschul, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:5873-5787 (1993)). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “toxin” refers to all peptides and/or proteins, of any amino acid length and sequence, in either monomeric or multimeric forms naturally, present in animal venoms or poisons and their non-venom homologues. Animal toxins include all molecules identified or inferred by any means (e.g., physical, chemical, biochemical, genetic, genomic, proteomic) from animal venoms or poisons, including but not limited to isolation from crude venoms, isolation from venom gland tissues or extracts, identification based on venom gland proteome/proteomics, venome/venomics, transcriptome, and/or EST analysis. In some embodiments, a toxin is a toxin from a venom or poison of a snake, snail, scorpion, sea anemone, lizard, or a spider. Representative toxins, and their amino acid sequences and source designations, are presented in Tables and Figures herein (e.g., Table 1, Table 2, Table 13, Example 20, \nFIG. 8\n, \nFIG. 9\n, \nFIG. 14\n, \nFIG. 15\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “toxin peptide”, as used herein, refers to polypeptides that have structural and/or functional similarity to one or more toxins (and includes such toxins). In some embodiments, a toxin peptide has an amino acid sequence that is substantially identical to that of a toxin. In some embodiments, a toxin peptide is less than 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20 or fewer amino acids long. In some embodiments, a toxin peptide is more than 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, or more amino acids long. In some embodiments, a toxin peptide is between about 20 and about 60 amino acids long. In some embodiments, a toxin peptide is between about 30 and about 50 amino acids long. In some embodiments, a toxin peptide has an amino acid sequence that includes a plurality of cysteines. In some embodiments, such cysteines are located at positions corresponding to \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 7 or 8, 13 or 14, 27 or 28, 32 or 33, and/or 34 or 35 of a toxin. In some embodiments, toxin peptides have an amino acid sequence that includes the following sequence: (X)\nm\nC(X)\nn\nC(X)\nn\nC(X)\no\nC(X)\nn\nCXC(X)\nm \n(SEQ ID NO:______), wherein X is any amino acid, and wherein m=2-10 amino acids, n=3-5 amino acids, and o=7-12 amino acids. In some embodiments, toxin peptides have an amino acid sequence that includes: (X)\nm\nKC(X)\nn\nQC(X)\nn\nCK(X)\no\nKCM(X)\nn\nCXC(X)\nm \n(SEQ ID NO:______), wherein X is any amino acid, and wherein m=2-10 amino acids, n=3-4 amino acids, and o=7-12 amino acids. In some embodiments, toxin peptides have an amino acid sequence that includes: XXXKCXXXXQCXXXCKXXXXXXXKCMXXXCXCXX (SEQ ID NO:______), wherein X is any amino acid. In some embodiments, a toxin peptide has an amino acid sequence that includes a plurality of sequence elements, each of which is found in a natural toxin. In some embodiments, a toxin peptide has an amino acid sequence that includes a plurality of sequence elements that are found in (or share substantially identity with sequence elements that are found in) a plurality of different natural toxins. In some embodiments, a toxin peptide has an amino acid sequence that includes at least two sequence elements that are found in (or share substantially identity with sequence elements that are found in) the same natural toxin, but further includes one or more sequence elements that are not found in the natural toxin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “transmembrane protein” refers to polypeptides that partially span a membrane and that completely span a membrane. A “transmembrane protein” refers to monomeric as well as multimeric proteins, including heteromultimeric proteins. A transmembrane protein can be a protein found on any membrane of a cell (e.g., a membrane of an intracellular compartment such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, an endocytic compartment, nuclear membrane, or a cell surface membrane).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “wild-type”, when applied to a polypeptide (e.g., a receptor polypeptide, or a toxin polypeptide) refers to a polypeptide whose primary amino acid sequence is identical to that of a polypeptide found in nature. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a wild type polypeptide is one whose amino acid sequence is found in normal (i.e., non-mutant) polypeptides.\n\n\n \nReceptors\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods described herein are applicable to any receptor, i.e., any receptor that can serve as an interacting partner for a ligand. In most embodiments, a receptor suitable for methods described herein is a receptor that serves as an interacting partner for a toxin peptide. In some embodiments, a receptor is a transmembrane protein. In some embodiments, a receptor is a channel protein. Exemplary receptors for toxin peptides may include, but are not limited to, ion channels (e.g., potassium, sodium, calcium, chloride, and non-specific ion channels), as well as other transmembrane proteins that are sensitive to toxin peptides, for example, neurotransmitter receptors (e.g., NMDA receptor, serotonin (5-HT) receptor, alpha1-adrenoceptor, muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), neuronal-type nAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor), receptors for endogenous peptides (e.g., neurotensin receptor, endothelin receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor, vasopressin receptor), noradrenaline transporter, acetylcholinesterase, GPIIb/IIIa integrin receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and G-protein coupled receptors that are and are not ion channels. Receptors also include amino acid transporters and integrin receptors (e.g., glycoprotein IIb/IIIa integrin receptors). Table 1 below provides a non-exclusive list of receptors, as well as exemplary toxin ligands for the receptors, and organisms in which the ligands are naturally expressed. Receptors that may be utilized in accordance with the present invention include wild type receptors and also receptor polypeptides whose amino acid sequences are substantially identical to wild type polypeptides. Furthermore, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, receptor polypeptides with various sequence modifications (e.g., fusions, substitutions, deletions, additions, rearrangements) as compared with a wild type receptor may be utilized if desired.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganism\n\n\nLigand (scaffold) name\n\n\nRepresentative receptor

receptors. In some embodiments, receptors are expressed in cells. In some embodiments, receptors are immobilized (e.g., immobilized on a solid support or in an artificial membrane). In some embodiments, receptors are purified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a receptor is a potassium channel. Potassium channels are mainly found in plasma membranes but are not generally distributed over the cell surface. Potassium channels catalyze the rapid permeation of potassium ions while rejecting biologically abundant potential competitors such as sodium, calcium and magnesium. Ion selectivity and high through put rate of potassium channels is accomplished by precise co-ordination of dehydrated potassium by the protein and multiple ion occupancy within the permeation pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll potassium channels carry out the formation of a transmembrane “leak” specific for potassium ions. Since cells almost universally maintain cytoplasmic potassium concentrations higher than those extracellularly, the opening of a potassium channel implies a negative ongoing change in electrical voltage across the cell membrane. This may result in termination of the action potential of electrically excitable cells including nerve, muscle and pancreatic beta cells. In non-excitable cells, potassium channels play important roles in the cellular potassium recycling required for electrolyte balance affected by the renal epithelium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a receptor is a voltage gated potassium channel belonging to the delayed rectifier class or Shaker potassium channel subfamily, which includes Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv1.4, Kv1.5, Kv1.6, Kv1.7, and Kv1.8. In some embodiments, a receptor is a potassium receptor of the Kv2, Kv3, Kv4, Kv5, Kv6, Kv7, Kv9, Kv9, Kv10, Kv11, or Kv12 family (see an exemplary list of such receptors in Gutman et al., Pharmacol. Rev. 57(4): 473-508, 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a receptor is a Kv1.3 potassium channel. Kv1.3 potassium channels are a voltage-gated receptors expressed in a number of tissues, including T lymphocytes. One exemplary a ligand for Kv1.3 channel is kaliotoxin (KTX). KTX, found naturally in the venom of at least one species of scorpions, is a peptidyl inhibitor of Ca(2+)-activated K\n+\n channels and voltage-gated K\n+\n channels Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3. KTX is a single, approximately 4-kDa, polypeptide chain. KTX displays sequence homology with other scorpion-derived inhibitors of Ca(2+)-activated or voltage-gated K\n+\n channels: 44% homology with charybdotoxin (CTX), 52% with noxiustoxin (NTX), and 44% with iberiotoxin (IbTX).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a receptor is a voltage-gated sodium channel. Sodium channels have important functions throughout the body. For example, Nav1.4 controls excitability of skeletal muscle. Nav1.5 controls excitability of cardiac myocytes. Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.6 are abundant in the central nervous system. Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 are expressed in sensory neurons and have a role in pain perception. Nav1.7 is broadly expressed in the peripheral nervous system and plays a role in the regulation of action potential.\n\n\n \nLigands and Ligand Libraries\n\n\n \n \n \nAmong other things, the present disclosure provides methods for identifying, characterizing, and/or detecting ligands for receptors. In various embodiments, ligands are toxin peptides (e.g., toxin peptides derived from an animal venom). Provided methods can include the use of libraries of toxin peptides to permit simultaneous screening of multiple candidate ligand species. Methods herein are applicable to identifying ligands that derive from (i.e., are structurally related to) any toxin. For example, methods are applicable to toxin peptides which are derived from toxins of organisms such as sea anemone (e.g., \nStichodactyla helianthus\n), scorpion (e.g., \nAndroctonus mauretanicus, Odontobuthus doriae\n), snakes (e.g., \nDendroaspis\n), spiders (e.g., tarantula), and snails.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxins that can serve as a scaffold for toxin peptides and libraries of toxin peptides include any of the toxins listed in a Table or Figure herein. For example, one or more of kaliotoxin, dendrotoxin, ShK toxin, hongotoxin-1, tarantula venom toxin vstx1, hanatoxin, fasciculin-2, dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP), sarafotoxin, \nOdontobuthus doriae \nOD1 toxin, \nThrixopelma pruriens \nprototoxin-1, \nThrixopelma pruriens \nprototoxin-2 can serve as a scaffold for generating a toxin peptide or library toxin peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nOdontobuthus doriae \nOD1 toxin is a ligand for voltage gated sodium channels. OD1 toxin has the following amino acid sequence:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: \n——\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGVRDAYIADDKNCVYTCASNGYCNTECTKNGAESGYCQWIGRYGNACWCI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKLPDEVPIRIPGKCR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThrixopelma pruriens \nProtoxin-1 ProTx-I toxin is a toxin for voltage gated sodium channels.

For example, in some embodiments, a toxin peptide has an amino acid sequence which includes one or more domains from one toxin, and one or more domains from one or more other toxins. In one example, a toxin peptide includes a first domain from a first toxin, a second domain from a second toxin, and a third domain from a third toxin. In some embodiments, a toxin peptide has an amino acid sequence of a natural toxin which has been altered such that the toxin peptide has an amino acid sequence with at least 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% sequence identity to the natural toxin sequence. Sequence alterations suitable for generation of toxin peptides include insertions, deletions, substitutions, rearrangements (e.g., inversions) and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, sequence alterations are introduced into a toxin sequence at random. In some embodiments, sequence alterations are introduced into a toxin sequence in a targeted manner (e.g., to vary residues within a particular domain). In some embodiments, sequence alterations are introduced at residues other than cysteine residues (e.g., to preserve disulfide bonding). In some embodiments, sequence alterations are introduced at residues other than cysteine residues and basic residues. In some embodiments, a toxin peptide has an amino acid sequence of a natural toxin which has been altered at residues that undergo posttranslational modifications. Any and/or all of these features can be used to generate a diverse library of peptides for screening and identifying novel ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, multiple toxins serve as a scaffold source for a single ligand, thereby providing combinatorial diversity to the range of ligand sequences that can be produced, screened, and utilized in a method described herein. A group of toxins suitable for use as a scaffold for a ligand (i.e., a “scaffold group”) typically has a similar number of amino acids, and a similar arrangement of disulfide bridges. Members of a scaffold group typically have a homologous three-dimensional backbone structure. Members of a scaffold group can have very different biological properties and structural variation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, members of a library include sequences that include cysteines spaced at intervals observed in a natural toxin, with variability in residues between cysteines. In certain embodiments, one or more additional residues found in a natural toxin sequence are conserved (e.g., basic residues known to be important for binding activity). In some embodiments, kaliotoxin-1 serves as a scaffold for a ligand or library thereof. In certain embodiments, members of a library include peptides that have cysteines spaced at intervals observed in kaliotoxin, i.e., the peptides include the underlined cysteines found in kaliotoxin-1: GVEINVK\nC\nSGSPQ\nC\nLKP\nC\nKDAGMRFGK\nC\nMNRK\nC\nH\nC\nTPK (SEQ ID NO:______). Such peptides have the following consensus sequence: XXXXCXXXXXCXXXCXXXXXXXXXCXXXXCXCXX (SEQ ID NO:______), wherein X is any amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, members of a library include peptides having additional residues conserved from the kaliotoxin-1 sequence, such as the underlined residues: GVEINV\nKC\nSGSP\nQC\nLKP\nC\nKDAGMRFG\nKCM\nNR\nKC\nH\nC\nTPK (SEQ ID NO:______). Such peptides have the following consensus sequence: XXXXXXKCXXXXQCXXXCXXXXXXXXKCMXXKCXCXXX (SEQ ID NO:______) wherein X is any amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, members of a library include peptides having still additional residues conserved from the kaliotoxin-1 sequence, such as the underlined residues: GVEINV\nKC\nSGSP\nQCL\nKP\nCK\nDAGMRFG\nKCM\nNR\nKC\nH\nC\nTPK (SEQ ID NO:______). Such peptides have the following consensus sequence: XXXXXXKCXXXXQCLXXCKXXXXXXXKCMXXKCXCXXX (SEQ ID NO:______) wherein X is any amino acid. Libraries can include peptides having residues conserved from other toxins, e.g., other toxins described herein, e.g., one or more toxins from Table 1 or Table 2, Table 13, Example 20, \nFIG. 8\n, \nFIG. 9\n, \nFIG. 14\n, or \nFIG. 15\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides a ligand that includes the following consensus sequence: IXVKCXXPXQCXXPCKXXXGXXXXXKCMNXKCXCYX (SEQ ID NO: ______), wherein X is any amino acid. In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides a ligand that includes the following consensus sequence: IXVKCXXPXQCXXPCKXXGXXXXKCMNXKCXCYX (SEQ ID NO: ______), wherein X is any amino acid. In some embodiments, the ligands specifically bind to a potassium channel. In some embodiments, the ligands inhibit a potassium channel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 2 provides an exemplary list of toxins that share a scaffold with kaliotoxin.\n\n\n \n

\nConus \nmarine snails are shown in \nFIG. 14\n, with disulfide bonding patterns indicated under each set of peptides (from French and Terlau, J. Med. Chem. 11:3053-3064, 2004). These \nConus \ntoxins target sodium channels. Another exemplary set of natural scaffolds that target sodium channels are shown in \nFIG. 15\n (from Mouhat et al., 378(Pt 3):717-26, 2004). Any of these toxins can be used to produce toxin peptides. Libraries of toxin peptides can be produced using methods described herein. In some embodiments, toxin peptides include cysteine at positions corresponding to cysteines found in the toxin(s). In some embodiments, toxin peptides include one or more basic residues corresponding to basic residues found in the toxin(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, members of a scaffold group used to produce one or more ligands includes kaliotoxin-1, charybdotoxin, and agitotoxin-2. This combination of toxins served as a source for the novel artificial ligand mokatoxin-1, as described in Examples herein. Mokatoxin-1 (also referred to as MK-1) is composed of A, B and C domains present in at least three different species of scorpions, for example \nButhus occitanus \n(AgTx2, domain A, North Africa), \nCentruroides elegans \n(Ce3, domain B, Central America), and \nLeiurus quinquestriatus \n(charybdotoxin, domain C, Middle East). As shown in \nFIG. 9\n, the sequence for mokatoxin-1 is INVKCSLPQQCIKPCKDAGMRFGKCMNKKCRCYS (SEQ ID NO: 1). Further novel neurotoxin-like sequences depicted in \nFIG. 9\n include \nmokatoxin\n \n \n \n—\n0422, TVIDVKCTSPKQCLPPCKAQFGIRAGAKCMNKKCRCYS (SEQ ID NO: 2), and \nmokatoxin\n \n \n \n—\n0516, TVINVKCTSPKQCLRPCKDRFGQHAGGKCMNGKCKCYPH (SEQ ID NO: 3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScaffolds are not limited to venom toxins. For example, certain non-venom peptides from mammals share a scaffold with venom toxins. Such peptides can be employed in a scaffold group to produce novel ligands in accordance with the present disclosure. To give one example, dendroaspis natriuretic peptide from mamba snake venom and human brain natriuretic peptide fall into a scaffold group. Derivatives and/or portions of these peptides can be synthesized and/or combined to produce novel ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands (e.g., toxin peptides) can be produced by any method. In some embodiments, a ligand is produced by recombinant expression in a cell. In some embodiments, a ligand is produced by peptide synthesis. In some embodiments, a ligand is produced by in vitro translation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands can be inserted into vectors for expression and/or library selection. In some embodiments, a library is presented in a protein array (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854; De Wildt et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 18:989-994, 2000; Lueking et al., Anal. Biochem. 270:103-111, 1999; Ge, Nucleic Acids Res. 28, e3, I-VII, 2000; MacBeath and Schreiber, Science 289:1760-1763, 2000; WO 01/98534, WO 01/83827, WO 02/12893, WO 00/63701, WO 01/40803 and WO 99/51773). In some embodiments, a library is presented on a replicable genetic package, e.g., in the form of a phage library such as a phage display, yeast display library, ribosome display, or nucleic acid-protein fusion library. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; Garrard et al. (1991) Bio/Technology 9:1373-1377; WO 03/029456; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,446. Binding members of such libraries can be obtained by selection and screened in a high throughput format. See, e.g., U.S. 2003-0129659.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a ligand may be inserted into a phagemid or phage vector, in-frame, to form a leader-linker-ligand-linker-coat protein construct (Clackson and Lowman, Phage display. Oxford University Press, 2004; Barbas et al., Phage display. A laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001). For example, \nFIG. 1\n schematically depicts KTX incorporated into a phagemid vector, in frame, fused by N and C-terminal linker sequences between the leader sequence and the phage coat protein III. Exemplary upstream and downstream leader amino acid sequences are AEGA (SEQ ID NO:______) and GSASSA (SEQ ID NO:______), respectively, and an exemplary coat protein is protein III or its truncated version. Phages can be grown, prepared, titered and stored (Clackson and Lowman, Phage display. Oxford University Press, 2004; Barbas et al., Phage display. A laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigand libraries for phage display can be generated by standard methods (Clackson and Lowman, Phage display. Oxford University Press, 2004; Barbas et al., Phage display. A laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001). In one example, ligand libraries for phage display with a combinatorial arrangement of ligand-domains are generated by designing overlapping or non-overlapping oligonucleotides corresponding to each individual domain. These oligonucleotides are phosphorylated, annealed, mixed in a desired combination and concentration and ligated into a phagemid vector with or without linker sequences to create a library by standard methods (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Vols 1-3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). For example, ligands may be composed by domains A1B1C1, A1B2C1, and A3B2C1, respectively. A combinatorial library of ligands in this representative example yields the pattern AnBnCn, where n is the i-th domain (for example, A2B1C3 is a novel ligand present in this library).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLibrary diversity is verified by sequencing or by other physical, chemical or biochemical means, either with or without statistical analysis, that is suitable to use for diversity verification. Domains can be defined by functional, structural or sequence properties and can be of any length and a domain can be present or absent. Domains can be singular or highly varied to expand diversity. Standard protocols of molecular biology may be employed (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Vols 1-3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a library includes toxin peptides (e.g., toxin peptides having sequences from one or more animal toxins). Toxin peptide libraries can include peptide animal toxins in their native or natural (wild-type) form or in any variation in amino acid sequence or may be comprised of DNA and/or RNA sequences encoding animal toxins. The library may contain toxins representing one or more scaffolds (also known as toxin-types or toxin families). For example, in some embodiments, a library includes toxin peptides from scorpion toxins, venom three-finger molecular scaffolds, or animal toxins that interact with K\n+\n ion channels irrespective of the toxin's scaffold and species origin. In some embodiments, a library includes all known toxins from a given species, or all known toxins from all species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, an animal toxin library may include toxins from one or more of sea anemone, scorpion, and snake. Sea anemone \nStichodactyla helianthus \nShK toxin is pharmacologically active and blocks Kv1.3 K\n+\n channels in mammalian cells when expressed on the phage. Scorpion \nAndroctonus mauretanicus \nkaliotoxin-1 is pharmacologically active and blocks Kv1.3 K\n+\n channels in mammalian cells when expressed on the phage. Snake venom toxin \nDendroaspis dendrotoxin \nis pharmacologically active and blocks Kv1.1 K\n+\n channels in mammalian cells when expressed on the phage (see \nFIG. 12\n, upper panel), while Camel VHH, a nonspecific-phage (see \nFIG. 12\n, middle panel) or phage buffer (see \nFIG. 12\n, bottom panel) cause no block.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a library is incorporated into a phage display system. In phage display, candidate ligands (e.g., toxin peptides) are functionally displayed on the surface of the phage and nucleic acid sequences encoding the ligands are enclosed inside phage particles. The functional display permits the selection of ligands that interact with a target or targets. A selection can be based on the ligand type (e.g., toxin type) and/or target biochemistry, pharmacology, immunology and/or other physicochemical or biological property. For example, a K\n+\n channel toxin can be identified by screening scorpion toxin library on a K\n+\n channel for binding to the channel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a toxin peptide library is constructed and maintained such that each toxin peptide is individually constructed and stored and can be mixed into the library in any desired combination for the test to be performed. In another example, two or more toxin peptides may be constructed in the same reaction and stored and used together.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA phage library can be transfected into \nE. coli \nor other suitable bacterial species, propagated and the phages purified. At this stage, ligands (e.g., toxin peptides) can be functionally expressed on the surface of the phage and physically linked to their respective genes inside of the phage particle. A library is brought into contact with a target. After incubation with the target, those phages that express a ligand with no or weak recognition for the target are washed away. The remaining ligands that interact with the target are dissociated and can be (i) genotyped to establish the ligand identity, or (ii) processed for one or more rounds of panning, or (iii) otherwise quantified and/or identified (e.g., ELISA, microbiological titering, functional testing).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA ligand library (e.g., toxin peptide library) may created by any known method. For example, a toxin library may be created by collecting peptides and/or nucleic acids encoding animal toxins and, if desired, non-venom homologues. Non-venom homologues include any molecule present outside of a venom gland or not used as a venom component but similar in sequence or structure to toxins. In applications employing phage display, N-terminal and C-terminal nucleotide sequences can be designed to join sequences for subcloning into a phagemid or other phage-display compatible vector. Overlapping or nonoverlapping DNA oligonucleotides are designed and synthesized for synthetic genes. This includes positive and negative DNA strands and N-terminal and C-terminal joining regions. The respective DNA oligonucleotide pairs (positive and negative strands) and sets are phosphorylated and annealed to create full length genes (e.g., genes encoding toxin peptides) with or without joining regions. Ligation into phagemid or other phage-display compatible vector is performed, for example using coat protein III as a fusion protein. Other suitable phage proteins may also be used. The sequences or genotypes can be confirmed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe strategy described above was used to produce a library of ligands. Amino acid sequences from members of the library are shown in \nFIG. 2\n. Seventy out of 120 (58.3%) sequences are scorpion K\n+\n channel toxin scaffolds. MAAE (SEQ ID NO:______) is the C terminal part of the signal peptide/secretion peptide-cleavage domain, position −4 to 0 relative to the toxin sequence. GSASSA (SEQ ID NO:______) is an N-terminal linker region, which was placed immediately following the toxin sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a linker sequence used to connect a ligand (e.g., toxin) sequence to a signal peptide and/or a coat protein of a phage (for phage display methods) and/or to any other domain is varied to optimize one or more of ligand expression, binding, or function. Varied sequences can be produced by any method. Table 3 below lists linker sequences generated by Kunkel mutagenesis. “STM” corresponds to a C-terminal portion of one exemplary signal peptide. This is followed by a variable linker sequence of five amino acids, and an “AAK” sequence, which is one example of an N-terminal sequence that can follow a linker segment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExemplary Linker Segments for Expression \n \n \n \nof Ligands\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSEQ ID\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSTM\n \n.....\n \nAAK\n \n \n \nNO:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n \n \n \nSTM\n \n \n \n \n \nADLHD\n \nAAK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n \nSTM\n \n \n \n \n \nASTEF\n \nAAK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \n \n \nSTM\n \n \n \n \n \nAVDGV\n \nAAK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n \n \n \n \nSTM\n \n \n \n \n \nCQPEL\n \nAAK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n \n \n \n \nSTM\n \n \n \n \n \nEQVDA\n \nAAK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6\n \n \n \nSTM\n \nGSDMH\n \nAAK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \nSTM\n \n \n \n \n \nHTDYT\n \nAAK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \nSTM\n \nLELTS\n \nAAK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n \nSTM\n \n \n \n \n \nLLTVP\n \nAAK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10\n \n \n \n \nSTM\n \n \n \n \n \nPLAGP\n \nAAK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11\n \n \n \nSTM\n \nSVSVS\n \nAAK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMethods of Identifying, Characterizing, and/or Detecting Ligands\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands (e.g., toxin peptides) can be evaluated for binding to a receptor or for modulating activity of a receptor by any available method.\n\n\n \nLibrary Screening\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following provides exemplary methods for screening a display library. The methods can also be modified and used in combination with other types of libraries, e.g., an expression library or a protein array, and so forth. Ligands (e.g., a library of toxin peptides having varied amino acid sequences) can be displayed on phage, e.g., filamentous phage. Library members having a desired degree of affinity for and/or activity toward a receptor of interest can be identified using immobilized or immobilizable receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a phage library is contacted with and allowed to bind to the target of interest. To facilitate separation of binders and non-binders in the selection process, it is often convenient to immobilize the receptor on a solid support, although it is also possible to first permit binding to the target receptor in solution and then segregate binders from non-binders by coupling the receptor to a support. Bound phage may then be liberated from the receptor by a number of means, such as changing the buffer to a relatively high acidic or basic pH (e.g., \npH\n 2 or pH 10), changing the ionic strength of the buffer, adding denaturants, adding a competitor, adding host cells which can be infected (Hogan et al., Biotechniques 38(4):536, 538, 2005), or other known means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, receptors are purified prior to ligand selection. For example, purified or partially purified natural, synthetic or semi-synthetic receptors, such as KcsA carrying the toxin binding domain of a mammalian K\n+\n channel Kv1.3, may be prepared and immobilized on a surface, such as a 96-well MaxiSorp (Nalgene Nunc International, Rochester, N.Y.) plate or comparable surface suitable for immobilization and panning.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, receptors may be expressed in cells. For example, cells may be stably or transiently transfected with one or more receptors can be utilized as expressed in native tissues (Clackson and Lowman, Phage display. Oxford University Press, 2004; Barbas et al., Phage display. A laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001; Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Vols 1-3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). In one example, HEK (mammalian human embryonic kidney) and COS cells expressing wild-type Kv1.3 or Kv1.3-PDZ domain chimera were employed, the latter target allowing a “double” panning (e.g., as a control or to enhance binding affinity) using phages expressing kaliotoxin-1 and/or PDZ-binder domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPanning may be performed by the binding of ligands to the receptors, followed by washes and ligand recovery. In one example, panning is performed according to standard methods of phage display (Clackson and Lowman, Phage display. Oxford University Press, 2004; Barbas et al., Phage display. A laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001). Panning may be repeated until the desired enrichment is achieved. In addition, libraries can be pre-depleted on surfaces or cells that contain no receptors or on a receptor where the putative ligand receptor domain may be directly or indirectly altered. Additionally, any and all conditions of panning may be varied, altered or changed to achieve optimal results, such as the isolation of a specific ligand. Panning variations include, but are not limited to, the presence of competing ligand(s), presence of excess target(s), length and temperature of binding, pre-absorption of the ligand library on one or more different receptor(s) or cells or surfaces, composition of binding solution (e.g., ionic strength), stringency of washing, and recovery procedures. Phages recovered from panning may be processed for further rounds of panning, functional analysis, and/or sequencing/genotyping to deduce the resulting ligands' amino acid sequence or biological properties (Clackson and Lowman, Phage display. Oxford University Press, 2004; Barbas et al., Phage display. A laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing ligand recovery, ligands of interest may be produced in native form by standard methods of peptide/protein synthesis/production (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Vols 1-3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989; Albericio, Solid-Phase Synthesis: A Practical Guide. CRC, 2000; Howl, Peptide Synthesis and Applications. Humana Press, 2005).\n\n\n \nCharacterization of Binding Interactions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding properties of a ligand (e.g., a toxin peptide) can be readily assessed using various assay formats. Techniques useful for evaluating binding of a ligand (e.g., a toxin peptide) to a receptor (e.g., a channel protein) include ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, Biomolecular Interaction Analysis, and the like. In some embodiments, binding interactions are analyzed using an ELISA assay. For example, the ligand to be evaluated is contacted to a microtitre plate whose bottom surface has been coated with the target receptor, e.g., a limiting amount of the receptor. The ligand is contacted to the plate. The plate is washed with buffer to remove non-specifically bound ligands. Then the amount of the ligand bound to the plate is determined by probing the plate with an antibody that recognizes the ligand. For example, the ligand can include an epitope tag. The antibody can be linked to an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase, which produces a colorimetric product when appropriate substrates are provided. In the case where a display library member includes the protein to be tested, the antibody can recognize a region that is constant among all display library members, e.g., for a phage display library member, a major phage coat protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA binding interaction between a ligand and a particular receptor can be analyzed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). For example, before or after sequencing of a display library member present in a sample, and optionally verified, e.g., by ELISA, the displayed ligand can be produced in quantity and assayed for binding the target using SPR. SPR or real-time Biomolecular Interaction Analysis (BIA) detects biospecific interactions in real time, without labeling any of the interactants (e.g., BIAcore). Changes in the mass at the binding surface (indicative of a binding event) of the BIA chip result in alterations of the refractive index of light near the surface (the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)). The changes in the refractivity generate a detectable signal, which are measured as an indication of real-time reactions between biological molecules. Information from SPR can be used to provide an accurate and quantitative measure of the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n), and kinetic parameters, including k\non \nand k\noff\n, for the binding of a ligand (e.g., a toxin peptide) to a target receptor (e.g., an ion channel). Such data can be used to compare different ligands. Information from SPR can also be used to develop structure-activity relationship (SAR). For example, if the ligands are all mutated variants of a single parental toxin or a set of known toxins, variant amino acids at given positions can be identified that correlate with particular binding parameters, e.g., high affinity and slow k\noff\n. Additional methods for measuring binding affinities include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and binding titrations (e.g., using fluorescence energy transfer). Other solution measures for studying binding properties include fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), NMR, X-ray crystallography, molecular modeling, and measuring bound vs. free molecules. Measurement of bound vs. free molecules can be accomplished with a KinExA instrument from Sapidyne Instruments Inc., Boise, Id.\n\n\n \nCharacterization of Biological Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition to, or instead of, receptor binding, biological activity of ligands can be characterized in methods provided by the present disclosure. Biological activities of ligands can be characterized by any available means. In some embodiments, a ligand is a toxin peptide and a receptor is an ion channel. In these embodiments, methods for assessing channel activity can be employed. Methods for assessing ion channel activity include, for example, assays that measure voltage, current, membrane potential, and ion flux.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, ligands are tested for activity toward recombinant or naturally expressed functional ion channels. Samples that include functional channels (e.g., cells or artificial membranes) can be treated with a ligand and compared to control samples (e.g., samples without the ligand), to examine the extent of modulation. Changes in ion flux may be assessed by determining changes in polarization (i.e., electrical potential) of a cell or membrane expressing a channel. In some embodiments, a change in cellular polarization is by measuring changes in current (thereby measuring changes in polarization) with voltage-clamp and patch-clamp techniques, e.g., the “cell-attached” mode, the “inside-out” mode, and the “whole cell” mode (see, e.g., Ackerman et al., New Engl. J. Med. 336:1575-1595, 1997). Whole cell currents can be determined using standard methodology (see, e.g., Hamil et al., PFlugers. Archiv. 391:85, 1981). Other assays include radiolabeled rubidium flux assays and fluorescence assays using voltage-sensitive dyes (see, e.g., Vestergarrd-Bogind et al., J. Membrane Biol. 88:67-75, 1988; Daniel et al., J. Pharmacol. Meth. 25:185-193, 1991; Holevinsky et al., J. Membrane Biology 137:59-70, 1994). In some embodiments, ligands to be tested are present in the range from 1 pM to 100 mM. Other methods for assessing a ligand's effects on ion flux are described in the Examples herein. In some embodiments, the ability of a ligand to modulate (e.g., inhibit) a non-target receptor is tested, in addition to its ability to modulate a target receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands can be tested to evaluate other types of biological effects, such as effects downstream of receptor activity. For example, Kv 1.3 channels are expressed in T lymphocytes. Inhibitors of Kv1.3 channels suppress T cell activation in vitro and delayed type hypersensitivity in vivo, and have immunosupporessive activity in animal models of autoimmunity (Beeton et al., 98:13942-13947, 2001; Koo et al., J. Immunol. 5120-5128, 1997). Accordingly, a candidate ligand for a Kv1.3 receptor can be evaluated for the ability to suppress T cell activation in vitro and/or T cell dependent pathologies in vivo. Assays appropriate for other ligand-receptor combinations would be apparent to one of skill in the art. Various exemplary effects of ligands that may be determined using intact cells or animals include transmitter release (e.g., dopamine), hormone release (e.g., insulin), transcriptional changes, cell volume changes (e.g., in red blood cells), changes in cell metabolism such as cell growth or pH changes, and changes in intracellular second messengers such as Ca\n2+\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands can be selected for their potency and selectivity of modulation of a target receptor. In some embodiments, a ligand is assayed for its potency toward a panel of receptors and an IC\n50 \nvalue is determined for each. A ligand that demonstrates a low IC\n50 \nvalue for the target receptor, and a higher IC\n50 \nvalue for other receptors within the test panel, is considered to be selective toward the target receptor. Generally, a ligand is deemed selective if its IC\n50 \nvalue is at least one order of magnitude less than the next smallest IC\n50 \nvalue measured in the panel.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions & Treatments\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also features compositions including novel ligands described herein. In some embodiments, a composition is a pharmaceutically acceptable composition that includes a novel ligand described herein. The pharmaceutical composition can include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary carriers include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. Preferably, the carrier is suitable for oral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, spinal or epidermal administration (e.g., by injection or infusion). Depending on the route of administration, the ligand may be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition can include a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, e.g., a salt that retains the desired biological activity of the ligand and does not impart any undesired toxicological effects (see e.g., Berge, S. M., et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1-19, 1977).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition may be in a variety of forms. These include, for example, liquid, semi-solid and solid dosage forms, such as liquid solutions (e.g., injectable and infusible solutions), dispersions or suspensions, liposomes and suppositories. The preferred form depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. Typical compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions, such as compositions similar to those used for administration of antibodies to humans. A common mode of administration is parenteral (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion). In one embodiment, the ligand composition is administered by intravenous infusion or injection. In another embodiment, the ligand composition is administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. In another embodiment, the ligand composition is administered orally. In some embodiments, the ligand composition is administered topically. In some embodiments, the ligand composition is administered transdermally. Pharmaceutical compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition including a ligand can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, dispersion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the ligand in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNovel ligands described herein can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art. For many applications, the route/mode of administration is intravenous injection or infusion. For example, for therapeutic applications, a ligand composition can be administered by intravenous infusion at a rate of less than 30, 20, 10, 5, or 1 mg/min to reach a dose of about 1 to 100 mg/m\n2 \nor 7 to 25 mg/m\n2\n. Alternatively, the dose could be 100 μg/Kg, 500 μg/Kg, 1 mg/Kg, 5 mg/Kg, 10 mg/Kg, or mg/Kg. The route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a ligand is prepared with a carrier that protects against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known. See, e.g., Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J. R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978. Pharmaceutical formulation is a well-established art, and is further described in Gennaro (ed.), Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20.sup.th ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2000 (ISBN: 0683306472); Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 7.sup.th Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers, 1999 (ISBN: 0683305727); and Kibbe (ed.), Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients American Pharmaceutical Association, 3\nrd \ned., 2000 (ISBN: 091733096X).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided by the present disclosure are kits that include a ligand described herein and instructions for use, e.g., treatment, prophylactic, or diagnostic use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the ligand, the composition of the kit can include other ingredients, such as a solvent or buffer, a stabilizer or a preservative, and/or a second agent for treating a condition or disorder described herein. Alternatively, the other ingredients can be included in the kit, but in different compositions or containers than the ligand. In such embodiments, the kit can include instructions for admixing the ligand and the other ingredients, or for using the ligand together with the other ingredients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA novel ligand described herein (e.g., a mokatoxin) can be administered, alone or in combination with, a second agent to a subject, e.g., a patient, e.g., a patient, who has a disorder (e.g., a Kv1.3-mediated disorder), a symptom of a disorder or a predisposition toward a disorder, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect the disorder, the symptoms of the disorder or the predisposition toward the disorder. The treatment may also delay onset, e.g., prevent onset, or prevent deterioration of a condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA therapeutically effective amount can be administered, typically an amount of the ligand which is effective, upon single or multiple dose administration to a subject, in treating a subject, e.g., curing, alleviating, relieving or improving at least one symptom of a disorder in a subject to a degree beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment. A therapeutically effective amount of the composition may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the composition is outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A therapeutically effective dosage preferably modulates a measurable parameter, favorably, relative to untreated subjects. The ability of a ligand to inhibit a measurable parameter can be evaluated in an animal model system predictive of efficacy in a human disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of ligand calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a ligand described herein is 0.1-20 mg/Kg, more preferably 1-10 mg/Kg. The compound can be administered by parenteral (e.g., intravenous or subcutaneous) infusion at a rate of less than 20, 10, 5, or 1 mg/min to reach a dose of about 1 to 50 mg/m\n2 \nor about 5 to 20 mg/m\n2\n. It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions (e.g., the supervising physician), and that dosage ranges set forth herein are only exemplary.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Uses\n\n\n \n \n \nNovel ligands described herein may be used in therapies for the treatment or prophylaxis of disorders mediated target receptors (e.g., Kv1.3 channels). Kv1.3 channels are a therapeutic target for immunosuppressants. Accordingly, novel ligands described herein that inhibit activity of Kv1.3 channels are useful in the treatment of immune disorders. In some embodiments, a novel ligand is used to treat autoimmune and/or chronic inflammatory diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosis, chronic rheumatoid arthritis, type I and II diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, biliary cirrhosis, uveitis, multiple sclerosis, graft versus host disease, graft rejection, and other disorders such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, bullous pemphigoid, sarcoidosis, psoriasis, ichthyosis, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, Reiter's syndrome, Behcet's disease, myasthenia gravis, encephalomyelitis, Graves opthalmopathy, psoriasis, neurodermitis and asthma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile various aspects and examples have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more examples and implementations are possible within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the disclosure is not to be restricted except in light of the attached claims and their equivalents.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nReference will now be made in detail to several examples. While the disclosure will be described in conjunction with these examples, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the claimed invention to such examples. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in the examples in order to provide a thorough understanding of the subject matter of the claims which, however, may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the description.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nLive Cells—Kv1.3 Cells vs. Vector\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one example, KTX was preferentially bound to HEK and COS cells expressing Kv1.3 channels vs. cells not expressing Kv1.3 (vector). As shown in \nFIG. 3\n, panning on Kv1.3 transfected cells compared to the vector cells enriches for KTX. “A” shows about a 10-fold enrichment of KTX when screened on COS cells transfected with Kv1.3 vs. the vector. 5×10\n11 \nphagemids were added to the cell cultures in “A.” “B” shows an approximate 20-fold enrichment of KTX when screened on HEK cells transfected with Kv1.3 vs. the vector. 5×10\n11 \nphagemids were added to the cell cultures in “B.”\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nLive Cells—KTX Ligands vs. Non-Specific Ligands\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another example, KTX was preferentially enriched when a mixture of non-specific and KTX ligands was panned on cells expressing Kv1.3 channels. As shown in Table 4, KTX was selected over non-KTX ligands when panning was performed on mammalian cells expressing Kv1.3 channels.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nINPUT\n\n\nOUTPUT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKTX phages/nonspecific phages (%)\n\n\n \n\n\nFold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculated\n\n\nActual\n\n\nKTX (%)\n\n\n \nEnrichment\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/90 \n\n\n7/93 (n = 30)\n\n\n30 (n = 30)\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/99\n\n\n5/95 (n = 20)\n\n\n26 (n = 20)\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/90 \n\n\n0/100 (n = 10) \n\n\n22 (n = 18)\n\n\nenrichment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the first input, the calculated ratio was 10 KTX phagemids per 100 phages. The actual ratio, averaged over 30 samples, was 7 KTX phagemids per 100 phages. After one round of panning, the output ratio increased to 30 KTX phagemids per 100 phages, resulting in a 4.3 fold enrichment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the second input, the calculated ratio was 1 KTX phagemid per 100 phages.

The third input shows enrichment of KTX, however the enrichment cannot be quantified due to no KTX phages being present in the 10 input samples.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nLive Cells—KTX-Like Ligands vs. Non-KTX-Like Ligands\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a further example, KTX-like ligands (e.g., having a KTX-like protein scaffold) were preferentially enriched when a mixture of non-specific and KTX-like ligands were panned on cells expressing Kv1.3 channels. A library of KTX-like ligands, with a calculated diversity of greater than 11,000, was created de novo. The library comprised approximately 8% KTX-like ligands and 92% non-KTX-like ligands. The library of ligands was screened on Kv1.3 receptors expressed in HEK and COS cells.

The input ligands per well are 10\n9\n, 10\n8\n, 10\n7\n. The ligands included: sarafotoxin S6b (upper panel \nFIG. 4\n), kaliotoxin-1 (KTX, middle row \nFIG. 4\n), no ligand helper phages (bottom row \nFIG. 4\n). The data, shown in \nFIG. 4\n, indicates specific binding of sarafotoxin S6b to anti-S6b, and KTX to KcsA-Kv1.3.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nDNP and Saratoxin S6b—Antiserum Reacts with Phages\n\n\n \n \n \nAs depicted in \nFIG. 5\n, \nDendroaspis \nnatriuretic peptide (DNP) and sarafotoxin S6b (S6b) ligands in a phage display system are preferentially selected on antiserum raised against DNP and S6b, respectively. Based on its structural similarity, S6b also selected, but in a lesser extent, on antiserum raised against endothelin. The controls included DX88 (a kallikrein ligand) and CVHH (a camel-Ag ligand). The \nnumber\n 8 or 9 following the ligand name, in \nFIG. 5\n, indicates 10\n8 \nor 10\n9 \nphages per reaction, respectively.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nMokatoxin-1, a Kv1.3-Specific Artificial Neurotoxin\n\n\n \n \n \nTo confirm that a natural animal venom neurotoxin can bind to a known Kv channel site when expressed on the surface of a phage particle, a phagemid was constructed with KTX of the scorpion \nAndroctonus mauretanicus \nencoded on the N-terminus and in-frame with phage coat protein III. As a control, a phage expressing a mutant toxin, DDD-KTX, was synthesized. DDD-KTX does not bind to KTX sites because three basic residues on the KTX interaction surface are altered to aspartate (R24D, K27D, R31D).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor each binding determination, 3 wells in a NUNC-Immuno MaxiSorp 96-Well plates were coated overnight at 4° C. with 1 ug of KcsA-1.3 or KcsA in 50 ul of 100 mM NaHCO\n3\n, 1 mM DDM, pH 9, then washed once with Tris-\nHCl\n 50 mM, \nNaCl\n 150 mM pH7.5 containing 0.1\n% Tween\n 20, 1 mM DDM (TBST). Wells were then blocked at room temperature with 200 ul of \nTris\n 50 \nmM NaCl\n 150 mM pH 7.5, 1 mM DDM, (TBS) containing 0.5% BSA, then washed once with TBST. For each well, 108-1010 phages were added in 50 ul of TBS containing 0.5% BSA and incubated on a rotary shaker at room temperature for 2 hrs. Following five washes with TBST, 50 ul of anti-phage antibody-peroxidase conjugated TBST with 0.5% BSA was added and incubated on a rotary shaker for 2 hours at room temperature, then washed 5 times with TBST and twice with TBS. Fifty (50) ul of 1 step turbo-TMB-ELISA was added and the reaction is stopped by 50 μl of 2M H\n2\nSO\n4 \nand the absorbency was read at 450 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in the ELISA assay of \nFIG. 6\n, KTX is able to express, fold and bind adequately when exposed on the phage surface as a fusion partner with protein III. KTX-phages bind to a purified potassium channel (KcsA carrying a segment of the Kv1.3 pore loop, KcsA-1.3) whereas KTX-phage did not bind to wild KcsA nor did DDD-KTX-phage bind to either KcsA-1.3 or KcsA. The data represented in \nFIG. 6\n is the mean and S.E. recorded from 3 wells. “A” shows Kaliotoxin-1 phage (fKTX) binds to KcsA-Kv1.3 but not to wild-type KcsA. “B” shows Inactive kaliotoxin-1 (R24D, K27D, R31D; fDDD-KTX) does not bind to KcsA-1.3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo demonstrate KTX-phages inhibit Kv1.3 channels, Kv1.3 channels expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were studied using whole-cell patch-clamp. Phagemids were applied at 1 nM and then washed out. Half recovery was achieved at ˜3 min wash time. Plasmids were transfected into cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were performed at 24 hr. Whole-cell patch-clamp was performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pCLAMP software (Molecular Devices, Union City, Calif.) at filter and sampling frequencies of 5 and 25 kHz respectively. Kv1.3 currents were evoked by 250 ms test pulses to 50 mV from −80 mV with a 5 second interpulse interval and studied in a bath solution comprising in mM: 1.3 CaCl\n2\n, 0.5 MgCl\n2\n, 0.4 MgSO\n4\n, 3.56 KCl, 0.44 KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 139.7 NaCl, 0.34 Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 5.5 glucose, 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Electrodes were fabricated from borosilicate glass (Clark, Kent, UK) and had a resistance of ˜5 MΩ when filled with a solution containing in mM: 136 KCl, 1 MgCl\n2\n, 2 K\n2\nATP, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. Electrodes were coated with Sigmacote (Sigma) prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 7\n, KTX-phage inhibits Kv1.3 channels. Application of 1 nM KTX-phage blocked currents by ˜35% and inhibition was reversed by half in ˜20 minutes on washing the cells with buffer without phage particles. Conversely, DDD-KTX-phage, phage expressing camel CVHH antibody fragments to an unrelated antigen or buffer used for the phage preparation did not suppress or augment channel currents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA phage-display library of the novel toxin scaffolds was designed based on the KTX family of scaffolds (\nFIG. 8\n). Thirty-six (36) known KTX family toxin sequences were aligned using the six conserved cysteine residues they employ to form three disulfide bonds. The sequences were thereby considered in three linear domains homologous to KTX residues G1-P12 (domain A), L15-G26 (domain B) and N30 to K38 (domain C). Toxins were then constructed from one linkage of one of 30 unique A domains, 22 unique B domains and 17 unique C domains present in the 32 parent toxins. Forward and reverse primers were synthesized for each 69 unique domains, phosphorylated and annealed. Ninety separate reactions were used to anneal domains (in each reaction was 1 A domain, 7 or 8 B domains, and 17 C domains in equimolar proportions). These were ligated into pAS62 phagemids and transfected into XL1 \nE. coli\n. Joining sequences between AB and BC were shared sites (in KTX these are Q13C14 and K\n27\nT28M29) leading to a calculated library diversity of 11,220 toxin variants including the 19 known toxins. Random genotyping of isolates confirmed expression of all domains and 68% toxin-bearing phage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe library was applied to KcsA-1.3 immobilized onto a solid-phase. Following two rounds of panning, 16.6% of the eluted phage was a single novel neurotoxin-like sequence composed of A, B and C domains from three different species of scorpions, shown in \nFIG. 9\n: \nButhus occitanus \n(AgTx2, domain A, North Africa), \nCentruroides elegans \n(Ce3, domain B, Central America), and \nLeiurus quinquestriatus \n(charybdotoxin, domain C, Middle East). The new toxin was named mokatoxin-1 (MK-1) and was not observed in control selective trials with KcsA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo confirm that isolation of MK-1 was specific, a 1:15,000 mixture of mokatoxin-1-phage and DDD-KTX-phage was applied to immobilized KcsA-1.3. Sixty percent of the phage isolated after two rounds of selection was MK-1 while all isolates recovered after two rounds on the KcsA control were DDD-KTX.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMK-1-phage particles were confirmed to bind specifically to KcsA-1.3 and also block Kv1.3 currents in mammalian cells. Thereafter, MK-1 was synthesized. As depicted in \nFIG. 10\n, application of the MK-1 to wild-type Kv1.3 channels expressed in \nXenopus \noocytes showed half-maximal blockade at 3 nM. The blocking of Kv1.3 by MK-1 is represented by filled circles; the blocking of Kv1.2 by MK-1 is represented by filled diamonds; and the blocking of Kv1.1 by MK-1 is represented by filled triangles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNotably, as shown in Table 8, the pharmacological profile of mokatoxin-1 (MK-1) was different than all three of its parent toxins and KTX. Whereas MK-1 blocks only Kv1.3 potently, KTX blocks Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3 and BK, AgTx2 blocks Kv1.1 and Kv1.3, Ce3 does not block Kv1.3 and CTX blocks Kv1.2, Kv1.3 and BK.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe demonstrated selectivity of MK-1 on Kv1.3 in respect of other K+ channels is one significant example of the power and utilization potential of the present method describing the creation of toxin libraries and their screening. Pharmacological selectivity (specificity) is one example of useful modifications (e.g., improving on existing toxins or toxin scaffolds) such residue alterations to improve target specificity, affinity, impact on receptor function, to attach cargo for delivery to specific cellular and molecular locations and/or similar new/useful properties.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChannel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\napproximate IC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nToxin\n\n\nKv1.1\n\n\nKv1.2\n\n\nKv1.3\n\n\nBK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMK-1\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n~680\n\n\n~3\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKTX-1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n~5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAgTX2\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n26.8\n\n\n0.004\n\n\n~1150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCe3\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n~366\n\n\n \nND\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nCTX\n \n \n \n \n\n\n1500\n\n\n5.6\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nKaliotoxin-1-Phage Specifically Binds to and Enriched on Animal Cells Expressing Functional Mammalian Wild-Type K+ Channel Kv1.3\n\n\n \n \n \nHEK cells were transfected with an expression vector carrying K\n+\n channel Kv1.3 (TEST) or with empty vector that does not code for any transmembrane protein (CONTROL). Transfection efficiency was monitored with cotransfection of gene encoding for the green fluorescence protein (GFP) and observing the fluorescence after 1-2 days following transfection. Under these conditions, functional expression of the Kv1.3 channel was verified by electrophysiological, biochemical, and immunological means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the peak expression time for Kv1.3 channels (1-2 days following transfection), cells were detached from the monolayer, washed and brought into contact with a calculated mixture of 2% KTX-phage:2% mokatoxin-1-phage:96% inactive kaliotoxin-1 (DDD-KTX)-phage. KTX and mokatoxin-1 are Kv1.3 specific scorpion toxins. DDD-KTX is a mutant variant of KTX that does not bind to or inhibit Kv1.3 channels. Following incubation of the cells with the phages, cells were subjected to wash to remove the unbound/weakly bound phages. The remaining bound phages were eluted from the cells and transformed into XL1 \nE. coli\n, and plated onto LB plates with antibiotic selecting for the phagemids. After 1 day, 16-20 colonies of transformed XL1 were randomly selected and genotyped to establish the relative ratio (i.e., its departure from the calculated initial input of 2:2:96%) of the three different phage species, before and after the 1st and 2nd rounds of panning.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKv1.3 specific KTX-phage was enriched from a calculated initial input of 2% to 40% (n=20) after the 2nd panning on Kv1.3 expressing cells, but not on vector transfected cells. In addition, Kv1.3 specific mokatoxin-1-phage was enriched from a calculated initial input of 2% (n=20) to 15% (n=20) after the 2nd panning on Kv1.3 expressing cells, but not on vector transfected cells. DDD-KTX-phage proportion decreased in the Kv1.3 expressing cells, while in the vector transfected cells, after the 2nd panning, this was the only species recovered in our sample (n=16).\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nIsolation of \nMokatoxin\n \n \n \n—\n0422, a Novel K\n+\n Channel Toxin, from a Toxin Phage-Display Library by Panning on Kv1.3 K+ Channels Expressed in Mammalian Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nHEK cells were transfected with an expression vector carrying K\n+\n channel Kv1.3 (TEST) or with empty vector that does not code for any transmembrane protein (CONTROL).

The KTX scaffold combinatorial library construction comprises a phage-display library of novel toxin scaffolds designed based on the KTX family of scaffolds. Thirty-six known KTX family toxin sequences were aligned using the six conserved cysteine residues employed by KTX to form three disulfide bonds. The sequences were thereby considered in three linear domains homologous to KTX residues G1-P12 (domain A), L15-G26 (domain B) and N30 to K38 (domain C).

Joining sequences between AB and BC were shared sites (in KTX these are Q13C14 and K27T28M29) leading to a calculated library diversity of 11,220 toxin variants including the 19 known toxins. One such toxin is mokatoxin\n—\n0422, whose amino acid sequence TVIDVKCTSPKQCLPPCKAQFGIRAGAKCMNKKCRCYS (SEQ ID NO: 2) is depicted in \nFIG. 9\n.

The remaining bound phages were eluted from the cells and transformed into XL1 \nE. coli\n. Transformed XL1 was (1) amplified overnight in liquid media in the presence of a helper phage and antibiotic to prepare a phage preparation (to used in subsequent rounds of panning), and (2) an aliquot of the transformed XL1 was plated onto LB plates with antibiotic selecting for the phagemid. The following day, 18-20 colonies of the plated XL1 were randomly selected and genotyped to establish enrichment on Kv1.3 cells versus control cells not expressing Kv1.3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElectrophysiological recordings were performed with \nmokatoxin\n \n \n \n—\n0422 to confirm blocking of Kv1.3 channels.

This toxin peptide has a large difference in affinity for other channels that are important targets for the kaliotoxin scaffold. Mokatoxin-1 is unique as compared to known natural toxins and their natural or point mutant homologs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo examine the effect of mokatoxin-1 on activity of potassium ion channels, cDNA encoding \nRattus \nKv1.1 (NCBI accession number NM\n—\n173095), \nRattus \nKv1.2 (NM\n—\n012970), Homo Kv1.3 (NM\n—\n002232), or \nMus \nBK (NM\n—\n010610) were subcloned into oocyte expression vectors based on PCR3.1 and pGEM. cRNA synthesis was performed with T7 polymerase and the mMessageMachine Kit (Ambion, Austin, Tex.) according to manufacturers instructions. cRNA concentrations were determined spectroscopically. For two electrode voltage clamp recordings oocytes were extracted from \nXenopus laevis \nand defoliculated with Collagenase Type 2 (Worthington, Lakewood, N.J.). Oocytes were maintained in ND91 solution containing 2 mM KCl, 91 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1.8 mM CaCl\n2\n, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Cellgro, Hemdon, Va.) and 0.1% Gentamycin sulfate (Gibco, Grand Island, N.Y.)) at 16° C. Stage V and VI oocytes were injected with 8 pg to 4 ng cRNA, and currents recorded 1 to 4 days later.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor dose-response measurements of toxin block of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, or Kv1.3 peak currents were recorded during a 500 ms step to 0 mV from a holding voltage of −100 mV, followed by a 200 ms step to −135 mV every 30 s. To determine the kinetics of toxin block oocytes were held at −100 mV and stepped to the test voltage of 0 mV for 100 ms followed by a 200 ms duration step to −135 mV every 2 s. BK currents were recorded during a 50 ms step to +60 mV from a holding voltage of −80 mV, followed by a 40 ms step to −100 mV every 3 s. The perfusion solution contained 2 mM KCl, 96 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1.8 mM CaCl\n2\n, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 0.1% fatty acid ultra-free BSA fraction V (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, Ind.).

Data in this example show that mokatoxin-1 blocks T cell activity at least as well as kaliotoxin. Experiments in this example were performed as described in 2008, J. Biol. Chem. 283, 14559-14570.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsolation and Culture of Human T Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman T cells purified from peripheral blood of healthy donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque for 15 min. This step was followed by negative magnetic cell purification according to the manufacturer's instructions (Human Pan T cells isolation kit, Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, Calif., USA) and purity of CD3\n+\n T cells was >96% as assessed by flow cytometry. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin, streptomycin, MOPS, 2-ME, and nonessential amino acids in a 5% CO\n2 \nincubator at 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α Secretion Assays\n\n\n \n \n \n \n10\n5 \nfreshly isolated CD3\n+\n T cells were activated using CD3/CD28 dynabeads (Dynal, USA) at a T cell:bead ratio of 1:1 in 200 ul of medium in 96 wells plate. Channel blockers diluted at different concentrations in PBS were added to the cells 1 h prior to stimulation (done in triplicate). After 16 h of activation cells were counted and supernatants analysed for hIL-2, hIFN-γ and hTNF-α by ELISA following the manufacturer's instructions (eBiosciences, San Diego, Calif., USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults: MK Toxin Inhibits Secretion of IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α by CD3/CD28 Activated T Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlock of the K\n+\n channels in T cells by mokatoxin-1 decreased immune functions including IL-2 and IFN-γ secretion after CD3/CD28 stimulation. Human CD3\n+\n T cells were stimulated with CD3/CD28 beads following incubation with different concentrations (from 0.1 to 100 nM) of MK and KTX. The activity of MK was compared to the activity of KTX that was previously described to block the channels (Beeton et al, JI 2001). \nFIG. 17\n shows that MK inhibits at concentration as low as 1 nM. At a concentration of 10 nM, IL-2 and TNF-α secretion were decreased by approximately 50%; there was no reduction of cell viability with concentrations as high as 1 μM (not shown). The data show that inhibition of cytokine secretion by MK was comparable to, or better than that seen with KTX.\n\n\n \nExamples 15\n\n\nMokatoxin-1 does not Alter Ileum Function\n\n\n \n \n \nKaliotoxin and related toxins block Kv1.1 and produce ileal contractions. In contrast, mokatoxin is selective and does not block Kv1.1 or cause ileal hyperactivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo show the selectivity of mokatoxin-1 for Kv1.3 K\n+\n channel subtype and to further demonstrate the pharmaceutical utility of mokatoxin-1, experiments were performed as described in Suarez-Kurtz et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 289 (3):1517-1222, 1999. These experiments use the spontaneous motility of guinea pig ileum as an organ-level assay to demonstrate K\n+\n channel subtype specificity. The effect of Kv1.1 or Kv1.2 blockers is to induce spontaneous twitches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, experiments were performed as described in Vianna-Jorge et al., Br J Pharmacol. 2003, 138 (1):57-62. These experiments assay the intraluminal pressure measurements of peristaltic activity of guinea pig ileum as an organ-level assay to demonstrate K\n+\n channel subtype specificity. The effect of Kv1.1 or Kv1.2 blockers is to lower the pressure threshold for initiation of the peristaltic waves and increase the frequency of these waves.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe classical kaliotoxin homolog Margatoxin at 10 nM, but not mokatoxin-1 (1-100 nM), induced twitches in the ileum strips (\nFIG. 18A\n). This is an effect mediated by Kv1.1 consistent with selectivity of mokatoxin-1 for Kv1.3 channels (not in ileum). Margatoxin, but not mokatoxin-1 induced a lowering of the pressure threshold for initiation of the peristaltic waves and an increase in the frequency of these waves (\nFIG. 18B\n). Ileum has Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 channels and block of either leads to contractions (as seen with all three toxins, margatoxin and kaliotoxin and agitoxin-2, J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1999, 289 (3):1517-1222). The effect by mokatoxin-1 on T cells but not ileum shows that it blocks Kv1.3 but not Kv1.1 or Kv1.2 channels in native tissues.\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nMokatoxin-1 Structure is Novel\n\n\n \n \n \nTo understand the basis for selectivity the three dimensional structure of mokatoxin, the structure was solved by solution NMR by the method described in Koide et al., J Mol Biol. 284 (4):1141-1151, 1998; and Karatan et al., Chem Biol. 2004, 11 (6):835-844, 2004. This analysis revealed that mokatoxin-1 and kaliotoxin-1 have similar, but not identical, scaffold structure as expected by the constraints of library design.\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nMokatoxin-2 and Mokatoxin-3: Kv Channel Blockers Selected on Cells with Novel Characteristics\n\n\n \n \n \nMokatoxin-2 and -3 were isolated from a library using cell-based panning where CHO cells were induced to produce intact human Kv1.3 channels on their surfaces. (By contrast, mokatoxin-1 was isolated on purified proteins in plastic dishes). These novel toxins are based on sequences found in the kaliotoxin family and exhibit different kinetics of inhibition compared to kaliotoxin-1, on which the library was designed, and to mokatoxin-1, a toxin peptide isolated using solid-phase panning.

No. 60/495,036, filed Aug. 14, 2003, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\n\n\nSTATEMENT AS TO FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH\n\n\nThis invention was made with U.S. government support under NIH grant CA92625. The government has certain rights in the invention.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention relates generally to methods and compositions for the regulation of apoptosis.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nProgrammed cell death, referred to as apoptosis, plays an indispensable role in the development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis within all multicellular organisms (Raff, Nature 356: 397-400, 1992). Genetic and molecular analysis from nematodes to humans has indicated that the apoptotic pathway of cellular suicide is highly conserved (Hengartner and Horvitz, Cell 76: 1107-1114, 1994). In addition to being essential for normal development and maintenance, apoptosis is important in the defense against viral infection and in preventing the emergence of cancer.\n\n\nDiverse intrinsic death signals emanating from multiple subcellular locales all induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to activate Apaf-1 and result in effector caspase activation. Proteins in the BCL-2 family are major regulators of the commitment to programmed cell death as well as executioners of death signals at the mitochondrion. Members of this family include both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and share homology in up to four conserved regions termed BCL-2 homology (BH) 1-4 domains (Adams and Cory, 1998). The family can be divided into three main sub-classes. The anti-apoptotic proteins, which include BCL-2 and BCL-X\nL\n, are all “multidomain,” sharing homology throughout all four BH domains. However, the pro-apoptotic proteins can be further subdivided and include multidomain proteins, such as BAX and BAK, which possess sequence homology in BH1-3 domains. The more distantly related “BH3-only” proteins are to date all pro-apoptotic and share sequence homology within the amphipathic α-helical BH3 region, which is required for their apoptotic function (Chittenden et al., 1995; O'Connor et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1996; Zha et al., 1997).\n\n\nMultidomain pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK upon receipt of death signals participate in executing mitochondrial dysfunction. In viable cells, these proteins exist as monomers. In response to a variety of death stimuli, however, inactive BAX, which is located in the cytosol or loosely attached to membranes, inserts deeply into the outer mitochondrial membrane as a homo-oligomerized multimer (Eskes et al., 2000; Gross et al., 1998; Wolter et al., 1997). Inactive BAK resides at the mitochondrion where it also undergoes an allosteric conformational change in response to death signals, which includes homo-oligomerization (Griffiths et al., 1999; Wei et al., 2000). Cells deficient in both BAX and BAK are resistant to a wide variety of death stimuli that emanate from multiple locations within the cell (Wei et al., 2001).\n\n\nThe BH3-only molecules constitute the third subset of this family and include BID, NOXA, PUMA, BIK, BIM and BAD (Kelekar and Thompson, 1998). These proteins share sequence homology only in the amphipathic α-helical BH3 region which mutation analysis indicated is required in pro-apoptotic members for their death activity. Moreover, the BH3-only proteins require this domain to demonstrate binding to “multidomain” BCL-2 family members. Multiple binding assays, including yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation from detergent solubilized cell lysates and in-vitro pull down experiments indicate that individual BH3-only molecules display some selectivity for multidomain BCL-2 members (Boyd et al., 1995; O'Connor et al., 1998; Oda et al., 2000; Wang et al., 1996; Yang et al., 1995). The BID protein binds pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK as well as anti-apoptotic BCL-2 and BCL-X\nL \n(Wang et al., 1996; Wei et al., 2000). In contrast, BAD, NOXA and BIM as intact molecules display preferential binding to anti-apoptotic members (Boyd et al., 1995; O'Connor et al., 1998; Oda et al., 2000; Yang et al., 1995).\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is based on the discovery that the BH3 domain from the BCL-2 family of proteins alone can function as a specific death ligand. The peptides are referred to herein as BH3 peptides.\n\n\nIn one aspect the invention provides an isolated peptide having a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 2 or 10. The peptide induces BAK oligomerization and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. In another aspect the invention provides an isolated peptide having a sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 3-9 or 11. The peptide binds BCL-2 or MCL-1. For example, SEQ ID NO:1-5 binds BCL-2. Alternatively, SEQ ID NO: 6 and 7 bind MCL-1.\n\n\nAlso include in the invention is a chimeric peptide having a first domain and a second domain. The first domain having and amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 1-11. The second domain having a translocation sequence which facilitates transport across a biological membrane. Examples, of translocation sequence includes polyarginine.\n\n\nIn another aspect the invention includes a nucleic acid encoding any one of the peptides of the invention.\n\n\nAlso included in the invention is a vector containing one or more of the nucleic acids described herein, and a cell containing the vectors or nucleic acids described herein.\n\n\nThe invention is also directed to host cells transformed with a vector comprising any of the nucleic acid molecules described above.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention includes a composition that includes the peptides of the invention and a carrier or diluent.\n\n\nIn yet a further aspect the invention provides methods of treating a cell proliferative disorder, e.g., cancer in a subject by administering to a subject a BH3 peptide.\n\n\nIn another aspect the invention includes a method of inducing apoptosis in a cell by contacting said cell with \n \n \nSEQ ID NOs\n \n \n 1, 2 or 10 such that apoptosis is induced. Alternatively, the invention provides a method of sensitizing a cell to apoptosis by contacting said cell with a composition comprising any of SEQ ID NOs: 3-7 or 11 such that as to sensitize the cell to apoptosis.\n\n\nA further aspect the invention includes a method of screening for an apoptotic sensitizer compound by contacting mitochondria overexpressing BCL-2 with a BID-like BH3 peptide to form a BCL-2-peptide complex and contacting the complex with a test compound. Cytochrome c release from the mitochondria is determined and compared to Cytochrome c release from the mitochondria not exposed to the compound. An increase of cytochrome c release in the presence of the test compound compared to the absence of the compound indicates the compound is an apoptotic sensitizer compound.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention relates to a transgenic animal containing a heterologous gene construct encoding a protein comprising BCL-2 protein, or a cell isolated from this animal. The gene construct is ubiquitously expressed. Alternatively, the gene construct is constitutively expressed. The gene constructs contain one or more regulatory sequences, such as a promoter. For example, the gene construct is under the control of an inducible promoter. The transgenic animal is useful for in vitro testing to determine the effect of a BCL-2 antagonist.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention relates to a method of using cell lines isolated from a transgenic animal in an in vitro assay to determine the inhibition of a BCL-2 protein, inhibition of an anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein family member or determine the effects or antagonist thereof.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention relates to a transgenic non-human animal containing a recombinant nucleic acid molecule stably integrated in its genome, where the recombinant nucleic acid molecule encodes a BCL-2 protein.\n\n\nIn a further aspect, the invention relates to a method for the production of a transgenic non-human animal, which includes introduction of a recombinant nucleic acid molecule into a germ cell, an embryonic cell, an egg cell or a cell derived therefrom, where the recombinant nucleic acid molecule encodes a BCL-2 protein.\n\n\nUnless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

The peptides which activate pro-apoptotic members are referred to herein as “BID-like BH3 peptides” (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, and 10) whereas the peptides that counteract anti-apoptotic members, are referred to herein as “BAD-like BH3 peptide” (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 3-7 and 11). The BID-like and BAD-like peptide are summarized below in Table 1 and are collectively referred to herein as BH3 peptides. Additionally, the invention provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions for treating pathophysiologies associated with apoptosis, e.g., cell proliferative disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC50\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(nM),\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\nK\nd\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK\nd\n(nM),\n\n\n \n\n\nBID\n\n\n \n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ\n\n\nBCL-2\n\n\nSD\n\n\nDisplace-\n\n\nSD\n\n\nHelicity\n\n\nMCL-1\n\n\nSD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAmino Acid Sequence\n\n\nID NO\n\n\nBinding\n\n\n+/−\n\n\nment\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n(222 nM)\n\n\nBinding\n\n\n(+/−)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBIDBH3\n \n \nEDIIRNIARHLAQVGDSMDR\n \n \n\n\n1\n\n\n220\n\n\n30\n\n\n838\n\n\n192\n\n\n19.5\n\n\n283\n\n\n11\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBIMBH3\n \n \nMRPEIWIAQELRRIGDEFNA\n \n \n\n\n2\n\n\n74\n\n\n2\n\n\nND\n\n\n—\n\n\n15.8\n\n\n79\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmBADBH3\n\n\nLWAAQRYGRELRRMSDEFEGSFKGL\n\n\n3\n\n\n39\n\n\n6\n\n\n173\n\n\n60\n\n\nND\n\n\n>2600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBADBH3\n \n \nNLWAAQRYGRELRRMSDEFVDSFKK\n \n \n\n\n4\n\n\n41\n\n\n11\n\n\nND\n\n\n—\n\n\n23.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBIKBH3\n \n \nMEGSDALALRLACIGDEMDV\n \n \n\n\n5\n\n\n485\n\n\n272\n\n\n4920\n\n\n1648\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOXAABH3\n \n \nAELPPEFAAQLRKIGDKVYC\n \n \n\n\n6\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n—\n\n\n>30,000\n\n\n—\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n752\n\n\n334\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOXABBH3\n \n \nPADLKDECAQLRRIGDKVNL\n \n \n\n\n7\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n—\n\n\n>30,000\n\n\n—\n\n\n11.6\n\n\n829\n\n\n149\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBCLXBH3\n\n\nVIPMAAVKQALREAGDEFEL\n\n\n8\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n—\n\n\n>30,000\n\n\n—\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIDBH3 mut\n\n\nEDIIRNIARHAAQVGASMDR\n\n\n9\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n—\n\n\n>30,000\n\n\n—\n\n\n16.4\n\n\n>2600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBID-\nlike\n \n \nXXXXXXIAXXLXXXGDXXXX\n \n \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBAD-like\n\n\nXXXXXXXXXXLXXXXDXXXX\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBH3 Peptides\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides a BH3 peptide. No particular length is implied by the term “peptide”. In some embodiments, the BH3 peptide is less than 195 amino acids in length, e.g., less than or equal to 150, 100, 75, 50, 35, 25 or 15 amino acid in length. For example a BH3 peptide includes the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1-11. In various embodiments, the BH3 peptide includes the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1-2 or 10 where the peptide induces BAK oligomerization and cytochrome c mobilization (e.g., release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria). By BAK oligomerization is meant that the BH3 peptide induces the formation of BAK oligomers, e.g., dimers, trimers, etc. The oligomers are hetero-oligomers. Alternatively, the oligomers are homo-oligomers. In a further embodiment, the BH3 peptide stimulates apoptosis, e.g., programmed cell death. Alternatively the BH3 peptides includes the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3-5 or 11, where the peptide binds BCL-2 or other anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family of proteins. Alternatively the BH3 peptides includes the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or 7, where the peptide binds MCL-1 or other anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family of proteins. (See, Table 1).\n\n\nExamples of BID-like BH3 peptides include a peptide which includes (in whole or in part) the sequence \nNH\n \n2\n— XXXXXXIAXXLXXXGDXXXX\n—COOH \n(SEQ ID NO:10). Examples of BAD-like BH3 peptides includes (in whole or in part) the sequence \nNH\n \n2\n— XXXXXXXXXXLXXXXDXXXX\n—COOH \n(SEQ ID NO:11). As used herein X may be any amino acid. Alternatively, the BID-like or BAD-like BH3 peptides include at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15 or more amino acids of SEQ ID NO:10 or SEQ ID NO:11)\n\n\nThe BH3 peptides can be polymers of L-amino acids, D-amino acids, or a combination of both. For example, in various embodiments, the peptides are D retro-inverso peptides. The term “retro-inverso isomer” refers to an isomer of a linear peptide in which the direction of the sequence is reversed and the chirality of each amino acid residue is inverted. See, e.g., Jameson et al., \nNature, \n368, 744-746 (1994); Brady et al., \nNature, \n368, 692-693 (1994). The net result of combining D-enantiomers and reverse synthesis is that the positions of carbonyl and amino groups in each amide bond are exchanged, while the position of the side-chain groups at each alpha carbon is preserved. Unless specifically stated otherwise, it is presumed that any given L-amino acid sequence of the invention may be made into an D retro-inverso peptide by synthesizing a reverse of the sequence for the corresponding native L-amino acid sequence.\n\n\nAlternatively, the BH3 peptides are cyclic peptides. BH3 cyclic peptide are prepared by methods known in the art. For example, macrocyclization is often accomplished by forming an amide bond between the peptide N- and C-termini, between a side chain and the N- or C-terminus [e.g., with K\n3\nFe(CN)\n6 \nat pH 8.5] (Samson et al., \nEndocrinology, \n137: 5182-5185 (1996)), or between two amino acid side chains. See, e.g., DeGrado, \nAdv Protein Chem, \n39: 51-124 (1988).\n\n\nPreparation of BH3 Peptide\n\n\nBH3 peptides are easily prepared using modern cloning techniques, or may be synthesized by solid state methods or by site-directed mutagenesis. A BH3 peptide may include dominant negative forms of a polypeptide. In one embodiment, native BH3 peptides can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In another embodiment, BH3 polypeptides are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, BH3 peptides can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques.\n\n\nAn “isolated” or “purified” protein or biologically active portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the BH3 peptide is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language “substantially free of cellular material” includes preparations of BH3 peptides in which the protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. In one embodiment, the language “substantially free of cellular material” includes preparations of BH3 peptides having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of non-BH3 peptide (also referred to herein as a “contaminating protein”), more preferably less than about 20% of non-BH3 peptide, still more preferably less than about 10% of non-BH3 peptide, and most preferably less than about 5% non-BH3 peptide. When the BH3 peptide or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation.\n\n\nThe language “substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals” includes preparations of BH3 peptides in which the protein is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals that are involved in the synthesis of the protein. In one embodiment, the language “substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals” includes preparations of BH3 peptides having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-BH3 peptide chemicals, more preferably less than about 20% chemical precursors or non-BH3 peptide chemicals, still more preferably less than about 10% chemical precursors or non-BH3 peptide chemicals, and most preferably less than about 5% chemical precursors or non-BH3 peptide chemicals.\n\n\nThe term “biologically equivalent” is intended to mean that the compositions of the present invention are capable of demonstrating some or all of the same apoptosis modulating effects, i.e., release of cytocrome c or BAK oligomerization although not necessarily to the same degree as the BH3 polypeptide deduced from sequences identified from cDNA libraries of human, rat or mouse origin or produced from recombinant expression symptoms.\n\n\nPercent conservation is calculated from the above alignment by adding the percentage of identical residues to the percentage of positions at which the two residues represent a conservative substitution (defined as having a log odds value of greater than or equal to 0.3 in the PAM250 residue weight table). Conservation is referenced to sequences as indicated above for identity comparisons. Conservative amino acid changes satisfying this requirement are: R-K; E-D, Y-F, L-M; V-I, Q-H.\n\n\nBH3 peptides can also include derivatives of BH3 peptides which are intended to include hybrid and modified forms of BH3 peptides including fusion proteins and BH3 peptide fragments and hybrid and modified forms in which certain amino acids have been deleted or replaced and modifications such as where one or more amino acids have been changed to a modified amino acid or unusual amino acid and modifications such as glycosylation so long as the hybrid or modified form retains the biological activity of BH3 peptides. By retaining the biological activity, it is meant that cell death is induced by the BH3 polypeptide, although not necessarily at the same level of potency as that of the naturally-occurring BH3 polypeptide identified for human or mouse and that can be produced, for example, recombinantly. The terms induced and stimulated are used interchangeably throughout the specification.\n\n\nPreferred variants are those that have conservative amino acid substitutions made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a BH3 polypeptide is replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a BH3 coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened to identify mutants that retain activity.\n\n\nAlso included within the meaning of substantially homologous is any BH3 peptide which may be isolated by virtue of cross-reactivity with antibodies to the BH3 peptide described herein or whose encoding nucleotide sequences including genomic DNA, mRNA or cDNA may be isolated through hybridization with the complementary sequence of genomic or subgenomic nucleotide sequences or cDNA of the BH3 peptides herein or fragments thereof.\n\n\nChimeric and Fusion Proteins\n\n\nThe invention also provides BH3 chimeric or fusion proteins. As used herein, a BH3 or BID mutein “chimeric protein” or “fusion protein” comprises a BH3 or BID mutein polypeptide operatively linked to a non-BH3 polypeptide. An “BH3 peptide” refers to a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence corresponding to a BH3 peptide whereas a “non-BH3 peptide refers to a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence corresponding to a protein that is not substantially homologous to the BH3 peptide, e.g., a protein that is different from the BH3 peptide and that is derived from the same or a different organism. Within a BH3 peptide the BH3 peptide can correspond to all or a portion of a BH3 peptide. In one embodiment, a BH3 peptide fusion protein comprises at least one biologically active portion of a BH3 peptide. In another embodiment, a BH3 peptide fusion protein comprises at least two biologically active portions of a BH3 peptide. Within the fusion protein, the term “operatively linked” is intended to indicate that the BH3 peptide and the non-BH3 peptide are fused in-frame to each other. The non-BH3 peptide can be fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the BH3 peptide.\n\n\nFor example, in on aspect the invention provides a chimeric peptide that include a first domain containing BH3 peptide operably linked to a second domain containing a translocation sequence\n\n\nA “translocation sequence” refers to any sequence of amino acids that directs a peptide in which it is present to a desired cellular destination. For example the translocation sequence is polyarginine. Thus, the translocation sequence can direct or facilitate penetration of the peptide across a biological membrane, e.g., a phospholipid membrane, mitochondrial membrane, or nuclear membrane. For example the translocation sequence directs the peptide from outside the cell, through the plasma membrane, and into the cytoplasm or to a desired location within the cell, e.g., the nucleus, the ribosome, the mitochondria, the ER, a lysosome, or peroxisome. Alternatively, or in addition, the translocation sequence can direct the peptide across a physiological barrier such as the blood-brain barrier, the trans-mucosal barrier, or the hematoencephalic, hematoretinal, gastrointestinal and pulmonary barriers.\n\n\nAlternatively, a BH3 peptide fusion protein comprises a BH3 peptide operably linked to the extracellular domain of a second protein. Such fusion proteins can be further utilized in screening assays for compounds that modulate BH3 peptide activity (such assays are described in detail below).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the fusion protein is a GST-BH3 peptide fusion protein in which the BH3 peptide sequences are fused to the C-terminus of the GST (i.e., glutathione S-transferase) sequences. Such fusion proteins can facilitate the purification of recombinant BH3 peptide.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the fusion protein is a BH3 peptide-immunoglobulin fusion protein in which the BH3 peptide sequences comprising one or more domains are fused to sequences derived from a member of the immunoglobulin protein family. The BH3 peptide-immunoglobulin fusion proteins of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a subject to inhibit an interaction between a BH3 peptide ligand and a BH3 peptide on the surface of a cell, to thereby suppress BH3 peptide-mediated signal transduction in vivo. In one nonlimiting example, a contemplated BH3 peptide ligand of the invention is a VHL polypeptide. The BH3 peptide-immunoglobulin fusion proteins can be used to affect the bioavailability of a BH3 peptide cognate ligand. Inhibition of the BID α6 peptide ligand/BH3 peptide interaction may be useful therapeutically for both the treatment of proliferative disorders, as well as modulating (e.g., inducing or inhibiting) cell survival or apoptosis. For example, inhibition of the BH3 peptide ligand/BH3 peptide can be used to various disorders as described herein. Moreover, the BH3 peptide-immunoglobulin fusion proteins of the invention can be used as immunogens to produce anti-BH3 antibodies in a subject, to purify BH3 peptide ligands, and in screening assays to identify molecules that inhibit the interaction of BH3 peptide with a BH3 peptide ligand.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the fusion protein is a BH3 peptide-basic charged domain fusion protein in which the BH3 peptide sequences comprising one or more domains are fused to a basic peptide domain. The BH3 peptide-basic charged domain fusion proteins of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a subject to inhibit an interaction between a BH3 peptide ligand and a BH3 peptide in a cell, to thereby suppress BH3 peptide-mediated signal transduction in vivo. Several examples of biologically active fusion proteins, comprising basic peptide domains, for direct delivery of proteins into human patients in the context of protein therapy are known in the art, including, but not limited to, the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) TAT protein, HIV-1 Rev protein, \nDrosophila Antennapedia \nor HIV-1 octaarginine protein. These basic peptide domains can be arginine-rich. These transducing proteins have been shown to have a membrane permeability and a carrier function for the delivery of proteins to the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells, both in vivo and in vitro. These cells can be mammalian cells (i.e. human cells) (Suzuki et al., J Biol Chem 276: 5836-40, 2001 and Suzuki et al., J Biol Chem 277: 2437-43, 2002).\n\n\nA BH3 chimeric or fusion protein of the invention can be produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques. For example, DNA fragments coding for the different polypeptide sequences are ligated together in-frame in accordance with conventional techniques, e.g., by employing blunt-ended or stagger-ended termini for ligation, restriction enzyme digestion to provide for appropriate termini, filling-in of cohesive ends as appropriate, alkaline phosphatase treatment to avoid undesirable joining, and enzymatic ligation. In another embodiment, the fusion gene can be synthesized by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively, PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers that give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments that can subsequently be annealed and reamplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence (see, for example, Ausubel et al. (Eds.) C\nURRENT \nP\nROTOCOLS IN \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY\n, John Wiley & Sons, 1992). Moreover, many expression vectors are commercially available that already encode a fusion moiety (e.g., a GST polypeptide). A BH3 peptide-encoding nucleic acid can be cloned into such an expression vector such that the fusion moiety is linked in-frame to the BH3 peptide.\n\n\nBH3 Nucleic Acids\n\n\nThe present invention additionally relates to nucleic acids that encode BH3 peptide. Nucleic acids encoding the BH3 peptides may be obtained by any method known in the art (e.g., by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3′- and 5′-termini of the sequence and/or by cloning from a cDNA or genomic library using an oligonucleotide sequence specific for the given gene sequence).\n\n\nFor recombinant expression of one or more BH3 peptides, the nucleic acid containing all or a portion of the nucleotide sequence encoding the peptide may be inserted into an appropriate expression vector (i.e., a vector that contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted peptide coding sequence). In some embodiments, the regulatory elements are heterologous (i.e., not the native gene promoter). Alternately, the necessary transcriptional and translational signals may also be supplied by the native promoter for the genes and/or their flanking regions.\n\n\nA variety of host-vector systems may be utilized to express the peptide coding sequence(s). These include, but are not limited to: (i) mammalian cell systems that are infected with vaccinia virus, adenovirus, and the like; (ii) insect cell systems infected with baculovirus and the like; (iii) yeast containing yeast vectors or (iv) bacteria transformed with bacteriophage, DNA, plasmid DNA, or cosmid DNA. Depending upon the host-vector system utilized, any one of a number of suitable transcription and translation elements may be used.\n\n\nPromoter/enhancer sequences within expression vectors may utilize plant, animal, insect, or fungus regulatory sequences, as provided in the invention. For example, promoter/enhancer elements can be used from yeast and other fungi (e.g., the GAL4 promoter, the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter, the phosphoglycerol kinase promoter, the alkaline phosphatase promoter). Alternatively, or in addition, they may include animal transcriptional control regions, e.g., (i) the insulin gene control region active within pancreatic α-cells (see, e.g., Hanahan, et al., 1985. \nNature \n315: 115-122); (ii) the immunoglobulin gene control region active within lymphoid cells (see, e.g., Grosschedl, et al., 1984. \nCell \n38: 647-658); (iii) the albumin gene control region active within liver (see, e.g., Pinckert, et al., 1987. \nGenes and Dev \n1: 268-276; (iv) the myelin basic protein gene control region active within brain oligodendrocyte cells (see, e.g., Readhead, et al., 1987. \nCell \n48: 703-712); and (v) the gonadotropin-releasing hormone gene control region active within the hypothalamus (see, e.g., Mason, et al., 1986. \nScience \n234: 1372-1378), and the like.\n\n\nExpression vectors or their derivatives include, e.g. human or animal viruses (e.g., vaccinia virus or adenovirus); insect viruses (e.g., baculovirus); yeast vectors; bacteriophage vectors (e.g., lambda phage); plasmid vectors and cosmid vectors. A host cell strain may be selected that modulates the expression of inserted sequences of interest, or modifies or processes expressed peptides encoded by the sequences in the specific manner desired. In addition, expression from certain promoters may be enhanced in the presence of certain inducers in a selected host strain; thus facilitating control of the expression of a genetically-engineered peptides. Moreover, different host cells possess characteristic and specific mechanisms for the translational and post-translational processing and modification (e.g., glycosylation, phosphorylation, and the like) of expressed peptides. Appropriate cell lines or host systems may thus be chosen to ensure the desired modification and processing of the foreign peptide is achieved. For example, peptide expression within a bacterial system can be used to produce an unglycosylated core peptide; whereas expression within mammalian cells ensures “native” glycosylation of a heterologous peptide.\n\n\nAlso included in the invention are derivatives, fragments, homologs, analogs and variants of BH3 peptides and nucleic acids encoding these peptides. For nucleic acids, derivatives, fragments, and analogs provided herein are defined as sequences of at least 6 (contiguous) nucleic acids, and which have a length sufficient to allow for specific hybridization. For amino acids, derivatives, fragments, and analogs provided herein are defined as sequences of at least 4 (contiguous) amino acids, a length sufficient to allow for specific recognition of an epitope.\n\n\nThe length of the fragments is less than the length of the corresponding full-length nucleic acid or polypeptide from which the BH3 peptides s, or nucleic acid encoding same, is derived. Derivatives and analogs may be full length or other than full length, if the derivative or analog contains a modified nucleic acid or amino acid. Derivatives or analogs of the BH3 peptides include, e.g., molecules including regions that are substantially homologous to the peptides, in various embodiments, by at least about 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, or 95%, 98%, or even 99%, identity over an amino acid sequence of identical size or when compared to an aligned sequence in which the alignment is done by a computer homology program known in the art. For example sequence identity can be measured using sequence analysis software (Sequence Analysis Software Package of the Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, 1710 University Avenue, Madison, Wis. 53705), with the default parameters therein.\n\n\nIn the case of polypeptide sequences, which are less than 100% identical to a reference sequence, the non-identical positions are preferably, but not necessarily, conservative substitutions for the reference sequence. Conservative substitutions typically include substitutions within the following groups: glycine and alanine; valine, isoleucine, and leucine; aspartic acid and glutamic acid; asparagine and glutamine; serine and threonine; lysine and arginine; and phenylalanine and tyrosine. Thus, included in the invention are peptides having mutated sequences such that they remain homologous, e.g. in sequence, in function, and in antigenic character or other function, with a protein having the corresponding parent sequence. Such mutations can, for example, be mutations involving conservative amino acid changes, e.g., changes between amino acids of broadly similar molecular properties. For example, interchanges within the aliphatic group alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine can be considered as conservative. Sometimes substitution of glycine for one of these can also be considered conservative. Other conservative interchanges include those within the aliphatic group aspartate and glutamate; within the amide group asparagine and glutamine; within the hydroxyl group serine and threonine; within the aromatic group phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan; within the basic group lysine, arginine and histidine; and within the sulfur-containing group methionine and cysteine. Sometimes substitution within the group methionine and leucine can also be considered conservative. Preferred conservative substitution groups are aspartate-glutamate; asparagine-glutamine; valine-leucine-isoleucine; alanine-valine; phenylalanine-tyrosine; and lysine-arginine.\n\n\nWhere a particular polypeptide is said to have a specific percent identity to a reference polypeptide of a defined length, the percent identity is relative to the reference peptide. Thus, a peptide that is 50% identical to a reference polypeptide that is 100 amino acids long can be a 50 amino acid polypeptide that is completely identical to a 50 amino acid long portion of the reference polypeptide. It might also be a 100 amino acid long polypeptide, which is 50% identical to the reference polypeptide over its entire length. Of course, other polypeptides will meet the same criteria.\n\n\nThe invention also encompasses allelic variants of the disclosed polynucleotides or peptides; that is, naturally-occurring alternative forms of the isolated polynucleotide that also encode peptides that are identical, homologous or related to that encoded by the polynucleotides. Alternatively, non-naturally occurring variants may be produced by mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis.\n\n\nSpecies homologs of the disclosed polynucleotides and peptides are also provided by the present invention. “Variant” refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide differing from the polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention, but retaining essential properties thereof. Generally, variants are overall closely similar, and in many regions, identical to the polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention. The variants may contain alterations in the coding regions, non-coding regions, or both.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, altered sequences include insertions such that the overall amino acid sequence is lengthened while the protein retains trafficking properties. Additionally, altered sequences may include random or designed internal deletions that shorten the overall amino acid sequence while the protein retains transport properties.\n\n\nThe altered sequences can additionally or alternatively be encoded by polynucleotides that hybridize under stringent conditions with the appropriate strand of the naturally-occurring polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide or peptide from which the BH3 peptide is derived. The variant peptide can be tested for BH3 peptide-binding and modulation of BH3 peptide-mediated activity using the herein described assays. ‘Stringent conditions’ are sequence dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Generally, stringent conditions can be selected to be about 5° C. lower than the thermal melting point (T\nM\n) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The T\nM \nis the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is at least about 0.02 molar at \npH\n 7 and the temperature is at least about 60° C. As other factors may affect the stringency of hybridization (including, among others, base composition and size of the complementary strands), the presence of organic solvents and the extent of base mismatching, the combination of parameters is more important than the absolute measure of any one.\n\n\nHigh stringency can include, e.g., Step 1: Filters containing DNA are pretreated for 8 hours to overnight at 65° C. in buffer composed of 6×SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% BSA, and 500 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Step 2: Filters are hybridized for 48 hours at 65° C. in the above prehybridization mixture to which is added 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 5−20×10\n6 \ncpm of \n32\nP-labeled probe. Step 3: Filters are washed for 1 hour at 37° C. in a solution containing 2×SSC, 0.01% PVP, 0.01% Ficoll, and 0.01% BSA. This is followed by a wash in 0.1×SSC at 50° C. for 45 minutes. Step 4: Filters are autoradiographed. Other conditions of high stringency that may be used are well known in the art. See, e.g., Ausubel et al., (eds.), 1993, C\nURRENT \nP\nROTOCOLS IN \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY\n, John Wiley and Sons, NY; and Kriegler, 1990, G\nENE \nT\nRANSFER AND \nE\nXPRESSION\n, A L\nABORATORY \nM\nANUAL\n, Stockton Press, NY.\n\n\nModerate stringency conditions can include the following: Step 1: Filters containing DNA are pretreated for 6 hours at 55° C. in a solution containing 6×SSC, 5×Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS and 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Step 2: Filters are hybridized for 18-20 hours at 55° C. in the same solution with 5−20×10\n6 \ncpm \n32\nP-labeled probe added. Step 3: Filters are washed at 37° C. for 1 hour in a solution containing 2×SSC, 0.1% SDS, then washed twice for 30 minutes at 60° C. in a solution containing 1×SSC and 0.1% SDS. Step 4: Filters are blotted dry and exposed for autoradiography. Other conditions of moderate stringency that may be used are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Ausubel et al., (eds.), 1993, C\nURRENT \nP\nROTOCOLS IN \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY\n, John Wiley and Sons, NY; and Kriegler, 1990, G\nENE \nT\nRANSFER AND \nE\nXPRESSION\n, A L\nABORATORY \nM\nANUAL\n, Stockton Press, NY.\n\n\nLow stringency can include: Step 1: Filters containing DNA are pretreated for 6 hours at 40° C. in a solution containing 35% formamide, 5×SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% PVP, 0.1% Ficoll, 1% BSA, and 500 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Step 2: Filters are hybridized for 18-20 hours at 40° C. in the same solution with the addition of 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.2% BSA, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate, and 5−20×10\n6 \ncpm \n32\nP-labeled probe. Step 3: Filters are washed for 1.5 hours at 55° C. in a solution containing 2×SSC, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. The wash solution is replaced with fresh solution and incubated an additional 1.5 hours at 60° C. Step 4: Filters are blotted dry and exposed for autoradiography. If necessary, filters are washed for a third time at 65-68° C. and reexposed to film. Other conditions of low stringency that may be used are well known in the art (e.g., as employed for cross-species hybridizations). See, e.g., Ausubel et al., (eds.), 1993, C\nURRENT \nP\nROTOCOLS IN \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY\n, John Wiley and Sons, NY; and Kriegler, 1990, G\nENE \nT\nRANSFER AND \nE\nXPRESSION\n, A L\nABORATORY \nM\nANUAL\n, Stockton Press, NY.\n\n\nBH3 Antibodies\n\n\nAlso included in the invention are antibodies to BH3 peptides or fragments thereof. The term “antibody” as used herein refers to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site that specifically binds (immunoreacts with) an antigen. Such antibodies include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric, single chain, F\nab\n, F\nab′\n, and F\n(ab′)2 \nfragments, and an F\nab \nexpression library. In general, an antibody molecule obtained from humans relates to any of the classes IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE and IgD, which differ from one another by the nature of the heavy chain present in the molecule. Certain classes have subclasses as well, such as IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, and others. Furthermore, in humans, the light chain may be a kappa chain or a lambda chain. Reference herein to antibodies includes a reference to all such classes, subclasses and types of human antibody species.\n\n\nAn isolated BH3-related protein of the invention may be intended to serve as an antigen, or a portion or fragment thereof, and additionally can be used as an immunogen to generate antibodies that immunospecifically bind the antigen, using standard techniques for polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparation. The full-length protein can be used or, alternatively, the invention provides antigenic peptide fragments of the antigen for use as immunogens. An antigenic peptide fragment comprises at least 6 amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of the full length protein, or amino acid sequences as shown in SEQ ID NOs:1-7, and encompasses an epitope thereof such that an antibody raised against the peptide forms a specific immune complex with the full length protein or with any fragment that contains the epitope. By epitope reference is made to an antigenic determinant of a polypeptide. Typically, epitopes contain hydrophilic amino acids such that the particular region of the polypeptide is located on its surface and likely to be exposed in an aqueous based milieu. Preferably, the antigenic peptide comprises at least 3 amino acid residues in a spatial conformation which is unique to the epitope. Generally, the antigenic peptide comprises at least 5 amino acid residues, or at least 10 amino acid residues, or at least 15 amino acid residues, or at least 20 amino acid residues, or at least 30 amino acid residues. Furthermore, antibodies to a BH3 peptide or fragments thereof can also be raised against oligopeptides that include a conserved region such as the α6 helix domain of BID identified herein.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments of the invention, at least one epitope encompassed by the antigenic peptide is a region of BH3 that is located on the surface of the protein, e.g., a hydrophilic region. A hydrophobicity analysis of the human BH3 sequence will indicate which regions of a BH3 are particularly hydrophilic and, therefore, are likely to encode surface residues useful for targeting antibody production. As a means for targeting antibody production, hydropathy plots showing regions of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity may be generated by any method well known in the art, including, for example, the Kyte Doolittle or the Hopp Woods methods, either with or without Fourier transformation. See, e.g., Hopp and Woods, 1981, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 78: 3824-3828; Kyte and Doolittle 1982, J. Mol. Biol. 157: 105-142, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Antibodies that are specific for one or more domains within an antigenic protein, or derivatives, fragments, analogs or homologs thereof, are also provided herein.\n\n\nA protein of the invention, or a derivative, fragment, analog, homolog or ortholog thereof, may be utilized as an immunogen in the generation of antibodies that immunospecifically bind these protein components.\n\n\nVarious procedures known within the art may be used for the production of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies directed against a protein of the invention, or against derivatives, fragments, analogs homologs or orthologs thereof (see, for example, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow E, and Lane D, 1988, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., incorporated herein by reference). Some of these antibodies are discussed below.\n\n\nPolyclonal Antibodies\n\n\nFor the production of polyclonal antibodies, various suitable host animals (e.g., rabbit, goat, mouse or other mammal) may be immunized by one or more injections with the native protein, a synthetic variant thereof, or a derivative of the foregoing. An appropriate immunogenic preparation can contain, for example, the naturally occurring immunogenic protein, a chemically synthesized polypeptide representing the immunogenic protein, or a recombinantly expressed immunogenic protein. Furthermore, the protein may be conjugated to a second protein known to be immunogenic in the mammal being immunized. Examples of such immunogenic proteins include but are not limited to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. The preparation can further include an adjuvant. Various adjuvants used to increase the immunological response include, but are not limited to, Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels (e.g., aluminum hydroxide), surface active substances (e.g., lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, dinitrophenol, etc.), adjuvants usable in humans such as Bacille Calmette-Guerin and Corynebacterium parvum, or similar immunostimulatory agents. Additional examples of adjuvants which can be employed include MPL-TDM adjuvant (monophosphoryl Lipid A, synthetic trehalose-dicorynomycolate) and CpG dinucleotide motifs (Krieg, A. M. Biochim Biophys Acta 1489(1):107-16, 1999).\n\n\nThe polyclonal antibody molecules directed against the immunogenic protein can be isolated from the mammal (e.g., from the blood) and further purified by well known techniques, such as affinity chromatography using protein A or protein G, which provide primarily the IgG fraction of immune serum. Subsequently, or alternatively, the specific antigen which is the target of the immunoglobulin sought, or an epitope thereof, may be immobilized on a column to purify the immune specific antibody by immunoaffinity chromatography. Purification of immunoglobulins is discussed, for example, by D. Wilkinson (The Scientist, published by The Scientist, Inc., Philadelphia Pa., Vol. 14, No. 8 (Apr. 17, 2000), pp. 25-28).\n\n\nMonoclonal Antibodies\n\n\nThe term “monoclonal antibody” (MAb) or “monoclonal antibody composition”, as used herein, refers to a population of antibody molecules that contain only one molecular species of antibody molecule consisting of a unique light chain gene product and a unique heavy chain gene product. In particular, the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the monoclonal antibody are identical in all the molecules of the population. MAbs thus contain an antigen binding site capable of immunoreacting with a particular epitope of the antigen characterized by a unique binding affinity for it.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256:495 (1975). In a hybridoma method, a mouse, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes can be immunized in vitro.\n\n\nThe immunizing agent will typically include the protein antigen, a fragment thereof or a fusion protein thereof. Generally, either peripheral blood lymphocytes are used if cells of human origin are desired, or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, (1986) pp. 59-103). Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells can be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (“HAT medium”), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.\n\n\nPreferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63).\n\n\nThe culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980). Preferably, antibodies having a high degree of specificity and a high binding affinity for the target antigen are isolated.\n\n\nAfter the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones can be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells can be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones can be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibodies can also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also can be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison, Nature 368, 812-13 (1994)) or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or can be substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody.\n\n\nHumanized Antibodies\n\n\nThe antibodies directed against the protein antigens of the invention can further comprise humanized antibodies or human antibodies. These antibodies are suitable for administration to humans without engendering an immune response by the human against the administered immunoglobulin. Humanized forms of antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2 \nor other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) that are principally comprised of the sequence of a human immunoglobulin, and contain minimal sequence derived from a non-human immunoglobulin. Humanization can be performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. (See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539.) In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies can also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin (Jones et al., 1986; Riechmann et al., 1988; and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596 (1992)).\n\n\nHuman Antibodies\n\n\nFully human antibodies relate to antibody molecules in which essentially the entire sequences of both the light chain and the heavy chain, including the CDRs, arise from human genes. Such antibodies are termed “human antibodies”, or “fully human antibodies” herein. Human monoclonal antibodies can be prepared by the trioma technique; the human B-cell hybridoma technique (see Kozbor, et al., 1983 Immunol Today 4: 72) and the EBV hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (see Cole, et al., 1985 In: M\nONOCLONAL \nA\nNTIBODIES AND \nC\nANCER \nT\nHERAPY\n, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Human monoclonal antibodies may be utilized in the practice of the present invention and may be produced by using human hybridomas (see Cote, et al., 1983. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 80: 2026-2030) or by transforming human B-cells with Epstein Barr Virus in vitro (see Cole, et al., 1985 In: M\nONOCLONAL \nA\nNTIBODIES AND \nC\nANCER \nT\nHERAPY\n, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96).\n\n\nIn addition, human antibodies can also be produced using additional techniques, including phage display libraries (Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227:381 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581 (1991)). Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge, human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and antibody repertoire. This approach is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016, and in Marks et al. (Bio/\nTechnology\n 10, 779-783 (1992)); Lonberg et al. (Nature 368 856-859 (1994)); Morrison (Nature 368, 812-13 (1994)); Fishwild et al, (Nature Biotechnology 14, 845-51 (1996)); Neuberger (Nature Biotechnology 14, 826 (1996)); and Lonberg and Huszar (Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13 65-93 (1995)).\n\n\nHuman antibodies may additionally be produced using transgenic nonhuman animals which are modified so as to produce fully human antibodies rather than the animal's endogenous antibodies in response to challenge by an antigen. (See PCT publication WO94/02602). The endogenous genes encoding the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains in the nonhuman host have been incapacitated, and active loci encoding human heavy and light chain immunoglobulins are inserted into the host's genome. The human genes are incorporated, for example, using yeast artificial chromosomes containing the requisite human DNA segments. An animal which provides all the desired modifications is then obtained as progeny by crossbreeding intermediate transgenic animals containing fewer than the full complement of the modifications. The preferred embodiment of such a nonhuman animal is a mouse, and is termed the Xenomouse™ as disclosed in PCT publications WO 96/33735 and WO 96/34096. This animal produces B cells which secrete fully human immunoglobulins. The antibodies can be obtained directly from the animal after immunization with an immunogen of interest, as, for example, a preparation of a polyclonal antibody, or alternatively from immortalized B cells derived from the animal, such as hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, the genes encoding the immunoglobulins with human variable regions can be recovered and expressed to obtain the antibodies directly, or can be further modified to obtain analogs of antibodies such as, for example, single chain Fv molecules.\n\n\nAn example of a method of producing a nonhuman host, exemplified as a mouse, lacking expression of an endogenous immunoglobulin heavy chain is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,598. It can be obtained by a method including deleting the J segment genes from at least one endogenous heavy chain locus in an embryonic stem cell to prevent rearrangement of the locus and to prevent formation of a transcript of a rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, the deletion being effected by a targeting vector containing a gene encoding a selectable marker; and producing from the embryonic stem cell a transgenic mouse whose somatic and germ cells contain the gene encoding the selectable marker.\n\n\nA method for producing an antibody of interest, such as a human antibody, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,771. It includes introducing an expression vector that contains a nucleotide sequence encoding a heavy chain into one mammalian host cell in culture, introducing an expression vector containing a nucleotide sequence encoding a light chain into another mammalian host cell, and fusing the two cells to form a hybrid cell. The hybrid cell expresses an antibody containing the heavy chain and the light chain.\n\n\nIn a further improvement on this procedure, a method for identifying a clinically relevant epitope on an immunogen, and a correlative method for selecting an antibody that binds immunospecifically to the relevant epitope with high affinity, are disclosed in PCT publication WO 99/53049.\n\n\nF\nab \nFragments and Single Chain Antibodies\n\n\nAccording to the invention, techniques can be adapted for the production of single-chain antibodies specific to an antigenic protein of the invention (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778). In addition, methods can be adapted for the construction of F\nab \nexpression libraries (see e.g., Huse, et al., 1989 Science 246: 1275-1281) to allow rapid and effective identification of monoclonal F\nab \nfragments with the desired specificity for a protein or derivatives, fragments, analogs or homologs thereof. Antibody fragments that contain the idiotypes to a protein antigen may be produced by techniques known in the art including, but not limited to: (i) an F\n(ab′)2 \nfragment produced by pepsin digestion of an antibody molecule; (ii) an F\nab \nfragment generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of an F\n(ab′)2 \nfragment; (iii) an F\nab \nfragment generated by the treatment of the antibody molecule with papain and a reducing agent and (iv) F\nv \nfragments.\n\n\nBispecific Antibodies\n\n\nBispecific antibodies are monoclonal, preferably human or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for an antigenic protein of the invention. The second binding target is any other antigen, and advantageously is a cell-surface protein or receptor or receptor subunit.\n\n\nMethods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy-chain/light-chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (Milstein and Cuello, Nature, 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of ten different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule is usually accomplished by affinity chromatography steps. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829, published 13 May 1993, and in Traunecker et al., 1991 \nEMBO J., \n10:3655-3659.\n\n\nAntibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) can be fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light-chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy-chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology, 121:210 (1986).\n\n\nAccording to another approach described in WO 96/27011, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the CH3 region of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory “cavities” of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.\n\n\nBispecific antibodies can be prepared as full-length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab′)\n2 \nbispecific antibodies). Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., Science 229:81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab′ fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab′-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab′-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab′-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.\n\n\nAdditionally, Fab′ fragments can be directly recovered from \nE. coli \nand chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., J. Exp. Med. 175:217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecule. Each Fab′ fragment was separately secreted from \nE. coli \nand subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.\n\n\nVarious techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., J. Immunol. 148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab′ portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The “diabody” technology described by Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light-chain variable domain (V\nL\n) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See, Gruber et al., J. Immunol. 152:5368 (1994).\n\n\nAntibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al., J. Immunol. 147:60 (1991).\n\n\nExemplary bispecific antibodies can bind to two different epitopes, at least one of which originates in the protein antigen of the invention. Alternatively, an anti-antigenic arm of an immunoglobulin molecule can be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g. CD2, CD3, CD28, or B7), or Fc receptors for IgG (FcγR), such as FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32) and FcγRIII (CD16) so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the cell expressing the particular antigen. Bispecific antibodies can also be used to direct cytotoxic agents to cells which express a particular antigen. These antibodies possess an antigen-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent or a radionuclide chelator, such as EOTUBE, DPTA, DOTA, or TETA. Another bispecific antibody of interest binds the protein antigen described herein (BID or BID α6).\n\n\nHeteroconjugate Antibodies\n\n\nHeteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 91/00360; WO 92/200373; EP 03089). It is contemplated that the antibodies can be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins can be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.\n\n\nEffector Function Engineering\n\n\nIt can be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function, so as to enhance, e.g., the effectiveness of the antibody in treating cancer. For example, cysteine residue(s) can be introduced into the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated can have improved internalization capability and/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See Caron et al., J. Exp Med., 176: 1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, J. Immunol., 148: 2918-2922 (1992). Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity can also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al. Cancer Research, 53: 2560-2565 (1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered that has dual Fc regions and can thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al., Anti-Cancer Drug Design, 3: 219-230 (1989).\n\n\nImmunoconjugates\n\n\nThe invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate).\n\n\nChemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, \nAleurites fordii \nproteins, dianthin proteins, \nPhytolaca americana \nproteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), \nmomordica charantia \ninhibitor, curcin, crotin, \nsapaonaria officinalis \ninhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include \n212\nBi, \n131\nI, \n131\nIn, \n90\nY, and \n186\nRe.\n\n\nConjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntolyene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., Science, 238: 1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94/11026.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the antibody can be conjugated to a “receptor” (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pretargeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a “ligand” (e.g., avidin) that is in turn conjugated to a cytotoxic agent.\n\n\nMethods of Modulating Apoptosis\n\n\nAlso included in the invention are methods of inducing apoptosis or sensitizing a cell to apoptosis. By “inducing apoptosis” is meant that that the program cell death is initiated. Apoptosis is measured by methods known in the art, for example apoptosis is measured by annexin V staining.\n\n\nIn one aspect apoptosis is induced in subject in need thereof by administering a BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide in an amount sufficient to induce apoptosis. The subject can be e.g., any mammal, e.g., a human, a primate, mouse, rat, dog, cat, cow, horse, pig. In various aspects the subject is susceptible to cancer or an autoimmune disorder.\n\n\nA BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide is administered with an anti-angiogenic compound. Examples of an anti-angiogenic compound include, but are not limited to, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, an epidermal-derived growth factor inhibitor, a fibroblast-derived growth factor inhibitor, a platelet-derived growth factor inhibitor, a matrix metalloprotease (MMP) inhibitor, an integrin blocker, interferon alpha, interferon-\ninducible protein\n 10, interleukin-12, pentosan polysulfate, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, carboxyamidotriazole, tetrahydrocortizol, combretastatin A-4, squalamine, 6-O-chloroacetyl-carbonyl)-fumagillol, thalidomide, angiostatin, endostatin, troponin-1, an antibody to VEGF, \nplatelet factor\n 4 or thrombospondin.\n\n\nThe BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide is further administered with an chemotherapeutic compound. Examples of chemotherapeutic compounds include, but are not limited to, paclitaxel, Taxol, lovastatin, minosine, tamoxifen, gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), methotrexate (MTX), docetaxel, vincristin, vinblastin, nocodazole, teniposide, etoposide, adriamycin, epothilone, navelbine, camptothecin, daunonibicin, dactinomycin, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, epirubicin or idarubicin.\n\n\nAlternatively, the BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide is further administered with an antibody, such as polyclonal, monoclonal, humanized, human, bispecific, heteroconjugate, immunoconjugate, chimeric, single chain, F\nab\n, F\nab′\n, and F\n(ab)2 \nfragments, and an F\nab \nexpression library as described above.\n\n\nIn another aspect, apoptosis is induced in a cell by contacting a cell with a BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide in an amount sufficient to induce apoptosis. Alternatively, a cell is sensitized to apoptosis by contacting a cell with a BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide in an amount sufficient to sensitize the cell to apoptosis. The cell population that is exposed to, i.e., contacted with, the BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide can be any number of cells, i.e., one or more cells, and can be provided in vitro, in vivo, or ex vivo.\n\n\nSome disease conditions are related to the development of a defective down-regulation of apoptosis in the affected cells. For example, neoplasias result, at least in part, from an apoptosis-resistant state in which cell proliferation signals inappropriately exceed cell death signals. Furthermore, some DNA viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus, African swine fever virus and adenovirus, parasitize the host cellular machinery to drive their own replication. At the same time, they modulate apoptosis to repress cell death and allow the target cell to reproduce the virus. Moreover, certain disease conditions such as lymphoproliferative conditions, cancer including drug resistant cancer, arthritis, inflammation, autoimmune diseases and the like may result from a down regulation of cell death regulation. In such disease conditions, it would be desirable to promote apoptotic mechanisms.\n\n\nMethods of Screening for Apoptotic Modulating Compounds\n\n\nThe invention further provides a method of screening for compound that modulate apoptosis, i.e., activators or sensitizers.\n\n\nIn various methods, a apoptotic sensitizer compound is identified by contacting a mitochondrion overexpressing an anti-apoptotic protein, e.g. BCL-2 or BCL-X\nL \nwith a BID-like BH3 peptide to form a protein-peptide complex. The complex is contacted with a candidate compound, and cytochrome c release is determined and compared to the amount of cytochrome c release in the test population to a control population that has or has not been exposed to the compound An increase in cytochrome c release presence of the compound as compared to the absence of the compound indicates the compound is an apoptotic sensitizer.\n\n\nThe invention also includes an apoptosis sensitizer identified according to this screening method, and a pharmaceutical composition which includes the apoptosis modulator.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThe compounds, e.g., BH3 peptides BH3 chimeric peptides, nucleic acids encoding BH3 peptides, and BH3 and BH3 antibodies (also referred to herein as “active compounds”) of the invention, and derivatives, fragments, analogs and homologs thereof, can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such compositions typically comprise the nucleic acid molecule, or protein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Suitable carriers are described in the most recent edition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, a standard reference text in the field, which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferred examples of such carriers or diluents include, but are not limited to, water, saline, finger's solutions, dextrose solution, and 5% human serum albumin. Liposomes and non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils may also be used. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates, and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL™ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\nSterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (e.g., a BH3 peptide or BH3 peptide encoding nucleic acid) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.\n\n\nOral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.\n\n\nFor administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.\n\n\nSystemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.\n\n\nThe compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811, incorporated fully herein by reference.\n\n\nIt is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration.\n\n\nTransgenic Animals.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention includes transgenic animals having a heterologous (or exogenous) gene construct or transgene encoding a BCL-2 polypeptide. (e.g., the tet-BCL-2 allele)\n\n\nThe preparation of a transgenic mammal includes introducing a nucleic acid construct that expresses a nucleic acid encoding a BCL-2 polypeptide into an undifferentiated cell type, e.g., an embryonic stem (ES) cell. The ES cell is injected into a mammalian embryo, where it integrates into the developing embryo. The embryo is implanted into a foster mother for the duration of gestation.\n\n\nEmbryonic stem cells are typically selected for their ability to integrate into and become part of the germ line of a developing embryo so as to create germ line transmission of the heterologous gene construct. Thus, any ES cell line that has this capability is suitable for use herein. One mouse strain that is typically used for production of ES cells is the 129J strain. A preferred ES cell line is murine cell line D3 (American Type Culture Collection catalog no. CRL 1934). More preferably, the cell line is RW4. The cells are cultured and prepared for DNA insertion using methods well known in the art, such as those set forth by Robertson (Robertson, In: \nTeratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach\n, E. J. Robertson, ed., IRL Press, Washington, D.C., 1987.). Insertion of the nucleic acid construct into the ES cells can be accomplished using a variety of methods well known in the art including for example, electroporation, microinjection, and calcium phosphate treatment.\n\n\nThe term “transgene” is used herein to describe genetic material that has been or is about to be artificially inserted into the genome of a mammalian cell, particularly a mammalian cell of a living animal. The transgene is used to transform a cell, meaning that a permanent or transient genetic change, preferably a permanent genetic change, is induced in a cell following incorporation of an heterologous nucleic acid, such as DNA. A permanent genetic change is generally achieved by introduction of the DNA into the genome of the cell. Vectors for stable integration include plasmids, retroviruses and other animal viruses, YACs, and the like. Of interest are transgenic mammals, e.g. cows, pigs, goats, horses, etc., and particularly rodents, e.g., rats, mice, etc. Preferably, the transgenic animals are mice.\n\n\nTransgenic animals comprise an heterologous nucleic acid sequence present as an extrachromosomal element or stably integrated in all or a portion of its cells, especially in germ cells. Unless otherwise indicated, it will be assumed that a transgenic animal comprises stable changes to the germline sequence. During the initial construction of the animal, “chimeras” or “chimeric animals” are generated, in which only a subset of cells have the altered genome. Chimeras are primarily used for breeding purposes in order to generate the desired transgenic animal. Animals having a heterozygous alteration are generated by breeding of chimeras. Male and female heterozygotes are typically bred to generate homozygous animals.\n\n\nThe heterologous gene is usually either from a different species than the animal host, or is otherwise altered in its coding or non-coding sequence. The introduced gene may be a wild-type gene, naturally occurring polymorphism, or a genetically manipulated sequence, for example having deletions, substitutions or insertions in the coding or non-coding regions. Where the introduced gene is a coding sequence, it is usually operably linked to a promoter, which may be constitutive or inducible, and other regulatory sequences required for expression in the host animal. By “operably linked” is meant that a DNA sequence and a regulatory sequence(s) are connected in such a way as to permit gene expression when the appropriate molecules, e.g., transcriptional activator proteins, are bound to the regulatory sequence(s). The transgenic animals of the invention can comprise other genetic alterations in addition to the presence of the heterologous gene. For example, the host's genome may be altered to affect the function of endogenous genes comprising BH-3 domains (e.g., endogenous BID, BIM, BAD, BIK, NOXA and/or BCLX genes), contain marker genes, or other genetic alterations. Construction of a BCL-2 transgenic mouse is illustrated in \nFIG. 10\n where 16 chimeras were bred to B6 mice to produce 45 positive F1 offspring.\n\n\nKnockouts and Knockins\n\n\nAlthough not necessary to the operability of the invention, the transgenic animals described herein may comprise alterations to endogenous genes comprising BCL-2 in addition to the genetic alterations described above. For example, the host animals may be either “knockouts” and/or “knockins” for a target gene(s) as is consistent with the goals of the invention (e.g., the host animal's endogenous BCL-2 gene may be “knocked out” and/or the BCL-2 gene may be “knocked in”). Knockouts have a partial or complete loss of function in one or both alleles of an endogenous gene comprising BCL-2 genes of interest. Knockins have an introduced transgene with altered genetic sequence and/or function from the endogenous BCL-2 gene. The two may be combined, for example, such that the naturally occurring gene is disabled, and an altered form introduced. For example, it may be desirable to knockout the host animal's endogenous gene comprising BCL-2, while introducing an exogenous gene comprising BCL-2.\n\n\nIn a knockout, preferably the target gene expression is undetectable or insignificant. For example, a knock-out of a gene comprising BCL-2 means that function of the BCL-2 gene has been substantially decreased so that expression is not detectable or only present at insignificant levels. This may be achieved by a variety of mechanisms, including introduction of a disruption of the coding sequence, e.g., insertion of one or more stop codons, insertion of a DNA fragment, etc., deletion of coding sequence, substitution of stop codons for coding sequence, etc. In some cases the exogenous transgene sequences are ultimately deleted from the genome, leaving a net change to the native sequence. Different approaches may be used to achieve the “knock-out”. A chromosomal deletion of all or part of the native gene may be induced, including deletions of the non-coding regions, particularly the promoter region, 3′ regulatory sequences, enhancers, or deletions of gene that activate expression of BCL-2 genes. A functional knock-out may also be achieved by the introduction of an anti-sense construct that blocks expression of the native genes (See, e.g., Li and Cohen (1996) Cell 85:319-329). “Knock-outs” also include conditional knock-outs, for example where alteration of the target gene occurs upon exposure of the animal to a substance that promotes target gene alteration, introduction of an enzyme that promotes recombination at the target gene site (e.g. Cre in the Cre-lox system), or other method for directing the target gene alteration post-natally.\n\n\nA “knockin” of a target gene means an alteration in a host cell genome that results in altered expression or function of a native target gene. Increased (including ectopic) or decreased expression may be achieved by introduction of an additional copy of the target gene, or by operatively inserting a regulatory sequence that provides for enhanced expression of an endogenous copy of the target gene. These changes may be constitutive or conditional, i.e. dependent on the presence of an activator or represser. The use of knockin technology may be combined with production of exogenous sequences to produce the transgenic animals of the invention.\n\n\nThe heterologous gene construct includes a nucleic acid encoding a protein comprising BCL-2 proteins. The heterologous gene construct can also encode for various selection markers and enhancer elements.\n\n\nA selection marker can be any nucleic acid sequence that is detectable and/or assayable. Examples of selection markers include positive selection markers and negative selection markers. Positive selection markers include drug resistance genes; e.g., neomycin resistance genes or hygromycin resistance genes, or beta-galactosidase genes. Negative selection markers, e.g., thymidine kinase gene, diphtheria toxin gene and ganciclovir are useful in the heterologous gene construct in order to eliminate embryonic stem (ES) cells that do not undergo homologous recombination. The selection marker gene is usually operably linked to its own promoter or to another strong promoter from any source that will be active or can easily be activated in the cell into which it is inserted; however, the marker gene need not have its own promoter attached as it may be transcribed using the promoter of the BCL-2 containing gene to be suppressed. In addition, the marker gene will normally have a polyA sequence attached to the 3′ end of the gene; this sequence serves to terminate transcription of the gene.\n\n\n“Enhancer elements” include nucleic acid sequences that are bound by polypeptides associated with transcription, and are usually in cis with the nucleic acid encoding a light-generating fusion protein. Examples of enhancer elements include cyclic AMP response elements (CRE), serum response elements (SRE), nuclear factor B (NF-κB), activator protein 1 (AP-1), serum response factor (SRF), and p53 binding sites. These enhancer elements may further include a TATA box.\n\n\nThe heterologous gene construct may be constitutively expressed in the transgenic mammal. The gene construct may expressed in specific tissues, e.g., the construct is under the control of a tissue-specific promoter.\n\n\nThe invention includes a transgenic mouse containing a heterologous gene construct encoding a BCL-2 protein. The gene construct is under the control of a conditional promoter Activation of the promoter by a transgenic trans-activator protein results in increased expression of the gene construct encoding the BCL-2 protein. Inactivation of the transactivator is achieved by the interaction of a selected biocompatible entity, or parts of the entity, with the transactivator elements. This results in a decrease in expression of the BCL-2 transgene. If the activation occurs only in a part of the animal, only cells in that part will express the BCL-2 proteins.\n\n\nTransgenic Cell Lines\n\n\nThe invention also includes cell lines derived from the transgenic animals described above. An example cell line is derived from the bone marrow of a triply transgenic (E-mu myc +/tet-Bcl-2 +/MMTVtTA +) leukemic mouse. The cell line is dependent on IL-7 for division. When treated with doxycycline, which turns off BCL-2, all the cells die, demonstrating the BCL-2 dependence of the cell line. The invention also includes a method of using the cell line in an in vitro assay to determine the inhibition of BCL-2 by a peptide or peptidomimetic comprising a BH3 domain (i.e. BCL-2 inhibition) or determine the effects of a test compound (i.e. BH3 agonist).\n\n\nThe invention will be further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nGeneral Methods\n\n\nPeptide Stocks\n\n\nPeptides were synthesized by Tufts University Core Facility, purified by HPLC, and identity confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Stock solutions were 10-20 mM DMSO.\n\n\nIsolation of Mitochondria\n\n\nMouse liver mitochondria were isolated from age-matched wt or Bak −/− mice. Livers were diced, subjected to Dounce rotary Teflon pestle disruption, then homogenized using a Kinematica Polytron homognizer. Following suspension in isolation buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.1 mM EGTA), mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation steps, followed by two washes in isolation buffer. Mitochondria from FL5.12 cells were isolated by cell disruption followed by differential centrifugation and washing as above. Cell disruption was performed either by a Kinematika Polytron homogenizer or by a combination of Dounce homogenization followed by 6-10 expulsions through a 27 gauge needle.\n\n\nCytochrome C Release\n\n\nMitochondria at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml were treated at room temperature in experimental buffer (125 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-MOPS pH 7.4, 5 mM glutamate, 2.5 mM malate, 1 mM KPO\n4\n, 10□M EGTA-Tris pH 7.4). Percent release was quantitated using a colorimetric ELISA (MCTC0, R&D Systems). In all experiments, treatments with DMSO were used as a control for solvent activity.\n\n\nBMH Cross-Linking\n\n\n1,6-Bismaleimidohexane was obtained from Pierce (#22330). A 10 mM stock solution in DMSO was added to treated mitochondrial suspensions at a 1:11 dilution. Cross-linking took place for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by centrifugation to pellet mitochondria. Pellets were dissolved in NuPAGE loading buffer (Invitrogen).\n\n\nBinding Assays\n\n\nTo determine K\nd \nfor peptide binding to BCL-2, a GST-BCL-2 fusion protein lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domain was utilized. Peptides were synthesized with a fluorescein amino-terminus using an AHA linker. Peptides at 25 nM were mixed with titrations of GST-BCL-2 in binding buffer (140 mM NaCL, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4) at 37° C. An increase in fluorescence polarization measured on a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B luminescence spectrophotometer was quantitated to calculate binding. A non-linear fit to a sigmoidal dose-response curve utilized the program Origin 6.0 to determine K\nd\n. For quantitative BIDBH3 displacement assays, 25 nM fluoresceinated BIDBH3 was mixed with 1 μM GST-BCL-2 in binding buffer. Increasing amounts of unlabelled BH3 peptides were titrated in, with loss of fluorescence polarization as a measurement of displacement of BIDBH3. Data were fitted to a sigmoidal curve as above, and IC50 determined.\n\n\nGST-BCL-2 Production\n\n\nGST-BCL-2δC21 fusion proteins were induced in BL21 DE3 by 0.1 mM IPTG. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (1 mg/ml lysozyme/1% Triton X-100/0.1 mg/ml PMSF/2 μg/ml aprotinin/2 μg/ml leupeptine/1 μg/ml pepstatin A in PBS) and sonicated. After centrifugation at 20,000×g for 20 min, the supernatant was applied to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). The beads were washed with PBS and treated with 50 mM glutathione/50 mM Tris HCl, pH8.0 to elute protein. Eluate was dialyzed against binding buffer and concentrated using Amicon centrifugal concentrating devices.\n\n\nCircular Dichroism\n\n\nCircular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter at 20° C. using the following standard measurement parameters: wavelength, 190-260 nm; step resolution, 0.5 nm; speed, 20 nm/sec; accumulations, 10; response, 1 sec; band width, 1 nm; path length, 0.1 cm. Stock solutions of peptide were dissolved in deionized water and concentrations determined by amino acid analysis. Samples were then diluted in 50 mM \npotassium phosphate pH\n 7 to a calculated final concentration of 50 μM. The CD spectrum of each sample was measured in triplicate and a background spectrum of diluent alone was subtracted. For comparison, the subtracted CD spectra were normalized to 35 μM based on repeat peptide concentration determination by amino acid analysis of the diluted peptide solutions. The α-helical content of each peptide was calculated by dividing the mean residue ellipicity [q]222obs by the reported [q]222obs for a model helical decapeptide (Yang et al., 1986).\n\n\nImmunoblot Analysis\n\n\nAntibodies used for immunoblot analysis included anti-cytochrome c (75981A, Pharmingen), anti-BAK (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-BAX (N-20, Santa Cruz). Antibody detection was accomplished using enhanced chemiluminescence (Western Lightning, Perkin-Elmer).\n\n\nJurkat Cell Death\n\n\nJurkat cells were grown in \nRPMI\n 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml/strep, 2 mM glutamine, 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were treated with peptide for 5 hours followed by staining with fluorescently-tagged Annexin V according to manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences 556547). Death was quantitated by FACS followed by analysis using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.)\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\nBH3 Peptides from BID and BIM, But not all BH3-Only Members Release Cytochrome C Similar to Myristoylated Bid\n\n\nRecombinant p15tBID and even more efficiently the p7/myrp15, myristoylated BID complex (myrBID), initiate BAK oligomerization and cytochrome c release in a mitochondrial in-vitro system that appears to recapitulate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in-vivo. Since the pro-apoptotic activity of BID in-vitro and in-vivo requires an intact BH3 domain, we tested the ability of peptides derived from this BH3 domain to initiate this activity. A 20 mer of BIDBH3 (aa 80-99) at 10 μM (Table 1) proved capable of initiating cytochrome c release, as did myrBID (\nFIG. 1A\n). the activity of other BH3 domain peptides were compared. While BIMBH3 (Table 1) demonstrated cytochrome c release, peptides derived from other BH3-only members BAD, BIK, and NOXA (Table 1) even at 100 μM did not display this activity (\nFIG. 1B\n). A peptide derived from the BH3 domain of anti-apoptotic Bcl-X\nL \ndid not cause cytochrome c release (\nFIG. 1B\n). Circular dichroism studies indicate that while the relative α-helical content of these peptides varies, the percent α-helicity does not solely dictate the activity of the peptides. While NOXAABH3 and BCL-X\nL\nBH3 have relatively low α-helical content, BADBH3 demonstrates the highest α-helical content and is still inactive in this assay (Table 1). Likewise, a peptide derived from the BH3 domain of BID, but containing substitutions (L90A, D95A) at two residues highly conserved throughout the family, retained α-helicity, but did not cause cytochrome c release (Table 1, \nFIG. 1B\n).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\nBAK is Required for BH3 Peptide-Induced Cytochrome C Release\n\n\nTo test whether BH3 peptides work through an established mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, we examined whether they required the “multidomain” member BAK to be present. One hallmark of cytochrome c release by native tBID is that it requires the presence of multidomain BAK or BAX in intact cells or BAK on purified mitochondria (Wei et al., 2000; Wei et al., 2001). Immunoblots of mitochondria isolated from the liver of Bak −/− mice confirmed that neither “multi-domain” pro-apoptotic BAX nor BAK was present (\nFIG. 2\n). Moreover, there is no compensatory alteration in the levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 members in the absence of BAX and/or BAK (not shown). Comparison of 100 μM BIMBH3 or BIDBH3 peptide on Bak +/+vs. −/− mitochondria indicated that BAK is required for the release of cytochrome c (\nFIG. 3\n). This requirement for BAK argues that these α-helical BH3 peptides function through the genetic pathway of mitochondrial apoptosis rather than by an autonomous permeabilization of membranes which non-specifically damages mitochondria.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nPeptides that Induce Cytochrome C Release Induce BAK Oligomerization\n\n\nPrevious work demonstrated that the translocation of tBID to the mitochondrion results in allosteric conformational activation of BAK, which includes its homo-oligomerization followed by the release of cytochrome c (Wei et al., 2000). It was found that the BIDBH3 peptide (like tBID or the p7/myr15BID complex) induces BAK oligomerization as detected with the cross-linker, BMH (\nFIG. 4A\n). Moreover, there is temporal relationship between BAK oligomerization and the release of cytochrome c induced by BIDBH3 peptide (FIG. \n4\nA,B). While BIMBH3 also induces BAK oligomerization, BADBH3 peptide, which lacks the ability to cause cytochrome c release, is unable to induce BAK oligomerization (\nFIG. 4C\n). In was also found that BIMBH3 and BIDBH3, but not BADBH3, could also induce oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria isolated from cultured FL5.12 cells, which contain both BAX and BAK (\nFIG. 2\n, \n4\nC). Note that while BIDBH3 induces more prominent cross-linking of BAK than does BIMBH3, BIMBH3 induces more prominent cross-linking of BAX than does BIDBH3. A mutant BID peptide BIDBH3mut (L90A, D95A) was tested and it lacked the ability to induce either cytochrome c release (\nFIG. 1B\n) or BAX, BAK oligomerization (\nFIG. 4C\n). These results indicate that BIDBH3 and BIMBH3 peptides, like intact tBID protein are capable of inducing an allosteric change in mitochondrial-resident BAK or BAX, which includes their homo-oligomerization and subsequent release of cytochrome c.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\nBCL-2 Inhibits Mitochondrial Release of Cytochrome C by BH3 Peptides\n\n\nMitochondria bearing protective levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 do not release cytochrome c following treatment with 25 ng tBID in vitro, apparently because tBID is bound and sequestered by BCL-2 in stable complexes that prevent tBID from activating BAK (Cheng et al., 2001). Similarly, mitochondria with overexpressed BCL-2 proved resistant to 10 M BIDBH3, 1 μM BIMBH3, as well as 30 nM myrBID failing to release cytochrome c (\nFIG. 5A\n) Furthermore, the presence of BCL-2 is coordinate with the loss of BAK oligomerization following exposure to BH3 peptide, suggesting that BCL-2 inhibits upstream of BAK activation (\nFIG. 5B\n). These findings support a model wherein a major component of BCL-2's role in inactivating tBID is to specifically sequester the BH3 domain, thus preventing BH3 itself from activating multidomain pro-apoptotic members.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nBADBH3 Binds BCL-2 and Restores Cytochrome C Release by BID\n\n\nBH3 peptides were tested which lack the intrinsic ability to activate BAK and cause cytochrome c release for their capacity to interfere with the anti-apoptotic protection by BCL-2. This subset of BH3 peptides might occupy the hydrophobic pocket of BCL-2 and consequently displace proapoptotic BIDBH3 or BIMBH3 peptides. The BADBH3 peptide most prominently demonstrates the capacity to overcome BCL-2 protection of mitochondria treated with a subliminal concentration of myrBID (30 nM), while BIKBH3 shows significant, but lesser, potency (\nFIG. 6A\n). The remaining BH3 peptides derived from NOXA and BCL-X\nL \ndid not demonstrate the capacity to overcome BCL-2 protection (\nFIG. 6A\n). Since even 100 μM BADBH3 in and of itself cannot activate BAK or release cytochrome c, this suggests that BADBH3 sensitizes mitochondria to BIDBH3 or BIMBH3 by successfully competing with these peptides for binding to BCL-2. At 100 μM, BADBH3 was able to restore the cytochrome c release of BCL-2 overexpressing mitochondria in a dose-response fashion to BIDBH3 (\nFIG. 6B\n) and BIMBH3 (\nFIG. 6C\n) to levels observed for wt mitochondria. An increase in the sensitivity of wt mitochondria treated with BADBH3 was observed. This would be expected, as the source of wt mitochondria, FL5.12 cells, express some murine BCL-2. It was noted that the restoration of cytochrome c release by BADBH3 was accompanied by restoration of BAK oligomerization.\n\n\nWhether eliminating BCL-2 protection by BADBH3 would enable the more physiologic ligand, myristoylated BID complex (p7/myrp15BID) was tested. Addition of 200 μM BADBH3 to BCL-2 overexpressing mitochondria markedly restores their sensitivity to even 1 nM myrBID. These BADBH3 treated mitochondria are more sensitive than wt mitochondria, probably reflecting the capacity of BADBH3 to inhibit the endogenous murine BCL-2 and BCL-X\nL \nresident on the mitochondria (\nFIG. 6D\n). The dose response range of BADBH3 was examined, revealing it had measurable activity at concentrations as low as 1 μM in inhibiting BCL-2 (\nFIG. 6E\n) and enabling cytochrome c release by myrBID. At 100 μM, BIKBH3 can also restore near-total cytochrome c release to mitochondria over-expressing BCL-2, demonstrating a mechanism of action like BADBH3, albeit at higher concentrations (\nFIG. 6E\n). This reveals that short BADBH3 and BIKBH3 peptides can effectively compete with the natural myrBID protein for binding BCL-2 thus abrogating BCL-2's antiapoptotic effect and enabling myrBID induced cytochrome c release.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\nBADBH3 Displaces BIDBH3 from BCL-2 by Fluorescence Polarization Analysis\n\n\nTo directly test whether BADBH3 could displace BIDBH3 from BCL-2 we utilized fluorescence polarization analysis. BADBH3 peptide bound full-length BCL-2 with approximately 5-fold greater affinity than BIDBH3 peptide (average of 41 vs. 220 nM, Table 1, \nFIG. 7A\n). Moreover, BADBH3 can efficiently displace pre-bound BIDBH3 peptide from BCL-2 (\nFIG. 7B\n). However, to compete pre-bound BIDBH3, an excess of BADBH3 is required, despite the 5-fold greater affinity of BADBH3 for BCL-2 in solution. This finding suggests a conformational change takes place in either BCL-2 and/or a BH3 peptide upon binding. In contrast, BIDBH3 does not effectively displace BADBH3 from BCL-2. Testing the remaining peptides reveals that those peptides which cause cytochrome c release by themselves (BIDBH3 and BIMBH3) or those which enable cytochrome c release by counteracting BCL-2 (BADBH3 and BIKBH3) all bind to BCL-2 with affinities in the 50-500 nM range. BADBH3 and BIKBH3 demonstrate the ability to displace BIDBH3 from the BCL-2 protein (Table 1). The remaining peptides (NOXABH3, NOXABBH3, BCLXBH3, BIDBH3mut) which were unable to overcome BCL-2 inhibition did not bind detectably to BCL-2 or displace BIDBH3 from BCL-2 (Table 1). These results are consistent with the capacity of “sensitizing” BH3 domains (e.g. BADBH3 or BIKBH3) to displace “activating” BH3 domains (e.g. BIDBH3 or BIMBH3) from the pocket of anti-apoptotic BCL-2. Once free, “activating” BH3 domains by this model would trigger BAK oligomerization with subsequent cytochrome c release (\nFIG. 7C\n).\n\n\nWhether apoptosis of cancer cells could be triggered by transduction of such BH3 peptides was explored. Prior studies utilizing internalization moieties including decanoic acid, antennepedia (ANT) or HIV Tat have noted confounding issues of cellular and mitochondrial toxicity. For example, when various BH3 domains were linked to a Tat 11-mer both wt and mutant transduced peptides rapidly killed cells. Moreover, many conjugates did not appear to work through the genetic pathway as they displayed no inhibition by BCL-2 and readily killed Bax, Bak doubly deficient cells (not shown). Linking a polyarginine (8 aa) stretch to the BH3 peptides appears more promising. Polyarginine tags have been shown to facilitate the transport of peptides across the plasma membrane (Rothbard et al., 2000). r8BIDBH3 was capable of killing Jurkat leukemic cells, whereas r8BIDBH3mut was ineffective. Moreover, the addition of non-toxic 10YM r8BADBH3 was able to sensitize Jurkat cells to subliminal concentrations (10 μM) of r8BIDBH3 (\nFIG. 8\n). Both r8BIDBH3 and r8BADBH3 failed to kill Bax, Bak doubly-deficient cells. Thus, this appears to provide an initial proof of concept experiment that “sensitizing” and “activating” BH3 domains will also synergize in vivo to initiate apoptosis of cancer cells.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nThe use of synthetic peptides coupled with genetically defined mitochondria indicate that the BH3 peptide domain itself, excised from the context of an entire BH3-only molecule, can function as a specific death ligand. The activity of BH3 peptides supports a ligand/receptor model in which “BID-like” BH3 domains are sufficient to trigger allosteric conformational activation of BAX, BAK, their respective receptors. Activation by BIDBH3 peptide was qualitatively indistinguishable from the myrBID protein in that either requires BAK, results in BAK oligomerization followed by cytochrome c release, and can be bound and sequestered by BCL-2 with resultant protection of BAK. The synthetic peptides also indicate that BH3 regions are true domains rather than merely conserved sequence motifs, as the peptide domain itself has inherent functional activity. Comparison of various α-helical peptides from BH3-only proteins reveals evidence for 2 functional classes of BH3 domains. BID-like domains “activate” multidomain proapoptotic BAX, BAK. Whereas, BAD-like domains “sensitize” mitochondria for apoptosis by occupying the pocket of anti-apoptotic BCL-2. The latter displace BID-like domains which even at subliminal levels can now initiate cytochrome c release. This predicts that therapeutics which mimic a BH3 domain, whether they be peptidomimetics or small molecules, will be assignable to these functional classes and should be classified utilizing the genetic and molecular reagents defined here.\n\n\nFrom a therapeutic vantage point, BAD-like “sensitizing” BH3 mimetics would possess several attractive characteristics. They might be predicted to reset susceptibility of cells protected by BCL-2 or BCLX\nL\n, but would require a second apoptotic signal to initiate an “activating” BH3-only protein. This implies that as a single agent, “sensitizing” mimetics might prove non-toxic, especially to normal cells. The need for a second signal provides the opportunity to utilize cancer cell selective pathways that could also spare normal cells.\n\n\nEvidence here for a “sensitizing” subset of BAD-like BH3 peptides provides an explanation for previous, apparent discrepancies concerning the mechanism of action of these proteins. Most BH3-only intact proteins including BAD, NOXA and BIK display a marked binding preference for anti-apoptotic members BCL-2, BCL-X\nL \nin interaction assays of yeast two-hybrid, pull down, or co-immunoprecipitation from detergent solubilized lysates (Boyd et al., 1995; Oda et al., 2000; Yang et al., 1995). Moreover, mutational analysis suggested that only when BAD was able to bind anti-apoptotic BCL-X\nL \nwas it capable of promoting death (Kelekar and Thompson, 1998). Yet, BAD, NOXA and BIK all require the multidomain proapoptotic BAX, BAK proteins to kill as evidenced in Bax, Bak-doubly deficient cells (Cheng et al., 2001; Zong et al., 2001). The ability of BAD-like BH3 peptides to mediate a displacement reaction from the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 pocket provides a mechanism of action that would accommodate all observations. The cooperating protein displaced from anti-apoptotic pockets within intact cells would include, but not be restricted to, BID-like “activating” BH3-only members. While helping to resolve this issue, the analysis of the BIMBH3 peptide proved provocative. Prior interaction assays indicate that the intact BIM protein displays preferential binding to anti-apoptotic BCL-2, BCL-X\nL \nover proapoptotic BAX or BAK. Previous reports testing the capacity of intact BIM protein to release cytochrome c from mitochondria gave differing results (Li et al., 2001; Terradillos et al., 2002). Here, the isolated BIM BH3 domain when removed from the context of the entire protein scored as BID-like, capable of activating BAX, BAK. Several potential explanations can be envisioned. It is possible that the critical α-helical face of the BH3 domain that recognizes BAX, BAK may not be exposed in the intact BIM protein. Alternatively, it is also conceivable that the standard protein interaction assays used to measure binding may not reflect all of the conformational states that a native BIM molecule undergoes during cell death in-vivo.\n\n\nThe mechanistic pathway to cytochrome c release for BIDBH3 peptide appears similar to native myrBID complex, yet the efficiency of triggering varies greatly. Near total release of cytochrome c from mitochondria requires but 10 nM myrBID complex, but 10 μM BIDBH3 peptide. Myristoylation increases the efficiency of BID targeting to mitochondria and could conceivably help focus its location on the outer mitochondrial membrane (Lutter et al., 2001; Zha et al., 2000). It is also possible that an integrated myrp15BID protein may more effectively present the BH3 domain to the BAK pocket. Of note the sources of mitochondria vary in their response to individual BH3 domains. BIDBH3 is more potent than BIMBH3 for liver mitochondria, whereas BIMBH3 is more effective on the FL5.12 mitochondria. This may reflect the presence of BAX on FL5.12 but not liver mitochondria. The efficiency of oligomerization (\nFIG. 4\n) supports a preference of BIDBH3 for BAK and BIMBH3 for BAX. An hypothesis that BIMBH3 prefers BAX would be consistent with the finding that BIM functions upstream of BAX in neuronal cell death following NGF deprivation (Putcha et al., 2001). The binding affinity of individual BH3 domains for BCL-2 members varies considerably (Sattler et al., 1997) (\nFIG. 7\n) providing a measurement for selectivity. Assessment of BH3 peptides by circular dichroism indicates that α-helical content is not the sole determinant of differential binding affinity, nor for the ability to induce BAX, BAK oligomerization and cytochrome c release. The specificity noted suggests a model in which distinct BH3 domains have select multidomain partners which provides a rationale for the large number of both BH3-only and multidomain antiapoptotic members.\n\n\nWhether the BH3 domains of multidomain members can initiate apoptosis is less certain. The BH3 domain isolated from BCL-X\nL \nstudied here showed no activity, while BH3 peptides from BAX have generated mixed results. Addition of a BH3 peptide from BAK to a \nXenopus \ncell free system induced release of cytochrome c and caspase activity, although the site of action was unknown (Cosulich et al., 1997). Addition of BAXBH3 to mammalian mitochondria has been reported to release cytochrome c without inducing permeability transition (Polster et al., 2001), consistent with the mechanistic pathway dissected here; whereas, others report BAXBH3 peptides which do induce permeability transition and loss of transmembrane potential as an explanation for cytochrome c release (Narita et al., 1998). This may be inherent to α-helices themselves or to hybrid proteins which can damage organelle membranes.\n\n\nA substantial challenge for the future is to effectively transduce BH3 peptides or BH3 peptidomimetics into cells and assure that the induction of apoptosis is through the genetic pathway. Several studies (Holinger et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2000) including the initial polyarginine transduction approach presented here suggest this warrants further efforts. However, caution exists as a number of amphipathic α-helical peptides, especially if they are cationic, can be attracted to negatively charged membranes, including mitochondrial membranes where they can non-specifically disrupt the lipid matrix and membrane barrier function (Ellerby et al., 1999; Matsuzaki, 2001; Westerhoff et al., 1989). Others utilizing ANT-BH3BAD found toxicity was independent of the BCL-2 pathway and also killed yeast, which tolerate expression of the BH3-only proteins (Schimmer et al., 2001; Vieira et al., 2002). Alternative methods of internalization including receptor mediated pathways should also be considered for BH3 peptidomimetics. The work here provides a proof of concept that BH3 mimetics can be designed which initiate apoptosis correctly, at definable points in the genetic pathway. Moreover, it provides a paradigm and reagents to dissect the mechanism of action of future BH3 mimetics.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nScreening for BH3-Mimetics Using a Mitochodrial Assay\n\n\nBH3-mimetics, e.g., BAD-like or BID-like, are screened using a mitochondrial assay. (See, \nFIG. 9\n) Mitochondria from livers of mice that are either wild-type or Bak−/− are isolated. Isolated mitochondria are contacted with a test compound and cytochrome c release is determined. No cytochrome c release in either wt or Bak−/− mitochondria indicates the test compound is a “sensitizing”, BAD-like mimetic. To further test this potential “sensitizing” BAD-like mimetic is added to subliminal concentration of a BID-like mimetic myrBID itself to determine if cytochrome c release is enhanced from BAK wt mitochondria. A BAD like mimetic is useful for example as a specific BCL-2/BCL-X\nL \ninhibitor. A compound that induces cytochrome c release in wt but not Bak−/− mitochondria indicates the compound is an “activating” BID-like mimetic. BADBH3 and myrBID are used as controls for sensitizing and activating compounds respectively.\n\n\nCandidate sensitizing compounds are further characterized by isolating mitochondria from either wt or over expressing BCL-2 FL5.12 cells. Sensitizer compound do not induce cytochrome c release from wt F15.12 mitochondria, however sensitizer compounds do enable subliminal concentrations of myrBID or a BID-like mimetic to release cytochrome c from BCL-2 protected mitochondria.\n\n\nA candidate sensitizing compound is further tested for its ability to kill BCL-2 dependent rather than BCL-2 independent cancer cells in culture.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 10\n\n\nProduction and Characterization of BCL-2 Conditional Knockin Mouse\n\n\nUsing standard recombinant DNA technology, the tet-BCL-2 allele was targeted to the \nDNA methyltransferase\n 1 locus (\nFIG. 10\n). By crossing the new mouse line with the MMTV-tTA line (Jackson Labs) mice were generated which conditionally overexpresse BCL-2 in epithelial cells and in B-lineage lymphocytes. Administration of doxycycline successfully suppresses BCL-2 overexpression in these animals. When these mice are crossed with mice expressing myc in the B-lymphocyte lineage (Eμ-myc mice, Jackson Labs) mice which uniformly have B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia were obtained.\n\n\nTo examine the effect of removing BCL-2 expression form the leukemia cells, the effects of doxycycline treatment in a cohort of 28 mice were examined. By genotype, each of the 28 mice contained the tet-BCL-2, the MMTV-tTA, and the Eμ-myc alleles. Phenotypically, each were found to have leukemia by blood smear, and a WBC in excess of 100,000/μl. At 4-5 weeks of age, half were treated with doxycycline (500 μg/ml) in drinking water, and half were left untreated. The WBC was measured by hemocytometer using 2 μl blood from tail which was lysed with 0.3% saponin and stained with Hoechst 33258. As shown in \nFIG. 11\n that the loss of BCL-2 expression induced by doxycycline treatment induces a dramatic, 1-2 log decrease in WBC and a remission of the leukemia. These data provide strong support for the requirement of BCL-2 for tumor maintenance in this murine cancer model, and validates this model for future in vivo testing of candidate BCL-2 inhibitors.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\nPropagation of a Cell Lines Derived from the BCL-2 Conditional Knockin Mouse\n\n\nA culture a cell line from the bone marrow of a triply transgenic, leukemic mouse was propagated. When BCL-2 transgene expression is eliminated by doxycycline treatment, the cell line dies. This BCL-2 dependent cancer cell line is useful for cellular testing of candidate BCL-2 inhibitors.\n\n\nFurthermore, as a control for specificity of a putative BCL-2 antagonist, a cell line from B-cell malignancies which are not dependent on BCL-2 expression were generated. The tumors arose in triply transgenic mice that had not been maintained on doxycycline to abolish BCL-2 transgene expression. Cell from these mice were grown in culture in the absence of doxycycline. Turning off BCL-2 expression by administration of doxycycline did not induce cell death. These results demonstrate that these cell lines are useful in conjunction with the BCL-2 dependent cell line described above to assess the specificity of action of a putative BCL-2 antagonist. A specific BCL-2 antagonist is a compound that kills the BCL-2 dependent cell line but does not kill the BCL-2 independent cell line.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\nAdams, J. M., and Cory, S. (1998).
