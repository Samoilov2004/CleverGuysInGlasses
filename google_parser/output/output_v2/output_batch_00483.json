Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/913,584, filed on Apr. 24, 2007, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to new heterocyclic compounds having affinity to muscarinic receptors, a pharmaceutical composition containing said compounds, as well as the use of said compounds for the preparation of a medicament for treating, alleviating or preventing muscarinic receptor mediated diseases and conditions.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nMuscarinic cholinergic receptors mediate the actions of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Muscarinic receptors comprise five distinct subtypes, denoted as muscarinic M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5 receptors. Each subtype has a unique distribution in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The M1 receptor is predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex and is believed to be involved in the control of higher cognitive functions; the M2 receptor is the predominant subtype found in heart and is involved in the control of heart rate; the M3 receptor is widely expressed in many peripheral tissues and is believed to be involved in gastrointestinal and urinary tract stimulation as well as sweating and salivation; the M4 receptor is present in the brain and may be involved in locomotion and antipsychotic effects; the M5 receptor is located in the brain and may be involved in compound addition and in psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia. In view of the key physiological roles attributed to each of the muscarinic receptor subtypes, extensive efforts have been made to generate new compounds showing selective agonistic or antagonistic properties (see for example EP 0296721; EP 0316718; Sauerberg, P. et al., J. Med. Chem., 1992, Vol. 35, No. 22, 2274-2283; Ward, J. S. et al., 1992, J. Med. Chem., Vol. 35, No. 22, 4011-4019; U.S. Pat. No. 5,527,813; Zlotos, D. P. et al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, Vol. 9, No. 8, 1999, 1029-1053; Plate, R., et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 4 (1996), 227-237; Plate, R. et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 8 (2000), 449-454; Del Guidice, M. R. et al., Arch. Pharm. Med. Chem. 2003, 336, 143-154).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA well known example of a M1/M4 preferring muscarinic receptor agonist is the thiadiazole compound xanomeline which in preclinical studies has a desirable profile, however, in clinical studies displays a unfavourable side effects (see for example the review by Eglen, R. M., \nProgress in Medicinal Chemistry, \n2005, 43, p. 105-136 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,376,668), which seem to be related to M2 receptor mediated activity (e.g. heart rate effects). In addition, xanomeline has a relatively low (in vitro) metabolic stability. Xanomeline related compounds are further disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,527,813. However, representative compounds display unfavourable side effects which seem to be related to M2 and M3 receptor mediated activity (e.g. heart rate effects and salivation, respectively).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough further research is ongoing to develop therapeutics that have the selective M1/M4 profile, this has not yet resulted in successful candidates. Therefore, there is a need for new selective compounds with the desired properties.\n\n\n \nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIt has now been found that heterocyclic compounds of the formula (I)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a solvate or hydrate thereof,\n\n\nwherein\n        \n \nthe heterocycle comprises two double bonds which may be present at varying positions, and which are represented by the dashed lines (---);\n \nthe heterocycle contains two heteroatoms,\n            \n \nW is N or NH;\n \nY is CH, O or NH, wherein\n \nif Y is O, X\n1 \nis CH and X\n2 \nis C—Z—R2 or C—R3, wherein Z is NH, O, or S; and\n \nif Y is CH or NH, one of X\n1 \nand X\n2 \nis CH or N, wherein if X\n1 \nis CH or N, X\n2 \nis C—Z—R2 or C—R3, and if X\n2 \nis CH or N, X\n1 \nis C—Z—R2 or C—R3, wherein Z is NH or S;\n \n\n\n \nR1 is chosen from structures (a), (b) and (c):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR2 is chosen from (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkyl, (C\n2\n-C\n10\n)alkenyl and (C\n2\n-C\n10\n)alkynyl, optionally independently substituted with one or more substituents chosen from halogen, hydroxy, cyano, oxo, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkylthio, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkenyloxy, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkenylthio, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, (C\n5\n-C\n7\n)cycloalkyl, a 5-membered unsaturated heterocycle (optionally substituted with halogen), phenyl, phenyloxy and phenylthio, wherein the phenyl group is optionally substituted with halogen; and\n\n\nR3 is chosen from (C\n4\n-C\n10\n)alkyl, (C\n2\n-C\n10\n)alkenyl and (C\n2\n-C\n10\n)alkynyl, optionally independently substituted with one or more substituents chosen from halogen, hydroxy, cyano, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkylthio, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkenyloxy, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkenylthio, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, (C\n5\n-C\n7\n)cycloalkyl, a 5-membered unsaturated heterocycle optionally substituted with halogen, phenyl, phenyloxy and phenylthio, wherein the phenyl group is optionally substituted with halogen;\n\n\nand optionally, when R2 is an unbranched (C\n2\n-C\n8\n)alkyl, R2 links to formula (Ia)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a solvate or hydrate thereof,\n\n\nthrough the X\n1\na or X\n2\na of formula (Ia), wherein if X\n1 \nis CH or N, X\n1\na is CH or N and\n\n\nX\n2\na is C—Za-, or\n\n\nif X\n1 \nis C—Z—R2, X\n1\na is C—Za- and X\n2\na is CH or N, wherein X\n1\na or X\n2\na having Za links to R2; and\n\n\nthe symbols Wa, Ya and Za and the substituent R1a have the same meanings as defined previously for the symbols W, Y and Z and the substituent R1 and are not independently selected, each of the symbols Wa, Ya and Za and the substituent R1a representing identical symbols and substituents, respectively, as the symbols W, Y and Z and the substituent R1 in the other part of the structure of formula (I).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThese heterocyclic compounds display affinity to muscarinic receptors, in particular to M1 and/or M4 receptors, having muscarinic receptor modulating, in particular (partially) agonistic, properties.\n\n\n \n \nIn addition, compounds of this invention display a higher (in vitro) metabolic stability than the prior art compound xanomeline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are useful for treating, alleviating and preventing muscarinic receptor mediated diseases and conditions.

General Aspects of Syntheses\n\n\n \n \n \nDifferent synthetic routes for the preparations of compounds of the present invention illustrated in formula I are described and easily prepared from readily available starting materials. More general information on pyrazole, imidazole and isoxazole chemistry, see for example: J. A. Joule, K. Mills and G. F. Smith, “Heterocyclic Chemistry”, third edition, Stanley Thornes (Publishers) Ltd., Cheltenham, 1998. More information on addition and subsequent removal of protective groups in organic synthesis can be found in: T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, third edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1999.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selection of the particular method depends on factors such as the compatibility of functional groups with the reagent used, the possibility to use protecting groups, catalysts, activating and coupling reagents and the ultimate structural features present in the final compound being prepared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an example of the general procedure (scheme 1), nicotinoyl chloride hydrochloride (1) is converted to the N-methyl-N-methoxyamide (2) in the presence of a base and reacted with hexyl-lithium (J. Med. Chem., 35, 1992, 2392-2406) to produce 1-pyridin-3-yl-heptan-1-one (3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMild α-methylenation of compound 3 (J. Org. Chem., 71, 2006, 2538-2541) afforded 2-methylene-1-pyridin-3-yl-heptan-1-one (4), which was reacted with hydrazine (Synthesis, 1989, 320-321) to produce 1-(4-pentyl-3-pyridin-3-yl-4,5-dihydropyrazol-1-yl)-ethanone (5). Oxidation of a 2-pyrazoline to a pyrazol can be accomplished using methods well known to those skilled in the art. Specific conditions are: activated MnO\n2 \nin dichloroethane (EP0094555) to produce compound 6, which was deprotected under basic conditions to afford compound 7. The 3-(4-pentyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine derivate (9) was obtained from compound 8 by quarternizing the pyridine moiety with CH\n3\nI and reducing the corresponding pyridinium salt with NaBH\n4 \n(Arch. Pharm. Pharm. Med. Chem., 336, 2003, 143-154).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example of the general procedure (scheme 2), readily available pyridin-3-yl-acetic acid (10) is converted to the N-methyl-N-methoxyamide derivate (12), which is reacted with BuLi to produce 1-pyridin-3-yl-hexan-2-one (13). N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal treatment of 13 furnished the enamine (14) which is converted to the pyrazol (15). The synthesis of 3-(4-Butyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine (16) is illustrated in scheme 2 according to the two step sequence shown in scheme 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another example of the general procedure (scheme 3), 3-(4-bromo-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-pyridine (20A) or its iodo analog (20B) (Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 4, 1996, 227-237) is used as precursor for the synthesis of compounds of the general formula I. The di-lithio derivate (Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 8, 2000, 2317-2335) of 20A, prepared on multigram scale by pyrazol-NH deprotonation and bromine-lithium exchange (2.1 equiv. n-Buli, THF, −78° C., 2 hr), was trapped with a disulfide (for example methyldisulfanylmethane) affording 3-(4-methylsulfanyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-pyridine 21A, which was converted to the 1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine derivate 22A according to the two step sequence shown in scheme 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe generation of anions at the ortho position of the aromatic systems employed in the synthetic procedures described in this application is performed according to a general synthetic strategy known as Directed Ortho Metalation (DOM). Within this area, a number of functional groups known as Directed Metalation Groups (DMG's) have been studied for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dimethylsulfonamide group as Directing Metalation Group (DMG) in the N\n1\n-position of 3-pyridin-3-yl-pyrazole-1-sulfonic acid dimethylamide (23) enables the lithiation of the 5-position and thereby its functionalisation (Chem. Ber., 124, 1991, 1639-1650). The 5-lithioderivate of 23, prepared on multigram scale by α-metallation (1.0 equiv, t-Buli, THF, −78° C., 1 hr), was trapped (J. Org. Chem., 64, 1999, 5366-5370) with a disulfide (for example 1-butyldisulfanylbutane) to afford 5-butylsulfanyl-3-pyridin-3-yl-pyrazol-1-sulfonic acid dimethylamide 24, which was deprotected (25) and converted to the 1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine derivate 26 according to the two step sequence shown in scheme 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother synthetic route for the preparations of compounds of the present invention illustrated in formula I is described in scheme 4. The introduction of the 2-(trimethylsilyl)-ethoxymethyl group (SEM) as a protective group (Tetrahedron Letters, 39, 1998, 5171-5174) afforded a mixture of compounds 27A and 27B. Subsequent bromine-lithium exchange (1.1 equiv. n-Bull, THF, −78° C., 1 hr) and reacting this 4-lithioderivate of 27A/B with S\n8 \ngenerates the intermediate lithium aryl thiolate (J. Org. Chem., 69, 2004, 3236-3239) of 3-pyridin-3-yl-1-(2-trimethylsilanyl-ethoxymethyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-thiol. This intermediate was trapped with 4-bromo-1,1,1-trifluoro-butane to afford a mixture of 28A and 28B. Subsequent removal of the SEM protecting group resulted in the desired 3-[4-(4,4,4-trifluoro-butylsulfanyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]-pyridine 21B, which was converted to the 1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine derivate 22B according to the two step sequence shown in scheme 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, 3-(4-iodo-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-pyridine (20B, scheme 5) is employed as starting material for compounds of the present invention illustrated in formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 4-lithioderivate of the SEM protected derivative 29A/B, prepared according to the corresponding compounds 27A/B (scheme 4), was reacted with trimethyl borate followed by in situ hydrogen peroxide oxidation (J. Heterocyclic Chem., 31, 1994, 1377-1380) to afford the corresponding 3-pyridin-3-yl-1-(2-trimethylsilanyl-1-ethoxymethyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-ol (30, one isomer given). Alkylation of the 4-hydroxy derivate 30 can be accomplished using methods well known in the art, for example, by reacting compound 30 with K\n2\nCO\n3 \nin DMF in the presence of a variety of (aryl)alkyl halides, for example (3-bromo-propyl)-benzene, to generate compound 31A (one isomer given). Subsequent removal of the SEM group resulted in 3-[4-(3-phenyl-propoxy)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]-pyridine (32A), which was converted to the 1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine derivate 33A according to the two step sequence shown in scheme 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 6 illustrates two alternative methods of preparing 3-(4-alkoxy-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mixture of readily available SEM protected pyrazoles 29A/B was converted to a mixture of 34A/B by the efficient two step sequence described in scheme 1 (quarternizing the pyridine moiety with CH\n3\nI and reducing the corresponding pyridinium salt with NaBH\n4\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for the formation of C—O bonds have been reported (e.g. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 123, 2001, 10770). More precisely, an efficient transformation of primary alcohols with the 4-iodo-pyrazole analog (34A/B) could be achieved using the CuI/1,10-phenanthroline catalyzed cross-coupling methodology (Organic Letters, 4, 2002, 973-976). Subsequent deprotection of compound 35A (one isomer given) yielded 3-(4-hexyloxy-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine (33B).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative synthetic sequence (scheme 6), C—O bond formation can be accomplished using the aforementioned CuI/1,10-phenanthroline catalyzed cross-coupling methodology to generate compound 31G. The synthesis of compound 33G has been illustrated in scheme 6, according to the procedures illustrated in scheme 5.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the invention relates to bis 3-(4-alkylsulfanyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine derivatives (for example compound 22C, scheme 7) that bind to and can activate muscarinic receptors (J. Med. Chem., 44, 2001, 4563-4576).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntroduction of the phenylsulfonyl as protective group (starting from 20A) was accomplished regio-selectively to generate 3-(1-phenylsulfonyl-4-bromo-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-pyridine (36A from 20A).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cross-coupling of aliphatic and aromatic thiols and aryl bromides can be mediated by a Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3\n/Xantphos catalytic system in refluxing xylene to afford the corresponding aryl thioethers (Organic Letters, 6, 2004, 4587-4590, Tetrahedron, 61, 2005, 5253-5259).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing this methodology, 36A was converted to the protected bis-alkylsulfanyl-pyrazol derivative 37. Removal of the N\n1\n-phenylsulfonyl group can be accomplished using methods well known to those skilled in the art, for example, optionally reacting compound 37 with potassium hydroxide in diethylene glycol in the presence of hydrazine. Quarternizing the (bis)-pyridine moiety with CH\n3\nI and reducing the corresponding (bis)-pyridinium salt with NaBH\n4 \nafforded pyrazol derivative 22C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 7 illustrates an alternative method for preparing 3-(4-alkylsulfanyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine derivatives, so can be used to synthesize compounds presented in scheme 3 & 4 (22A and 22B respectively), the main feature being the availability of the parent thiol.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother illustration of the preparation of compounds of the present invention of formula I is shown in scheme 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStraightforward nitration (Chem. Ber., 88, 1955, 1577) of pyrazole derivative 19, afforded 3-(4-nitro-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-pyridine (38), which was reduced to the corresponding 3-pyridin-3-yl-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamine (39) and reacted with an acid chloride, for example butyryl chloride, to generate the amide (40). Subsequent conversion to the 1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine derivate 41 was done accordingly to the two step sequence shown in scheme 1. Subsequent LiAlH\n4 \nreduction of the amide generates butyl-[3-(1-methyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-amine (42).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 9 illustrates the preparation of 3-(4-alkynyl (and alkenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine derivatives as compounds of the formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3-(1-Phenylsulfonyl-4-bromo-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-pyridine (36A, scheme 7) or its iodo analog 36B (scheme 9) are excellent substrates for Sonogashira couplings with terminal acetylenes (Tetrahedron Letters, 38, 1997, 7835-7838., Eur J. Org. Chem., 2006, 3283-3307). Catalysis with PdCl\n2\n(PPH\n3\n)\n2 \nin the presence of CuI (excess Et\n3\nN, DMF, 80° C., 2 hr) and (for example) hex-1-yne generates compound 43A. Subsequent deprotection (accordingly to scheme 7), followed by the two step sequence shown in scheme 1, afforded 3-(4-hex-1-ynyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine (45A).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe scope and reactivity of compound 36A (or 36B) is further illustrated by the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions with (for example) alkenylboronic acids. Catalysis with Pd(OAc)\n2 \nand the effective S-Phos in the presence of K\n3\nPO\n4 \nand (for example) (E)-hexen-1-ylboronic acid (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 127, 2005, 4685-4696) afforded the alkenyl 46A. Subsequent deprotection, followed by the two step sequence shown in scheme 1 afforded 3-(4-hex-1-enyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine (47A).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, 3-(4-iodo-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (48, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 8, 2000, 449-454) is employed as starting material for compounds of the present invention of formula I (scheme 10).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReferring to scheme 3, the di-lithio derivative (Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 8, 2000, 2317-2335) of 48, (2.1 equiv. n-Bull, THF, −78° C., 2 hr), was trapped with a disulfide (for example 1-butyldisulfanyl-butane) to afford the corresponding 3-(4-butylsulfanyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane 49A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 10 illustrates an alternative—but also general—method of preparing 3-(4-alkylsulfanyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivatives. So, compound 48 could be converted by the Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3\n/Xantphos catalytic system (analogous to scheme 7, but in DMF at 120° C.) yielding the corresponding aryl thioether 49B, in a single step without protection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mixture of readily available SEM protected pyrazoles 50 (one isomer given) was converted to a mixture of 51A by the CuI/1,10-phenanthroline catalyzed cross-coupling methodology as described in scheme 6, however using different conditions. Subsequent deprotection of 51A yields the corresponding 3-(4-butoxy-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]-octane 52A.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further illustration of the preparation of compounds of the present invention of formula I is shown in scheme 11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe readily available 1-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-one (53), (J. Med. Chem., 36, 1993, 683-689) was converted to 6-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]-6-ol (55), analogous to an efficient two step sequence (Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 8, 2000, 449-454). Attempts to improve the yield of dehydratation of the alcohol (55) was accomplished by acylation (56) (Heterocycles, 24, 1986, 971-977) and subsequent elimination in the heat (185° C.). Reduction of the enamine (57) gave the anticipated endo 1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]derivative (58). Iodination (Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 4, 1996, 227-237) and introduction of pentane-1-thiol by the Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3\n/Xantphos catalytic system (accordingly to scheme 7) afforded endo-6-(4-pentylsulfanyl-1-H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane (60A).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn scheme 12, yet another illustration of the preparation of compounds of the present invention of formula I is shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCommercially available 3-pyridinealdoxime (61) is converted to its chlorohydroxyimino derivative (US 2004/0157900) which is converted to nicotinonitrile oxide (Tetrahedron, 61, 2005, 4363-4371) “in situ” and reacted with 1,2-bis-trimethylsilanyl-ethyne (Chem.

Halogen-induced ipso desilylation resulted in the 4-bromo-5-trimethylsilanyl derivative (63). Subsequent desilylation with NH\n4\nOH (Chem.

Following extensive washings and recovery of the initial state, the tissues were exposed to the test compounds or the same agonist. In the M1 and M2 receptor assays, the compounds were left in contact with the tissues until a stable response was obtained or for a maximum of 15 min. When several concentrations were tested, they were added cumulatively. In the M3 receptor assay, the compounds were left in contact with the tissues for a time sufficient to obtain a peak response or for a maximum of 10 min, then washed out. When several concentrations were tested, they were added consecutively at 40-min intervals. Where an agonist-like response was obtained, the respective reference antagonist was tested against the highest concentration of the compounds to confirm the involvement of the receptor studied in this response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsolated Organ Assays, Antagonist Mode:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tissues were exposed to a submaximal concentration of the respective reference agonist to obtain a control response. In the M1 and M2 receptor assays, the test compounds or the reference antagonists were added after stabilization of the agonist-induced response then left in contact with the tissues until a stable effect was obtained or for a maximum of 15 min. When several concentrations were tested, they were added cumulatively. In the M3 receptor assay, the test compounds or the reference antagonist were added 30 min before re-exposure to the agonist which was added at 40-min intervals. Where it occurred, an inhibition of the agonist-induced response produced by the compounds indicated an antagonist activity at the receptor studied. Each compound was investigated in the three assays for agonist and antagonist activities at one or several concentrations in three separate tissues. In each assay, the reference agonist and antagonist were tested at several concentrations in three separate tissues to obtain concentration-response curves.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell-Based Assays:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells were incubated with compound and the response indicated was measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResponse and Calculation of Results\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsolated Organ Assays:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe parameters measured were the maximum change in the amplitude of the electrically-evoked contractions (M1 and M2 receptor assays) or in tension (M3 receptor assay) induced by each compound concentration. The results are expressed as a percent of the control agonist-induced response. The EC50 values of the reference agonists (concentration producing a half-maximum response) and IC50 values of the reference antagonists (concentration producing a half-maximum inhibition of the agonist-induced response) were calculated by linear regression analysis of their concentration-response curves.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell-Based Assays:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are expressed as a percent of reference agonist values and blanks in the presence of the test compound, percent stimulation for agonist mode; for the antagonist mode (test compound in the presence of reference agonist) as percent inhibition. The EC50 values (concentration causing a half-maximal stimulation of control values), IC50 values (concentration causing a half-maximal inhibition of control values) were determined by non-linear regression analysis of the concentration-response curves using Hill equation curve fitting.\n\n\n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nCLAGUE, R.

Bound radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting using a liquid scintillation cocktail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResponse and Calculation of Results\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults were expressed as percentage of total Ligand binding and that of Non Specific Binding, per concentration of Compound tested (duplicates); from the concentration—displacement curves IC50 values were determined by non-linear regression analysis using Hill equation curve fitting. The inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated from the Cheng-Prushoff equation Ki=IC50/(1+L/Kd), where L is the concentration of radioligand in the assay, and Kd the affinity of the radioligand for the receptor. Results were expressed as pKi's, means±SD of at least 2 separate experiments; i.e. outliers (outside+/−1 std of mean) and discrepancies were excluded. Compounds with no significant affinity at concentrations of 10 μM and higher were concluded to be “inactive” denoted by pKi of “<5.0”.\n\n\n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nDÖRJE, F., WESS, J., LAMBRECHT, G., TACKE, R., MUTSCHLER, E. and BRANN, M.
