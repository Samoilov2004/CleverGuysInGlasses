No. 61/050,693 filed May 6, 2008.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to pyrazoles which are useful as antagonists of CCR1 mediated activity and are thus useful for treating a variety of diseases that are mediated through CCR1 activity including autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, methods of using these compounds in the treatment of various diseases and disorders, processes for preparing these compounds and intermediates useful in these processes.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nChemotactic Cytokine Receptor 1 (CCR1) belongs to a large family (>20) of chemotactic cytokine (chemokine) receptors that interact with specific chemokines (>50) to mediate leukocyte trafficking, granule exocytosis, gene transcription, mitogenic effects and apoptosis. Chemokines are best known for their ability to mediate basal and inflammatory leukocyte trafficking. The binding of at least three chemokines (MIP-1 alpha/CCL3, MCP3/CCL7 and RANTES/CCL5) to CCR1 is responsible for the trafficking of monocytes, macrophages and TH1 cells to inflamed tissues of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients (Trebst et al. (2001) American J of Pathology 159 p. 1701). Macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), macrophage chemoattractant protein 3 (MCP-3) and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) are all found in the CNS of MS patients, while MIP-1 alpha and RANTES are found in the CNS in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS (Review: Gerard and Rollins (2001) Nature Immunology). Macrophages and Th1 cells in the inflamed synovia of RA patients are also major producers of MIP-1 alpha and RANTES, which continuously recruit leukocytes to the synovial tissues of RA patients to propagate chronic inflammation (Volin et al. (1998) Clin. Immunol. Immunopathology; Koch et al. (1994) J. Clin. Investigation; Conlon et al. (1995) Eur. J. Immunology). Antagonizing the interactions between CCR1 and its chemokine ligands is hypothesized to block chemotaxis of monocytes, macrophages and Th1 cells to inflamed tissues and thereby ameliorate the chronic inflammation associated with autoimmune diseases such as RA and MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEvidence for the role of CCR1 in the development and progression of chronic inflammation associated with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis, is based on both genetic deletion and small molecule antagonists of CCR1. CCR1 deficient mice were shown to exhibit reduced susceptibility (55% vs. 100%) and reduced severity (1.2 vs. 2.5) of active EAE (Rottman et al. (2000) Eur. J. Immunology). Furthermore, administration of small molecule antagonist of CCR1, with moderate affinity (K\ni\n=120 nM) for rat CCR1, was shown to delay the onset and reduce the severity of EAE when administered intravenously (Liang et al. (2000) J. Biol. Chemistry). Treatment of mice with antibodies specific for the CCR1 ligand MIP1alpha have also been shown to be effective in preventing development of acute and relapsing EAE by reducing the numbers of T cells and macrophages recruited to the CNS (Karpus et al. (1995) J. Immunology; Karpus and Kennedy (1997) J. Leukocyte Biology). Thus, at least one CCR1 ligand has been demonstrated to recruit leukocytes to the CNS and propagate chronic inflammation in EAE, providing further in vivo validation for the role of CCR1 in EAE and MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo validation of CCR1 in the development and propagation of chronic inflammation associated with RA is also significant. For example, administration of a CCR1 antagonist in the collagen induced arthritis model (CIA) in DBA/1 mice has been shown to be effective in reducing synovial inflammation and joint destruction (Plater-Zyberk et al. (1997) Immunology Letters). Another recent publication described potent antagonists of murine CCR1 that reduced severity (58%) in LPS-accelerated collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), when administered orally (Biorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters (15 (2005) 5160-5164). Published results from a Phase I clinical trial with an oral CCR1 antagonist demonstrated a trend toward clinical improvement in the absence of adverse side effects (Haringman et al. (2003) Ann. Rheum. Dis.). One third of the patients achieved a 20% improvement in rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms (ACR20) on day 18 and CCR1 positive cells were reduced by 70% in the synovia of the treated patients, with significant reduction in specific cell types including 50% reduction in CD4\n+\n T cells, 50% reduction in CD8\n+\n T cells and 34% reduction in macrophages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies such as those cited above support a role for CCR1 in MS and RA and provide a therapeutic rationale for the development of CCR1 antagonists.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel compounds which block the interaction of CCR1 and its ligands and are thus useful for treating a variety of diseases and disorders that are mediated or sustained through the activity of CCR1 including autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, methods of using these compounds in the treatment of various diseases and disorders, processes for preparing

hereinabove in this application, in the event the nomenclature is in conflict with the structure, it shall be understood that the compound is defined by the structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to pharmaceutical preparations, containing as active substance one or more compounds of the invention, or the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, optionally combined with conventional excipients and/or carriers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention also include their isotopically-labelled forms. An isotopically-labelled form of an active agent of a combination of the present invention is identical to said active agent but for the fact that one or more atoms of said active agent have been replaced by an atom or atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number of said atom which is usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes which are readily available commercially and which can be incorporated into an active agent of a combination of the present invention in accordance with well established procedures, include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, e.g., \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, and \n36\nCl, respectively. An active agent of a combination of the present invention, a prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of either which contains one or more of the above-mentioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms is contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of any compounds of described above containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms may occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Isomers shall be defined as being enantiomers and diastereomers. All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. Each stereogenic carbon may be in the R or S configuration, or a combination of configurations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds of the invention can exist in more than one tautomeric form. The invention includes methods using all such tautomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll terms as used herein in this specification, unless otherwise stated, shall be understood in their ordinary meaning as known in the art. For example, “C\n1-4\nalkoxy” is a C\n1-4\nalkyl with a terminal oxygen, such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy. All alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups shall be understood as being branched or unbranched where structurally possible and unless otherwise specified. Other more specific definitions are as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarbocycles include hydrocarbon rings containing from three to twelve carbon atoms. These carbocycles may be either aromatic or non-aromatic ring systems. The non-aromatic ring systems may be mono- or polyunsaturated. Preferred carbocycles include but are not limited to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexenyl, cycloheptanyl, cycloheptenyl, phenyl, indanyl, indenyl, benzocyclobutanyl, dihydronaphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, naphthyl, decahydronaphthyl, benzocycloheptanyl and benzocycloheptenyl. Certain terms for cycloalkyl such as cyclobutanyl and cyclobutyl shall be used interchangeably.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heterocycle” refers to a stable nonaromatic 4-8 membered (but preferably, 5 or 6 membered) monocyclic or nonaromatic 8-11 membered bicyclic or spirocyclic heterocycle radical which may be either saturated or unsaturated. Each heterocycle consists of carbon atoms and one or more, preferably from 1 to 4 heteroatoms chosen from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur.

Such groups can be substituted as herein above described by groups such as oxo to result in definitions such as but not limited to: alkoxycarbonyl, acyl, amido and thioxo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “aryl” as used herein shall be understood to mean aromatic carbocycle or heteroaryl as defined herein. Each aryl or heteroaryl unless otherwise specified includes it's partially or fully hydrogenated derivative.

For example, a compound which would have a ‘dangling valency’, or a ‘carbanion’ are not compounds contemplated by the inventive methods disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of compounds of formula (I). A “pharmaceutically acceptable derivative” refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester, or any other compound which, upon administration to a patient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound useful for the invention, or a pharmacologically active metabolite or pharmacologically active residue thereof. A pharmacologically active metabolite shall be understood to mean any compound of the invention capable of being metabolized enzymatically or chemically.

Other acids, such as oxalic acid, while not themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N—(C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)\n4\n \n+\n salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, within the scope of the invention is use of prodrugs of compounds of the invention. Prodrugs include those compounds that, upon simple chemical transformation, are modified to produce compounds of the invention.

These examples are for the purpose of illustrating embodiments of this invention, and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way since, as recognized by one skilled in the art, particular reagents or conditions could be modified as needed for individual compounds. Starting materials used are either commercially available or easily prepared from commercially available materials by those skilled in the art. Reaction progress may be monitored by conventional methods such as thin layer chromatography (TLC) or liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Intermediates and products may be purified by methods known in the art, including flash chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or recrystallization. Amide bond formations may be carried out by standard coupling conditions well-known in the art (see, for example, M. Bodanszky, \nThe Practice of Peptide Synthesis \n(Springer-Verlag: 1984), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), for example, by reacting a carbocylic acid and an amine in the presence of 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Racemic compounds of this invention may be prepared in enantiomerically pure or enriched form by methods known in the art, including separation using chiral HPLC, resolution using a chiral reagent or auxiliary, and other asymmetric methods reported in the chemical literature (for examples, see Liu, G. et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n1997, 119, 9913; Chelucci, G. et al., \nTetrahedron: Asymmetry \n2006, 17, 3163; Chelucci, G. et al., \nTetrahedron \n2006, 62, 619). Furthermore, if certain functional groups are incompatible under the reaction conditions, protection/deprotection of these groups may be carried out using reagents and conditions readily selected by one of ordinary skill in the art (see, for example, P. G. M. Wuts and T. W. Greene, \nGreene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis \n(John Wiley & Sons: 2006), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods described below and in the Synthetic Examples section may be used to prepare the compounds of formula I.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the schemes below, Ar\n1\n, R\n1\n-R\n3 \nand X shall have the meanings defined in the detailed description of formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula I may be prepared as shown in Scheme 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs illustrated above, the desired beta-ketoacetate substituted with R\n1 \nwith the acid protected, for example as the t-butyl ester, is heated with dimethylformamide dimethylacetal in the presence of a suitable acid such as p-TsOH, preferably in a microwave oven. The resulting intermediate is then reacted with a hydrazine salt bearing Ar\n1\n, in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine to provide the pyrazole ester. The ester is converted to the acid by hydrolysis, or in the case of the t-butyl ester by treatment of HCl in dioxane, to provide the carboxylic acid. This is coupled with the desired amine using standard coupling conditions known in the art, for example by treatment with O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) in the presence of a suitable base such as morpholine to provide the desired compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternate procedure is illustrated in Scheme 2. In this procedure, the desired beta-ketoacetate ester substituted with R\n1 \nis heated with dimethylformamide dimethylacetal Followed by dilution with a suitable solvent such as EtOH and addition of hydrazine hydrate to provide the pyrazole ester substituted with R′. Conversion to the acid, for example by hydrolysis in aqueous base is then followed by coupling with the desired amine as described above. Reaction of the resulting pyrazole with Ar\n2\nI in the presence of CuI, a suitable base such as K\n2\nCO\n3\n, and suitable ligand such as trans-N,N′-dimethylcyclohexane-1,2-diamine in a solvent such as DMF provides the desired compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe products of formula (I) prepared as described in the schemes above may be further transformed by methods known in the art and described in the synthetic examples below to produce additional compounds of formula (I). Compounds prepared by the methods illustrated above and in the synthetic examples below are shown in Table 1 in the Detailed Description along with mass spectroscopy data obtained for the compounds.\n\n\n \nSYNTHETIC EXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n1-(3-Chloro-4-fluoro-phenyl)-5-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo a mixture of tert-butyl acetoacetate (1.1 mL, 6.8 mmol) and dimethylformamide-dimethylacetal (1.0 mL, 7.6 mmol) in a microwave tube is added a catalytic amount of TsOH.

invention are effective antagonists of the interactions between CCR1 and its chemokine ligands and thus antagonize CCR1-mediated activity. Therefore, in one embodiment of the invention, there is provided methods of treating autoimmune disorders using compounds of the invention. In another embodiment, there is provided methods of treating inflammatory disorders using compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by theory, by antagonizing the interactions between CCR1 and its chemokine ligands, the compounds block chemotaxis of pro-inflammatory cells including monocytes, macrophages dendritic cells, eosinophils, and T cells (TH1) cells and other CCR1 positive cells to inflamed tissues and thereby ameliorate the chronic inflammation associated with autoimmune diseases. Thus, the antagonism of CCR1 activity is an attractive means for preventing and treating a variety of autoimmune disorders, including inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, organ (Horuk et al. (2001) JBC 276 p. 4199) and bone marrow transplant rejection and other disorders associated with an influx of pro-inflammatory cells. For example, the compounds of the invention may be used to prevent or treat acute or chronic inflammation, allergies, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, graft versus host disease (and other forms of organ or bone marrow transplant rejection), Alzheimer's disease (Halks-Miller et al. (2003) Ann Neurol 54 p. 638), Asthma (Jouber et al. (2008) J. Immun 180 p. 1268) chronic kidney disease (Topham et al. (1999) J. Clin. Invest. 104 p. 1549), sepsis (He et al. (2007) Am J. Physio 292 p. G1173), autoimmune myocarditis (Futamats et al. (2006) J Mol Cell Cardiology 40 p. 853) and systemic lupus erythematosus. In particular, the compounds may be used to prevent or treat rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Other disorders associated with the trafficking of pro-inflammatory cells will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art and can also be treated with the compounds and compositions of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor treatment of the above-described diseases and conditions, a therapeutically effective dose will generally be in the range from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per dosage of a compound of the invention; preferably, from about 0.1 mg to about 20 mg/kg of body weight per dosage. For example, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would be from about 0.7 mg to about 7000 mg per dosage of a compound of the invention, preferably from about 7.0 mg to about 1400 mg per dosage. Some degree of routine dose optimization may be required to determine an optimal dosing level and pattern. The active ingredient may be administered from 1 to 6 times a day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneral Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen used as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the invention are typically administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Such compositions can be prepared using procedures well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one compound of the invention. The compounds of the invention may also be administered alone or in combination with adjuvants that enhance stability of the compounds of the invention, facilitate administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing them in certain embodiments, provide increased dissolution or dispersion, increased antagonist activity, provide adjunct therapy, and the like. The compounds according to the invention may be used on their own or in conjunction with other active substances according to the invention, optionally also in conjunction with other pharmacologically active substances. In general, the compounds of this invention are administered in a therapeutically or pharmaceutically effective amount, but may be administered in lower amounts for diagnostic or other purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the compounds of the invention, in pure form or in an appropriate pharmaceutical composition, can be carried out using any of the accepted modes of administration of pharmaceutical compositions. Thus, administration can be, for example, orally, buccally (e.g., sublingually), nasally, parenterally, topically, transdermally, vaginally, or rectally, in the form of solid, semi-solid, lyophilized powder, or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tablets, suppositories, pills, soft elastic and hard gelatin capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, or aerosols, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical compositions will generally include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound of the invention as the/an active agent, and, in addition, may include other medicinal agents, pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, diluents, vehicles, or combinations thereof. Such pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, or additives as well as methods of making pharmaceutical compositions for various modes or administration are well-known to those of skill in the art. The state of the art is evidenced, e.g., by \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n20th Edition, A. Gennaro (ed.), Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2000\n; Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives\n, Michael & Irene Ash (eds.), Gower, 1995\n; Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients\n, A. H. Kibbe (ed.), American Pharmaceutical Ass'n, 2000; H. C. Ansel and N. G. Popovish, \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, \n5th ed., Lea and Febiger, 1990; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entireties to better describe the state of the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs one of skill in the art would expect, the forms of the compounds of the invention utilized in a particular pharmaceutical formulation will be selected (e.g., salts) that possess suitable physical characteristics (e.g., water solubility) that is required for the formulation to be efficacious."
