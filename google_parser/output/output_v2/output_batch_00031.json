Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a novel diarylmethylamide derivative. The compound acts as a melanin-concentrating hormone receptor antagonist, and is useful as an agent for the prevention, treatment, or remedy of various circulatory diseases, neurological diseases, metabolic diseases, reproductive system diseases, respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, and the like.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nMelanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is cyclic peptide hormone/neuropeptide that was first isolated from the hypophysis of salmon by \nKawauchi et al., in 1983 [see Nature, Vol. 305, 321 (1983\n)], and is known to functionally antagonize melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the fishes to cause condensation of melanin granules in the melanophore, thus being involved in the body color change [see \nInternational Review of Cytology, Vol. 126, 1 (1991\n); \nTrends in Endocrinology and Metabolism, Vol. 5, 120 (1994\n)]. Further, in the mammals, although MCH-containing neuron cell bodies are localized in the lateral hypothalamic area and the zona incerta, the nerve fibers thereof project to an extremely large area in the brain [see \nThe Journal of Comparative Neurology, Vol. 319, 218 (1992\n)], and MCH is believed to be responsible for various central biological functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lateral hypothalamic area has been known as the feeding center from long ago, and further, in recent years, much molecular biological/pharmacological knowledge suggesting involvement of MCH in the energy homeostasis control has been accumulated. Specifically, it has been reported that expression of mRNA, an MCH precursor, is accelerated in the brain of genetic obesity model animals, i.e., ob/ob mice, db/db mice, KKAy mice, Zucker fatty rats, and fasted mice [see \nNature, Vol. 380, 243 (1996\n); \nDiabetes, Vol. 47, 294 (1998\n); \nBiochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 268, 88 (2000\n); \nMolecular Brain Research, Vol. 92, 43 (2001\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result of acute intraventricular administration of MCH to rats, an increase in food intake is observed [\nNature, Vol. 380, 243 (1996\n)], and chronic administration leads to obesity accompanied by bulimia [see \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 99, 3240 (2002\n)]. Further, in mice lacking MCH precursor gene, as compared with wild mice, reduced food consumption and increased oxygen consumption per body weight are seen, and also low body weight due to reduction in body fat is observed [see \nNature, Vol. 396,670 (1998\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeanwhile, transgenic mice that overexpress MCH precursor develop obesity, which is accompanied by bulimia, and insulin resistance [see \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation, Vol. 107, 379 (2001\n)]. This accordingly suggests that MCH is an important factor in the development of obesity, and is also involved in metabolic disorders and respiratory diseases for which obesity is a risk factor. In addition, MCH is known to be involved in, for example, anxiogenesis, epilepsy, memory/learning, diuresis, sodium/potassium excretion, oxytocin secretion, and reproduction/reproductive function [see\n Peptides, Vol. 17, 171 (1996\n); \nPeptides, Vol. 18, 1095 (1997\n); \nPeptides, Vol. 15, 757 (1994\n); \nJournal of Neuroendocrinology, Vol. 8, 57 (1996\n) \nCritical Reviews in Neurobiology, Vol. 8, 221 (1994\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMCH causes various pharmacological effects via MCH receptors existing mainly in the central nervous system. As MCH receptors, at least two types are known: type 1 receptor (MCH-1R or SLC-1) and type 2 receptor (MCH-2R or SLT) [see \nNature, Vol. 400, 261 (1999\n); \nNature, Vol. 400, 265 (1999\n); \nBiochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 261, 622 (1999\n); \nNature Cell Biology, Vol. 1, 267 (1999\n); \nFEBS Letters, Vol. 457, 522 (1999\n); \nBiochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 283, 1013 (2001\n); \nThe Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 276, 20125 (2001\n); \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 98, 7564 (2001\n); \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 98, 7576 (2001\n); \nThe Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 276, 34664 (2001\n); \nMolecular Pharmacology, Vol. 60, 632 (2001\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, pharmacological effects observed in the rodents are caused mainly via MCH-1R [see \nGenomics, Vol. 79, 785 (2002\n)]. From the fact that chronic administration of MCH to mice lacking MCH-1R gene does not induce bulimia or obesity, the energy metabolism control by MCH is known to be caused via MCH-1R. Further, it is known that deficiency of MCH-1R gene increases the amount of activity of a mouse [see \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 99, 3240 (2002\n)], and also, involvement in central diseases accompanied by behavior disorder, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, depression, and the like, is strongly suggested [see \nMolecular Medicine Today, Vol. 6, 43 (2000\n); \nTrends in Neuroscience, Vol. 24, 527 (2001\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \n In addition, the presence of an autoantibody against MCH-1R has been reported in the blood serum of vitiligo vulgaris patients [see \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation, Vol. 109, 923 (2002\n)]. MCH-1R expression in certain kinds of cancer cells has also been reported, and, in light of the MCH and MCH-1R expression sites in vivo, involvement of MCH in cancer, sleep/waking, drug dependence, and digestive diseases has also been suggested [see \nBiochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 289, 44 (2001\n); \nNeuroendocrinology, Vol. 61, 348 (1995\n); \nEndocrinology, Vol. 137, 561 (1996\n); \nThe Journal of Comparative Neurology, Vol. 435, 26 (2001\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe function of MCH is expressed by MCH binding to an MCH receptor. Accordingly, inhibition of binding of MCH to its receptor will inhibit the expression of MCH activity. Therefore, substances that antagonize binding of MCH to its receptor are expected to be useful as preventive or remedy for various MCH-related diseases, including metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, hormone secretion disorder, hyperlipemia, gout, fatty liver, and like; circulatory diseases such as angina pectoris, acute/congestive cardiac insufficiency, myocardial infarction, coronary arteriosclerosis, hypertension, nephropathy, electrolyte abnormality, and like; central and peripheral nervous system diseases such as bulimia, affective disorder, depression, anxiety, epilepsy, delirium, dementia, schizophrenia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dysmnesia, somnipathy, cognitive impairment, dyskinesia, dysesthesia, dysosmia, morphine resistance, drug dependence, alcohol dependence, and like; reproductive system diseases such as infertility, premature delivery, sexual dysfunction, and like; and other conditions including digestive diseases, respiratory diseases, cancer, chromatosis, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs compounds having MCH receptor antagonism, for example, \n \nWO 03/004027\n \n (Patent Document 1) and \n \nUS 2006/079683\n \n (Patent Document 2) disclose a number ofN-benzyl-4-phenylpiperidine derivatives. However, these specifications nowhere disclose a compound having an amide group bonded to methylene between two aryl groups, which is the feature of the invention.\n\n \n \n \nPatent Document 1: \n \nWO 03/004027\n \n pamphlet\n \nPatent Document 2: \n \nUS 2006/079683\n \n pamphlet\n \n\n\nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nPROBLEMS THAT THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors conducted extensive research on compounds having MCH receptor antagonism. As a result, they found that compounds having piperidine bonded through methylene to one of the aryl groups of diarylmethylamide are heretofore unknown, novel compounds, and that such compounds have MCH receptor antagonism and are effective in the prevention or treatment of various MCH-receptor-related diseases, and thus accomplished the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, the invention
