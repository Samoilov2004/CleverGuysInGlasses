In particular, the present invention relates to amino acid and peptide prodrugs of guanfacine which offer improved pharmacokinetic properties relative to guanfacine itself. The invention also relates to methods of reducing gastrointestinal (GI) side-effects associated with guanfacine therapy. These combined advantages should improve patient compliance and hence the drug's therapeutic effectiveness and patient benefit.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common psychiatric conditions affecting children. Prevalence estimates vary but according to data from the National Survey of Children's Health, ˜8% of US children were diagnosed with ADHD in 2003, 56% of whom were treated with medication (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2005), Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 54, 842-847). Psychostimulant medications are the mainstay of therapy for patients with ADHD (Pediatrics (2001), 108, 1033-1044; Arch Gen Psychiatry (1999), 56, 1073-1085; Pediatrics (2004), 113, 754-761). Although >80% of these patients receive stimulant drugs, <40% are reported to exhibit normal behavior with treatment. Additionally, ˜30% of patients either do not respond or cannot tolerate long term therapy with these agents. An additional concern is that these stimulants are classified by the US Drug Enforcement Administration as Schedule II Controlled Substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral classes of non-stimulant drugs appear to be efficacious in patients with ADHD including tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine and desipramine), bupropion, a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, atomoxetine, a norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor and α-2 adrenoceptor agonists clonidine and guanfacine. The latter has been reported to enhance frontal cortex functioning (PCF) in rats, monkeys and humans. In patients treated for ADHD with guanfacine, the drug may ameliorate prefrontal cortical deficits. Specifically, guanfacine appears to act primarily on the α-2 adrenoceptors in the prefrontal cortex, enhancing working memory, cognitive function and attentiveness.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGuanfacine: N-Amidino-2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)acetamide monohydrochloride\n\n\n \n \n \nHistorically, guanfacine was employed as an antihypertensive agent (TENEX®) due to its effectiveness in lowering blood pressure. Typically, doses of 1-2 mg and occasionally 3 mg/day have been used in the treatment of hypertension. Peak plasma drug levels are reached as early as 1 hour after dosing and may be associated with cardiovascular side effects or somnolence. The drug is usually taken at night to minimize the impact of this. Recently a new guanfacine product (INTUNIV®) has been developed for the treatment of ADHD. This is a sustained release formulation designed to minimize any acute cardiovascular or CNS depressant effects of the drug resulting from the normally rapid rise in plasma drug concentrations. In a recent pharmacokinetic study on INTUNIV® reported by Swearingen et al. (2007), Clin. Therap. 29, 617-624, peak plasma levels were not seen until 6 hours post dosing so minimizing any unwanted cardiovascular or CNS effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn common with other α-2 adrenoceptor agonists such as clonidine, guanfacine may inhibit gut motility, leading, in some cases and especially after the higher doses, to constipation. For example, the incidence of constipation reported for the 3 mg dose of TENEX® is ˜15% (FDA label). This may be due in part to a direct local interaction between the drug and α-2 adrenoceptors within the gut. Published data provides evidence not only for the presence of α-2 adrenoceptors in the GI tract and their role in influencing gut motility (Blandizzi (2007), Neurochemistry International, 51, 282-288), but also for a direct effect of selective α-2 adrenoceptor agonists such as UK14,304 on the motility reflexes of guinea pig ileum (Stebbing et al (2001), J of Physiol. 534 465-478). Such effects are clearly undesirable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nINTUNIV® is a controlled release product and one limitation of such formulations is that they may be subject to a food interaction. The presence of food in the stomach serves to raise the gastric pH and slow gastric emptying. This may lead to some erosion of the enteric coating, designed to break down at higher pH's, and some early drug release as a consequence. Administration of INTUNIV® with a high fat meal has been shown to elevate C\nmax \nby 75% and increase AUC by 40% (FDA label). While taking the drug under more appropriate prandial conditions may be desirable, this may not always be possible. Variations in the prandial state may therefore lead to some variability in rate and extent of drug exposure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn spite of the advantages offered by guanfacine, there continues to be a need to reduce side-effects associated with guanfacine therapy. There remains therefore a real need in the treatment of ADHD as well as hypertension for a guanfacine product which retains all the inherent pharmacological advantages of the drug molecule but overcomes its limitations in inducing adverse GI side-effects. The present invention addresses this need.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a guanfacine prodrug of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or tautomer thereof:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nP\n1 \nis hydrogen or -L-R;\n \nP\n2 \nis absent, hydrogen or -L-R;\n\n\nprovided that when P\n1 \nis hydrogen, P\n2 \nis not absent;\n\n \nL is absent, or a group selected from the group comprising:\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nan amino acid residue containing from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, and a peptide formed from 2 to 10 independently selected amino acids each containing from 2 to 20 carbon atoms;\n\n\nwherein:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nM\n1 \nis absent or is selected from the group comprising: —CH\n2\n—,\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R\n1 \nis selected from the group comprising: H, C\n1-4 \nalkyl and C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl;\n\n \n \n \n \n \nM\n2 \nis absent or is selected from the group comprising: —CH\n2\n—,\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R\n1 \nis selected from the group comprising: H, C\n1-4 \nalkyl and C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl;\n\n \n \n \n \n \nR\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare each independently selected at each occurrence from the group comprising: hydrogen, hydroxy, C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, C\n1-6 \nalkyl C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, —(CR\n4\nR\n5\n)\nn\nOC(═O)R\n6\n, —(CR\n4\nR\n5\n)\nn\nC(═O)R\n6\n, —C(═O)R\n6\n, C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n1-6 \nhaloalkyl, aryl, —NR\n4\nR\n5 \nand —NR\n4\n(CO)R\n6\n;

The method comprises orally administering an effective amount of a guanfacine prodrug of the present invention to the subject. The disorder may be one treatable with guanfacine. For example, the disorder may be attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). An alternative psychiatric condition treatable with guanfacine is oppositional defiance disorder (ODD). Alternatively, the disorder may be a cardiovascular condition such as hypertension. The disorder may also be a disorder selected from the group comprising: neuropathic pain, cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS), anxiety (including PTSD, OCD, self injury), addiction withdrawal and autism.

The method includes\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) forming a guanfacine prodrug of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) administering the prodrug or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a mammal in need thereof. Typically, the mammal is a human subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe guanfacine prodrugs described herein induce statistically significant lower average (e.g., mean) effects on gut motility in the gastrointestinal environment as compared to a non-prodrug guanfacine salt form such as guanfacine HCl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative aspect of the invention, a method for improving the pharmacokinetics and extending the duration of action of guanfacine in a subject in need thereof is provided. The method comprises administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a prodrug of the present invention, or a composition thereof, wherein the plasma concentration time profile is modulated to minimize an initial upsurge in concentration of guanfacine, minimizing any unwanted cardiovascular or somnolent effects, while significantly extending the time for which the drug persists in plasma (resulting from continuing generation from the prodrug) and hence duration of action.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, a method for reducing inter- or intra-subject variability of guanfacine plasma levels is provided. The method comprises administering to a subject, or group of subjects in need thereof, an effective amount of a prodrug of the present invention, or a composition thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method for minimizing gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation normally associated with administration of guanfacine. The method comprises orally administering a guanfacine prodrug or pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the present invention, and wherein upon oral administration, the prodrug or pharmaceutically acceptable salt minimizes, if not completely avoids, the gastrointestinal side effects usually seen after oral administration of the unbound guanfacine. The amount of guanfacine is preferably a therapeutically effective amount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to natural and/or non-natural amino acids and short-chain peptides of guanfacine which preclude interaction between the α-2 adrenoceptors located in the gut and the active drug, so minimizing the risk of constipation. In addition, the prodrugs provided herein deliver a pharmacologically effective amount of the drug to treat various psychiatric and/or cardiovascular conditions. Such use of prodrugs of guanfacine reduces intra- and inter-subject variability in plasma concentration and so provides consistent therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, the presence of quantities of unhydrolyzed prodrug in tissue compartments and/or plasma may provide a reservoir for continued generation of the active drug. Continued generation of guanfacine maintains plasma drug levels, thereby reducing the frequency of drug dosage. These benefits would be expected to improve patient compliance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese and other embodiments are disclosed or are apparent from and encompassed by the following Detailed Description.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n illustrates plasma concentration profiles for guanfacine following administration of guanfacine or \ncompound\n 1 to primates at 0.5 mg/kg guanfacine free base equivalents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n illustrates plasma concentration profiles for guanfacine following administration of guanfacine or \ncompound\n 2 to primates at 0.5 mg/kg guanfacine free base equivalents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n illustrates plasma concentration profiles for guanfacine following administration of guanfacine or \ncompound\n 5 to primates at 0.5 mg/kg guanfacine free base equivalents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n illustrates plasma concentration profiles for guanfacine following administration of guanfacine or \ncompound\n 61 to primates at 0.5 mg/kg guanfacine free base equivalents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n illustrates plasma concentration profiles for guanfacine following administration of guanfacine or \ncompound\n 63 to primates at 0.5 mg/kg guanfacine free base equivalents.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nA.

Prodrug moieties described herein may be referred to based on their amino acid or peptide and the dicarboxylate linker group. The amino acid or peptide in such a reference should be assumed to be bound via an amino terminus on the amino acid or peptide to one carboxyl group of the dicarboxylic acid, while the other carboxyl group is attached to guanfacine. The dicarboxylate linker group may or may not be variously substituted as stipulated earlier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “aryl” refers to an aromatic hydrocarbon ring system containing at least one aromatic ring.

Water or aqueous saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions are preferably employed as carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” by E.W. Martin, 18\nth \nEdition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to molecular entities and compositions that are generally regarded as safe. In particular, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in the practice of this invention are physiologically tolerable and do not typically produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction (for example, gastric upset, dizziness and the like) when administered to a patient. Preferably, as used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means approved by a regulatory agency of the appropriate governmental agency or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia or other generally recognized pharmacopoeia for use in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” means an excipient that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes an excipient that is acceptable for human pharmaceutical use. A “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” as used in the present application includes both one and more than one such excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “treating” includes: (1) preventing or delaying the appearance of clinical symptoms of the state, disorder or condition developing in a subject that may be afflicted with or predisposed to the state, disorder or condition but does not yet experience or display clinical or subclinical symptoms of the state, disorder or condition; (2) inhibiting the state, disorder or condition (e.g., arresting, reducing or delaying the development of the disease, or a relapse thereof in case of maintenance treatment, of at least one clinical or subclinical symptom thereof); and/or (3) relieving the condition (i.e., causing regression of the state, disorder or condition or at least one of its clinical or subclinical symptoms). The benefit to a subject to be treated is either statistically significant or at least perceptible to the subject or to the physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “subject” refers to humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Effective amount” means an amount of a prodrug or composition of the present invention sufficient to result in the desired therapeutic response. The therapeutic response can be any response that a user (e.g., a clinician) will recognize as an effective response to the therapy. The therapeutic response will generally be amelioration of the typical symptoms of ADHD. In further and/or alternative embodiments, the therapeutic response will be amelioration of the typical symptoms of opposition defiance disorder (ODD), hypertension, pain (neuropathic pain), cognitive impairment in psychosis, cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS), post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety (including PTSD, OCD, self injury), addiction withdrawal, autism, hot flushes, chemotherapy-induced mucositis, etc. It is further within the competency of one skilled in the art to determine appropriate treatment duration, appropriate doses, and any potential combination treatments, based upon an evaluation of therapeutic response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Reducing gastrointestinal side effects associated with guanfacine therapy” shall be understood to mean a reduction, amelioration and/or prevention of the occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects (e.g., constipation) realized in patients treated with the prodrug described herein as compared to patients which have received a non-prodrug guanfacine salt in an immediate release or sustained release form. Reduction of gastrointestinal side effects is deemed to occur when a patient achieves positive clinical results. For example, successful reduction of gastrointestinal side effects shall be deemed to occur when at least about 10% (i.e. at least about 15%) or preferably at least about 20%, more preferably at least about 30% or higher (i.e., about 40%, 50%) decrease in constipation including other clinical markers contemplated by the artisan in the field is realized when compared to that observed in the treatment with a non-prodrug guanfacine. In certain aspects, successful reduction of gastrointestinal side effects can be determined by changes in gut motility induced by the prodrug described herein as compared to a non-prodrug guanfacine salt in an immediate release or sustained release form. In this aspect, statistical significance relative to a non-prodrug guanfacine can be at least about 0.058, and preferably <0.001.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “at least about” comprises the numbers equal to or larger than the numbers referred to. In various embodiments, such as when referring to the decrease in gut motility, the term “at least about 15%” includes the terms “at least about 16%”, “at least about 17%”, at least about 18%” and so forth. Likewise, in some embodiments, the term “at least about 30%” includes the terms “at least about 31%”, “at least about 32%”, and so forth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “active ingredient,” unless specifically indicated, is to be understood as referring to the guanfacine portion of the prodrug, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “salts” can include acid addition salts or addition salts of free bases. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts (for example, of the carboxyl terminus of the amino acid or peptide) include, but are not limited to, metal salts such as sodium, potassium and cesium salts; alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts; organic amine salts such as triethylamine, guanidine and N-substituted guanidine salts, acetamidine and N-substituted acetamidine, pyridine, picoline, ethanolamine, triethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, and N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts (of basic nitrogen centers) include, but are not limited to inorganic acid salts such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, phosphate; organic acid salts such as trifluoroacetate and maleate salts; sulfonates such as methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, camphor sulfonate and naphthalenesulfonate; amino acid salts such as arginate, alaninate, asparginate and glutamate; and carbohydrate salts such as gluconate and galacturonate (see, for example, Berge, et al. “Pharmaceutical Salts,” \nJ. Pharm. Sci. \n1977; 66:1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “about,” unless otherwise indicated, refers to ±10% of the given value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes the synthesis of all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula (I) wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most commonly found in nature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution with stable isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. \n2\nH, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout the description and claims of this specification, the words “comprise” and “contain” and variations of the words, for example “comprising” and “comprises”, means “including but not limited to”, and is not intended to (and does not) exclude other moieties, additives, components, integers or steps.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout the description and claims of this specification, the singular encompasses the plural unless the context otherwise requires. In particular, where the indefinite article is used, the specification is to be understood as contemplating plurality as well as singularity, unless the context requires otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFeatures, integers, characteristics, compounds, chemical moieties or groups described in conjunction with a particular aspect, embodiment or example of the invention are to be understood to be applicable to any other aspect, embodiment or example described herein unless incompatible therewith.\n\n\n \nB. Advantages of the Guanfacine Prodrugs of the Present Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe use of the guanfacine prodrugs of the present invention provides a means of delivering guanfacine to the systemic circulation but avoiding direct contact between the active drug and α-2-adrenoceptors in the GI tract so minimizing any potential constipating effects. It is possible that part of the constipating actions of α-2-adrenoceptors may be elicited directly within the gut. Reduction of the adverse GI side-effects associated with administration may be a particular advantage of using a prodrug of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, guanfacine therapy with the prodrugs described herein, when administered orally, induces significantly lower average (i.e. mean) effects on gut motility in the gastrointestinal environment of the patient than a non-prodrug guanfacine salt form such as guanfacine hydrochloride salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the amino acid or peptide portion of the guanfacine prodrugs selectively exploits the inherent di- and tripeptide transporter Pept1 within the digestive tract. Once absorbed, these prodrugs may provide a reservoir from which the active drug species may continue to be generated simulating the delivery from a sustained release preparation. This approach avoids the need for enteric coated sustained release formulations which may be subject to premature coat erosion in the stomach due to the presence of food. Using a prodrug provides an alternate means of continuous delivery since it is believed that drug is released from the amino acid or peptide prodrug by hepatic and extrahepatic hydrolases which are, in part, present in red blood cells and/or plasma. Alternatively, the prodrug may be metabolized to an intermediate which may be converted to the active drug through chemical or enzymatic processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the use of the prodrugs of the present invention can provide greater consistency in response as the result of more consistent oral bioavailability. As a result of this consistent oral bioavailability, the prodrugs of the present invention offer a significant reduction of inter- and intrasubject variability of guanfacine plasma and CNS concentrations and, hence, significantly less fluctuation in therapeutic response for a single patient, or among a patient population providing improved patient benefit.\n\n\n \nC. Methods of Treatment\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a method for treating a disorder in a subject in need thereof with guanfacine. The method comprises orally administering an effective amount of a guanfacine prodrug of the present invention to the subject. The disorder may be one treatable with guanfacine. For example, the disorder may be psychiatric conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or oppositional defiance disorder. The prodrug can be any guanfacine prodrug encompassed by Formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a guanfacine conjugate of Formula (I) for use in the treatment of a psychiatric condition such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or oppositional defiance disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for minimizing the gastrointestinal side effects normally associated with administration of guanfacine. The method comprises orally administering a guanfacine prodrug or pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the present invention, and wherein upon oral administration, the prodrug or pharmaceutically acceptable salt minimizes, if not completely avoids, the constipating effects frequently seen after administration of higher oral doses of the unbound guanfacine. The amount of guanfacine is preferably a therapeutically effective amount. The prodrug can be any guanfacine prodrug encompassed by Formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the above, there are provided methods of reducing gastrointestinal side effects associated with guanfacine therapy in a mammal. The methods include:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) forming a guanfacine prodrug of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) administering the prodrug or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a mammal in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in a mammal. The method includes administering a prodrug of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a mammal in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a guanfacine conjugate of Formula (I) for use in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in a mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating hypertension in a mammal. The method is conducted by administering a prodrug of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a mammal in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a guanfacine conjugate of Formula (I) for use in the treatment of hypertension in a mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdeally, the prodrugs employed in the methods described herein, when administered orally, should achieve therapeutically effective guanfacine plasma concentration. In one embodiment, the prodrugs employed in the method described herein include guanfacine attached to valine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred embodiment, the prodrugs of Formula (I) or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are orally administered. In some preferred embodiments, the method protocol includes administering the prodrugs of Formula (I) or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in a daily amount of from about 1 mg to about 100 mg, preferably from about 1 mg to about 50 mg, more preferably from about 1 mg to about 15 mg, more preferably from about 1 mg to about 10 mg and more preferably from about 1 mg to about 5 mg based on the amount of guanfacine in free base form. If the systemic availability from the prodrug yields a lower absolute oral bioavailablity, then the preferred dosage is from about 2 mg to about 10 mg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn all aspects of the invention where the conjugate of Formula (I) or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered, the dosage mentioned is based on the amount of guanfacine free base rather than the amount of the conjugate administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present method is useful for, among other things, avoiding the constipating effects associated with guanfacine administration resulting from α-2 adrenoceptor mediated inhibition of gut motility as compared to a treatment with guanfacine in non-prodrug salt form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the present invention provides a method for improving the pharmacokinetics of guanfacine in a subject in need thereof. The method comprises administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a prodrug of the present invention, or a composition thereof, wherein the rate and consistency of delivery of guanfacine provided by the prodrug offers advantage over that seen when guanfacine in a non-prodrug form is administered alone. These benefits include a modulation of the attainment of C\nmax \nso minimizing unwanted cardiovascular effects, greater consistency in attainment of plasma levels and thereby therapeutic response and prolonged maintenance of plasma drug levels reducing dosing frequency and improving patient compliance. The prodrug can be any guanfacine prodrug encompassed by Formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further alternative aspect, the present invention provides a method of reducing effects of guanfacine on gut motility. The method includes the steps of\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) reacting guanfacine with an activated amino acid (e.g. glutamic acid) capable of forming a covalent bond with the guanfacine under conditions effective to form a prodrug of Formula (I) and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) administering the prodrug of Formula (I) or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a mammal in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a guanfacine conjugate of Formula (I) for use in the reduction of the effects of guanfacine on gut motility.\n\n\n \nD. Salts, Solvates, & Derivatives of the Compounds of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe methods of the present invention further encompass the use of salts and solvates of the guanfacine prodrugs described herein. In one embodiment, the invention disclosed herein is meant to encompass all pharmaceutically acceptable salts of guanfacine prodrugs (including those of the carboxyl terminus of the amino acid as well as those of the basic nitrogens).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a prodrug of guanfacine used in the practice of the present invention is prepared by reaction of the prodrug with an acid or base as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent in accordance with methods well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe acid addition salts of the prodrugs may be prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free base form may be regenerated by contacting the salt form with a base and isolating the free base in the conventional manner. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to their respective free base for purposes of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts are formed with metal bases or amines, such as alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides or organic amines. Examples of metals used as cations are sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and the like. Examples of suitable amines are N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, and procaine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe base addition salts of the acidic compounds are prepared by contacting the free acid form with a sufficient amount of the desired base to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free acid form may be regenerated by contacting the salt form with an acid and isolating the free acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds useful in the practice of the present invention may have both a basic and an acidic center and may therefore be in the form of zwitterions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art of organic chemistry will appreciate that many organic compounds can form complexes, i.e., solvates, with solvents in which they are reacted or from which they are precipitated or crystallized, e.g., hydrates with water. The salts of compounds useful in the present invention may form solvates such as hydrates useful therein. Techniques for the preparation of solvates are well known in the art (see, for example, Brittain. \nPolymorphism in Pharmaceutical solids\n. Marcel Decker, New York, 1999). The compounds useful in the practice of the present invention can have one or more chiral centers and, depending on the nature of individual components, they can also have geometrical isomers.\n\n\n \nE. Pharmaceutical Compositions of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nWhile it is possible that, for use in the methods of the invention, the prodrug may be administered as the bulk substance, it is preferable to present the active ingredient in a pharmaceutical formulation, e.g., wherein the agent is in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The compositions of the present invention also include pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the guanfacine prodrugs, as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile it is anticipated that the formulations of the invention may be immediate-release dosage forms, i.e., dosage forms that release the prodrug at the site of absorption immediately, in an alternative embodiment, the prodrugs described herein can be as part of controlled-release formulation, i.e. dosage forms that release the prodrug over a predetermined period of time. Controlled release dosage forms may be of any conventional type, e.g. in the form of reservoir or matrix-type diffusion-controlled dosage forms; matrix, encapsulated or enteric-coated dissolution-controlled dosage forms; or osmotic dosage forms. Dosage forms of such types are disclosed, for example, in Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20\nth \nEdition, 2000, pp. 858-914.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, since absorption of amino acid and peptide prodrugs of guanfacine may proceed via an active transporter such as Pept1, unconventional controlled dosage forms may be desirable. As the Pept1 transporter is believed to be largely confined to the upper GI tract, this may limit the opportunity for continued absorption along the whole length of the GI tract. For those prodrugs of guanfacine which do not result in sustained plasma drugs levels due to continuous generation of active from a systemic reservoir of prodrug—but which may offer other advantages—gastroretentive or mucoretentive formulations analogous to those used in metformin products such as Glumetz® or Gluphage XR® may be useful. The former exploits a drug delivery system known as Gelshield Diffusion™ Technology while the latter uses a so-called Acuform™ delivery system. In both cases the concept is to retain drug in the stomach, slowing drug passage into the ileum maximizing the period over which absorption takes place and effectively prolonging plasma drug levels. Other drug delivery systems affording delayed progression along the GI tract may also be of value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations of the present invention can be administered from one to six times daily, depending on the dosage form and dosage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition containing at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient (i.e., a guanfacine prodrug), or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative (e.g., a salt or solvate) thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or other excipient. In particular, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition including a therapeutically effective amount of at least one prodrug described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the methods of the invention, the prodrug employed in the present invention may be used in combination with other therapies and/or active agents. Accordingly, the present invention provides, in a further aspect, a pharmaceutical composition including at least one compound useful in the practice of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, a second active agent, and, optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen combined in the same formulation, it will be appreciated that the two compounds must be stable and compatible with each other and the other components of the formulation. When formulated separately the compounds may be provided in any convenient formulation, conveniently in such manner as is known for such compounds in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prodrugs used herein may be formulated for administration in any convenient way for use in human medicine and the invention therefore includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention adapted for use in human medicine. Such compositions may be presented for use in a conventional manner with the aid of one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. Acceptable carriers and excipients for therapeutic use are well-known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985). The choice of pharmaceutical carrier can be selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The pharmaceutical compositions may include, in addition to the carrier, any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s), and/or solubilizing agent(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreservatives, stabilizers, dyes and even flavoring agents may be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, ascorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds used in the invention may be milled using known milling procedures such as wet milling to obtain a particle size appropriate for tablet formation and for other formulation types. Finely divided (nanoparticulate) preparations of the compounds may be prepared by processes known in the art, for example, see International Patent Application No. WO 02/00196 (SmithKline Beecham).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prodrugs and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are intended to be administered orally (e.g., as a tablet, sachet, capsule, pastille, pill, bolus, powder, paste, granules, bullets or premix preparation, ovule, elixir, solution, suspension, dispersion, gel, syrup or as an ingestible solution). In addition, compounds may be present as a dry powder for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use, optionally with flavoring and coloring agents. Solid and liquid compositions may be prepared according to methods well-known in the art. Such compositions may also contain one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients which may be in solid or liquid form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDispersions can be prepared in a liquid carrier or intermediate, such as glycerin, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin oils, and mixtures thereof. The liquid carrier or intermediate can be a solvent or liquid dispersive medium that contains, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol or the like), vegetable oils, non-toxic glycerine esters and suitable mixtures thereof. Suitable flowability may be maintained, by generation of liposomes, administration of a suitable particle size in the case of dispersions, or by the addition of surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets may contain excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate and glycine, disintegrants such as starch (preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), sodium starch glycolate, croscarmellose sodium and certain complex silicates, and granulation binders such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), sucrose, gelatin and acacia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and talc may be included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of pharmaceutically acceptable disintegrants for oral compositions useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose sodium, microcrystalline cellulose, alginates, resins, surfactants, effervescent compositions, aqueous aluminum silicates and crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of pharmaceutically acceptable binders for oral compositions useful herein include, but are not limited to, acacia; cellulose derivatives, such as methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose or hydroxyethylcellulose; gelatin, glucose, dextrose, xylitol, polymethacrylates, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, tragacanth, xanthane resin, alginates, magnesium aluminum silicate, polyethylene glycol or bentonite.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of pharmaceutically acceptable fillers for oral compositions useful herein include, but are not limited to, lactose, anhydrolactose, lactose monohydrate, sucrose, dextrose, mannitol, sorbitol, starch, cellulose (particularly microcrystalline cellulose), dihydro- or anhydro-calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of pharmaceutically acceptable lubricants useful in the compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to, magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol, polymers of ethylene oxide, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, sodium oleate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and colloidal silicon dioxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable odorants for the oral compositions include, but are not limited to, synthetic aromas and natural aromatic oils such as extracts of oils, flowers, fruits (e.g., banana, apple, sour cherry, peach) and combinations thereof, and similar aromas. Their use depends on many factors, the most important being the organoleptic acceptability for the population that will be taking the pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable dyes for the oral compositions include, but are not limited to, synthetic and natural dyes such as titanium dioxide, beta-carotene and extracts of grapefruit peel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of pharmaceutically acceptable coatings for the oral compositions, typically used to facilitate swallowing, modify the release properties, improve the appearance, and/or mask the taste of the compositions include, but are not limited to, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose and acrylate-methacrylate copolymers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable examples of pharmaceutically acceptable sweeteners for the oral compositions include, but are not limited to, aspartame, saccharin, saccharin sodium, sodium cyclamate, xylitol, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose and sucrose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable examples of pharmaceutically acceptable buffers useful herein include, but are not limited to, citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, dibasic sodium phosphate, magnesium oxide, calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable examples of pharmaceutically acceptable surfactants useful herein include, but are not limited to, sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules. Preferred excipients in this regard include lactose, starch, a cellulose, milk sugar or high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. For aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs, the agent may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, with emulsifying and/or suspending agents and with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol and glycerin, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable examples of pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives include, but are not limited to, various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as solvents, for example ethanol, propylene glycol, benzyl alcohol, chlorobutanol, quaternary ammonium salts, and parabens (such as methyl paraben, ethyl paraben, and propyl paraben).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable examples of pharmaceutically acceptable stabilizers and antioxidants include, but are not limited to, ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA), thiourea, tocopherol and butyl hydroxyan (hydroxyanisole).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may contain from 0.01 to 99% weight per volume of the prodrugs encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\n \nF. Doses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe doses described throughout the specification refer to the amount of guanfacine in the composition, in free base form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAppropriate patients (subjects) to be treated according to the methods of the invention include any human in need of such treatment. Methods for the diagnosis and clinical evaluation of ADHD or ODD including the severity of the condition experienced by a human are well known in the art. Thus, it is within the skill of the ordinary practitioner in the art (e.g., a medical doctor) to determine if a patient is in need of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual subject. The specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular individual may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual undergoing therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, an effective amount of prodrugs of Formula (I) is from about 1 mg to about 100 mg, preferably from about 1 to about 50 mg, and more preferably from about 1 mg to about 5 mg. If the prodrugs of Formula (I) provide near complete oral bioavailability, the preferred dosage is from about 1 to about 5 mg, based on the currently effective maximum daily doses of from about 1 to about 5 mg. If the systemic availability from the prodrug yields a lower absolute oral bioavailablity, then the preferred dosage is from about 2 mg to about 10 mg. The prodrugs, as described herein, may be administered once daily or divided into multiple doses as part of multiple dosing treatment protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the severity of the condition to be treated, a suitable therapeutically effective and safe dosage, as may readily be determined within the skill of the art, and without undue experimentation, may be administered to subjects. For oral administration to humans, the daily dosage level of the prodrug may be in single or divided doses. The duration of treatment may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, and should reflect the magnitude of the condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the methods of treating ADHD/ODD or hypertension, the prodrugs encompassed by the present invention may be administered in conjunction with other therapies and/or in combination with other active agents. For example, the prodrugs encompassed by the present invention may be administered to a patient in combination with other active agents used in the management of these conditions. An active agent to be administered in combination with the prodrugs encompassed by the present invention may include, for example, a drug selected from the group consisting of stimulant drugs such as amphetamine or methyl phenidate or non stimulant agents such atomoxetine. In such combination therapies, the prodrugs encompassed by the present invention may be administered prior to, concurrent with, or subsequent to the other therapy and/or active agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the prodrugs encompassed by the present invention are administered in conjunction with another active agent, the individual components of such combinations may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or combined pharmaceutical formulations by any convenient route. When administration is sequential, either the prodrugs encompassed by the present invention or the second active agent may be administered first. For example, in the case of a combination therapy with another active agent, the prodrugs encompassed by the present invention may be administered in a sequential manner in a regimen that will provide beneficial effects of the drug combination. When administration is simultaneous, the combination may be administered either in the same or different pharmaceutical compositions. For example, the prodrugs encompassed by the present invention and another active agent may be administered in a substantially simultaneous manner, such as in a single capsule or tablet having a fixed ratio of these agents or in multiple, separate capsules or tablets for each agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the prodrugs encompassed by the present invention are used in combination with another agent active in the methods for treating ADHD/ODD or hypertension, the dose of each compound may differ from that when the compound is used alone.

Synthesis of the Prodrugs\n\n\n \n \n \nGenerally, the methods of preparing prodrugs described herein include reacting guanfacine with an activated amino acid or peptide under conditions effective to form prodrugs of Formula (I). Activated amino acids useful in the methods described herein can be prepared by standard techniques known to those of ordinary skill, for example, coupling a dipeptide with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) to prepare an NHS ester, reacting an amino acid with phosgene to prepare isocyanate, or extending an amino acid with a dicarboxylic acid which can be activated as an NHS ester. The methods provide a guanfacine prodrug where guanfacine is bonded to a dipeptide through an amide linkage, to a dipeptide through a carbamate linkage, to an amino acid through urea linkage, or to an amino acid through a dicarboxylic acid linker forming an amide linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor purposes of illustration, the methods of preparing prodrugs described herein include:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) reacting an activated amino acid and peptide having the formula;\n\n\n \n \n \nLG-L\ni\n-R\na\n—PG\n\n\n\n \n \nwith an amino group of guanfacine under basic conditions sufficient to form a protected guanfacine prodrug having the formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) deprotecting the guanfacine prodrug with an acid to form a prodrug of Formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein\n\n\n \n \n \n \nL\n1 \nis an amino acid, a carbonyl or a dicarboxylic acid;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\na \nis an amino acid or a peptide,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLG is a leaving group; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPG is a protecting group such as BOC and t-Bu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe leaving group useful in the preparation includes NHS or p-nitrophenyloxy and other leaving groups known by those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood that other art recognized protecting groups can be used in place of BOC and t-Bu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the reactions are carried out in an inert solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), ethyl acetate, methanol, methylene chloride, chloroform, N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) or mixtures thereof. The reactions can be preferably conducted in the presence of a base, such as N-methylmorpholine (NMM), dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, triethylamine, etc. to neutralize any acids generated. The reactions can be carried out at a temperature from about 0° C. up to about 22° C. (room temperature).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nPreferably The present invention is further illustrated by reference to the following Examples.

Glutaryl-(S)-valine tert-butyl ester was obtained through the reaction of (S)-valine tert-butyl ester with glutaric anhydride. An ‘activated ester’ was prepared from glutaryl-(S)-valine tert-butyl ester by DCC coupling with N-hydroxysuccinimide. The ester was then reacted with guanfacine to give guanfacine-[glutaryl-(S)-valine]amide tert-butyl ester. Removal of the tert-butyl group was achieved by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid to give guanfacine-[glutaryl-(S)-valine]amide trifluoroacetate.

Subsequent debenzylation afforded N-Boc-(S)valine-β-alanine and this was then converted to a second ‘activated ester’ by DCC coupling with N-hydroxysuccinimide. This activated ester was coupled with guanfacine to give N-Boc-(S)valine-β-alanine-guanfacine.

The protected serine was then coupled to N-Boc-sarcosine N-hydroxysuccinimide ester to yield N-Boc-sarcosine-(S)-serine(Bn) tert-butyl ester. The benzyl ester of serine was deprotected by palladium catalysed hydrogenation followed by activation with N,N′-disuccinimidyl carbonate (DSC) to give an ‘activated carbonate’. The ‘activated carbonate’ was coupled with guanfacine to give N-Boc-sarcosine-(S)-serine(CO.guanfacine) tert-butyl ester.

A direct action on these receptors in the intestine could be partially responsible for the constipation associated with guanfacine use. If the prodrug were to be prematurely hydrolyzed, the gut would be exposed to the actions of the parent active drug which could lead to a reduction in gut motility. Premature hydrolysis of the guanfacine prodrug would also negate the opportunity to deliver systemically the prodrug from which the active drug might be continuously generated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethodology\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rate and extent of hydrolysis of various guanfacine prodrugs was investigated under the conditions prevailing in the GI tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious guanfacine amino acid prodrugs were incubated at 37° C. in simulated gastric and simulated intestinal juice (USP defined composition) for 1 hour and 2 hours, respectively.

These include the proteinogenic dipeptide prodrugs of guanfacine conjugated through the alpha carboxylic acid which were commonly quite unstable under the conditions existing in the GI tract although the val-val conjugate did display some limited stability. The N-acetylated amino acid prodrugs of guanfacine conjugated through the alpha carboxylic acid also demonstrated poor stability. The dipeptide prodrugs conjugated to guanfacine through a non-alpha carboxylic acid functional group such as β alanine and γ glutamic acid were more stable. The carbamate-bridged conjugates were generally very stable while the highest stability was observed with urea bridged conjugates and cyclised amino acid derivatives. The dicarboxylic acid bridged amino acid prodrugs and direct amide conjugates displayed intermediate stability.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nStability of Guanfacine Prodrugs to Enzymes Present in Freshly Withdrawn Porcine Intestinal Fluid\n\n\n \n \n \nMany of the peptidases in the intestinal lumen may not be present in the USP simulated intestinal fluid preparations previously described.

Variations in the prandial state may therefore lead to some variability in rate and extent of drug exposure. Guanfacine prodrugs should therefore ideally be devoid of such a food interaction in order to deliver similar guanfacine levels in the fed and fasted state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethodology\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFive male cynomolgus monkeys were used. Food was withdrawn from animals in fasted groups from the evening of the day prior to dosing until approximately 4 hours after dosing. The vehicle for the compounds was sterile water for irrigation (guanfacine and compound 2) or 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (compound 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations were prepared on the day of dosing and administered orally as soon as practicable up to a maximum of 2 hours after formulation. Animals were dosed at 0.5 mg/kg guanfacine free base equivalents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood samples (0.5 mL) were collected from all animals pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 10, 12, 16 and 24 hours after dosing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing processing, the resultant plasma was frozen and analysed by a qualified method. Pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed using a validated pharmacokinetic software package.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing oral administration of the prodrugs, food did not affect the rate and extent of absorption of the prodrugs and the extent of formation of guanfacine.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuanfacine pharmacokinetic parameters following administration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof guanfacine or prodrugs to the cynomolgus monkey in fasted or\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfed condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGuanfacine\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nequivalent\n\n\n \n\n\nmean C\nmax\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndose\n\n\n \n\n\n(ng/mL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest compound\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\nFood status\n\n\nguanfacine\n\n\nprodrug\n\n\nF\nrel \n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuanfacine\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nFasted\n\n\n31.3\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuanfacine\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nFed\n\n\n30.2\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/\nA\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nFasted\n\n\n6.82\n\n\n9.23\n\n\n27.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nFed\n\n\n6.11\n\n\n7.19\n\n\n27.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nFasted\n\n\n20.5\n\n\nBLQ\n\n\n59.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nFed\n\n\n17.7\n\n\n2.15\n\n\n53.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nN/A—Not applicable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe apparent absence of a food effect for guanfacine is a consequence of its administration as unformulated guanfacine in place of the commercial sustained release formulation.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nThe Pharmacokinetics of Guanfacine and Prodrugs in Rats in Hepatic Portal and Tail Veins Following Oral Administration of Guanfacine or Prodrug\n\n\n \n \n \nThe absorption of intact prodrug and conversion of prodrug to guanfacine after absorption is important if any local effects of the active compound on \nalpha\n 2 adrenoceptors in the gastrointestinal tract are to be minimised.

This suggests a lack of extensive degradation of the prodrugs prior to absorption and a reduction in the potential to elicit a direct pharmacological effect in the gut lumen.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nIn Vitro Assessment of the Effects of Guanfacine and Selected Prodrugs on α-2A Adrenoceptor Binding\n\n\n \n \n \nThe target receptor for guanfacine is the human α-2A adrenoceptor subtype in the central nervous system. The activation of this receptor is responsible for its intended therapeutic effect. However, it is possible that local activation of α-2A adrenoceptors present in the gut contributes to adverse gastrointestinal effects (constipation) associated with guanfacine. The receptor binding of the prodrugs was investigated to confirm that the prodrug molecules had been largely inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding assay methodology employed in this study followed that described by Langin et al. (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 167:95-104, 1989) and used human recombinant CHO cells expressing α-2 adrenoceptors. The competitive binding ligand was [3H] RX821002 (1 nM) which has a high affinity for the alpha-2A subtype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are set forth in Table 17. Guanfacine in non-prodrug form showed considerable potency as a competitive binding agent at the α-2A adrenoceptor displaying an Ki of 32 nM. The prodrugs tested in the assay were all less potent binding agents to the receptor with most displaying Ki values greater than 30-fold those obtained with guanfacine. Thus, the prodrugs described herein would have little or no effect on intestinal α-2A adrenoceptors and hence potentially have a diminished ability to induce constipation through direct actions on gut motility, compared to guanfacine in non-prodrug form.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding of guanfacine and various\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprodrugs at α-2A adrenoceptor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGuanfacine\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n1200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n7200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n41 \n\n\n1700\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n1600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n61 \n\n\n10000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nIn Vivo Effects of Guanfacine and its Prodrugs on Gut Motility in Rat\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of a drug on gut motility can be studied by means of the charcoal propulsion test. Drugs known to cause constipation such as morphine and guanfacine significantly delay the transit of a charcoal meal in the rat. The effects of guanfacine in non-prodrug form and its prodrugs on GI motility were assessed in groups of 10 rats fasted overnight prior to the test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method used was based on that described by Takemori et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 169:39, 1969). Test treatments were administered orally 60 minutes prior to an oral dose of a 10% suspension of charcoal in 2.5% gum Arabic (2 ml/kg). Twenty minutes after dosing with charcoal, the rats were sacrificed and the entire gastrointestinal tract was removed quickly and carefully. The distance that the charcoal meal had traveled toward the caecum was measured and expressed as a percentage of the total gut length. The results are described in Table 18.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrally administered guanfacine in non-prodrug form at a dose of 0.1 mg base/kg had significant effects on gut motility with 41-52% reduction in the distance traveled by the charcoal plug within 20 minutes, compared to that of the control group (treated with the vehicle). All the prodrugs were considerably less potent than guanfacine in the inhibition of GIT transit in the rat. Notably the doses of \n \n \ncompounds\n \n \n 2, 61 and 63 required to inhibit GIT transit to the same extent as guanfacine were 10-fold or greater expressed as molar equivalents. The comparative systemic exposure to guanfacine in rats following oral administration of \n \ncompounds\n \n 61 and 63 was similar to that following guanfacine administration at an equimolar dose. For \ncompound\n 2 the systemic guanfacine exposure was \nca\n 40% compared to guanfacine administration.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of guanfacine or prodrugs on gastrointestinal transit of a\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncharcoal meal in the rat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDose (guanfacine free base equivalents) mg/kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.03\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\n% inhibition of GIT transit compard to \nvehicle\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuanfacine\n\n\n \n\n\n−52\n\n\n−55\n\n\n \n\n\n−47\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n+3\n\n\n−30\n\n\n \n\n\n−42\n\n\n \n\n\n−42\n\n\n−42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n−9\n\n\n−6\n\n\n \n\n\n−45\n\n\n \n\n\n−50\n\n\n−53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n−6\n\n\n−22\n\n\n \n\n\n−48\n\n\n−50\n\n\n−44\n\n\n−42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nStudy\n 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuanfacine\n\n\n−13\n\n\n−41\n\n\n−56\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n61 \n\n\n \n\n\n−8\n\n\n−25\n\n\n \n\n\n−31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n63 \n\n\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n−13\n\n\n \n\n\n−49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being by bound by any theory, the lack of effects on gut motility by the prodrugs is attributed in part to the reduced or minimally available active drug (guanfacine) within the gut lumen to interact locally with α-2 adrenoceptors."

It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art to the presently claimed invention, or relevant, nor that any of the publications specifically or implicitly referenced are prior art.\n\n\nThe exendins are peptides that are found in the salivary secretions of the Gila monster and the Mexican Beaded Lizard, reptiles that are endogenous to Arizona and Northern Mexico. Exendin-3 [SEQ ID NO: 1, i.e., His Ser Asp Gly Thr Phe Thr Ser Asp Leu Ser Lys Gln Met Glu Glu Glu Ala Val Arg Leu Phe Ile Glu Trp Leu Lys Asn Gly Gly Pro Ser Ser Gly Ala Pro Pro Pro Ser-NH\n2\n] is present in the salivary secretions of \nHeloderma horridum \n(Mexican Beaded Lizard), and exendin-4 [SEQ ID NO: 2, i.e., His Gly Glu Gly Thr Phe Thr Ser Asp Leu Ser Lys Gln Met Glu Glu Glu Ala Val Arg Leu Phe Ile Glu Trp Leu Lys Asn Gly Gly Pro Ser Ser Gly Ala Pro Pro Pro Ser-NH\n2\n] is present in the salivary secretions of \nHeloderma suspectum \n(Gila monster) (Eng, J., et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n265:20259-62, 1990; Eng, J., et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n267:7402-05, 1992). The amino acid sequence of exendin-3 is shown in \nFIG. 1\n. The amino acid sequence of exendin-4 is shown in \nFIG. 2\n. Exendin-4 was first thought to be a (potentially toxic) component of the venom. It now appears that exendin-4 is devoid of toxicity, and that it instead is made in salivary glands in the Gila monster.\n\n\nThe exendins have some sequence similarity to several members of the glucagon-like peptide family, with the highest homology, 53%, being to GLP-1 [7-36]NH\n2 \n[SEQ ID NO: 3] (Goke, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n268:19650-55, 1993). GLP-1 [7-36]NH\n2\n, also sometimes referred to as proglucagon[78-107] or simply “GLP-1” as used most often herein, has an insulinotropic effect, stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells; GLP-1 has also been reported to inhibit glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha-cells (Ørsov, et al., \nDiabetes, \n42:658-61, 1993; D'Alessio, et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest., \n97:133-38, 1996). GLP-1 has been reported to inhibit gastric emptying (Willms B, et al., \nJ Clin Endocrinol Metab \n81 (1): 327-32, 1996; Wettergren A, et al., \nDig Dis Sci \n38 (4): 665-73, 1993), and gastric acid secretion (Schjoldager B T, et al., \nDig Dis Sci \n34 (5): 703-8, 1989; O'Halloran D J, et al., \nJ Endocrinol \n126 (1): 169-73, 1990; Wettergren A, et al., \nDig Dis Sci \n38 (4): 665-73, 1993)). GLP-1 [7-37], which has an additional glycine residue at its carboxy terminus, is reported to stimulate insulin secretion in humans (Ørskov, et al., \nDiabetes, \n42:658-61, 1993). A transmembrane G-protein adenylate-cyclase-coupled receptor said to be responsible at least in part for the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 has reportedly been cloned from a beta-cell line (Thorens, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n89:8641-45, 1992). GLP-1 has been the focus of significant investigation in recent years due to its reported action on the amplification of stimulated insulin production (Byrne M M, Goke B. Lessons from human studies with glucagon-like peptide-1: Potential of the gut hormone for clinical use. In: Fehmann H C, Goke B. Insulinotropic Gut Hormone Glucagon-Like Peptide 1. Basel, Switzerland: Karger, 1997:219-33).\n\n\nOther reports relate to the inhibition of gastric emptying (Wettergren A, et al., Truncated GLP-1 (proglucagon 78-107-amide) inhibits gastric and pancreatic functions in man, \nDig. Dis. Sci. \n1993 April; 38(4):665-73), inhibition of glucagon secretion (Creutzfeldt W O C, et al., Glucagonostatic actions and reduction of fasting hyperglycemia by exogenous glucagon-like peptide I(7-36) amide in \ntype\n 1 diabetic patients, \nDiabetes Care \n1996; 19(6):580-6), and a purported role in appetite control (Turton M D, et al., A role for glucagon-like peptide-1 in the central regulation of feeding, \nNature \n1996 January; 379(6560):69-72).\n\n\nGLP-1 has also been reported to restore islet glucose sensitivity in aging rats, restoring their glucose tolerance to that of younger rats (Egan J M, et al., Glucagon-like peptide-1 restores acute-phase insulin release to aged rats, Diabetologia 1997 June; 40 (Suppl 1):A130). However, the short duration of biological action of GLP-1 in vivo is one feature of the peptide that has hampered its development as a therapeutic agent. Various methods have been tried to prolong the half-life of GLP-1 or GLP-1 (7-37), including attempts to alter their amino acid sequence and to deliver them using certain formulations (see, e.g., European Patent Application, entitled “Prolonged Delivery of Peptides,” by Darley, et al., \npublication number\n 0 619 322 A2, regarding the inclusion of polyethylene glycol in formulations containing GLP-1 (7-37)).\n\n\nPharmacological studies have led to reports that exendin-4 can act at GLP-1 receptors on certain insulin-secreting cells, at dispersed acinar cells from guinea pig pancreas, and at parietal cells from stomach; the peptide is also reported to stimulate somatostatin release and inhibit gastrin release in isolated stomachs (Goke, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n268:19650-55, 1993; Schepp, et al., \nEur. J. Pharmacol., \n69:183-91, 1994; Eissele, et al., \nLife Sci., \n55:629-34, 1994). Exendin-3 and exendin-4 were reportedly found to stimulate cAMP production in, and amylase release from, pancreatic acinar cells (Malhotra, R., et al., \nRegulatory Peptides, \n41:149-56, 1992; Raufman, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n267:21432-37, 1992; Singh, et al., \nRegul. Pept. \n53:47-59, 1994). Additionally, exendin-4 has a significantly longer duration of action than GLP-1. For example, in one experiment, glucose lowering by exendin-4 in diabetic mice was reported to persist for several hours, and, depending on dose, for up to 24 hours (Eng J. Prolonged effect of exendin-4 on hyperglycemia of db/db mice, Diabetes 1996 May; 45 (Suppl 2):152A (abstract 554)). Based on their insulinotropic activities, the use of exendin-3 and exendin-4 for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and the prevention of hyperglycemia has been proposed (Eng, U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,286).\n\n\nThe results of an investigation of whether exendins are the species homolog of mammalian GLP-1 was reported by Chen and Drucker who cloned the exendin gene from the Gila monster (\nJ. Biol. Chem. \n272(7):4108-15 (1997)). The observation that the Gila monster also has separate genes for proglucagons (from which GLP-1 is processed), that are more similar to mammalian proglucagon than exendin, indicates that exendins are not merely species homologs of GLP-1.\n\n\nTo date, agents that serve to delay gastric emptying have generally found a place in medicine as diagnostic aids in gastrointestinal radiological examinations. For example, glucagon is a polypeptide hormone that is produced by the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. It is a hyperglycemic agent that mobilizes glucose by activating hepatic glycogenolysis. It can to a lesser extent stimulate the secretion of pancreatic insulin. Glucagon is used in the treatment of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, for example, when administration of glucose intravenously is not possible. However, as glucagon reduces the motility of the gastro-intestinal tract it is also used as a diagnostic aid in gastrointestinal radiological examinations. Glucagon has also been used in several studies to treat various painful gastrointestinal disorders associated with spasm. Daniel, et al. (Br. Med. J., 3:720, 1974) reported quicker symptomatic relief of acute diverticulitis in patients treated with glucagon compared with those who had been treated with analgesics or antispasmodics. A review by Glauser, et al. (\nJ. Am. Coll. Emergency Physns, \n8:228, 1979) described relief of acute esophageal food obstruction following glucagon therapy. In another study, glucagon significantly relieved pain and tenderness in 21 patients with biliary tract disease compared with 22 patients treated with placebo (M. J. Stower, et al., \nBr. J. Sure., \n69:591-2, 1982).\n\n\nMethods for regulating gastrointestinal motility using amylin agonists are described in commonly owned International Application No. PCT/US94/10225, published Mar. 16, 1995, as WO 1995/007098.\n\n\nMethods for regulating gastrointestinal motility using exendin agonists are described in commonly owned U.S. Pat.

The compounds described herein that are useful for lowering glucagon levels and/or suppressing glucagon secretion include exendin, exendin agonists, and modified exendins and exendin agonists and related formulations, and dosage formulations.\n\n\nThe contents of the above-identified articles, patents, and patent applications, and all other documents mentioned or cited herein, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Applicants reserve the right to physically incorporate into this application any and all materials and information from any such articles, patents, patent applications, or other documents mentioned or cited herein.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAccording to one aspect, the present invention provides novel exendin agonist compound formulations and dosages thereof exhibiting advantageous properties that include effects in slowing gastric emptying and lowering plasma glucose levels. Thus, this aspect of the invention includes formulations of exendins and exendin agonists that comprise an exendin or exendin agonist mixed together with a buffer (preferably an acetate buffer), an iso-osmolality modifier (preferably mannitol), and optionally containing a preservative (preferably m-cresol), said formulation having a pH of between about 3.0 and about 7.0 (preferably between about 4.0 and about 5.0).\n\n\nAdditional formulations within the scope of the invention include a parenteral liquid dosage form, a lyophilized unit-dosage form, a lyophilized multi-use dosage form, and modifications of these dosage forms that are useful in the oral, nasal, buccal, sublingual, intra-tracheal, and pulmonary delivery of exendins and exendin agonists.\n\n\nThus, the invention includes parenteral liquid dosage forms that comprise approximately 0.005 to about 0.4%, more specifically from about 0.005 to about 0.02%, or from about 0.005 to about 0.05% (w/v), respectively of the active ingredient in an aqueous system along with approximately 0.02 to 0.5% (w/v) of an acetate, phosphate, citrate or glutamate or similar buffer either alone or in combination to obtain a pH of the final composition of approximately 3.0 to 7.0, more specifically from about pH 4.0 to about 6.0, or from about 4.0 to 5.0, as well as either approximately 1.0 to 10% (w/v) of a carbohydrate or polyhydric alcohol iso-osmolality modifier (preferably mannitol) or up to about 0.9% saline or a combination of both leading to an isotonic or an iso-osmolar solution in an aqueous continuous phase. Approximately 0.005 to 1.0% (w/v) of an anti-microbial preservative selected from the group consisting of m-cresol, benzyl alcohol, methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl parabens and phenol is also present if the formulation is packaged in a multi-use container. A sufficient amount of water for injection is added to obtain the desired concentration of solution. Sodium chloride, as well as other excipients, may also be present, if desired. Such excipients, however, must maintain the overall stability of the active ingredient. Useful polyhydric alcohols include such compounds as sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol, and polyethylene glycols (PEGs). The polyhydric alcohols and the carbohydrates will also be effective in stabilizing protein against denaturation caused by elevated temperature and by freeze-thaw or freeze-drying processes. Suitable carbohydrates include galactose, arabinose, lactose or any other carbohydrate which does not have an adverse affect on a diabetic patient, if intended for that use, i.e., the carbohydrate is not metabolized to form large concentrations of glucose in the blood. Preferably, the peptides of the present invention are admixed with a polyhydric alcohol such as sorbitol, mannitol, inositol, glycerol, xylitol, and polypropylene/ethylene glycol copolymer, as well as various polyethylene glycols (PEG) of \n \n \nmolecular weight\n \n \n 200, 400, 1450, 3350, 4000, 6000, and 8000). Mannitol is the preferred polyhydric alcohol.\n\n\nThe lyophilized unit-dose formulations of the present invention are also stable, but need not be isotonic and/or iso-osmolar. They include active ingredient(s), a bulking agent to facilitate cake formation (which may also act as a tonicifer and/or iso-osmolality modifier upon reconstitution to either facilitate stability of the active ingredient and/or lessen the pain on injection), and may also include a surfactant that benefits the properties of the cake and/or facilitates reconstitution. The lyophilized unit-dose formulations of the present invention include approximately 0.005 to about 0.4%, more specifically from about 0.005 to about 0.02%, or 0.005 to 0.05% (w/v) of the active ingredient. It may not be necessary to include a buffer in the formulation and/or to reconstitute the lyophile with a buffer if the intention is to consume the contents of the container within the stability period established for the reconstituted active ingredient. If a buffer is used, it may be included in the lyophile or in the reconstitution solvent. Therefore, the formulation and/or the reconstitution solvent may contain individually or collectively approximately 0.02 to 0.5% (w/v) of an acetate, phosphate, citrate or glutamate buffer either alone or in combination to obtain a pH of the final composition of approximately 3.0 to 7.0, more specifically from about pH 4.0 to about 6.0, or from about 4.0 to 5.0. The bulking agent may consist of either approximately 1.0 to 10% (w/v) of a carbohydrate or polyhydric alcohol iso-osmolality modifier (as described above) or up to 0.9% saline or a combination of both leading to a isotonic or iso-osmolar solution in the reconstituted aqueous phase. A surfactant, preferably about 0.1 to about 1.0% (w/v) of \npolysorbate\n 80 or other non-ionic detergent, may be included. As noted above, sodium chloride, as well as other excipients, may also be present in the lyophilized unit-dosage formulation, if desired. The liquid formulation of the invention prior to lyophilization will be substantially isotonic and/or iso-osmolar either before lyophilization or to enable formation of isotonic and/or iso-osmolar solutions after reconstitution.\n\n\nThe invention also includes lyophilized and liquid multi-dose formulations. As with the parenteral liquid and lyophilized unit-dosage formulations described above, the lyophilized multi-unit-dosage form should contain a bulking agent to facilitate cake formation. A preservative is included to facilitate multiple use by the patient. These dosage forms include approximately 0.005 to about 0.4%, more specifically from about 0.005 to about 0.02%, or from about 0.005 to 0.05% (w/v), respectively of the active ingredient. If a buffer is used, it may be included in the lyophile or in the reconstitution solvent, and the formulation and/or the reconstitution solvent may contain individually or collectively approximately 0.02 to 0.5% (w/v) of an acetate, phosphate, citrate or glutamate buffer either alone or in combination to obtain a pH of the final composition of approximately 3.0 to 7.0, more specifically from about pH 4.0 to about 6.0, or from about 4.0 to 5.0. The bulking agent may consist of either approximately 1.0 to 10% (w/v) of a carbohydrate or a polyhydric alcohol iso-osmolality modifier (preferably mannitol) or up to 0.9% saline, or a combination of both, leading to an isotonic or iso-osmolar solution in the reconstituted aqueous phase. A surfactant, preferably about 0.1 to about 1.0% (w/v) of \npolysorbate\n 80 or other non-ionic detergent, may be included. Approximately 0.005 to 1.0% (w/v) of an anti-microbial preservative selected from the group consisting of m-cresol, benzyl alcohol, methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl parabens and phenol (preferably m-cresol) is also present if the formulation is packaged in a multi-use container. Sodium chloride, as well as other excipients, may also be present, if desired. The liquid formulation of the invention should be substantially isotonic and/or iso-osmolar either before lyophilization or to enable formation of isotonic and/or iso-osmolar solutions after reconstitution.\n\n\nThe invention further includes solid dosage forms useful for oral, buccal, sublingual, intra-tracheal, nasal, and pulmonary delivery. The formulations that best support pulmonary and/or intra-tracheal dosage forms may be either preserved or unpreserved liquid formulations and/or dry powder formulations. The preserved or unpreserved liquid formulations will be essentially identical to the formulations described above under preserved or unpreserved liquid parenteral formulations. The pH of the solution should be about 3.0 to 7.0, more specifically from about 4.0 to 6.0, or from about 4.0 to 5.0, with a pH greater than or equal to about 5.0 being most preferred to reduce the potential for bronchoconstriction. The dry powder formulations may contain a bulking agent and/or salts to facilitate particle size formation and appropriate particle size distribution. A surfactant and/or salts may also benefit the properties of the particle morphology and/or facilitate tissue uptake of the active ingredient. Dry powder dosage forms can range from 1% to 100% (w/w), respectively of the active ingredient. It may not be necessary to include a bulking agent and/or salts to facilitate particle size formation and/or distribution. The bulking agent and/or salts may consist of either approximately 0 to 99% (w/w) of a carbohydrate or polyhydric alcohol or approximately 0 to 99% salt or a combination of both leading to the preferred particle size and distribution. A surfactant, preferably about 0.1 to about 1.0% (w/w) of \npolysorbate\n 80 or other non-ionic detergent, may be included. Sodium chloride, as well as other excipients, may also be present, if desired. Such excipients, however, will maintain the overall stability of the active ingredient and facilitate the proper level of hydration.\n\n\nAlso within the scope of the invention is the formulation comprising up to 50 mg/ml of an exendin or an exendin agonist in 30 mM acetate buffer (pH about 4.5) and mannitol, with or without a preservative.\n\n\nFurther within the scope of the invention are preferred dosages for exendins and exendin agonists when given by injection, and when given by other routes. Thus, formulations for exendin and exendin agonists having comparable potency are provided for the administration by injection of from about 0.1 to about 0.5 μg per kilogram, given one to three times per day. Typically, for the patient with diabetes who weighs in the range from about 70 kilograms (average for the \ntype\n 1 diabetic) to about 90 kilograms (average for the \ntype\n 2 diabetic), for example, this will result in the total administration of about 10 to about 120 μg per day in single or divided doses. If administered in divided doses, the doses are preferably administered two or three times per day, and more preferably, two times per day.\n\n\nOral dosages according to the present invention will include from about 50 to about 100 times the active ingredient, i.e., from about 500 to about 12,000 μg per day in single or divided doses, preferably from about 500 to about 5,000 μg per day. Pulmonary dosages according to the present invention will include from about 10 to about 100 times the active ingredient, i.e., from about 100 to about 12,000 μg per day in single or divided doses, preferably about 500 to 1000 μg per day. Nasal, buccal and sublingual dosages according to the present invention will also include from about 10 to about 100 times the active ingredient, i.e., from about 100 to about 12,000 μg per day in single or divided doses.\n\n\nPreferred dosages for nasal administration are from about 10-1000 to about 1200-12,000 μg per day, for buccal administration from about 10-1000 to about 1200-12,000 μg per day, and for sublingual administration from about 10-1000 to about 1200-8,000 μg per day. Sublingual dosages are preferably smaller than buccal dosages. Administration dosages for exendin agonists having less than or greater than the potency of exendin-4 are increased or decreased as appropriate from those described above and elsewhere herein.\n\n\nAlso included within the scope of the present invention are methods of administration of said novel exendin agonist compound formulations and dosages by delivery means alternative to subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion, including, for example, by nasal delivery, pulmonary delivery, oral delivery, intra-tracheal delivery, sublingual delivery, and buccal delivery.\n\n\nAccording to another aspect, the present invention provides novel exendin agonist compound formulations and dosages, and methods for the administration thereof, that are useful in treating diabetes (including \ntype\n 1 and \ntype\n 2 diabetes), obesity, and other conditions that will benefit from the administration of a therapy that can slow gastric emptying, lowering plasma glucose levels, and reduce food intake.\n\n\nPreferred exendins or exendin agonists for use include: exendin-4 (1-30) [SEQ ID NO: 4, i.e., His Gly Glu Gly Thr Phe Thr Ser Asp Leu Ser Lys Gln Met Glu Glu Glu Ala Val Arg Leu Phe Ile Glu Trp Leu Lys Asn Gly Gly]; exendin-4 (1-30) amide [SEQ ID NO: 5, i.e., His Gly Glu Gly Thr Phe Thr Ser Asp Leu Ser Lys Gln Met Glu Glu Glu Ala Val Arg Leu Phe Ile Glu Trp Leu Lys Asn Gly Gly-NH\n2\n]; exendin-4 (1-28) amide [SEQ ID NO: 6, i.e., His Gly Glu Gly Thr Phe Thr Ser Asp Leu Ser Lys Gln Met Glu Glu Glu Ala Val Arg Leu Phe Ile Glu Trp Leu Lys Asn-NH\n2\n]; \n14\nLeu, \n25\nPhe exendin-4 amide [SEQ ID NO: 7, i.e., His Gly Glu Gly Thr Phe Thr Ser Asp Leu Ser Lys Gln Leu Glu Glu Glu Ala Val Arg Leu Phe Ile Glu Phe Leu Lys Asn Gly Gly Pro Ser Ser Gly Ala Pro Pro Pro Ser-NH\n2\n]; \n14\nLeu, \n25\nPhe exendin-4 (1-28) amide [SEQ ID NO: 8, i.e., His Gly Glu Gly Thr Phe Thr Ser Asp Leu Ser Lys Gln Leu Glu Glu Glu Ala Val Arg Leu Phe Ile Glu Phe Leu Lys Asn-NH\n2\n]; and \n14\nLeu, \n22\nAla, \n25\nPhe exendin-4 (1-28) amide [SEQ ID NO: 9, i.e., His Gly Glu Gly Thr Phe Thr Ser Asp Leu Ser Lys Gln Leu Glu Glu Glu Ala Val Arg Leu Ala Ile Glu Phe Leu Lys Asn-NH\n2\n].\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\nIn accordance with the present invention and as used herein, the following terms are defined to have the following meanings, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n\nThe term “amino acid” refers to natural amino acids, unnatural amino acids, and amino acid analogs, all in their D and L stereoisomers if their structure allow such stereoisomeric forms.

Such methods are useful, for example, in the treatment of hyperglucagonemia and other conditions in which lower levels of glucagon or suppression of glucagon secretion are of benefit. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, glucagonoma and necrolytic migratory erythema.\n\n\nModified Exendins and Exendin Agonists\n\n\nThe modified exendins and exendin agonists of the present invention include, for example, one or more PEG polymers linked to an exendin or exendin agonist, such as a naturally occurring exendin, a synthetic exendin or an exendin agonist.\n\n\nExendin-4\n\n\nExendin-4 is a naturally occurring peptide isolated from the salivary secretions of the Gila monster. Animal testing of exendin-4 has shown that its ability to lower blood glucose persists for several hours. Exendin-4, a 39-amino acid polypeptide, is synthesized using solid phase synthesis as described herein, and this synthetic material has been shown to be identical to that of native exendin-4.\n\n\nAs described herein, the nonclinical pharmacology of exendin-4 has been studied. In the brain, exendin-4 binds principally to the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius region in the hindbrain and to the subformical organ in the forebrain. Exendin-4 binding has been observed in the rat and mouse brain and kidney. The structures to which exendin-4 binds in the kidney are unknown.\n\n\nVarious experiments have compared the biologic actions of exendin-4 and GLP-1 and demonstrated a more favorable spectrum of properties for exendin-4. A single subcutaneous dose of exendin-4 lowered plasma glucose in db/db (diabetic) and ob/ob (diabetic obese) mice by up to 40%. In Diabetic Fatty Zucker (ZDF) rats, 5 weeks of treatment with exendin-4 lowered HbA\n1c \n(a measure of glycosylated hemoglobin used to evaluate plasma glucose levels) by up to 41%. Insulin sensitivity was also improved by 76% following 5 weeks of treatment in obese ZDF rats. In glucose intolerant primates, dose-dependent decreases in plasma glucose were also observed.\n\n\nAn insulinotropic action of exendin-4 has also been observed in rodents, improving insulin response to glucose by over 100% in non-fasted Harlan Sprague Dawley (HSD) rats, and by up to ˜10-fold in non-fasted db/db mice. Higher pretreatment plasma glucose concentrations were associated with greater glucose-lowering effects. Thus the observed glucose lowering effect of exendin-4 appears to be glucose-dependent, and minimal if animals are already euglycemic.\n\n\nExendin-4 dose dependently slowed gastric emptying in HSD rats and was 90-fold more potent than GLP-1 for this action. Exendin-4 has also been shown to reduce food intake in NIH/Sw (Swiss) mice following peripheral administration, and was at least 1000 times more potent than GLP-1 for this action. Exendin-4 reduced plasma glucagon concentrations by approximately 40% in anesthetized ZDF rats during hyperinsulinemic, hyperglycemic clamp conditions, but did not affect plasma glucagon concentrations during euglycemic conditions in normal rats. Exendin-4 has been shown to dose-dependently reduce body weight in obese ZDF rats, while in lean ZDF rats, the observed decrease in body weight appears to be transient.\n\n\nThrough effects on lowering glucagon and suppressing glucagon secretion, exendins, exendin agonists, and modified exendins or exendin agonists containing exendin-4, for example, will be useful in people who would benefit from lowered glucagon, for example, people with glucagonoma and necrolytic migratory erythema, and people with diabetes whether or not they retain the ability to secrete insulin. See Example 5.\n\n\nThe toxicology of exendin-4 has been investigated in single-dose studies in mice, rats and monkeys, repeated-dose (up to 28 consecutive daily doses) studies in rats and monkeys and in vitro tests for mutagenicity and chromosomal alterations. To date, no deaths have occurred, and there have been no observed treatment-related changes in hematology, clinical chemistry, or gross or microscopic tissue changes. Exendin-4 was demonstrated to be non-mutagenic, and did not cause chromosomal aberrations at the concentrations tested (up to 5000 μg/mL).\n\n\nIn support of the investigation of the nonclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism of exendin-4, a number of immunoassays have been developed. A radioimmunoassay with limited sensitivity (˜100 μM) was used in initial pharmacokinetic studies. A two-site IRMA assay for exendin-4 was subsequently validated with a lower limit of quantitation of 15 μM. The bioavailability of exendin-4, given subcutaneously, was found to be approximately 50-80% using the radioimmunoassay. This was similar to that seen following intraperitoneal administration (48-60%). Peak plasma concentrations (C\nmax\n) occurred between 30 and 43 minutes (T\nmax\n). Both C\nmax \nand AUC values were monotonically related to dose. The apparent terminal half-life for exendin-4 given subcutaneously was approximately 90-110 minutes. This was significantly longer than the 14-41 minutes seen following intravenous dosing. Similar results were obtained using the IRMA assay. Degradation studies with exendin-4 compared to GLP-1 indicate that exendin-4 is relatively resistant to degradation.\n\n\nExendin Agonists\n\n\nThe structure activity relationship (SAR) of exendin was investigated for structures that may relate to the antidiabetic activity of exendin, for its stability to metabolism, and for improvement of its physical characteristics, especially as it pertains to peptide stability and to amenability to alternative delivery systems, and various exendin agonist peptide compounds have been invented. Exendin agonists include exendin peptide analogs in which one or more naturally occurring amino acids are eliminated or replaced with another amino acid(s). Preferred exendin agonists are agonist analogs of exendin-4. Particularly preferred exendin agonists include those described in commonly owned WO 99/07404 (i.e., PCT Application Serial No. PCT/US98/16387 filed Aug. 6, 1998, entitled “Novel Exendin Agonist Compounds,” which claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application Ser.

The synthesis of exendins and exendin agonists is thus described first, followed by methodology for linking the polyethylene glycol polymer(s) to the exendin or exendin agonist.\n\n\nPreparation of Exendins and Exendin Agonists\n\n\nExendins and exendin agonist compounds such as exendin analogs and exendin derivatives, described herein may be prepared through peptide purification as described in, for example, Eng, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n265:20259-62, 1990; and Eng, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n267:7402-05, 1992, hereby incorporated by reference herein. Alternatively, exendins and exendin agonist peptides may be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in Raufman, et al. (\nJ. Biol. Chem. \n267:21432-37, 1992), hereby incorporated by reference herein, using standard solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques and preferably an automated or semiautomated peptide synthesizer. The compounds that constitute active ingredients of the formulations and dosages of the present invention may be prepared using standard solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques and preferably an automated or semiautomated peptide synthesizer. Typically, using such techniques, an α-N-carbamoyl protected amino acid and an amino acid attached to the growing peptide chain on a resin are coupled at room temperature in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone or methylene chloride in the presence of coupling agents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in the presence of a base such as diisopropylethylamine. The α-N-carbamoyl protecting group is removed from the resulting peptide-resin using a reagent such as trifluoroacetic acid or piperidine, and the coupling reaction repeated with the next desired N-protected amino acid to be added to the peptide chain. Suitable N-protecting groups are well known in the art, with t-butyloxycarbonyl (tBoc) and fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) being preferred herein.\n\n\nThe solvents, amino acid derivatives and 4-methylbenzhydryl-amine resin used in the peptide synthesizer may be purchased from Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, Calif.). The following side-chain protected amino acids may be purchased from Applied Biosystems, Inc.: BSD-112344.1-Arg(Pmc), Boc-Thr(Bzl), Fmoc-Thr(t-Bu), Boc-Ser(Bzl), Fmoc-Ser(t-Bu), Boc-Tyr(BrZ), Fmoc-Tyr(t-Bu), Boc-Lys(Cl-Z), Fmoc-Lys(Boc), Boc-Glu(Bzl), Fmoc-Glu(t-Bu), Fmoc-His(Trt), Fmoc-Asn(Trt), and Fmoc-Gln(Trt). Boc-His(BOM) may be purchased from Applied Biosystems, Inc. or Bachem Inc. (Torrance, Calif.). Anisole, dimethylsulfide, phenol, ethanedithiol, and thioanisole may be obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, Wis.). Air Products and Chemicals (Allentown, Pa.) supplies HF. Ethyl ether, acetic acid and methanol may be purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, Pa.).\n\n\nSolid phase peptide synthesis may be carried out with an automatic peptide synthesizer (Model 430A, Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, Calif.) using the NMP/HOBt (Option 1) system and tBoc or Fmoc chemistry (see, Applied Biosystems User's Manual for the ABI 430A Peptide Synthesizer, Version 1.3B Jul. 1, 1988, \nsection\n 6, pp. 49-70, Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, Calif.) with capping. Boc-peptide-resins may be cleaved with HF (−50° C. to 0° C., 1 hour). The peptide may be extracted from the resin with alternating water and acetic acid, and the filtrates lyophilized. The Fmoc-peptide resins may be cleaved according to standard methods (\nIntroduction to Cleavage Techniques\n, Applied Biosystems, Inc., 1990, pp. 6-12). Peptides may also be assembled using an Advanced Chem Tech Synthesizer (\nModel MPS\n 350, Louisville, Ky.).\n\n\nPeptides may be purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (preparative and analytical) using a Waters Delta Prep 3000 system. A C4, C8 or C18 preparative column (10μ, 2.2×25 cm; Vydac, Hesperia, Calif.) may be used to isolate peptides, and purity may be determined using a C4, C8 or C18 analytical column (5μ, 0.46×25 cm; Vydac). Solvents (A=0.1% TFA/water and B=0.1% TFA/CH\n3\nCN) may be delivered to the analytical column at a flowrate of 1.0 ml/min and to the preparative column at 15 ml/min. Amino acid analyses may be performed on the Waters Pico Tag system and processed using the Maxima program. Peptides may be hydrolyzed by vapor-phase acid hydrolysis (115° C., 20-24 h). Hydrolysates may be derivatized and analyzed by standard methods (Cohen, et al., The Pico Tag Method: A Manual of Advanced Techniques for Amino Acid Analysis, pp. 11-52, Millipore Corporation, Milford, Mass. (1989)). Fast atom bombardment analysis may be carried out by M-Scan, Incorporated (West Chester, Pa.). Mass calibration may be performed using cesium iodide or cesium iodide/glycerol. Plasma desorption ionization analysis using time of flight detection may be carried out on an \nApplied Biosystems Bio-Ion\n 20 mass spectrometer. Electrospray mass spectroscopy may be carried and on a VG-Trio machine.\n\n\nPeptide active ingredient compounds useful in the formulations and dosages of the invention may also be prepared using recombinant DNA techniques, using methods now known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, \n2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor (1989). Alternatively, such compounds may be prepared by homogeneous phase peptide synthesis methods. Non-peptide compounds useful in the present invention may be prepared by art-known methods. For example, phosphate-containing amino acids and peptides containing such amino acids, may be prepared using methods known in the art. See, e.g., Bartlett and Landen, \nBiorg. Chem. \n14:356-377 (1986).\n\n\nConjugation of Polyethylene Glycol Polymers\n\n\nThere are several strategies for coupling PEG to peptides/proteins. See, Francis, Int. J. Hematology 68:1 (1998); Gombotz, Bioconjugate Chem. 6:150 (1995); and Delgado, Crit. Rev. Therap. Drug Carrier Sys. 9:249 (1992) all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Those skilled in the art, therefore, will be able to utilize such well-known techniques for linking one or more polyethylene glycol polymers to the exendins and exendin agonists described herein. Suitable polyethylene glycol polymers typically are commercially available or may be made by techniques well know to those skilled in the art. The polyethylene glycol polymers preferably have molecular weights between 500 and 20,000 and may be branched or straight chain polymers.\n\n\nThe attachment of a PEG on an intact peptide or protein can be accomplished by coupling to amino, carboxyl or thiol groups. These groups will typically be the N and C termini and on the side chains of such naturally occurring amino acids as lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and cysteine. Since \nexendin\n 4 and other exendins and exendin agonists can be prepared by solid phase peptide chemistry techniques, a variety of moieties containing diamino and dicarboxylic groups with orthogonal protecting groups can be introduced for conjugation to PEG.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides for conjugation of an exendin or exendin agonist to one or more polymers other than polyethylene glycol which can regulate kidney clearance in a manner similar to polyethylene glycol. Examples of such polymers include albumin and gelatin. See, Gombotz and Pettit, \nBioconjugate Chem., \n6:332-351, 1995, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nUtility\n\n\nThe formulations and dosages described herein are useful in view of their pharmacological properties. In particular, the compounds described herein possess activity as agents to reduce glucagon levels and suppress glucagon secretion, as evidenced by the ability to lower glucagon levels in animals and humans. They can be used to treat conditions or diseases that can be alleviated by reducing glucagon levels and suppressing glucagon secretion.\n\n\nThe compounds referenced above may form salts with various inorganic and organic acids and bases. Such salts include salts prepared with organic and inorganic acids, for example, HCl, HBr, H\n2\nSO\n4\n, H\n3\nPO\n4\n, trifluoroacetic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, methanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid and camphorsulfonic acid. Salts prepared with bases include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts, e.g., sodium and potassium salts, and alkali earth salts, e.g., calcium and magnesium salts. Acetate, hydrochloride, and trifluoroacetate salts are preferred. The salts may be formed by conventional means, as by reacting the free acid or base forms of the product with one or more equivalents of the appropriate base or acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent such as water which is then removed in vacuo or by freeze-drying or by exchanging the ions of an existing salt for another ion on a suitable ion exchange resin.\n\n\nFormulation and Administration\n\n\nExendin and exendin agonist formulations and dosages of the invention are useful in view of their exendin-like effects, and may conveniently be provided in the form of formulations suitable for parenteral (including intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous) administration. Also described herein are formulations and dosages useful in alternative delivery routes, including oral, nasal, buccal, sublingual and pulmonary.\n\n\nThe feasibility of alternate routes of delivery for exendin-4 has been explored by measuring exendin-4 in the circulation in conjunction with observation of a biologic response, such as plasma glucose lowering in diabetic animals, after administration. Passage of exendin-4 has been investigated across several surfaces, the respiratory tract (nasal, tracheal and pulmonary routes) and the gut (sublingual, gavage and intraduodenal routes). Biologic effect and appearance of exendin-4 in blood have been observed with each route of administration via the respiratory tract, and with sublingual and gavaged peptide via the gastrointestinal tract. Intra-tracheal administration, nasal administration, administration via the gut, and sublingual administration have all been described.\n\n\nIn some cases, it will be convenient to provide a modified exendin or exendin agonist and another anti-glucagon agent, such as an amylin or an amylin agonist, in a single composition or solution for administration together. In other cases, it may be more advantageous to administer another anti-glucagon agent separately from the exendin, exendin agonist, or modified exendin or exendin agonist. In yet other cases, it may be beneficial to provide an exendin, exendin agonist, or modified exendin or exendin agonist either co-formulated or separately with other glucagon lowering agents such as amylin. A suitable administration format may best be determined by a medical practitioner for each patient individually. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and their formulation are described in standard formulation treatises, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. See also Wang, Y. J. and Hanson, M. A. “Parenteral Formulations of Proteins and Peptides: Stability and Stabilizers,” Journal of Parenteral Science and Technology, Technical Report No. 10, Supp. 42:2S (1988).\n\n\nCompounds useful in the invention can be provided as parenteral compositions for injection or infusion. They can, for example, be suspended in an inert oil, suitably a vegetable oil such as sesame, peanut, olive oil, or other acceptable carrier. Preferably, they are suspended in an aqueous carrier, for example, in an isotonic buffer solution at a pH of about 3.0 to about 7.0, more specifically from about 4.0 to 6.0, and preferably from about 4.0 to about 5.0. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH buffering agents. Useful buffers include for example, sodium acetate/acetic acid buffers. A form of repository or “depot” slow release preparation may be used so that therapeutically effective amounts of the preparation are delivered into the bloodstream over many hours or days following transdermal injection or delivery.\n\n\nThe desired isotonicity may be accomplished using sodium chloride or other pharmaceutically acceptable agents such as dextrose, boric acid, sodium tartrate, propylene glycol, polyols (such as mannitol and sorbitol), or other inorganic or organic solutes. Sodium chloride is preferred particularly for buffers containing sodium ions.\n\n\nThe claimed compounds can also be formulated as pharmaceutically acceptable salts (e.g., acid addition salts) and/or complexes thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are non-toxic salts at the concentration at which they are administered. The preparation of such salts can facilitate the pharmacological use by altering the physical-chemical characteristics of the composition without preventing the composition from exerting its physiological effect. Examples of useful alterations in physical properties include lowering the melting point to facilitate transmucosal administration and increasing the solubility to facilitate the administration of higher concentrations of the drug.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition salts such as those containing sulfate, hydrochloride, phosphate, sulfamate, acetate, citrate, lactate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, cyclohexylsulfamate and quinate. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be obtained from acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfamic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclohexylsulfamic acid, and quinic acid. Such salts may be prepared by, for example, reacting the free acid or base forms of the product with one or more equivalents of the appropriate base or acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent such as water which is then removed in vacuo or by freeze-drying or by exchanging the ions of an existing salt for another ion on a suitable ion exchange resin.\n\n\nCarriers or excipients can also be used to facilitate administration of the compound. Examples of carriers and excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars such as lactose, glucose, or sucrose, or types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols and physiologically compatible solvents. The compositions or pharmaceutical composition can be administered by different routes including intravenously, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, and intramuscular, orally, topically, or transmucosally.\n\n\nIf desired, solutions of the above compositions may be thickened with a thickening agent such as methylcellulose. They may be prepared in emulsified form, either water in oil or oil in water. Any of a wide variety of pharmaceutically acceptable emulsifying agents may be employed including, for example, acacia powder, a non-ionic surfactant (such as a Tween), or an ionic surfactant (such as alkali polyether alcohol sulfates or sulfonates, e.g., a Triton).\n\n\nCompositions useful in the invention are prepared by mixing the ingredients following generally accepted procedures. For example, the selected components may be simply mixed in a blender or other standard device to produce a concentrated mixture which may then be adjusted to the final concentration and viscosity by the addition of water or thickening agent and possibly a buffer to control pH or an additional solute to control tonicity.\n\n\nOther pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and their formulation are described in standard formulation treatises, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. See also Wang, Y. J. and Hanson, M. A. “Parenteral Formulations of Proteins and Peptides: Stability and Stabilizers,” Journal of Parenteral Science and Technology, Technical Report No. 10, Supp. 42:2S (1988).\n\n\nFor use by the physician, the compounds will be provided in dosage unit form containing an amount of an exendin, exendin agonist, or modified exendin or exendin agonist, with or without another anti-glucagon agent. Therapeutically effective amounts of an exendin, exendin agonist, or modified exendin or exendin agonist for use in the control of glucagon and in conditions in which glucagon levels are beneficially lowered or regulated are those that decrease post-prandial blood glucagon levels as desired. In diabetic or glucose intolerant individuals, plasma glucagon levels may be higher than in normal individuals. In such individuals, beneficial reduction or “smoothing” of post-prandial blood glucagon levels, may be obtained. As will be recognized by those in the field, an effective amount of therapeutic agent will vary with many factors including the age and weight of the patient, the patient's physical condition, the glucagon level or level of inhibition of glucagon suppression to be obtained, and other factors.\n\n\nSuch pharmaceutical compositions are useful in causing glucagon to be lowered in a subject and may be used as well in other disorders where lowered or suppressed glucagon is beneficially reduced.\n\n\nThe effective daily anti-glucagon dose of the compounds will typically be in the range of 0.01 or 0.03 to about 5 mg/day, preferably about 0.01 or 0.5 to 2 mg/day and more preferably about 0.01 or 0.1 to 1 mg/day, for a 70 kg patient, administered in a single or divided doses. The exact dose to be administered is determined by the attending clinician and is dependent upon where the particular compound lies within the above quoted range, as well as upon the age, weight and condition of the individual. Administration should begin at the first sign of symptoms or shortly after diagnosis of, for example, diabetes mellitus as manifested by elevated glucagon. Administration may be by injection, preferably subcutaneous or intramuscular. Orally active compounds may be taken orally, however dosages should be increased 5-10 fold.\n\n\nGenerally, in treating or preventing elevated, inappropriate, or undesired post-prandial blood glucagon levels, the compounds of this invention may be administered to patients in need of such treatment in a dosage ranges similar to those given above, however, the compounds are administered more frequently, for example, one, two, or three times a day. Particularly preferred are the exendin and exendin agonist formulations and dosages and routes of administration thereof described commonly owned WO 00/41546 and WO 00/41548 (i.e., claiming priority to \nU.S. Provisional Application\n 60/116,380, entitled “Novel Exendin Agonist Formulations And Methods Of Administration Thereof,” filed Jan. 14, 1999 (and the corresponding PCT application claiming priority from it that was filed on Jan. 14, 2000, Ser. No. PCT/US00/00942, and \nU.S. Provisional Application\n 60/175,365, entitled “Use of Exendins and Agonists Thereof for Modulation of Triglyceride Levels and Treatment of Dyslipidemia,” filed Jan. 10, 2000), from which this application claims priority and the disclosures of which have been incorporated by referenced in their entirety as if fully set forth herein.\n\n\nA form of repository or “depot” slow release preparation may be used so that therapeutically effective amounts of the preparation are delivered into the bloodstream over many hours or days following transdermal injection or other form of delivery.\n\n\nThe effective daily doses of the compounds are described. The exact dose to be administered may be determined by the attending clinician and may be further dependent upon the efficacy of the particular exendin or exendin agonist compound used, as well as upon the age, weight and condition of the individual. The optimal mode of administration of compounds of the present application to a patient depend on factors known in the art such as the particular disease or disorder, the desired effect, and the type of patient. While the compounds will typically be used to treat human patients, they may also be used to treat similar or identical diseases in other vertebrates such as other primates, farm animals such as swine, cattle and poultry, and sports animals and pets such as horses, dogs and cats.\n\n\nIn particular, the formulation which best supports a parenteral liquid dosage form is one in which the active ingredient(s) is stable with adequate buffering capacity to maintain the pH of the solution over the intended shelf life of the product. The dosage form should be either an isotonic and/or an iso-osmolar solution to either facilitate stability of the active ingredient or lessen the pain on injection or both. Devices that deliver very small injection volumes, however, may not require that the formulation be either isotonic and/or iso-osmolar. If the dosage form is packaged as a unit-dose, then a preservative may be included but is not required. If, however, the dosage form is packaged in a multi-use container, then a preservative is necessary.\n\n\nThese dosage forms include approximately 0.005 to about 0.4%, more specifically from about 0.005 to about 0.02%, or from about 0.005 to about 0.05% (w/v), respectively of the active ingredient in an aqueous system along with approximately 0.02 to 0.5% (w/v) of an acetate, phosphate, citrate or glutamate or similar buffer either alone or in combination to obtain a pH of the final composition of approximately 3.0 to 7.0, more specifically from about pH 4.0 to about 6.0, or from about 4.0 to 5.0, as well as either approximately 1.0 to 10% (w/v) of a carbohydrate or polyhydric alcohol iso-osmolality modifier (preferably mannitol) or up to about 0.9% saline or a combination of both leading to an isotonic or an iso-osmolar solution in an aqueous continuous phase. Approximately 0.005 to 1.0% (w/v) of an anti-microbial preservative selected from the group consisting of m-cresol, benzyl alcohol, methyl ethyl, propyl and butyl parabens and phenol is also present if the formulation is packaged in a multi-use container. A sufficient amount of water for injection is added to obtain the desired concentration of solution. Sodium chloride, as well as other excipients, may also be present, if desired. Such excipients, however, must maintain the overall stability of the active ingredient.\n\n\nPolyhydric alcohols and carbohydrates share the same feature in their backbones, i.e., —CHOH—CHOH—. The polyhydric alcohols include such compounds as sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol, and polyethylene glycols (PEGs). These compounds are straight-chain molecules. The carbohydrates, such as mannose, ribose, trehalose, maltose, glycerol, inositol, glucose and lactose, on the other hand, are cyclic molecules that may contain a keto or aldehyde group. These two classes of compounds will also be effective in stabilizing protein against denaturation caused by elevated temperature and by freeze-thaw or freeze-drying processes. Suitable carbohydrates include galactose, arabinose, lactose or any other carbohydrate which does not have an adverse affect on a diabetic patient, i.e., the carbohydrate is not metabolized to form large concentrations of glucose in the blood. Such carbohydrates are well known in the art as suitable for diabetics.\n\n\nPreferably, the peptides of the present invention are admixed with a polyhydric alcohol such as sorbitol, mannitol, inositol, glycerol, xylitol, and polypropylene/ethylene glycol copolymer, as well as various polyethylene glycols (PEG) of \n \n \nmolecular weight\n \n \n 200, 400, 1450, 3350, 4000, 6000, and 8000). Mannitol is the preferred polyhydric alcohol.\n\n\nThe liquid formulation of the invention should be substantially isotonic and/or iso-osmolar. An isotonic solution may be defined as a solution that has a concentration of electrolytes, or a combination of electrolytes and non-electrolytes that will exert equivalent osmotic pressure as that into which it is being introduced, here for example in the case of parenteral injection of the formulation, a mammalian tissue. Similarly, an iso-osmolar solution may be defined as a solution that has a concentration of non-electrolytes that will exert equivalent osmotic pressure as that into which it is being introduced. As used herein, “substantially isotonic” means within ±20% of isotonicity, preferably within ±10%. As used herein, “substantially iso-osmolar” means within ±20% of iso-osmolality, preferably within ±10%. The formulated product for injection is included within a container, typically, for example, a vial, cartridge, prefilled syringe or disposable pen.\n\n\nThe formulation which best support a unit-dose parenteral lyophilized dosage form is one in which the active ingredient is reasonably stable, with or without adequate buffering capacity to maintain the pH of the solution over the intended shelf life of the reconstituted product. The dosage form should contain a bulking agent to facilitate cake formation. The bulking agent may also act as a tonicifer and/or iso-osmolality modifier upon reconstitution to either facilitate stability of the active ingredient and/or lessen the pain on injection. As noted above, devices that deliver very small injection volumes may not require the formulation to be isotonic and/or iso-osmolar. A surfactant may also benefit the properties of the cake and/or facilitate reconstitution.\n\n\nThese dosage forms include approximately 0.005 to about 0.4%, more specifically from about 0.005 to about 0.02%, or 0.005 to 0.05% (w/v) of the active ingredient. It may not be necessary to include a buffer in the formulation and/or to reconstitute the lyophile with a buffer if the intention is to consume the contents of the container within the stability period established for the reconstituted active ingredient. If a buffer is used, it may be included in the lyophile or in the reconstitution solvent. Therefore, the formulation and/or the reconstitution solvent may contain individually or collectively approximately 0.02 to 0.5% (w/v) of an acetate, phosphate, citrate or glutamate buffer either alone or in combination to obtain a pH of the final composition of approximately 3.0 to 7.0, more specifically from about pH 4.0 to about 6.0, or from about 4.0 to 5.0. The bulking agent may consist of either approximately 1.0 to 10% (w/v) of a carbohydrate or polyhydric alcohol iso-osmolality modifier (as described above) or up to 0.9% saline or a combination of both leading to a isotonic or iso-osmolar solution in the reconstituted aqueous phase. A surfactant, preferably about 0.1 to about 1.0% (w/v) of \npolysorbate\n 80 or other non-ionic detergent, may be included. As noted above, sodium chloride, as well as other excipients, may also be present in the lyophilized unit-dosage formulation, if desired. Such excipients, however, must maintain the overall stability of the active ingredient. The formulation will be lyophilized within the validation parameters identified to maintain stability of the active ingredient.\n\n\nThe liquid formulation of the invention before lyophilization should be substantially isotonic and/or iso-osmolar either before lyophilization or to enable formation of isotonic and/or iso-osmolar solutions after reconstitution. The formulation should be used within the period established by shelf-life studies on both the lyophilized form and following reconstitution. The lyophilized product is included within a container, typically, for example, a vial. If other containers are used such as a cartridge, pre-filled syringe, or disposable pen, the reconstitution solvent may also be included.\n\n\nAs with the parenteral liquid and lyophilized unit-dosage formulations described above, the formulation which best supports a multi-dose parenteral lyophilized dosage form is one in which the active ingredient is reasonably stable with adequate buffering capacity to maintain the pH of the solution over the intended “in-use” shelf-life of the product. The dosage form should contain a bulking agent to facilitate cake formation. The bulking agent may also act as a tonicifer and/or iso-osmolality modifier upon reconstitution to either facilitate stability of the active ingredient or lessen the pain on injection or both. Again, devices that deliver very small injection volumes may not require the formulation to be either isotonic and/or iso-osmolar. A preservative is, however, necessary to facilitate multiple use by the patient.\n\n\nThese dosage forms include approximately 0.005 to about 0.4%, more specifically from about 0.005 to about 0.02%, or from about 0.005 to 0.05% (w/v), respectively of the active ingredient. It may not be necessary to include a buffer in the formulation and/or to reconstitute the lyophile with a buffer if the intention is to consume the contents of the container within the stability period established for the reconstituted active ingredient. If a buffer is used, it may be included in the lyophile or in the reconstitution solvent. Therefore, the formulation and/or the reconstitution solvent may contain individually or collectively approximately 0.02 to 0.5% (w/v) of an acetate, phosphate, citrate or glutamate buffer either alone or in combination to obtain a pH of the final composition of approximately 3.0 to 7.0, more specifically from about pH 4.0 to about 6.0, or from about 4.0 to 5.0. The bulking agent may consist of either approximately 1.0 to 10% (w/v) of a carbohydrate or a polyhydric alcohol iso-osmolality modifier (preferably mannitol) or up to 0.9% saline, or a combination of both, leading to an isotonic or iso-osmolar solution in the reconstituted aqueous phase. A surfactant, preferably about 0.1 to about 1.0% (w/v) of \npolysorbate\n 80 or other non-ionic detergent, may be included. Approximately 0.005 to 1.0% (w/v) of an anti-microbial preservative selected from the group consisting of m-cresol, benzyl alcohol, methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl parabens and phenol (preferably m-cresol) is also present if the formulation is packaged in a multi-use container. Sodium chloride, as well as other excipients, may also be present, if desired. Again, however, such excipients must maintain the overall stability of the active ingredient. The formulation should be lyophilized within the validation parameters identified to maintain stability of the active ingredient. The liquid formulation of the invention should be substantially isotonic and/or iso-osmolar either before lyophilization or to enable formation of isotonic and/or iso-osmolar solutions after reconstitution. The formulation should be used within the period established by shelf-life studies on both the lyophilized form and following reconstitution. The lyophilized product is included within a container, typically, for example, a vial. If other containers are used such as a cartridge, pre-filled syringe or disposable pen, the reconstitution solvent may also be included.\n\n\nThe formulations that best support oral, nasal, pulmonary and/or intra-tracheal dosage forms may be either preserved or unpreserved liquid formulations and/or dry powder or, for oral administration, solid formulations. The preserved or unpreserved liquid formulations will be essentially identical to the formulations described above under preserved or unpreserved liquid parenteral formulations. The pH of the solution should be about 3.0 to 7.0, with a pH greater than or equal to about 5.0 being most preferred to reduce the potential for bronchoconstriction. The dry powder formulations may contain a bulking agent and/or salts to facilitate particle size formation and appropriate particle size distribution. A surfactant and/or salts may also benefit the properties of the particle morphology and/or facilitate tissue uptake of the active ingredient.\n\n\nThese dry powder dosage forms can range from 1% to 100% (w/w), respectively of the active ingredient. It may not be necessary to include a bulking agent and/or salts to facilitate particle size formation and/or distribution. The bulking agent and/or salts may consist of either approximately 0 to 99% (w/w) of a carbohydrate or polyhydric alcohol or approximately 0 to 99% salt or a combination of both leading to the preferred particle size and distribution. A surfactant, preferably about 0.1 to about 1.0% (w/w) of \npolysorbate\n 80 or other non-ionic detergent, may be included. Sodium chloride, as well as other excipients, may also be present, if desired. Such excipients, however, must maintain the overall stability of the active ingredient and facilitate the proper level of hydration.\n\n\nThe formulations that best support nasal and/or intra-tracheal dosage forms may be either preserved or unpreserved liquid dosage formulations described previously.\n\n\nDissolvable gels and/or patches may be used to facilitate buccal delivery. The gels may be prepared from various types of starch and/or cellulose derivatives.\n\n\nSublingual delivery may be best supported by liquid formulations similar to those described above as parenteral liquid or parenteral lyophilized formulations after reconstitution except without the need for the dosage form to be an isotonic and/or iso-osmolar solution. Solid dosage forms may be similar to oral solid dosage forms except that they must be readily dissolvable under the tongue.\n\n\nOral delivery may be best supported by a liquid (gel cap) formulation that is similar to the parenteral liquid formulation except that the solution may be more concentrated and may contain additional additives to facilitate uptake of the active ingredient by the small intestine. Solid dosage forms will contain inert ingredients along with the active ingredient to facilitate tablet formation. These ingredients may include polyhedral alcohols (such as mannitol), carbohydrates, or types of starch, cellulose derivatives, and/or other inert, physiologically compatible materials. The tablet may be enterically coated to minimize digestion in the stomach and thereby facilitate dissolution and uptake further along the alimentary canal.\n\n\nClinical Studies\n\n\nAs described in Example 14 below, a double blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose study examining the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous exendin-4 in healthy volunteers has been completed. Five single subcutaneous doses of exendin-4 (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 μg/kg) were studied in 40 healthy male volunteers in the fasting state. Maximum plasma exendin-4 concentrations were achieved between one and two hours post-dose with little difference among the doses examined. Examination of the data indicated a dose dependent increase for C\nmax\n. There were no serious adverse events reported in this study.\n\n\nIn the healthy male volunteers that participated in this study, exendin-4 was well tolerated at subcutaneous doses up to and including 0.1 μg/kg. A decrease in plasma glucose concentration was also observed at this dose. At doses of 0.2 μg/kg and higher, the most commonly observed adverse events were headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and postural hypotension. There was a transient fall in plasma glucose concentration following administration of doses of 0.05 μg/kg and above.\n\n\nAlternate Routes of Delivery\n\n\nThe feasibility of alternate routes of delivery for exendin-4 has been explored by measuring exendin-4 in the circulation in conjunction with observation of a biologic response, such as plasma glucose lowering in diabetic animals, after administration. Passage of exendin-4 has been investigated across several surfaces, the respiratory tract (nasal, tracheal, and pulmonary routes) and the gut (sublingual, gavage and intraduodenal routes). Biologic effect and appearance of exendin-4 in blood have been observed with each route of administration via the respiratory tract, and with sublingual and gavaged peptide via the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\nIntra-tracheal Administration—As described herein, intra-tracheal administration of exendin-4 into fasted rats (20 μg/50 μL/animal) produced a rise in the mean plasma exendin-4 concentration to 2060±960 pg/mL within 5-10 minutes after administration. Elevated plasma exendin-4 concentrations were maintained for at least 1 hour after instillation (see \nFIG. 7\n). In diabetic db/db mice, intra-tracheal instillation of exendin-4 (1 μg/animal) lowered plasma glucose concentration by 30% while that in the vehicle control group increased by 41% 1.5 hours after treatment. In these animals the mean plasma concentration of exendin-4 was 777±365 pg/ml at 4.5 hours after treatment (see \nFIGS. 8\n \na \nand \n8\n \nb\n).\n\n\nIn diabetic ob/ob mice, intra-tracheal instillation of exendin-4 (1 μg/animal) decreased plasma glucose concentration to 43% of the pre-treatment level after 4 hours while that in the vehicle control group was not changed (see \nFIGS. 9\n \na \nand \n9\n \nb\n).\n\n\nNine overnight-fasted male Sprague Dawley rats (age 96-115 days, weight 365-395, mean 385 g) were anesthetized with halothane, tracheotomized, and catheterized via the femoral artery. At t=0 min, 30 μL of saline in which was dissolved 2.1 μg (n=3), 21 μg (n=3) or 210 μg of exendin-4 was instilled into the trachea beyond the level of intubation. Blood samples were taken after 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min, centrifuged and plasma stored at −20° C. for subsequent immunoradiometric (IRMA) assay directed to N-terminal and C-terminal epitopes of the intact exendin-4 molecule. Following intra-tracheal administration, 61-74% of peak plasma concentration was observed within 5 min. Tmax occurred between 20 and 30 min after administration. AUC and Cmax were proportional to dose. At a dose of 2.1 μg (1.5 nmol/kg), resulting in plasma concentrations of ˜50 pM (where glucose-lowering effects in man are observed), bioavailability was 7.3%. The coefficient of variation was 44%. At higher doses, bioavailability was slightly lower, and the CV was higher (see \nFIGS. 10\n \na \nand \n10\n \nb\n). Via the tracheal route of administration, the t½ (defined pragmatically as time for plasma to fall below 50% of Cmax) was 30-60 min for the lowest dose and 60-90 min for the 2 higher doses. In summary, biologically effective quantities of exendin-4 are rapidly absorbed via the trachea without evoking apparent respiratory distress. The respiratory tract is a viable route of administration of exendin-4.\n\n\nPulmonary Administration—Increased plasma concentrations of exendin-4 were detected in rats exposed to aerosolized exendin-4. Exposure of rats to approximately 8 ng of aerosolized exendin-4 per mL of atmosphere for 10 minutes resulted in peak plasma exendin-4 concentrations of 300-1900 pg/\nmL\n 5 minutes following treatment (see \nFIG. 11\n). Similar exposure of diabetic db/db mice to aerosolized exendin-4 lead to a 33% decrease in plasma glucose concentration after 1 hour, when a mean plasma exendin-4 concentration of 170±67 pg/mL was detected. Diabetic db/db mice in the control group exposed to aerosolized saline recorded no change in plasma glucose (see \nFIGS. 12\n \na \nand \n12\n \nb\n).\n\n\nNasal administration—Application of exendin-4 into the nasal cavity of rats led to a rise in plasma concentrations. Peak values of 300 pg/mL and 6757 pg/mL were detected 10 minutes after administration of 1 μg and 100 μg exendin-4 (dissolved in 2 μL saline), respectively (see \nFIG. 13\n).\n\n\nAdministration via the Gut—Male db/db mice (approximately 50 g body wt.) were fasted for 2 h and before and after an intra-gastric administration of saline or exendin-4 (exendin-4). A 9% decrease in plasma glucose concentration was observed with 1 mg/200 μl/animal and a 15% decrease was observed with 3 mg/200 μl/animal, compared with a 10% increase plasma glucose in the controls one hour after treatment (see \nFIG. 14\n).\n\n\nSublingual Administration—Sublingual application of exendin-4 (100 μg/5 μL/animal) to diabetic db/db mice led to a 15% decrease in plasma glucose concentration one hour after treatment. A 30% increase was observed for the control group receiving saline. The mean exendin-4 plasma level at 60 minutes was 4520±1846 pg/mL (see \nFIGS. 15\n \na\n, \n15\n \nb\n, and \n15\n \nc\n).\n\n\nEight Sprague Dawley rats (˜300 g) were briefly anesthetized with metophane while a solution containing 10 μg/3 μL (n=4) or 100 μg/3 μL (n=4) was pipetted under the tongue. Blood samples were subsequently collected from the topically anesthetized tail and assayed for exendin-4 by IRMA. Plasma concentrations had begun to rise by 3 min after administration and were maximal 10 min and 30 min after administration (10 μg and 100 μg doses, respectively). Plasma exendin-4 concentration subsequently remained above the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) beyond 5 hours. Area-under-the-curve to the end of each experiment was calculated by the trapezoidal method. Two numbers were derived, one derived from total immunoreactivity, the other derived from the increment above the non-zero value present at t=0. These values were compared to historical intravenous bolus data in the same animal model to obtain, respectively, high and low estimates of bioavailability. For the 10 μg dose, sublingual bioavailability was 3.1-9.6%, and for a 100 μg dose, bioavailability was lower at 1.3-1.5%. Variability of AUC was greatest in the first hour after administration (\nCV\n 74% and 128% for 10 and 100 μg doses). For the 5-hour integral, coefficient of variation of the AUC was 20% and 64%, respectively. Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) occurred as rapidly after sublingual administration as after subcutaneous administration (Tmax ˜30 min). Cmax after sublingual administration of 10 μg exendin-4 was 1.5% that after an intravenous bolus, but 14.5% of that obtained after a subcutaneous bolus. Cmax after sublingual administration of 100 μg exendin-4 was only 0.29% of that observed after an intravenous bolus, and 6.1% of that obtained after a subcutaneous bolus (see \nFIGS. 15\n \nd \nand \n15\n \ne\n). Thus, exendin-4 can be delivered at bioeffective doses via the sublingual route. Bioavailability and C\nmax \nwere greatest, T\nmax \nwas shortest, and variability of availability was least with the lowest sublingual dose. The lowest sublingual dose resulted in plasma concentrations similar to those that are predicted to be effective in lowering glucose in humans (˜50-100 μM).\n\n\nThe optimal formulation and mode of administration of compounds of the present application to a patient depend on factors known in the art such as the particular disease or disorder, the desired effect, and the type of patient. While the compounds will typically be used to treat human patients, they may also be used to treat similar or identical diseases in other vertebrates such as other primates, farm animals such as swine, cattle and poultry, and sports animals and pets such as horses, dogs and cats.\n\n\nTo assist in understanding the present invention the following Examples are included which describe the results of a series of experiments. The experiments relating to this invention should not, of course, be construed as specifically limiting the invention and such variations of the invention, now known or later developed, which would be within the purview of one skilled in the art are considered to fall within the scope of the invention as described herein and hereinafter claimed.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nPreparation of Exendin-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis Ser Asp Gly Thr Phe Thr Ser Asp Leu Ser Lys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGln Met Glu Glu Glu Ala Val Arg Leu Phe Ile Glu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrp Leu Lys Asn Gly Gly Pro Ser Ser Gly Ala Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro Pro Ser-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above amidated peptide was assembled on 4-(2′-4′-dimethoxyphenyl)-Fmoc aminomethyl phenoxy acetamide norleucine MBHA resin (Novabiochem, 0.55 mmole/g) using Fmoc-protected amino acids (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). In general, single-coupling cycles were used throughout the synthesis and Fast Moc (HBTU activation) chemistry was employed. Deprotection (Fmoc group removal) of the growing peptide chain was achieved using piperidine. Final deprotection of the completed peptide resin was achieved using a mixture of triethylsilane (0.2 mL), ethanedithiol (0.2 mL), anisole (0.2 mL), water (0.2 mL) and trifluoroacetic acid (15 mL) according to standard methods (Introduction to Cleavage Techniques, Applied Biosystems, Inc.) The peptide was precipitated in ether/water (50 mL) and centrifuged. The precipitate was reconstituted in glacial acetic acid and lyophilized. The lyophilized peptide was dissolved in water). Crude purity was about 75%.\n\n\nUsed in purification steps and analysis were Solvent A (0.1% TFA in water) and Solvent B (0.1% TFA in ACN).\n\n\nThe solution containing peptide was applied to a preparative C-18 column and purified (10% to 40% Solvent B in Solvent A over 40 minutes). Purity of fractions was determined isocratically using a C-18 analytical column. Pure fractions were pooled furnishing the above-identified peptide. Analytical RP-HPLC (\ngradient\n 30% to 60% Solvent B in Solvent A over 30 minutes) of the lyophilized peptide gave product peptide having an observed retention time of 19.2 minutes.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nPreparation of Exendin-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis Gly Glu Gly Thr Phe Thr Ser Asp Leu Ser Lys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGln Met Glu Glu Glu Ala Val Arg Leu Phe Ile Glu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrp Leu Lys Asn Gly Gly Pro Ser Ser Gly Ala Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro Pro Ser-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above amidated peptide was assembled on 4-(2′-4′-dimethoxyphenyl)-Fmoc aminomethyl phenoxy acetamide norleucine MBHA resin (Novabiochem, 0.55 mmole/g) using Fmoc-protected amino acids (Applied Biosystems, Inc.), cleaved from the resin, deprotected and purified in a similar way to Exendin-3 as describe in Example 1. Used in analysis were Solvent A (0.1% TFA in water) and Solvent B (0.1% TFA in ACN). Analytical RP-HPLC (\ngradient\n 36% to 46% Solvent B in Solvent A over 30 minutes) of the lyophilized peptide gave product peptide having an observed retention time of 14.9 minutes. Electrospray Mass Spectrometry (M): calculated 4186.6. found 4186.0 to 4186.8 (four lots).\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nClearance by the Kidney\n\n\nThe kidney can play a major role in the elimination of some molecules (drugs, peptides, proteins). For some molecules, this process begins when the kidney filters the blood at the glomerulus to produce the ultrafiltrate described below. The glomerular filter discriminates not only on the basis of molecular weight but also by acting as a negatively charged selective barrier, promoting retention of anionic compounds. The free fraction of molecules in the plasma (not protein bound) with a molecular weight less than 5 kD and an effective radii less than 15 Å are easily filtered. For larger molecular weight molecules they are filtered on a more restrictive and limited basis, principally by molecular size, structure and net charge. The cutoff point for glomerular filtration lies between albumin (67 kD) which is retained and hemoglobin (68 kD) which is filtered. Albumin, with an effective radius of about 36 Å is filtered less than 1% at the glomerulus.\n\n\nOnce in the glomerulus a molecule travels to the proximal tubule where it is either reabsorbed or it passes on through the loop of Henle to the distal tubule where collecting ducts drain the filtrate into the bladder. Filtered proteins and peptides are typically cleaved by brush border enzymes in the proximal tubule, from where they are efficiently retrieved by sodium/amino cotransporters (scavenging pumps). Otherwise, molecules which are polar, ionized and of large molecular weight will not be reabsorbed. Throughout this process metabolizing enzymes in the renal cortex (proximal tubules) may also degrade the molecule into more polar molecules, thereby increasing the probability for excretion into the urine. Many peptide hormones (for example, amylin, calcitonins) are degraded by passage through the renal circulation, presumably by vascular ectoenzymes accessible to the plasma, independently of the process of glomerular filtration. In those examples, rates of peptide clearance from the plasma are similar to the rate of renal plasma flow, which is ˜3-fold greater than the rate of glomerular filtration.\n\n\nStudies performed to identify plasma circulating metabolites of exendin-4 yielded very little evidence of proteolytic degradation; following large intravenous doses in animals, HPLC analysis of plasma showed only the presence of intact exendin, and negligible appearance of “daughter” peaks indicative of the buildup of degradation products. This is in contrast to other peptides studied (for example amylin and GLP-1) where the disappearance of the “parent” HPLC peak was associated with the appearance of “daughter” HPLC peaks, subsequently identified as subpeptide degradants. The absence of plasma degradants of exendin indicates little or no proteolysis at any site, including the renal circulation. Any clearance by the kidney, then, is via non-proteolytic means, namely filtration or active excretion (as occurs with para-amino hippurate).\n\n\nInitial measurements of exendin clearance in man (120-130 mL/min), monkeys (˜9 mL/min) and rats (3.2-4.4 mL/min) matched reported glomerular filtration rates in those species. To test whether renal filtration could be the principal mode of exendin elimination, studies were performed in overnight fasted nephrectomized male rats infused with exendin at a constant rate. Steady-state plasma levels of exendin-4 were greatly increased in nephrectomized rats compared to rats with their kidneys intact. This data indicated that the kidney was responsible for at least 80% of the clearance of exendin 4 (see \nFIGS. 5 and 6\n). Exendin clearance rates in intact rats were, again, similar to glomerular filtration rates expected in those rats (4.2 mL/min). Taken together these results indicate that very little metabolism occurs systemically and that most of the clearance of \nexendin\n 4 is through the kidney via filtration (but not by renal intravascular proteolysis). The low amounts of immunoreactive full-length exendin in the urine are consistent with it being cleaved by brush border enzymes in the proximal tubule after filtration.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nExendin-4 Decreases Glucagon Secretion During Hyperglycemic Clamps in Diabetic Fatty Zucker Rats\n\n\nAbsolute or relative hyperglucagonemia is often a feature of, for example, \ntype\n 1 and \ntype\n 2 diabetes mellitus, and the suppression of excessive glucagon secretion in these and other conditions described or referred to herein is a potential benefit of therapy using glucagonostatic agents. In this Example, the effect of exendin-4 on glucagon secretion in male anaesthetized Diabetic Fatty Zucker (ZDF) rats was examined. Using an hyperinsulinemic hyperglycemic clamp protocol, factors tending to influence glucagon secretion were held constant. Plasma glucose was clamped at ˜34 \nmM\n 60 min before beginning intravenous infusions of saline (n=7) or exendin-4 (0.21 μg+2.1 μg/mL/h; n=7). Plasma glucagon concentration measured prior to these infusions were similar in both groups (306±30 pM versus 252±32 pM, respectively; n.s.).\n\n\nMean plasma glucagon concentration in exendin-4 infused rats was nearly half of that in saline-infused rats in the final 60 minutes of the clamp (165±18 pM versus 298±26 pM, respectively; P<0.002). The hyperglycemic clamp protocol also enabled measurement of insulin sensitivity. Glucose infusion rate during the clamp was increased by 111±7% in exendin-4-treated versus control rats (P<0.001). In other words, exendin-4 exhibited a glucagonostatic effect in ZDF rats during hyperglycemic clamp studies, an effect that will be of therapeutic benefit in diabetic humans.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nMetabolic Effects of Exendin-4 on Glucagon Secretion in People with \nType\n 2 Diabetes\n\n\nIn this Example, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of synthetic exendin-4 was evaluated in 8 male non-insulin using patients with \ntype\n 2 diabetes who had discontinued other antidiabetic therapy for a minimum of 7 days. Each patient received subcutaneous (SC) injections of placebo (PBO) and 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 μg/kg exendin-4 48 hours apart in a single-blind, dose-rising, placebo controlled crossover design. Five patients also received a 0.4 μg/kg dose. Plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon concentrations were assessed fasting and in response to a 7 Kcal/kg Sustacal® challenge administered at the time of exendin-4/PBO injection. Gastric emptying was evaluated by measuring serum acetaminophen concentrations following a 20 mg/kg oral dose of liquid acetaminophen administered with the Sustacal®. No safety issues were identified based upon reported adverse events, EKG and safety lab monitoring. Doses of 0.3 and 0.4 μg/kg elicited a dose-dependent increase in nausea; vomiting occurred at the highest dose.\n\n\nPlasma glucose concentrations were reduced in all doses of exendin-4 compared to PBO although insulin concentrations were not significantly different. The 8 hour mean±SE changes in plasma glucose AUC from baseline were +391±187, −263±108, −247±64, −336±139, and −328±70 mg*hr/dL for the PBO, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 μg/kg doses respectively. The 3 hr changes in plasma glucagon were +128.0±19.2, −5.6±10.5, −29.4±18.6, −40.5±24.5, and +6.9±38.6 pg*hr/mL respectively. The gastric emptying rate was slowed in all doses and the mean total absorbed acetaminophen over 6 hours was reduced by 51%, 50%, 57% and 79% compared to PBO for 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 μg/kg doses respectively. In summary, SC injection of exendin-4 to patients identified no safety issues, was tolerated at doses ≦0.3 μg/kg, reduced plasma glucose and glucagon and slowed the rate of gastric emptying. These observations support the use of exendin for the treatment of conditions that would benefit from reduced glucagon levels and/or suppression of glucagon, including but not limited to \ntype\n 1 and \ntype\n 2 diabetes.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nPEG Modified Exendin-4\n\n\nIn the case of \nexendin\n 4, a 39 amino acid peptide with a molecular weight of 4187, modifications that increase its size and/or increase its anionic nature will decrease its ability to be filtered by the kidney. Because clearance of \nexendin\n 4 is largely by the kidney this will effectively increase its half life. Other properties of PEGylation (increased plasma half-life due to evasion of such renal and/or cellular clearance mechanisms that may exist; reduced immunogenicity and antigenicity; increased solubility; resistance to proteolysis; reduced toxicity (avoid dose spike); improved thermal and mechanical stability; improved permeability of the mucus or epithelial layer; and selective control over a specific biological function) are also of potential benefit for \nexendin\n 4 and exendin agonists.\n\n\nIn particular, because we have observed multiple pharmacologies (likely representing multiple receptor subtypes), different spectra of biological activities of \nexendin\n 4 may be selected by putting a PEG group at appropriate positions. Loss or alteration of bioactivity has been reported for PEGylated proteins which may be due to the presence of the PEG chains themselves, the particular site occupied by the PEG chain, or the coupling conditions having an adverse effect on the protein.\n\n\nPrimary considerations for PEG modification in terms of filtration at the kidney of exendin and exendin agonists are size and charge. Unmodified, \nexendin\n 4 has a molecular weight of approximately 4.2 kD and is anionic in nature with an overall net charge of approximately −2 at physiological pH. One, two or three PEG constituents may be covalently linked to \nexendin\n 4 or an analog of \nexendin\n 4, for example, with one PEG constituent being preferred. The size of the PEG can vary from a molecular weight of 500 to 20,000, preferably between 5,000 and 12,000.\n\n\nMany of the methods for covalent attachment of PEG take advantage of the epsilon-amino group on lysine. \nExendin\n 4 has two lysines that can be modified by attachment of PEG. An alanine scan of AC3177 (Leu\n14\n, Phe\n25\n1-28 exendin-4 (SEQ ID NO:9)), a shortened analog of \nexendin\n 4, revealed positions that are sensitive to substitution by alanine. The two lysines at \n \npositions\n \n 12 and 27 were moderately affected by this substitution suggesting that loss of the lysine specific R group side chain (methylene chain plus epsilon-amino group) is tolerated. With regard to the full-length peptide, \nexendin\n 4, the two lysine positions are appropriate for PEG attachment (see \ncompounds\n 1 and 2). In addition, depending on the chemistry used to conjugate the PEG, the epsilon-amino groups at these positions may be masked thereby increasing the anionic nature of the peptide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(201)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 223)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLS\nK(PEG)\nQMEEEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(202)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 224)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEAVRLFIEWL\nK(PEG)\nNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the results of the alanine scan, other likely positions that may be modified by insertion of a Lys-PEG or equivalent, for example, are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(203)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 225)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\nK(PEG)\nEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(204)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 226)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEG\nK(PEG)\nFTSDLSKQMEEEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(205)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 227)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFT\nK(PEG)\nDLSKQMEEEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(206)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 228)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSD\nK(PEG)\nSKQMEEEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(207)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 229)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDL\nK(PEG)\nKQMEEEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(208)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 230)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLSK\nK(PEG)\nMEEEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(209)*\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 231)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLSKQME\nK(PEG)\nEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(210)*\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 232)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLSKQMEE\nK(PEG)\nAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(211)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 233)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEA\nK(PEG)\nRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(212)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 234)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEAVR\nK(PEG)\nFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(213)*\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 235)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEAVRLFI\nK(PEG)\nWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(214)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 236)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEAVRLFIE\nK(PEG)\nLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(215)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 237)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEAVRLFIEWLK\nK(PEG)\nGGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three positions* above normally containing a glutamic acid that were indicated for modification with K(PEG) can also be modified by conjugation to the glutamic side chain carboxyl group, E(PEG).\n\n\nAnother analog in which the Lys-PEG can be added is at the supposed GlyGly turn:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(216)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 238)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEAVRLFIEWLKN\nK(PEG)\nGPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(217)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 239)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHGEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEAVRLFIEWLKNG\nK(PEG)\nPSSGAPPPS-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositions 29-39 of exendin-4 may not be critical for the glucose lowering activity as evidenced by AC3177 having nearly equipotent activity to \nexendin\n 4, and any of them, alone or in combination, can be substituted for K(PEG) or an equivalent.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nExendin-4 is a Circulating, Meal-Related Peptide in the Gila Monster\n\n\nThis experiment investigated whether exendin-4 has a metabolic role in the Gila monster lizard itself. To investigate whether exendin-4 appeared in the blood of the Gila monster in response to feeding, blood was sampled from one animal fasted for 7 weeks, before and 30 min after ingestion of a small rat. Plasma was assayed for full-length exendin-4 using an immunoradiometric assay with monoclonal antibody pairs directed to epitopes at N- and C-termini of exendin-4. Fasting plasma exendin-4 concentration was 76 pg/mL, near the lower limit of quantitation. After eating, this value rose 300-fold to 23,120 pg/mL.\n\n\nIn a second experiment, serial samples were taken from two animals fasted five weeks before and after ingestion of one or two small rats (47-49 g). Plasma exendin-4 concentration rose 23- to 36-fold (to 4860, 8340 pg/mL) immediately after eating, consistent with a direct passage of exendin-4 from the salivary gland to blood. After eating a second rat (t=30 min), plasma exendin-4 concentration in one Gila rose further to 27,209 pg/mL. Plasma exendin-4 concentration decayed with a t½ of 5.00 and 5.33 hours, respectively. In conclusion, exendin-4, known to originate from the salivary gland of the Gila monster, appears in high concentration in the blood immediately after eating. This may represent a meal-related signal to inhibit further eating and promote nutrient storage.\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nExendin-4 Decreases Glucagon Secretion During Hyperglycemic Clamps in Diabetic Fatty Zucker Rats\n\n\nAbsolute or relative hyperglucagonemia is often a feature of \ntype\n 1 and \ntype\n 2 diabetes mellitus, and the suppression of excessive glucagon secretion is a potential benefit of therapy using glucagonostatic agents. In this Example, the effect of exendin-4 on glucagon secretion in male anaesthetized Diabetic Fatty Zucker (ZDF) rats was examined. Using an hyperinsulinemic hyperglycemic clamp protocol, factors tending to influence glucagon secretion were held constant. Plasma glucose was clamped at ˜34 \nmM\n 60 min before beginning intravenous infusions of saline (n=7) or exendin-4 (0.21 μg+2.1 μg/mL/h; n=7). Plasma glucagon concentration measured before these infusions were similar in both groups (306±30 pM versus 252±32 pM, respectively; n.s.).\n\n\nMean plasma glucagon concentration in exendin-4 infused rats was nearly half of that in saline-infused rats in the final 60 minutes of the clamp (165±18 pM versus 298±26 pM, respectively; P<0.002). The hyperglycemic clamp protocol also enabled measurement of insulin sensitivity. Glucose infusion rate during the clamp was increased by 111±7% in exendin-4-treated versus control rats (P<0.001). In other words, exendin-4 exhibited a glucagonostatic effect in ZDF rats during hyperglycemic clamp studies, an effect that will be of therapeutic benefit in diabetic humans.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nPharmacokinetics of Exendin-4 in the Rat Following Intravenous, Subcutaneous and Intraperitoneal Administration\n\n\nThis Example describes work to define the plasma pharmacokinetics of exendin-4 in rats (˜350 g body weight each) following 2.1, 21, 210 μg/rat i.v. bolus, s.c. and i.p. administration and 2.1, 21, 210 μg/hr/rat i.v. infusion (3 hr). Serial samples of plasma (˜120 μL) were assayed using a validated immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). This sandwich-type assay uses mouse-based monoclonal antibodies that react with exendin-4 but do not react with GLP-1 or tested metabolites of exendin-4 or GLP-1. The lower limit of quantitation was 15 pM (63 pg/mL). The estimated t\n1/2 \nfor exendin-4 was 18-41 min for i.v. bolus, 28-49 for i.v. continuous, 90-216 min for s.c. and 125-174 min for i.p. injection. Bioavailability was 65-76% for s.c. and i.p. injection. Clearance determined from the i.v. infusion was 4-8 mL/min. Both C\nmax \nand AUC values within each route of administration were proportional to dose. Volume of distribution was 457-867 mL. Clearance and bioavailability were not dose dependent.

Sprague-Dawley rats (˜400 g) were anesthetized with halothane and cannulated via the femoral artery and saphenous vein. Following a 90-min recovery period, saline or peptide (30 μmol/kg/min each) was administered i.v. (1 ml/h for 2 hours; n=4-5 for each group). Thirty min after infusion commenced, D-glucose (5.7 mmol/kg, 0.8 ml) was injected i.v. In saline-treated, exendin-4-treated and GLP-1-treated rats, plasma glucose concentrations were similar before injection (9.3±0.3, 9.7±0.3, 10.3±0.4 mM), increased by similar amounts after glucose injection (21.7, 21.3, 23.7 mM), and resulted in a similar 60-min glucose AUC (987±39, 907±30, 1096±68 mM·min, respectively). That is, the glycemic stimulus was similar in each treatment group. Plasma insulin concentration in saline-treated rats increased 3.3-fold with the glucose challenge (230±53 to a peak of 765±188 μM). With exendin-4 infusion, the increase in plasma insulin concentration was 6.8-fold (363±60 to 2486±365 μM). With GLP-1 the increase in plasma insulin concentration was 2.9-fold (391±27 to 1145±169 μM), which was similar to that obtained in saline-treated rats. The 60-min insulin AUC in saline-treated rats was 24±6 nM·min, was increased 2.8-fold in exendin-treated rats (67±8 nM·min; P<0.003 versus saline; P<0.02 versus GLP-1) and by 20% in GLP-1-treated rats (n.s. versus saline). Amplification of glucose-stimulated insulin release by exendin-4 was also tested at infusion rates of 3 and 300 pmol/kg/min and shown to be dose-dependent. Thus, exendin-4 is more potent and/or effective than GLP-1 in amplifying glucose-stimulated insulin release in intact rats.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\nDevelopment and Validation of an Immunoradiometric Assay (IRMA) for the quantitation of Exendin-4 in Plasma and its Application to Preclinical Toxicity and Phase I Clinical Evaluations\n\n\nA sensitive and specific sandwich-type immunoradio-metric (IRMA) assay was developed for quantitation of plasma exendin-4 concentration using synthetic exendin-4 as the immunogen. One mouse-derived monoclonal antibody recognizes a C-terminal epitope on exendin-4 (capture antibody) but does not cross-react with GLP-1. The second antibody (detector antibody labeled with \n125\nI) recognizes an N-terminal epitope on exendin-4 and GLP-1, and requires a terminal histidine for binding. Thus, the assay as a whole does not detect GLP-1 (7-36)NH\n2\n, GLP-1 (7-36)COOH or exendin(3-39). Assay validation in rat, monkey, dog, rabbit and human plasmas showed inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation <20% and <10%, respectively, accuracy of ±15% with target low, mid and high controls, and lower and upper limits of quantitation of 62.8 and 2512 pg/mL, respectively. Plasma samples from 28-day subcutaneous toxicity evaluations of exendin-4 in rats and monkeys and a Phase I clinical study in normal subjects were evaluated using the IRMA. The C\nmax \nvalues in the animals studies are shown in the table below. Human samples from subcutaneous administration of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 μg/kg yielded C\nmax \nvalues of 90, 224, 370 and 587 pg/mL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCmax (pg/mL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDose (μg/kg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n100\n\n\n1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRat\n\n\n7,000\n\n\n127,000\n\n\n1,180,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMonkey\n\n\n20,000\n\n\n170,000\n\n\n1,890,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nComparison of GLP-1 Receptor Binding/Activating and Glucose-Lowering Effects of GLP-1 and Exendin-4\n\n\nExendin-4 was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis techniques and compared to synthetic GLP-1 in terms of in vitro binding to, and activation of, GLP-1 receptors, and in vivo in terms of lowering plasma glucose in diabetic db/db mice. In a plasma membrane preparation of a rat insulinoma cell line (RINm5f) that expresses the GLP-1 receptor, the peptides were assayed for their ability to bind and displace radiolabeled GLP-1 and for their ability to stimulate the production of cAMP. The relative order of binding potency was found to be GLP-1>exendin-4. The relative order of cyclase activation was GLP-1=exendin-4. Affinities, as shown in the table below, differ over a 4- to 5-fold range. In contrast, in vivo glucose lowering potency differed over a 3430-fold range. Exendin-4 was 3430-fold more potent than GLP-1. The in vivo potency of exendin-4 does not match potency at the GLP-1 receptor, and is likely the culmination of an aggregate of properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGlucose-lowering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBinding IC50 (nM)\n\n\nCyclase EC50 (nM)\n\n\nED50 (μg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGLP-1\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n0.28\n\n\n20.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExendin-4\n\n\n0.66\n\n\n0.30\n\n\n0.006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 13\n\n\nComparison of Glycemic Indices and Insulin Sensitivity in Pair-Fed and Exendin-4 Treated Diabetic Fatty Zucker Rats\n\n\nThis Example tests whether the beneficial effects of exendin-4 in ZDF rats were secondary to changes in food intake. It compares effects obtained with exendin-4 to effects observed in saline-treated matched animals who consumed the same amount of food as was eaten by ZDF rats injected subcutaneously twice daily with 10 μg exendin-4. Plasma glucose and HbA1c were measured weekly for 6 weeks. One day after the last treatment, animals were anesthetized with halothane and subjected to an hyperinsulinemic (50 mU/kg/min) euglycemic clamp. Changes in HbA1c over 6 weeks differed between treatment groups (P<0.001 ANOVA), increasing in ad lib fed (n=5) and pair fed (n=5) rats, but decreasing in exendin-4-treated rats (n=5). Similarly, changes in plasma glucose differed between treatment groups (P<0.002 ANOVA), increasing in ad lib fed and pair fed ZDF rats, and decreasing in ZDF rats treated with exendin-4. In the final hour of a 3-hour clamp protocol, glucose infusion rate in exendin-4-treated rats tended to be higher than in pair fed (+105%) and ad lib fed (+20%) controls, respectively (10.14±1.43 n=5, 8.46±0.87 n=4, 4.93±2.02 mg/kg/min n=3; n.s. P=0.09 ANOVA). Another index of insulin sensitivity, plasma lactate concentration, differed significantly between treatment groups (P<0.02 ANOVA) and was lowest in exendin-4-treated rats. Thus, exendin-4 treatment is associated with improvement in glycemic indices and in insulin sensitivity that is partly, but not fully, matched in controls fed the same amount of food, indicating that improvements in metabolic control with exendin-4 in ZDF rats are at least partly due to mechanisms beyond caloric restriction.\n\n\nExample 14\n\n\nClinical Studies and the Stimulation of Endogenous Insulin Secretion by Subcutaneous Synthetic Exendin-4 in Healthy Overnight Fasted Volunteers\n\n\nIn a double blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose clinical trial to explore safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics of synthetic exendin-4, exendin-4 formulated for subcutaneous injection was evaluated in healthy male volunteers while assessing effects upon plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Five single subcutaneous doses of exendin-4 (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 μg/kg) were studied in 40 healthy male volunteers in the fasting state. Maximum plasma exendin-4 concentrations were achieved between 1 and 2 hours post-dose with little difference among the doses examined. Examination of the data indicated a dose dependent increase for C\nmax\n. There were no serious adverse events reported in this study and in the healthy male volunteers that participated in this study, exendin-4 was well tolerated at subcutaneous doses up to and including 0.1 μg/kg. A decrease in plasma glucose concentration was also observed at this dose. At doses of 0.2 μg/kg and higher, the most commonly observed adverse events were headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and postural hypotension. There was a transient fall in plasma glucose concentration following administration of doses of 0.05 μg/kg and above.\n\n\nForty healthy, lean (mean BMI (±SE) 22.7±1.2) subjects aged 18-40 years were randomly assigned to 5 groups. Within each group of 8 subjects, 6 were assigned to exendin-4 and 2 to placebo (PBO). Exendin-4 (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 μg/kg) or placebo was administered following an overnight fast and plasma exendin-4, glucose and insulin concentrations monitored along with safety and tolerability. No safety issues were observed. Doses ≦0.1 μg/kg were tolerated as well as PBO whereas 0.2 and 0.3 μg/kg elicited a dose-dependent increase in nausea and vomiting. Peak plasma exendin-4 concentrations rose dose-dependently and following 0.1 μg/kg, exendin-4 immunoreactivity persisted for 360 min. Plasma glucose decreased following all doses, except 0.01 μg/kg, reached a nadir by 30 min and returned back to baseline within 180 min. Subjects receiving 0.3 μg/kg received a \ncaloric beverage\n 30 minutes after dosing, precluding comparison of their data. Mean change in plasma glucose (0-180 min): 0.03±0.07, −0.07±0.08, −0.38±0.14, −0.85±0.13 and −0.83±0.23 mmol/L for PBO, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 μg/kg respectively; P<0.02 versus PBO. The lowest plasma glucose recorded was 3.4 mmol/L. Corresponding mean changes in plasma insulin (0-120 min) were 0.43±0.59, 2.37±0.58, 2.28±0.66, 4.91±1.23, and 14.00±3.34 μU/mL; P<0.01 versus PBO for the 0.1 and 0.2 μg/kg groups. Thus, in healthy, overnight fasted volunteers, subcutaneous injection of exendin-4 (1) presented no safety issues, (2) was well-tolerated at doses ≦0.1 μg/kg, (3) led to exendin-4 immunoreactivity in plasma for up to 6 hrs, (4) increased plasma insulin and lowered plasma glucose in a dose-dependent manner without inducing hypoglycemia.\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\nEffectiveness of Alternative Delivery of Exendin-4 in Rodents\n\n\nThis Example tested the delivery of exendin-4 by means alternative to injection, and examined its ability to traverse mucosal surfaces in sufficient quantities to exert biological effect. Changes in concentration of plasma glucose and of intact synthetic exendin-4 (measured by a 2-site immunoradiometric assay) were observed in db/db mice administered a saline solution containing differing doses of synthetic exendin-4 via the trachea, via an aerosol mist (pulmonary), via gavage (oral), and under the tongue (sublingual). The same routes of administration, as well as intraduodenally and nasally, were tested in rats, and bioavailability was calculated, for example, for sublingual and intra-tracheal routes. Exendin-4 administered via each of the above routes in mice resulted in significant glucose-lowering \nactivity\n 1 to 4 hours after administration (db/db mice intra-tracheal P<0.02; ob/ob mice intra-tracheal P<0.0002; db/db mice aerosol P<0.0001; gavage P<0.002; sublingual P<0.02). Dose-dependent increases in plasma exendin-4 concentration were up to 777±365 pg/mL (db/db mice intra-tracheal); 170±67 pg/mL (db/db mice aerosol); 4520±1846 pg/mL (db/db mice sublingual). Similarly, in rats, exendin-4 concentrations were observed up to 68,682±38,661 pg/mL (intra-tracheal); 1900 pg/mL (pulmonary); 6757 pg/mL (nasal); 3,862±2,844 pg/mL (sublingual); but no apparent absorption or biological activity when delivered intraduodenally. Bioavailability of exendin-4 in saline was ˜7.3% at lower doses when delivered via the trachea, where 61-74% of Cmax was observed within 5 min. Kinetics thereafter were similar to those observed after subcutaneous administration. Bioavailability of exendin-4 in saline delivered under the tongue was 3.1-9.6% at lower doses. These studies support the delivery of exendin-4 and peptide agonist analogs thereof in biologically effective quantities via convenient non-injectable routes.\n\n\nExamples 16 to 20\n\n\nReagents Used\n\n\nGLP-1[7-36]NH\n2 \n(GLP-1) was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, Calif.). All other peptides were prepared using synthesis methods such as those described therein. All chemicals were of the highest commercial grade. The cAMP SPA immunoassay was purchased from Amersham. The radioligands were purchased from New England Nuclear (Boston, Mass.). RINm5f cells (American Type Tissue Collection, Rockville, Md.) were grown in DME/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells were grown at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n/95% humidified air and medium was replaced every 2 to 3 days. Cells were grown to confluence then harvested and homogenized using on a Polytron homogenizer. Cell homogenates were stored frozen at −70° C. until used.\n\n\nExample 16\n\n\nGLP-1 Receptor Binding Studies\n\n\nReceptor binding was assessed by measuring displacement of [\n125\nI]GLP-1 or [\n125\nI]exendin(9-39) from RINm5f membranes. Assay buffer contained 5 μg/ml bestatin, 1 μg/ml phosphoramidon, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V), 1 mg/ml bacitracin, and 1 mM MgCl\n2 \nin 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. To measure binding, 30 μg membrane protein (Bradford protein assay) was resuspended in 200 μl assay buffer and incubated with 60 μM [\n125\nI]GLP-1 or [\n125\nI]exendin(9-39) and unlabeled peptides for 120 minutes at 23° C. in 96 well plates (Nagle Nunc, Rochester, N.Y.). Incubations were terminated by rapid filtration with cold phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, through polyethyleneimine-treated GF/B glass fiber filters (Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.) using a Tomtec Mach II plate harvester (Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). Filters were dried, combined with scintillant, and radioactivity determined in a Betaplate liquid scintillant counter (Wallac Inc.).\n\n\nPeptide samples were run in the assay as duplicate points at 6 dilutions over a concentration range of 10\n−6\nM to 10\n−12\nM to generate response curves. The biological activity of a sample is expressed as an IC\n50 \nvalue, calculated from the raw data using an iterative curve-fitting program using a 4-parameter logistic equation (Prizm, GraphPAD Software).\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\nCyclase Activation Study\n\n\nAssay buffer contained 10 μM GTP, 0.75 mM ATP, 2.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM phosphocreatine, 12.5 U/ml creatine kinase, 0.4 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 μM IBMX in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Membranes and peptides were combined in 100 ml of assay buffer in 96 well filter-bottom plates (Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.). After 20 minutes incubation at 37° C., the assay was terminated by transfer of supernatant by filtration into a fresh 96 well plate using a Millipore vacuum manifold. Supernatant cAMP contents were quantitated by SPA immunoassay. Peptide samples were run in the assay as triplicate points at 7 dilutions over a concentration range of 10\n−6\nM to 10\n−12\nM to generate response curves. The biological activity of a particular sample was expressed as an EC\n50 \nvalue, calculated as described above.\n\n\nExample 18\n\n\nDetermination of Blood Glucose Levels in db/db Mice\n\n\nC57BLKS/J-m-db mice at least 3 months of age were utilized for the study. The mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and allowed to acclimate for at least one week before use. Mice were housed in groups of ten at 22° C.±1° C. with a 12:12 light:dark cycle, with lights on at 6 a.m. All animals were deprived of food for 2 hours before taking baseline blood samples. Approximately 70 μl of blood was drawn from each mouse via eye puncture, after a light anesthesia with metophane. After collecting baseline blood samples, to measure plasma glucose concentrations, all animals receive subcutaneous injections of either vehicle (10.9% NaCl), exendin-4 or test compound (1 μg) in vehicle. Blood samples were drawn again, using the same procedure, after exactly one hour from the injections, and plasma glucose concentrations were measured. For each animal, the % change in plasma value, from baseline value, was calculated.\n\n\nExample 19\n\n\nDose Response Determination of Blood Glucose Levels in db/db Mice\n\n\nC57BLKS/J-m-db/db mice, at least 3 months of age were utilized for the study. The mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and allowed to acclimate for at least one week before use. Mice were housed in groups of ten at 22° C.±1° C. with a 12:12 light:dark cycle, with lights on at 6 a.m. All animals were deprived of food for 2 hours before taking baseline blood samples. Approximately 70 μl of blood was drawn from each mouse via eye puncture, after a light anesthesia with metophane. After collecting baseline blood samples, to measure plasma glucose concentrations, all animals receive subcutaneous injections of either vehicle, exendin-4 or test compound in concentrations indicated. Blood samples were drawn again, using the same procedure, after exactly one hour from the injections, and plasma glucose concentrations were measured. For each animal, the % change in plasma value, from baseline value, was calculated and a dose dependent relationship was evaluated using Graphpad Prizm™ software.\n\n\nExample 20\n\n\nGastric Emptying\n\n\nThe following study was and may be carried out to examine the effects of exendin-4 and/or an exendin agonist compound on gastric emptying in rats. This experiment followed a modification of the method of Scarpignato, et al., \nArch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. \n246:286-94, 1980. Male Harlan Sprague Dawley (HSD) rats were used. All animals were housed at 22.7±0.8 C in a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle (experiments being performed during the light cycle) and were fed and watered ad libitum (Diet LM-485, Teklad, Madison, Wis.). Exendin-4 was synthesized according to standard peptide synthesis methods. The preparation of exendin-4 is described in Example 2. The determination of gastric emptying by the method described below was performed after a fast of 20 hours to ensure that the stomach contained no chyme that would interfere with spectrophotometric absorbance measurements.\n\n\nConscious rats received by gavage, 1.5 ml of an acaloric gel containing 1.5% methyl cellulose (M-0262, Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, Mo.) and 0.05% phenol red indicator. Twenty minutes after gavage, rats were anesthetized using 5% halothane, the stomach exposed and clamped at the pyloric and lower esophageal sphincters using artery forceps, removed and opened into an alkaline solution which was made up to a fixed volume. Stomach content was derived from the intensity of the phenol red in the alkaline solution, measured by absorbance at a wavelength of 560 nm. In separate experiments on 7 rats, the stomach and small intestine were both excised and opened into an alkaline solution. The quantity of phenol red that could be recovered from the upper gastrointestinal tract within 20 minutes of gavage was 89±4%; dye which appeared to bind irrecoverably to the gut luminal surface may have accounted for the balance. To account for a maximal dye recovery of less than 100%, percent of stomach contents remaining after 20 min were expressed as a fraction of the gastric contents recovered from control rats sacrificed immediately after gavage in the same experiment. Percent gastric contents remaining=(absorbance at 20 min)/(absorbance at 0 mm)×100.\n\n\nOne skilled in the art would readily appreciate that the present invention is well adapted to carry out the objects and obtain the ends and advantages mentioned, as well as those inherent therein.
