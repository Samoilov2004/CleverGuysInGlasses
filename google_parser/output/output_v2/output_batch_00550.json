Description\n\n\n\n\n Novel radioimmunoconjugates and uses thereof \n\n\nTechnical field of the invention \n\n\n The present invention relates to radioimmunotherapy of hematologic cancer with a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody with an unexpectedly high cytotoxicity. \n\n\nBackground of the invention \n\n\n Therapy with radiolabeled antibodies has been introduced against non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and is an approved method today. Two products are on the market, Zevalin™ and Bexxar™, and both targets the CD20 antigen (Jacene et al., 2007). \n\n\nAlso the immunotherapeutic agent rituximab (Rituxan™/Mabthera™) targets the CD20 antigen. One problem with treatment against the same target is the possibility of immunophenotypic drift during the disease course (Ngo et al., 2009) which could cause diminished effects of CD20 therapy when repeated over time as in rituximab therapy or if CD20-based radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is administered following prolonged rituximab therapy. A large number of patients receiving CD20 directed therapy will eventually experience relapse (Buchegger et al., 2006; Gordon et al 2004). Thus, there is a significant need for RIT that targets another antigen than the CD20 in NHL patients. In the early development of RIT, the two antigens CD37 and CD20 were evaluated as targets (Press et al., 2001). It was concluded that the CD20 targeting RIT was more appropriate and therefore the development of CD37 directed RIT was abandoned . Thus, it is known in the art that monoclonal antibodies are suitable for use in RIT against lymphoma, but that radioimmunoconjugate (RIC) targeting CD20 is superior to RIC targeting CD37 (Press et al., 2001). \n\n\nIn recent years CD37 has attracted some new interest (Heider et al., 2009; \n\n\nGrosmaire, 2007), mainly as target for immunotherapy using chimeric or \n\n humanized antibody constructs. These works teaches away from using \n\n\nconventional murine IgG monoclonal antibodies, since murine antibodies may induce human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) production in patients, which can cause discomfort and reduced efficacy of immunotherapies. \n\n\nFor RIT, conventional murine monoclonal antibodies are still considered interesting, since in general the protein doses used are lower and the treatment need not being repeated to the same extent as with immunotherapy. Also the clearance of murine IgG is generally slightly faster than humanized or chimeric versions of the same IgG, which may be more appropriate in terms of whole body radiation exposure from RIT, at least in some settings. It should be noted that both Bexxar and Zevalin are based on murine antibodies. \n\n\nThe present invention provides the anti-CD37 murine antibody HHl as carrier for radioisotope. The original hybridoma clone that produces the murine anti-CD37 antibody HHl was developed in the 1980's (Smeland et al., 1985) and the HHl antibody has been in sale for in vitro use in immunohistochemistry for several years. HHl has not previously been evaluated for radioimmunotherapy in terms of biodistribution and cellular cytotoxicity. The current work was therefore undertaken to evaluate the suitability of HHl in radioimmunotherapy. In contrast to the previous clinical and preclinical work with anti-CD37 RIC, which used \n131\nI directly radiolabeled to the tyrosine residues using the chloramineT/Iodogen methods, the HHl was radiolabeled via a chelator using a metallic radionuclide instead of a halogen. \n\n\nUsing a metallic radionuclide labeled via a chelator-linker could be advantageous since the use of \n131\nI-labeled antibodies is associated with the exposure of the thyroid to various amounts of iodine released from the RIC's. \n\n\nIn a previous study to evaluate whether HHl was suitable for producing a radioimmunoconjugate CHX-A-DTPA was conjugated to HHl and the conjugate labeled with \n205\n'\n206\nBi for in vitro modeling purposes (Henriksen et al., 1997). \n\n The uptake in the cell line Raji was compared for bismuth conjugated to HH l or streptavidin . In the latter case cells had been presaturated with biotinylated-HH l . \n\n\nIt was found that the number of chelators required to ensure functional RIC when labeled with \n212\nBi or \n213\nBi was a limiting factor. It was therefore suggested to use biotinylated HH l instead of a HH l based RIC. Once bound to the cells, the biotinylated HH l could then be targeted with radiolabeled streptavidin . \n\n\nThus, the work suggests that HH l labeled with an alpha-particle-emitting radionuclide was less useful due to insufficient specific activity at the chelator concentrations deemed tolerable for the HH l to retain sufficient bind ing ability. \n\n\nIt was also indicated in the paper that a beta-emitter would be even less suitable for constructing a functional RIC compared with an alpha-emitter (Henriksen et al, 1997) as the authors stated that targeted rad iotherapy with beta-emitter should be inferior in d isseminated disease because cross-fire is essential for obtaining sufficient effect. \n\n\nThus, the above cited work teaches away from using a directly chelated HH l in radioimmunotherapy and also away from using HH l in a beta-emitter based RIC. \n\n\nSummary of the invention \n\n\n The present invention relates to a radioimmunoconjugate that binds human CD37 comprising murine monoclonal antibody HH l, a linker, and a radionuclide selected from the group consisting of \n211\nAt, \n213\nBi, \n212\nBi, \n212\nPb, \n225\nAc, \n227\nTh, \n90\nY, \n186\nRe, \n188\nRe, \n199\nAu, \n194\nIr, \n166\nHo, \n159\nGd, \n153\nSm, \n149\nPm, \n142\nPr, \nm\nAg, \n109\nPd, \n77\nAs, \n67\nCu, \n47\nSc, and \n177\nLu . \n\n\nIn an embod iment of the present invention the linker is a chelating linker and the radionuclide is \n177\nLu . \n\n\nAn aspect of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a radioimmunoconjugate of the present invention, and a \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n In an embod iment of the present invention the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprises one or more additional antibodies or \n\n\nradioimmunoconjugates. \n\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention one or more additional antibodies or radioimmunoconjugates target CD20. \n\n\nA further embodiment of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention for treating B-cell malignant cells expressing the CD37 antigen . \n\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutical composition is for treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia . \n\n\nAn aspect of the present invention relates to the use of the radioimmunoconjugate of the present invention for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. \n\n\nAn embodiment of the present invention relates to the use of the \n\n\nradioimmunoconjugate of the present invention ad ministered in combination with or in addition to other therapy. \n\n\nIn an embod iment of the present invention the therapy is selected from \n\n\npretreatment, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, surgery, \n\n\nradiotherapy, and/or photodynamic therapy. \n\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention the therapy comprises pretreatment using anti-CD20 and/or anti-CD37 monoclonal antibody prior to the treatment with the radioimmunoconjugate of the present invention . \n\n\nAn aspect of the present invention relates to a method for treatment of a B-cell malignancy selected from non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, comprising administration of an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention . \n\n Another aspect of the present invention relates to a kit for the production of the radioimmunoconjugate of the present invention comprising two or more vials, wherein one vial contains a conjugate comprising a chelator linked to a murine monoclonal antibody HH1; and a second vial contains a radionuclide. \n\n\nAn embodiment of the present invention relates to a kit of the present invention, wherein the content of one or several of the vials are either lyophilized or in a solution. In another embodiment of the present invention the radioimmunoconjugate is generated by mixing the content of the two vials. \n\n\nBrief description of the figures \n\n\nFigure 1 \n\n\nCell-bound antibody immediately (A) and 96 hours (B) after washing for incubation of Raji, Rael and Daudi cells with \ni n\nIn-HHl, \ni n\nIn-rituximab, \n125\nI-HH1 and \n125\nI-rituximab. \n\n\nFigure 2 \n\n\nActivity bound to Daudi cells after incubation with \n177\nLu-HHl or \n177\nLu-rituximab for 2 h (A) and 18 h (B).

Data from experiments with various dosages of unlabeled HH l and rituximab d id not indicate any effects from the unlabeled antibod ies in the g rowth assay used . \n\n\nOne possible explanation could be that there are fewer cells with very low antigen density among CD37 vs. CD20 even thoug h CD20 is on average more strong ly expressed on the cell line used . \n\n\nRetention data did not suggest better retention due to internalization of CD37, which would otherwise be a possible explanation, since some internalization has been reported with the CD37 antigen (Press et al, 2001) . Thus, the present invention relates to a radioimmunoconjugate that binds human CD37 comprising murine monoclonal antibody HH l, a linker, and a radionuclide selected from the group consisting of \n211\nAt, \n213\nBi, \n212\nBi, \n212\nPb, \n225\nAc, \n227\nTh, \n90\nY, \n186\nRe, \n188\nRe, \n199\nAu, \n194\nIr, \n166\nHo, \n159\nGd, \n153\nSm, \n149\nPm, \n142\nPr, \nm\nAg, \n109\nPd, \n77\nAs, \n67\nCu, \n47\nSc, and \n177\nLu . \n\n\nIn an embod iment of the present invention the linker is a chelating linker. \n\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention the rad ionuclide is \n177\nLu . In yet another embod iment the radionuclide is another beta-emitter or an alpha- emitter. \n\n\nThe present invention suggests, with in vitro data, that radiolabeled HH l binds more effectively to the CD37 antigen than rad iolabeled rituximab do to the CD20 \n\n antigen, i.e., it reached maximum binding to the antigen with less circulating antibody required (Table 2, Figure 2). \n\n\nIt also required less time to reach maximum binding (Figure 2). These would be important features in vivo as well because this means that tumor cells can trap the RIC even at lower concentration of circulating antibodies, a situation that may occur in less available areas of solid tumors and for single tumor cells and micrometastases located in remote areas of normal tissues. This is significantly different from previous data which indicated that higher antibody concentration was required with another anti-CD37 antibody than HHl (Bernstein et al., 1990), also compared with an anti-CD20 antibody (Press et al., 1993), to saturate antigen and obtain favorable biodistribution. In addition, the present invention shows that HHl has some different antigen binding properties compared with a panel of three different anti-CD37 antibodies - despite that all of the antibodies substantially bind to the same epitope. \n\n\nBlocking experiments, i.e., using cells pre-saturated with unlabeled antibody, showed that HHl would block the CD37 on living cells from binding to radiolabeled HHl, substantially better than the three other anti-CD37 antibodies. \n\n\nIn a cell assay comparing radiolabeled antibodies, HHl showed much better immunoreactive fraction compared with the three other antibodies. By \n\n\nimmunoreactive fraction is meant the fraction of antibody that can bind antigen if there is an unlimited excess of antigens. Different antibodies can have different ability to preserve the immunoreactivity after going through a labeling procedure. The results in Example 6, Experiment IV, Table 5 shows that the immunoreactivity of HHl was better preserved than the immunoreactivity of three commercially available antibodies. \n\n\nOn the other hand, immunohistochemistry analyzes showed that the three antibodies stained tissue sections from paraffin-embedded fixed tumor samples, while HHl failed to do so. Differences in antibody antigen interactions were not detectable by flow cytometry. \n\n Flow cytometry histograms were similar for HHl and the three other anti-CD37 antibodies (Figure 6). All-in-all these data show that HHl has a significant individual antigen interaction, which in several aspects cannot be predicted from studies with other anti-CD37 antibodies. \n\n\nThe novel anti-CD37 radioimmunoconjugate with strong cytotoxic properties described here consists of the murine monoclonal antibody HHl, a chelating linker, and the beta-emitter \n177\nLu. \n\n\nThe radionuclide may be attached to the antibody by first reacting a bifunctional chelator, e.g., p-SCN-bn-DOTA (Macrocyclics, Tx, USA), with the antibody, followed by purification to remove unconjugated chelator, and then reaction of the chelator antibody conjugate with the radionuclide, followed by purification to remove any unconjugated radionuclide. \n\n\nAlternatively, the chelator and the radionuclide can be combined firstly and subsequently conjugated to the antibody. Chelating linkers like, e.g., p-SCN-bn-DOTA, can be used for conjugating other metal radionuclides to HHl in similar fashion to that described for \n177\nLu. \n\n\nAny type of linker with sufficient complexing ability and a functional group allowing direct or indirect conjugation to a protein or a peptide could be used . Examples of such linkers are described in the literature (e.g. Brechbiel, 2008; Liu, 2008). Some useful examples are bifunctional cyclic chelators like p-SCN-bn- DOTA, DOTA-NHS-ester; bifunctional linear chelators like p-SCN-Bn-DTPA and CHX-A\"-DTPA. The radionuclides in the present invention will preferably be conjugated to a targeting molecule by using bifunctional chelators. \n\n\nThese could be cyclic, linear or branched chelators. Particular reference may be made to the polyaminopolyacid chelators which comprise a linear, cyclic or \n\n branched polyazaalkane backbone with acidic (e.g. carboxyalkyl) groups attached at backbone nitrogens. \n\n\nExamples of suitable chelators include DOTA derivatives such as p- 5 isothiocyanatobenzyl- 1,4,7, 10-tetraazacyclododecane- 1,4,7, 10-tetraacetic acid (p-SCN-Bz-DOTA) and DTPA derivatives such as p-isothiocyanatobenzyl- diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (p-SCN-Bz-DTPA), the first being cyclic chelators, the latter linear chelators. \n\n\n10 Metallation of the complexing moiety may be performed before or after \n\n\n conjugation of the complexing moiety to the targeting moiety. \n\n\nThe radiolabeling procedure will in general be more convenient in terms of time used etc if the chelator is conjugated to the antibody before the radiolabeling 15 takes place. \n\n\nThe principles of preparing radiolabeled conjugates using chelators attached to antibodies is described broader in e.g. Liu, 2008. \n\n\n Thus, HHl can be used to prepare radioimmunoconjugates with differences in 20 radiation properties and effective half-lives. \n\n\nFor example anti-CD37 radioimmunoconjugate consisting of the murine \n\n\n monoclonal antibody HHl, a chelating linker and a beta or alpha emitting radionuclide including, but not limited to, \n177\nLu, \n211\nAt, \n213\nBi, \n212\nBi, \n212\nPb, \n225\nAc, 25 \n227\nTh, \n90\nY, \n186\nRe, \n188\nRe, \n199\nAu, \n194\nIr, \n166\nHo, \n159\nGd, \n153\nSm, \n149\nPm, \n142\nPr, \nm\nAg, \n109\nPd, 7\n7\nAs, \n67\nCu, \n47\nSc can be prepared and used for preparing pharmaceutical preparations and used in therapeutic applications. \n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions \n\n\n 30 \n\n\n A radioimmunotherapeutic product based on HHl would typically be provided as a pharmaceutical composition consisting of a radionuclide, according to the description above, linked via a chelator to the murine monoclonal antibody HHl dissolved in a buffer solution, which to a substantial degree maintain the chemical \n\n integrity of the radioimmunoconjugate and is being physiologically acceptable for infusion into patients. \n\n\nThus, an aspect of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a radioimmunoconjugate of the present invention, and a \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipient. \n\n\nAcceptable pharmaceutical carriers include but are not limited to non-toxic buffers, fillers, isotonic solutions, etc. More specifically, the pharmaceutical carrier can be but are not limited to normal saline (0.9 %), half-normal saline, Ringer's lactate, 5 % Dextrose, 3.3 % Dextrose/0.3 % Saline. The physiologically acceptable carrier can contain a radiolytic stabilizer, e.g., ascorbic acid, which protect the integrity of the radiopharmaceutical during storage and shipment. One embodiment of the present invention comprises the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention and one or more additional antibodies or radioimmunoconjugates. Antibodies include but are not limited to Rituximab, Epratuzumab, L19, F8, F16, Galiximab, Toralizumab, Alemtuzumab, Ofatumumab, Veltuzumab, Afutuzumab, Tositumomab, Reditux and Ibritumomab. \n\n\nRadioimmunoconjugates include but are not limited to Zevalin and Bexxar. \n\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention one or more additional antibodies or radioimmunoconjugates target CD20. Antibodies include but are not limited to Rituximab, Veltuzumab, Ofatumumab, Afutuzumab, Tositumomab, Reditux and Ibritumomab. Radioimmunoconjugates include but are not limited to Zevalin and Bexxar. \n\n\nA further embodiment of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention for treating B-cell malignant cells expressing the CD37 antigen. \n\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutical composition is for treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. \n\n Sequence identity \n\n\nAs commonly defined \"identity\" is here defined as sequence identity between genes or proteins at the nucleotide or amino acid level, respectively. \n\n\nThus, in the present context \"seq uence identity\" is a measure of identity between proteins at the amino acid level and a measure of identity between nucleic acids at nucleotide level . \n\n\n The protein sequence identity may be determined by comparing the amino acid sequence in a g iven position in each sequence when the sequences are aligned . \n\n\nSimilarly, the nucleic acid sequence identity may be determined by comparing the nucleotide sequence in a given position in each seq uence when the sequences are aligned . \n\n\nTo determine the percent identity of two nucleic acid seq uences or of two amino acids, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g ., gaps may be introd uced in the seq uence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alig nment with a second amino or nucleic acid sequence) . The amino acid residues or nucleotides at correspond ing amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared . \n\n\nWhen a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid resid ue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position . The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i .e., % identity = # of identical positions/total # of positions (e.g ., overlapping positions) x 100) . In one embodiment the two sequences are the same length . \n\n\nOne may manually align the seq uences and count the number of identical nucleic acids or amino acids. Alternatively, alig nment of two seq uences for the \n\n\ndetermination of percent identity may be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm . Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST prog rams. BLAST nucleotide searches may be performed with the NBLAST \n\n program, score = 100, wordlength = 12, to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules of the invention . BLAST protein searches may be performed with the XBLAST program, score = 50, wordlength = 3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecule of the invention . \n\n\nTo obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST may be utilised . Alternatively, PSI-Blast may be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules. When utilising the NBLAST, XBLAST, and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs may be used . See http ://www.ncbi.nlm .nih.gov. Alternatively, sequence identity may be calculated after the sequences have been aligned e.g . by the BLAST program in the EMBL database (www.ncbi.nlm.gov/cgi-bin/BLAST) . \n\n\nGenerally, the default settings with respect to e.g . \"scoring matrix\" and \"gap penalty\" may be used for alignment. In the context of the present invention, the BLASTN and PSI BLAST default settings may be advantageous. \n\n\nThe percent identity between two sequences may be determined using techniques similar to those described above, with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent identity, only exact matches are counted . \n\n\nAn embodiment the invention relates to an isolated nucleic acid comprising a sequence sharing 80 % sequence identity with the HH 1 antibody VH sequence (SEQ ID NO : 1) and/or VL sequence (SEQ ID NO : 3) . \n\n\nAn embodiment the invention relates to an isolated nucleic acid comprising a sequence with the HH 1 antibody VH sequence (SEQ ID NO : 1) and/or VL sequence (SEQ ID NO : 3) . In another embodiment of the invention the isolated nucleic acid comprises a sequence sharing at least 90 % sequence identity with the HH 1 antibody VH sequence (SEQ ID NO : 1) and/or VL sequence (SEQ ID NO : 3), such as 90 % identity, 91 % identity, 92 % identity, 93 % identity, 94 % identity, 95 % identity, 96 % identity, 97 % identity, 98 % identity, or 99 % identity. \n\n Another embodiment of the invention relates to an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence sharing 80 % sequence identity with the HH l antibody VH sequence (SEQ ID NO : 2) and/or VL sequence (SEQ ID NO : 4) . Another embodiment of the invention relates to an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence with the HH l antibody VH sequence (SEQ ID NO : 2) and/or VL sequence (SEQ ID NO : 4) . \n\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention, the antibody comprises a sequence sharing at least 90 % sequence identity with the HH l antibody VH sequence (SEQ ID NO : 2) and/or VL sequence (SEQ ID NO : 4), such as 90 % identity, 91 % identity, 92 % identity, 93 % identity, 94 % identity, 95 % identity, 96 % identity, 97 % identity, 98 % identity, or 99 % identity. Genetic vatiation \n\n\nGenetic variation is caused by variation in the order of bases in the nucleotides in genes. This variation cause mutations in the genes and subsequently in the proteins that such genes encode. \n\n\nThese mutations can be either sense or missense mutations or substitutions. \n\n\nAn embodiment of the present invention relates to the isolated nucleic acid sequence of the HH l monoclonal antibody VH chain (SEQ ID NO : 1) and/or VL chain (SEQ ID NO : 3) that comprises at least 50, such as 20, such as 10, such as 5, such as 4, such as 3, such as 2, such as 1 sense mutations. \n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention relates to the isolated nucleic acid sequence of the HH l monoclonal antibody VH chain (SEQ ID NO : 1) and/or VL chain (SEQ ID NO : 3) that comprises 0-50, such as 1-50, such as 0-20, such as 1- 20, such as 0-10, such as 1-10, such as 0-5, such as 1-5, such as 3, such as 1 sense mutations. \n\n\nA missense mutation (a type of nonsynonymous mutation) is a point mutation in which a single nucleotide is changed, resulting in a codon that codes for a \n\n different amino acid (mutations that change an amino acid to a stop codon are considered nonsense mutations, rather than missense mutations). A missense mutation can render the resulting protein non-functional. However, not all missense mutations lead to appreciable protein changes. An amino acid may be replaced by an amino acid of very similar chemical properties, in which case, the protein may still function normally; this is termed a neutral, \"quiet\", or conservative mutation. Alternatively, the amino acid substitution could occur in a region of the protein which does not significantly affect the protein secondary structure or function. When an amino acid may be encoded by more than one codon (so-called \n\n\n\"degenerate coding\") a mutation in a codon may not produce any change in translation; this would be a synonymous mutation (a form of silent mutation) and not a missense mutation. \n\n\nAn embodiment of the present invention relates to an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence of the HHl monoclonal antibody VH chain (SEQ ID NO: 1) and/or VL chain (SEQ ID NO : 3) that comprises at least 50, such as 20, such as 10, such as 5, such as 4, such as 3, such as 2, such as 1 missense mutations. \n\n\nAn embodiment of the present invention relates to an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence of the HHl monoclonal antibody VH chain (SEQ ID NO : 1) and/or VL chain (SEQ ID NO : 3) that comprises 0-50, such as 1-50, such as 0-20, such as 1-20, such as 0-10, such as 1-10, such as 0-5, such as 1-5, such as 3, such as 1 missense mutations. \n\n\nA conservative substitution is a substitution of one amino acid with another with generally similar properties such that the overall functioning is likely not to be seriously affected. \n\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention are the missense mutations conservative mutations or substitutions. \n\n A further embodiment of the present invention relates to an isolated nucleic acid sequence or a polypeptide sequence with 80% seq uence identity to the variable heavy chain (SEQ ID NO : 2) and/or variable light chain (SEQ ID NO : 4) sequences af HH l, wherein the sequence variation is conservative substitutions. \n\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention is the sequence identity 80% identity, such as 90% identity, 91 % identity, 92 % identity, 93 % identity, 94 % identity, 95 % identity, 96 % identity, 97 % identity, 98 % identity, or 99 % identity and the sequence variation is conservative substitutions. \n\n\nIn order to improve the radiolabeling step it may be beneficial to introduce extra lysine into e .g ., the Fc portion of HH l . This could reduce the probility of attaching lysine binding chelators into the antigen combining sites at the antibody, therebye reducing the risk of compromizing immunoreactivity during rad iolabeling . \n\n\nMethods for introducing lysine into e.g . the Fc portion of HH l is known in the art e.g . from Hemminki et al ., 1995. \n\n\nAn embodiment of the present invention relates to the rad ioimmunoconjugate of the present invention which has been mod ified by 10 Lys in the Fc portion of HH l, such as 8 Lys, such as 6 Lys, such as 5 Lys, such as 4 Lys, such as 3 Lys, such as 2 Lys, such as 1 Lys. \n\n\nTreatment \n\n\nTherapeutic use of a pharmaceutical solution according to the present invention may be for treatment against malig nant cells expressing the CD37 antigen, including but not limited to non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia . \n\n\nOther uses could be treatment of autoimmune diseases and treatment of transplantation related effects. The therapy could be based on, but are not limited to, beta-particle-radiation or alpha-particle-radiation or a combination of these. \n\n The therapy could be ad ministered either as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapies, preferentially standard treatments. Such other therapies may be pretreatment, surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, photodynamic therapy, radioimmunotherapy or a combination of two or more of these. By ad ministered is meant intravenous infusion or intravenous injection . More specifically, the radioimmunoconjugate of the present invention can be \n\n\nad ministered d irectly in a vein by a peripheral cannula connected to a d rip chamber that prevents air embolism and allows an estimate of flow rate into the patient. \n\n\nIn one embod iment the radioimmunoconjugate can be ad ministered in a repeated fashion . \n\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention the radioimmunoconjugate could be ad ministered in a repeated fashion but with different radionuclides, e .g ., beta- radioimmunotherapy could be followed by alpha-radioimmunotherapy or vice versa . \n\n\nAn aspect of the present invention relates to the use of the radioimmunoconjugate of the present invention for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. \n\n\nAn embodiment of the present invention relates to the use of the \n\n\nradioimmunoconjugate of the present invention ad ministered in combination with or in addition to other therapy. \n\n\nIn an embod iment of the present invention the other therapies is selected from pretreatment, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, surgery, \n\n\nradiotherapy, and/or photodynamic therapy. In another embodiment of the present invention the other therapies are bone marrow transplantation or stem cell transplantation and/or therapy. \n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention comprises therapeutic pretreatment using anti-CD20 and/or anti-CD37 monoclonal antibody prior to the treatment with the radioimmunoconjugate of the present invention . \n\n An aspect of the present invention relates to a method for treatment of a B-cell malignancy selected from non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, comprising administration of an effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. \n\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention the antibody dosing is 1-1000 mg per patient, more preferably 5-50 mg per patient, and \n177\nLu amounting to 1 - 200 MBq/kg, more preferably 10-100 MBq/kg of bodyweight. \n\n\nKits \n\n\n An aspect of the present invention relates to a kit for the production of the radioimmunoconjugate of the present invention comprising two or more vials, wherein one vial contains a conjugate comprising a chelator linked to a murine monoclonal antibody HH1; and a second vial contains a radionuclide. \n\n\nA kit may require some procedures to be performed, e.g., radiolabeling and/or purification to take place before infusion. An embodiment of the present invention relates to a kit of the present invention, wherein the content of one or several of the vials are either lyophilized or in a solution. \n\n\nBy mixing the contents of the two vials to generate the radioimmunoconjugate the final product will appear. Thus, in another embodiment of the present invention the radioimmunoconjugate is generated by mixing the content of the two vials. This product may need purification prior to use. \n\n\n\n\nExamples \n\n\nExample 1 - Radiolabeling of HH1 \n\n\nIodination : Antibodies were labeled with \n125\nI through indirect iodination using IODOGEN pre-coated iodination tubes (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's description. \n\n\nLabeling with \nm\nIn and \n177\nLu : Antibodies were first reacted with a chelator (p- SCN-Bn-DTPA or p-SCN-Bn-DOTA). \n\n\nThe DTPA or DOTA chelator was dissolved in 0.05 M HCI, and then added to the antibody, which was pH-adjusted to ca. 8 by washing with carbonate buffer, in a 5 : 1 ratio. pH was then checked again and if necessary adjusted . The solution was shaken in 60 min at room temperature, and then the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μΙ 200 mM glycine solution (per mg antibody). To remove free chelator the conjugated antibody was washed 4-5 times with PBS (PAA), and then adjusted to pH 5 by washing with ammonium acetate. \nm\nIn or \n177\nLu (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Ma, USA) was then added to 0.5 mg DOTA-Ab, and shaken for one hour at 42°C. Finally, the product was purified by elution on a gel filtration column, e.g ., Sephadex G-25 PD10 (GE health) or similar. The overall labeling yield varied from 17 % to 63 %. \n\n\nThe quality of the radioimmunoconjugates was measured using lymphoma cells and a modified Lindmo method. Cell concentrations up to 108 cells pr ml were used to compensate for the modest specific activity of \nm\nIn-conjugates. For \n125\nI- conjugates (which have a higher specific activity) it was enough to use cell concentrations up to 4*10\n7\n cells pr ml. \n\n\nThe immunoreactivity and specific activity for the radioimmunoconjugates can be seen in Table 1. \n\n Example 2 - Binding parameters \n\n\nThe association rate constant, k\na\n, the equilibrium d issociation constant, K\nd\n, and the mean number of binding sites, B\nmax\n, was determined by a one-step curve fitting method (Dahle et al . 2007) . The binding parameters were measured for HH l and rituximab and for three different lymphoma cell lines; Raji, Rael and Daudi cells (Table 2) . Specific binding was measured as a function of time and antibody concentration, and the solution of the d ifferential eq uation describing the net rate of formation of the antigen-antibody complex was fitted to the \n\n\nexperimental data points using the association rate constant, k\na\n, the eq uilibrium dissociation constant, K\nd\n, and the mean number of binding sites, B\nmax\n, as parameters. Five million cells pr ml were used, four concentrations of \n125\nI-labeld antibody ( 100 ng/ml, 1000 ng/ml, 5000 ng/ml and 10000 ng/ml) and 7 incubation time points (5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 1 h, 1.5 h and 2 h) . After incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS, and then counted in a gamma counter. \n\n\nExample 3 - Retention of cell-bound antibody \n\n\nRetention of cell-bound antibody immediately and 96 hours after washing were measured after incubation of Raji, Rael and Daudi cells with \ni n\nIn-HH l, \nm\nIn- rituximab, \n125\nI-HH 1 and \n125\nI-rituximab (Figure 1) . \n\n\nOne million cells in 1 ml RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % foetal calf serum, 1 % L- glutamine and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin were incubated with 1 g/ml \n125\nI- or \nm\nIn-labeled HH l or rituximab for one hour, washed twice with medium and incubated further for four days. The cell bound activity was determined \n\n\nimmediately after washing (Figure 1A) and after four days of incubation (Figure I B) by measuring the number of cells (Vi Cell Viability Analyzer, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) and the amount of radioactivity with a calibrated gamma detector (Cobra II auto-gamma detector, Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT, USA) . \n\n Example 4 - Treatment of lymphoma cells in vitro with \n177\nLu-HHl or \n177\nLu- rituximab \n\n\nExperiment I: Binding of \n177\nLu-HHl to Daudi cells \n\n\n5 One ml of Daudi cell suspension (1 million cells/ml) was seeded in 24 tubes and half of the tubes were blocked with 100 g/ml of either HHl or rituximab and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Subsequently, each tube was added either 1\n77\nLu-HHl or \n177\nLu-rituximab to a final concentration of 0, 1, 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 μς/ΓπΙ and incubated further at 37 °C. The specific activity was 91.6 kBq/ g for 10 \n177\nLu-HHl and 136.6 kBq/Mg for \n177\nLu-rituximab. \n\n\nThe amount of added activity was measured during the incubation period with a gamma detector (Cobra II auto-gamma detector, Packard Instrument Company). After 2 hours, half of the cells were washed and cell bound activity was measured (Figure 2A) while half of the cells were incubated over night (18 h) before washing 15 and measurement of cell bound activity (Figure 2B). \n\n\nThere was no difference between cells incubated with HHl and cells incubated with rituximab after 2 hour incubation, while the cell bound activity was twice as high for cells incubated with rituximab than for cells incubated with HHl after 18 hour incubation (Figure 2). \n\n\n20 Tables 3 and 4 indicate that radiolabeled HHl saturates the antigen quicker and at lower antibody concentration than rituximab. The nonspecific binding seems to be similar for the two radioimmunoconjugates ( IC), and it increases with increasing concentration of RIC in the medium. \n\n\nThe maximum number of specific bound \n177\nLu was about twice as high for \n\n\n25 rituximab as for HHl . However at the 1 g/ml dosage, there were almost no \n\n\n differences in the number of specifically bound radioactive atoms. \n\n\nExperiment II: Two hour incubation with \n177\nLu-IgG: Cell growth data \n\n\nDaudi cells were incubated with radioimmunoconjugates as in experiment I 30 (Figure 2 A). \n\n Growth of Daudi cells after 2 hour incubation with \n177\nLu-HHl or \n177\nLu-rituximab was measured by seeding 50.000 cells from each tube in three wells in six 12-well plates. The amount of cells were measured for several time points the next 14 days using an automatic imaging system (Clone Select Imager, Gentix Ltd, Hampshire, UK). \n\n\nThere was no effect of unlabeled antibody alone on cell growth. However, the blocked cells treated with \n177\nLu-antibody clearly did not grow as fast as the untreated control cells, indicating that there was an effect of unbound \n177\nLu- antibody or unspecifically bound \n177\nLu-antibody on the cells (Figure 3). Treatment of unblocked cells with \n177\nLu-antibody resulted in an increase in growth delay of 44 % for cells treated with 10 μς/πτιΙ \n177\nLu-HHl (Figure 3 A) and of 31 % for cells treated with 10 g/ml \n177\nLu-rituximab (Figure 3 B). \n\n\nFor treatment with 20 g/ml the difference between the two antibodies was even larger since there was no regrowth of the cells treated with \n177\nLu-HHl . This result was unexpected since the cells were labeled with the same amount of antibody (Figure 2 A). \n\n\nExperiment III: Eighteen hour incubation with \n177\nLu-IgG: Cell growth data. \n\n\nDaudi cells were incubated with radioimmunoconjugates as in experiment I (Figure 2 B). Growth of Daudi cells after 18 hour incubation with \n177\nLu-HHl or \n177\nLu-rituximab was measured by seeding 50.000 cells from each tube in three wells in six 12-well plates. \n\n\nThe amount of cells were measured for several time points the next 14 days using an automatic imaging system (Clone Select Imager, Gentix Ltd, Hampshire, UK). There was no effect of unlabeled antibody alone on cell growth. \n\n\nThe inhibition of cell growth on the blocked cells treated with \n177\nLu-antibody was larger in this experiment (Figure 4) than in experiment II (Figure 3) because of 16 hour increased incubation time with radioimmunoconjugate in the medium. \n\n\nTreatment of unblocked cells with \n177\nLu-antibody resulted in an increase in growth delay of 107 % for cells treated with 2.5 Mg/ml \n177\nLu-HHl (Figure 4 A) and of 52 \n\n % for cells treated with 2.5 μς/ΓπΙ \n177\nLu-rituximab (Figure 4 B). This result was unexpected since after 18 h of incubation the cells labeled with \n177\nLu-rituximab had twice as much cell-bound activity attached than the cells labeled with \n177\nLu- HH1 (Figure 2 B). \n\n\nExample 5 - Biodistribution of HH1 \n\n\nBiodistribution of \nin\nIn-labeled HH1 was studied in BALB/c-nude (nu/nu) mice with Daudi xenografts with size 32-256 mm\n3\n at the start of the study. \n\n\nThe radiolabeling was performed using pSCN-Bz-DOTA as a bifunctional chelating agent to complex the radionuclide and attach it to the antibody (see Example 1). The preparation was administered by tail vein injection of 100 μΙ solution to each animal. \n\n\nAn activity of 120 kBq was injected in each animal. Five animals were used per time point. Autopsies were performed after cervical dislocation at various time points after injection. The weight of each tissue sample was determined, and \nm\nIn were measured by a calibrated gamma detector (Cobra II auto-gamma detector, Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT, USA). Samples of the injectates were used as references in the measurement procedures. \n\n\nThe uptake of \ni n\nIn-HHl 24 hours after injection of mice with Daudi xenografts and the biodistribution in normal tissues are presented in Figure 5. The \n\n\nradiolabeled antibody has a relevant tumor targeting and biodistribution. The chelator-conjugate \ni n\nIn-HHl shows good stability in vivo. \n\n\nExample 6 - Comparison of HH1 with three other anti-CD37 antibodies \n\n\nExperiment I: Antigen blocking ability of anti-CD37 antibodies against radiolabeled HH1 \n\n\nTo test whether the HH1 antigen interaction can be blocked by other anti-CD37 antibodies, Daudi cells were blocked by pre-incubation with either HH1, O.N.108, IPO-24 or 6D263 antibodies. Daudi cells (2 millions/ml) were incubated for 15 \n\n minutes with either HHl, O.N.108, IPO-24 or 6D263 antibodies (20 Mg/ml) and added \n125\nI-labeled HHl antibody and incubated for 1 hour. \n\n\nThereafter, the cells were centrifuged and washed 3 times and the activities in supernatant and cell pellets were counted using a X-ray/gamma counter. \n\n\nCompared with the HHl blocked cells, the bound fraction of \n125\nI-labeled HHl was 48 %, 44 % and 51 % higher for O.N.108, IPO-24 or 6D263 blocked cells, respectively. \n\n\nThus, the antigen binding of \n125\nI-HH1 was better blocked with HHl than with the three other antibodies suggesting some differences in antigen interaction. In conclusion, HHl has significant different antigen-binding properties compared with a panel of three other anti-CD37 monoclonal antibodies. \n\n\nExperiment II: Antibody binding to paraffin embedded lymphoma tissue samples \n\n\nTo compare the ability of HHl and three commercially available CD37 antibodies to bind to fixated lymphoma samples, biopsies from lymphoma patients were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and cut in 10 Mm slices that were mounted on object glasses. \n\n\nThe samples were labeled with the antibodies HHl, IPO.24, ON.108 and 6D263 and the grade of labeling was detected using rabbit anti mouse polyclonal antibody and peroxidase staining. \n\n\nThe antibodies IPO.24 and ON.108 resulted in the strongest labeling of the lymphoma samples. The 6D263 antibody labeled the sample a little weaker. The HHl antibody labeling of the sections was insignificant. \n\n\nThus, it can be concluded, since HHl did not bind while three other anti-CD37 antibodies were binding, that HHl has a significantly different antigen interaction. \n\n\nExperiment III: Flow cytometry of HHl, IPO.24, ON.108 and 6D263 antibodies \n\n\nTo investigate differences in antigen expression detected by the different CD37 antibodies vs. HHl Daudi cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium with 5 \n\n % foetal calf serum and labeled with 10 μς/ml of the primary antibodies HHl, IPO.24, ON.108 and 6D363 for 0.5 hour in 0.2 ml medium with 10 % FCS on ice. \n\n\nSubsequently, the cells were washed twice with PBS with 0.25 % FCS and labeled with FITC-labeled polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse IgG Fab\n\"\n 2 (diluted 1 : 20) (Figure 6) for 0.5 hour on ice. Fluorescence from the FITC-label was detected by exciting with a 488 nm laser in a flow cytometer. \n\n\nDead cells and doublets were gated away using forward scatter, side scatter and propidium iodide signals. There was no significant variation among the different FITC histograms of the various CD37 antibodies (Figure 6). In conclusion, HHl and the tree other anti-CD37 antibodies IPO.24, ON.108 and 6D363, produce similar flow cytometry histograms. \n\n\nExperiment IV: The binding fraction for HHl and three commercially available anti-CD37 antibodies. To compare the binding fraction of HHl with the O.N.108, IPO-24 or 6D263 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Daudi cells. Cell suspensions, representing a large antigen excess, consisting of 60 million Daudi cells in 0.2 ml RPMI 1640 medium with 5 % foetal calf serum were blocked for 15 minutes with HHl, O.N.108, IPO-24 or 6D263 antibodies (500 Mg/ml) to account for non- specific binding of the antibody. Other parallels were unblocked . \n\n\nSubsequently, \n125\nI-labeled HHl, O.N.108, IPO-24 or 6D263 antibody (5-10 ng/ml) was added and the cells were incubated for 2 hours at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Thereafter, the cells were centrifuged and washed 2 times with PBS with 1 % FCS. The cell pellets were transferred to clean tubes and counted using a gamma counter. \n\n\nThe binding fraction was determined as the difference in activity for the unblocked and the blocked vials vs. the added activity. The HHl showed a much higher binding fraction compared with the other CD37 antibodies (Table 5). In \n\n\nconclusion, HHl showed a much higher immunoreactivity against living cells compared with IPO.24, ON.108 and 6D363 when the antibodies were radiolabeled \n\n in similar fashion. This result indicates that HHl has different antigen interaction than the three other antibodies. \n\n\nExample 7 - DNA and amino acid sequence of low and heavy chain variable regions \n\n\nThe gene and protein sequence of the variable regions of the HHl anti-CD37 antibody is as follows: \n\n\nThe VH aCD37 gene sequence corresponds to SEQ ID NO: 1 and the VH aCD37 protein sequence corresponds to SEQ ID NO: 2. \n\n\nVH aCD37 gagatccagctgcagcagtctggacctgagctggtgaagcctggggcttcagtgaaggta \n\n\n E I Q L Q Q S G P E L V K P G A S V K V tcctgcaaggcttctggttactcattcactgactacaacatgtactgggtgaagcagagc \n\n\n S C K A S G Y S F T D Y N M Y W V K Q S catggaaagagccttgagtggattggatatattgatccttacaatggtgatactacctac \n\n\n H G K S L E W I G Y I D P Y N G D T T Y aaccagaagttcaagggcaaggccacattgactgttgacaagtcctccagcacagccttc \n\n\n N Q K F K G K A T L T V D K S S S T A F atccatctcaacagcctgacatctgaggactctgcagtctattactgtgcaagatcccct \n\n\n I H L N S L T S E D S A V Y Y C A R S P tatggtcactatgctatggactactggggtcaaggaacctcagtcaccgtctcctca \n\n\n Y G H Y A M D Y W G Q G T S V T V S S The VL aCD37 gene sequence corresponds to SEQ ID NO:3 and the VL aCD37 protein sequence corresponds to SEQ ID NO: 4. \n\n VL aCD37 gacattgtgatgacccagtctcacaaactcttgtccacatcagtaggagacagggtcagc \n\n\n D I V M T Q S H K L L S T S V G D R V S atcacctgcaaggccagtcaggatgtgagtactgctgtagactggtatcaacagaaacca \n\n\n I T C K A S Q D V S T A V D W Y Q Q K P ggacaatctcctaaactactgattaactgggcatccacccggcacactggagtccctgat \n\n\n G Q S P K L L I N W A S T R H T G V P D cgcttcacaggcagtggatctgggacagattatactctcaccatcagcagtatgcaggct \n\n\n R F T G S G S G T D Y T L T I S S M Q A gaagacctggcactttattactgtcgacaacattatagcactccattcacgttcggctcg \n\n\n E D L A L Y Y C R Q H Y S T P F T F G S gggacaaagttggaaataaaa \n\n\n G T K L E I K \n\n\nThe amino acid sequence is significantly different from the amino acid sequence of the CD37 binding antibody AO (Heider et al., 2009). The overlap between the variable light chain of HHl and AO is 56 %, while the overlap between the variable heavy chain is 82 %. \n\n\nExample 8 - Binding of radiolabeled HHl on cells saturated with CD20 antibody rituximab. \n\n\nBackground \n\n\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma patients often receives rituximab as a standard therapy. It would be advantageous if radiolabeled HHl could be used in patients even if they are undergoing rituximab therapy. Daudi lymphoma cells, which express both the CD20 and the CD37 antigens, were used as a model. \n\n Methods \n\n\nDaudi lymphoma cells (3, 3 millions in 0.5 ml) were either pre- and co-treated with excessive amounts (100 μς/ΓηΙ of rituximab) for five minutes and thereafter added 1 μς of \n125\nI-labeled HHl or given \n125\nI-labeled HHl without rituximab pretreatment. To determine non-specific binding of \n125\nI-HH1 the same \n\n\nconfiguration as above but with pretreatment with unlabeled HHl (10 g/ml was used). The cells were incubated for two hours in PBS at room temperature and counted in a gamma counter, washed three times in 1 ml PBS followed by centrifugation, and finally recounted for cell bound radioactivity. \n\n\nResults \n\n\nWith rituximab pre-treatment/co-treatment, 26.0% (total bound, 27.4% - nonspecific bound, 1.4%) of the added \n125\nI-HH1 bound specifically to the cells. \n\n\nWithout rituximab pre-treatment/co-treatment, 25.5% (26.9 -1.4) bound specifically (all numbers represents mean of three parallelles). I.e, there were no significant difference in the binding of \n125\nI-HH1 due to the presence of rituximab. \n\n\nConclusion \n\n\nPre- and co- treatment with excessive amounts of rituximab did not alter the cell binding ability of radiolabeled HHl and, thus, did not block the access to the CD37 antigen. \n\n\nThis indicates that radioimmunotherapy with radiolabeled HHl may be suitable in patients subsequently to or during immunotherapy with anti-CD20 antibody as well as in patients not treated with rituximab. \n\n\nExample 9 - Treatment of SCID mice inoculated intravenously with Daudi lymphoma cells using \n177\nLu-HHl . \n\n Background \n\n\nTreatment of lymphoma patients with current CD20 directed radioimmunotherapy can be problematic in patients previously treated with rituximab because of antigenic drift and possible blockage of CD20 antigen. Therefore, \n\n\nradioimmunotherapy targeting other antigens might be more effective. By intravenous injection of human lymphoma cells in severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice we made an intravenous tumor model. When SCID mice are inoculated intravenously with Daudi lymphoma cells they will develop hind leg paralysis due to the growth of the Daudi tumor cells. \n\n\nExperimental \n\n\nSCID mice were injected intravenously with 10 million Daudi cells one week before administration of 50 or 100 MBq/kg \n177\nLu-HHl, 50 g HHl, 50 g rituximab or NaCI. The mice were monitored for hind leg paralysis and bodyweight loss as well as WBC count every other week. Discontinuation of symptom-free survival was used as an end point. To prepare the radiolabeled antibody, HHl was first labeled with p-SCN-Bn-DOTA and purified. After buffer exchange \n177\nLu (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Ma, USA) was added to the DOTA-HH1, and shaken for 40 minutes at 40°C. Specific activity was approximately 3200 MBq/mkg for the final product. Each preparation was dissolved in isotonic saline to a total injection volume of 100 μΙ per animal. \n\n\nResults \n\n\nMedian symptom free survival was 26 days (range 21 to 33) for saline, 40 days (range 23 to 44) for HHl and 40 days (range 33 to 44) for rituximab (Figure 8). For 50 kBq/kg \n177\nLu-HHl, 80% of the animals were alive after 79 days. Two of the mice in the 100 kBq/g group died before any of the animals in the saline groups, and the blood cell counts indicated radiotoxicity. A third animal in the 100 kBq/g group died at day 49. The other animals (70%) were alive at day 79. The survival of the mice treated with \n177\nLu-HHl were significantly higher than the survival of \n\n mice treated with NaCI, HHl or Rituximab (p<0.005, Mann Whitney Log Rank Test) \n\n\nConclusion The data shows that the groups receiving \n177\nLu-HHl in dosages of 50 or 100 kBq/g of b.w. groups had considerablye better survival than the groups receiving saline or immunotherapy with either HHl or rituximab. The toxicity data indicate that the activity should be kept below 100 kBq/g b.w. These data indicate that \n177\nLu-HHl has relevant properties for in vivo radioimmunotherapy. \n\n\nExample 10 - Biodistribution of \n177\nLu-HHl in nude mice with CD37 expressing tumor xenografts. \n\n\nBackground Lutetium-177 labeled HHl antibody was evaluated for in vivo tissue distribution and tumor targeting. \n\n\nExperimental procedure \n\n\nLabeling of antibodies with radionuclides The antibody was first labeled with the chelator p-SCN-Bn-DOTA. DOTA was dissolved in 0.05M HCI, added to the antibody in a 5 : 1 ratio and pH-adjusted to 8- 9 by washing with carbonate buffer using Amicon centrifuge filters (Millipore, USA) with a molecular weight cut-of of 30 kDa. \n\n\nThe pH was then checked again and if necessary adjusted. The solution was shaken during 60 min at room temperature, and then the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μΙ 200 mM glycine solution (per mg antibody). To remove free chelator the conjugated antibody was washed 4-5 times with PBS (PAA)(using Amicon and centrifugation), and then adjusted to pH 5 by washing with \n\n\nammonium acetate. \n177\nLu (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Ma, USA) was then combined \n\n with 0.5 mg DOTA-HH1 in a 2 ml polypropylene tube (Eppendorf, Germany), and shaked for one hour at 40°C. Specific activities were typically 25-120 MBq/kg for \n177\nLu-conjugates. \n\n\nImmunoreactivity \n\n\nThe quality of the radioimmunoconjugates were measured using lymphoma cells and a modified Lindmo method. Cell concentrations up to 108 cells pr ml were used. The conjugates used in the experiments had immunoreactivity above 50 %. \n\n\nBiodistribution of radioimmunoconjugates \n\n\nBiodistributions of \n177\nLu-HHl was determined in male BALB/c nude (nu/nu) mice implanted with 1 - 1 - 1 mm Daudi tumor xenografts three weeks before. The preparations were administered by tail vein injection of 100 μΙ solution in each animal. A mean acitivity of 500 kBq per mice for \n177\nLu-HHl . Four to five animals were used per time point. Autopsies were performed after cervical dislocation at various time points after injection. The weight of each tissue sample was determined, and \n177\nLu were measured by a calibrated gamma detector (Cobra II auto-gamma detector, Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT, USA). Samples of the injectates were used as references in the measurement procedures. \n\n\nResults and discussion \n\n\nUptake and retention of \n177\nLu-labeled HHl and in normal tissues of BALB/c-nude (nu/nu) female mice with Daudi xenografts are presented in Figure 7. There were no signs of redistribution of nuclide from/to any organs after the initial uptake of radioimmunoconjugates, which indicate that the radioimmunoconjugates were stable. \n\n\nInjection of \n177\nLu-HHl in nude mice with tumor showed a low uptake in bone. Free \n177\nLu is known to accumulate in bone so this result indicates that the \n\n\nradioimmunoconjugate was stable in vivo. The uptake in the tumors was significantly higher than in other organs at later time points. \n\n This indicates that \n177\nLu has relevant half life for radioimmunotherapy using the HHl antibody. \n\n\nThe biodistribution data of \n177\nLu-HHl show a relevant normal tissue uptake and clearance and significant retention in CD37 expressing tumor xenographs. The HHl antibody seems to be well suited for radioimmunotherapy. The \n177\nLu-HHl conjugate seems particularly suitable, as favorable tumor to normal tissue ratios were obtained before a larger fraction of the radionuclide was decayed . \n\n\nTables \n\n\nTable 1 \n\n\n Immunoreactivity and specific activity for the radioimmunoconjugates.

Description\n\n\n\n\nThe present invention relates to antibodies against human IL17A (IL17 antibody), methods for their production, pharmaceutical compositions containing said antibodies, and uses thereof.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nHuman IL-17A (CTLA-8, Swiss Prot Q16552, further named as IL-17) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a subset of memory T cells (called Th17) that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MS. IL-17A plays a role in the induction of other inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. Treatment of animals with IL-17A neutralizing antibodies decreases disease incidence and severity in autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Komiyama, Y. et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n177 (2006) 566-573). IL-17A is over-expressed in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients (Hellings, P. W. et al., \nAm. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. \n28 (2003) 42-50; Matusevicius, D. et al., \nMultiple Sclerosis \n5 (1999) 101-104; WO 2005/051422). In addition, IL-17A neutralizing antibodies reduce severity and incidence of mouse RA model of collagen induced arthritis, and high levels of IL-17A can be detected in the synovial fluid of inflamed joints from RA patients (Ziolkovvska, M. et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n164 (2000) 2832-38; Kotake, S. et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n103 (1999) 1345-52; Hellings, P. W. et al., \nAm. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. \n28 (2003) 42-50).\n\n\nWO 96/17939, U.S. Pat.

The antibody according to the invention is preferably a humanized antibody, chimeric antibody, or further genetically engineered antibody as long as the characteristic properties according to the invention are retained. “Antibody fragments” comprise a portion of a full length antibody, preferably the variable domain thereof, or at least the antigen binding site thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include diabodies, single-chain antibody molecules, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. scFv antibodies are, e.g., described in Huston, J. S., \nMeth Enzymol\n. (1991) 203:46-52. In addition, antibody fragments comprise single chain polypeptides having the characteristics of a V\nH \ndomain, namely being able to assemble together with a V\nL \ndomain, or of a V\nL \ndomain binding to IL-17, namely being able to assemble together with a V\nH \ndomain to a functional antigen binding site and thereby providing the properties of an antibody according to the invention. The terms “monoclonal antibody” or “monoclonal antibody composition” as used herein refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of a single amino acid composition. The term “humanized antibody” refers to antibodies in which the framework and/or “complementary determining regions” (CDR) have been modified to comprise the CDR of an immunoglobulin of different species as compared to that of the parent immunoglobulin. In a preferred embodiment, a mouse CDR is grafted into the framework region of a human antibody to prepare the “humanized antibody”. See, e.g., Riechmann, L., et al., \nNature \n332 (1988) 323-27; and Neuberger, M. S., et al., \nNature \n314 (1985) 268-70.\n\n\nThe term “binding to IL-17” as used herein means binding of the antibody to human IL-17 in an ELISA binding assay. Binding is found if the antibody causes an S/N (signal/noise) ratio of 7:1 or more at an antibody concentration of 1 μg/ml. The antibody according to the invention specifically binds to human IL-17A and with an IC\n50 \nvalue of 1 nM (0.15 μg/ml) or lower. The antibody does not bind to IL-17 B, C, D, E, and F (S/N (signal/noise) ratio of lower than 7:1) and is therefore specifically binding to IL-17A. Binding to IL-17 A and variants is performed by ELISA using immobilized IL-17 or variant.\n\n\nThe term “epitope” denotes a protein determinant capable of specifically binding to an antibody. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually epitopes have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and nonconformational epitopes are distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents. Preferably an antibody according to the invention binds specifically to native but not to denatured IL-17. The IL-17 antibody of the invention binds to the same epitope on IL-17 to which antibody Mab317 binds. The epitope binding property of an IL-17 antibody of the present invention may be determined using techniques known in the art. The IL-17 antibody is tested by an in vitro crossblocking binding assay to determine the ability of the test antibody to hinder the binding of antibody Mab317 to IL-17. If there is a displacement of the test antibody by antibody Mab317 for at least 15%, then the epitopes are in near proximity.\n\n\nThe “variable domain” (variable domain of a light chain (V\nL\n), variable domain of a heavy chain (V\nH\n)) as used herein denotes each of the pair of light and heavy chain domains which are involved directly in binding the antibody to the antigen. The variable light and heavy chain domains have the same general structure and each domain comprises four framework (FR) regions whose sequences are widely conserved, connected by three “hypervariable regions” (or complementary determining regions, CDRs). The framework regions adopt a β-sheet conformation and the CDRs may form loops connecting the β-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held in their three-dimensional structure by the framework regions and form together with the CDRs from the other chain the antigen binding site. The antibody's heavy and light chain CDR3 regions play a particularly important role in the binding specificity/affinity of the antibodies according to the invention and therefore provide a further object of the invention.\n\n\nThe term “antigen-binding portion of an antibody” when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The antigen-binding portion of an antibody comprises amino acid residues from the “complementary determining regions” or “CDRs”. “Framework” or “FR” regions are those variable domain regions other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. Therefore, the light and heavy chain variable domains of an antibody comprise from N- to C-terminus the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. Especially, CDR3 of the heavy chain is the region which contributes most to antigen binding and defines the antibody's properties. CDR and FR regions are determined according to the standard definition of Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th ed., Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991) and/or those residues from a “hypervariable loop”.\n\n\nThe term “amino acid” as used within this application denotes the group of naturally occurring carboxy α-amino acids comprising alanine (three letter code: ala, one letter code: A), arginine (arg, R), asparagine (asn, N), aspartic acid (asp, D), cysteine (cys, C), glutamine (gln, Q), glutamic acid (glu, E), glycine (gly, G), histidine (his, H), isoleucine (ile, I), leucine (leu, L), lysine (lys, K), methionine (met, M), phenylalanine (phe, F), proline (pro, P), serine (ser, S), threonine (thr, T), tryptophan (trp, W), tyrosine (tyr, Y), and valine (val, V).\n\n\nThe terms “nucleic acid” or “nucleic acid molecule”, as used herein, are intended to include DNA molecules and RNA molecules. A nucleic acid molecule may be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. A nucleic acid is “operably linked” when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, “operable linked” means that the DNA sequences being linked are colinear, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading frame. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice. As used herein, the expressions “cell”, “cell line”, and “cell culture” are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words “transformants” and “transformed cells” include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Variant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included.\n\n\nThe “Fc part” of an antibody is not involved directly in binding of an antibody to an antigen, but exhibits various effector functions. An “Fc part of an antibody” is a term well known to the skilled artisan and defined on the basis of papain cleavage of antibodies. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant region of their heavy chains, antibodies or immunoglobulins are divided in the classes: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, IgA1, and IgA2. According to the heavy chain constant regions the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, ε, γ, and μ, respectively. The Fc part of an antibody is directly involved in ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) and CDC (complement-dependent cytotoxicity) based on complement activation, C1q binding and Fc receptor binding. Complement activation (CDC) is initiated by binding of complement factor C1q to the Fc part of most IgG antibody subclasses. While the influence of an antibody on the complement system is dependent on certain conditions, binding to C1q is caused by defined binding sites in the Fc part. Such binding sites are known in the state of the art and described by, e.g., Boakle, R. J. et al., \nNature \n282 (1979) 742-43; Lukas, T. J. et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n127 (1981) 2555-60; Brunhouse, R. and Cebra, J. J., \nMol. Immunol. \n16 (1979) 907-17; Burton, D. R. et al., \nNature \n288 (1980) 338-44; Thommesen, J. E. et al., \nMol. Immunol. \n37 (2000) 995-1004; Idusogie, E. E. et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n164 (2000) 4178-84; Hezareh, M. et al., \nJ. Virology \n75 (2001) 12161-68; Morgan, A. et al., \nImmunology \n86 (1995) 319-24; EP 0307434. Such binding sites are, e.g., L234, L235, D270, N297, E318, K320, K322, P331, and P329 (numbering according to EU index of Kabat, see below). Antibodies of subclass IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 usually show complement activation and C1q binding, whereas IgG4 does not activate the complement system and does not bind C1q.\n\n\nThe antibody according to the invention comprises an Fc part from human origin which is Fc part of a human antibody of the subclass IgG1. For the Fc part of an antibody according to the invention preferably no C1q binding as defined below can be detected.\n\n\nThe invention therefore comprises an antibody according to the invention, characterized in that said antibody binds IL-17, contains an Fc part from human origin, and does not bind human complement factor C1q and therefore avoids CDC effector function\n\n\nPreferably an antibody according to the invention is in regard to Fcγ receptor binding of human IgG1 or IgG2 subclass, with a mutation in L234, L235, and/or D265, and/or contains the PVA236 mutation. Preferred are the mutations L234A, L235A, L235E, and/or PVA236 (PVA236 means that the amino acid sequence ELLG (given in one letter amino acid code) from amino acid position 233 to 236 of IgG1 or EFLG of IgG4 is replaced by PVA). The present invention thus provides an antibody according to the invention being characterized in that said antibody is an antibody of human subclass IgG1, containing at least one mutation in L234, L235, D270, N297, E318, K320, K322, P331 and/or P329. In one embodiment the antibody is a human antibody. In another embodiment the antibody is a humanized antibody. In one embodiment the present invention provides an antibody according to the invention, containing an Fc part derived from human origin, and being characterized in that said antibody is an antibody of human subclass IgG1, containing at least one mutation in L234, L235, D270, N297, E318, K320, K322, P331 and wherein the antibody binds to IL-17 with a K\nD \nvalue of less than 10\n−8 \nM in a BIAcore assay. In another embodiment the K\nD \nrange is 10\n−11 \nto 10\n−9 \nM.\n\n\nC1q binding can be measured according to Idusogie, E. E., et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n164 (2000) 4178-84. No C1q binding according to the invention is characterized in that if in such an assay wherein an ELISA plate is coated with different concentrations of the antibody, human C1q is added. C1q binding is detected by an antibody directed against human C1q followed by peroxidase-labeled conjugate detection with peroxidase substrate ABTS® (2,2′-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonate]). No C1q binding according to the invention is found if the optical density (OD) at 405 nm is for the test antibody lower than 0.05 at an antibody concentration of 10 μg/ml.\n\n\nThe antibody according to the invention is preferably characterized in that the constant chains are of human origin. Such constant chains are well known in the state of the art and described, e.g., by Kabat (see e.g. Johnson, G., and Wu, T. T., \nNuc Acids Res. \n28 (2000) 214-18). For example, a useful human heavy chain constant region comprises SEQ ID NO:23. For example, a useful human light chain constant region comprises an amino acid sequence of a kappa-light chain constant region of SEQ ID NO: 12.\n\n\nA further embodiment of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding a heavy and a light chain of an antibody according to the invention.\n\n\nThe invention comprises a method for the treatment of a patient in need of therapy, characterized by administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody according to the invention. The invention comprises the use of an antibody according to the invention for therapy. The invention comprises the use of an antibody according to the invention for the preparation of a medicament for the prophylaxis and treatment of inflammatory and thrombotic disorders. The invention comprises the use of an antibody according to the invention for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, preferably for the treatment of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nThe antibodies according to the invention include, in addition, such antibodies having “conservative sequence modifications” (variant antibodies), nucleotide and amino acid sequence modifications which do not affect or alter the above-mentioned characteristics of the antibody according to the invention. Modifications can be introduced by standard techniques known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Conservative amino acid substitutions include ones in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g. lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g. aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g. glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g. alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g. threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g. tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a human anti-IL-17 antibody can be preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. A “variant” anti-IL-17 antibody, refers therefore herein to a molecule which differs in amino acid sequence from a “parent” anti-IL-17 antibody amino acid sequence by up to ten, preferably from about two to about five, additions, deletions and/or substitutions in one or more variable region of the parent antibody. Amino acid substitutions can be performed by mutagenesis based upon molecular modeling as described by Riechmann, L., et al., \nNature \n332 (1988) 323-27 and Queen, C., et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n86 (1989) 10029-33.\n\n\nA further embodiment of the invention is a method for the production of an antibody against IL-17 which does not bind Fcγ receptor and/or C1q, characterized in that the sequence of a nucleic acid encoding the heavy chain of a human IgG1 type antibody binding to IL-17 is modified in such a manner that said modified antibody does not bind C1q and/or Fcγ receptor, said modified nucleic acid and the nucleic acid encoding the light chain of said antibody are inserted into an expression vector, said vector is inserted in a eukaryotic host cell, the encoded protein is expressed and recovered from the host cell or the supernatant.\n\n\nIdentity or homology with respect to the sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the parent sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or homology. The variant retains the ability to bind human IL-17 and preferably has properties, which are superior to those of the parent antibody. For example, the variant may have reduced side effects during treatment.\n\n\nThe “parent” antibody comprises the CDR regions of antibody 3C1 and is preferably used for the preparation of the variant. Preferably, the parent antibody has a human framework region and, if present, has a human antibody constant region or human antibody constant domains. For example, the parent antibody may be a humanized or a human antibody.\n\n\nThe antibodies according to the invention are preferably produced by recombinant means. Such methods are widely known in the state of the art and comprise protein expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells with subsequent isolation of the antibody polypeptide and usually purification to a pharmaceutically acceptable purity. For the protein expression nucleic acids encoding light and heavy chains or fragments thereof are inserted into expression vectors by standard methods. Expression is performed in appropriate prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells, such as CHO cells, NS0 cells, SP2/0 cells, HEK293 cells, COS cells, yeast, or \nE. coli \ncells, and the antibody is recovered from the cells (from the supernatant or after cells lysis). Recombinant production of antibodies is well-known in the state of the art and described, for example, in the review articles of Makrides, S. C., \nProtein Expr. Purif. \n17 (1999) 183-202; Geisse, S., et al., \nProtein Expr. Purif. \n8 (1996) 271-82; Kaufman, R. J., \nMol. Biotechnol. \n16 (2000) 151-60; Werner, R. G., \nDrug Res. \n48 (1998) 870-80. The antibodies may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or in a partially purified, or substantially pure form. Purification is performed in order to eliminate other cellular components or other contaminants, e.g., other cellular nucleic acids or proteins, by standard techniques, including column chromatography and others well known in the art. See Ausubel, F., et al., ed. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing and Wiley Interscience, New York (1987). Expression in NS0 cells is described by, e.g., Barnes, L. M., et al., \nCytotechnology \n32 (2000) 109-23; Barnes, L. M., et al., \nBiotech. Bioeng. \n73 (2001) 261-70. Transient expression is described by, e.g., Durocher, Y., et al., \nNucl. Acids. Res. \n30 (2002) E9. Cloning of variable domains is described by Orlandi, R., et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n86 (1989) 3833-37; Carter, P., et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n89 (1992) 4285-89; Norderhaug, L., et al., \nJ. Immunol. Meth. \n204 (1997) 77-87. A preferred transient expression system (HEK 293) is described by Schlaeger, E.-J. and Christensen, K., in \nCytotechnology \n30 (1999) 71-83, and by Schlaeger, E.-J., in \nJ. Immunol. Meth. \n194 (1996) 191-99. Monoclonal antibodies are suitably separated from the culture medium by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography. DNA and RNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures. The hybridoma cells can serve as a source of such DNA and RNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be inserted into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells, such as HEK 293 cells, CHO cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of recombinant monoclonal antibodies in the host cells.\n\n\nAmino acid sequence variants of human IL-17 antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody encoding DNA, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications can be performed, however, only in a very limited range, e.g. as described above. For example, the modifications do not alter the abovementioned antibody characteristics such as the IgG isotype and epitope binding, but may improve the yield of the recombinant production, protein stability, or facilitate the purification. Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the anti-IL-17 antibody may also be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and to prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment). Another type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody. By “altering” is meant removing one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody. Glycosylation of antibodies is typically N-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of anti-IL-17 antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of humanized anti-IL-17 antibody.\n\n\nAnother type of covalent modification of the antibody comprises linking the antibody to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192; 4,179,337.\n\n\nThe heavy and light chain variable domains according to the invention are combined with sequences of promoter, translation initiation, constant region, 3′ untranslated region, polyadenylation, and transcription termination to form expression vector constructs. The heavy and light chain expression constructs can be combined into a single vector, co-transfected, serially transfected, or separately transfected into host cells which are then fused to form a single host cell expressing both chains.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a composition, e.g., a pharmaceutical composition, containing one or a combination of monoclonal antibodies, or the antigen-binding portion thereof, of the present invention, formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption/resorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. Preferably, the carrier is suitable for injection or infusion. A composition of the present invention can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is known in the art. In addition to water, the carrier can be, for example, an isotonic buffered saline solution. Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present invention, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art. Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient (effective amount). The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.\n\n\nThe invention comprises the use of the antibodies according to the invention for the treatment of a patient suffering from multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, Crohn's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and transplant rejection.\n\n\nA further embodiment of the invention is the use of an anti-IL-17 antibody, preferably an antibody according to the invention, for the treatment of a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, said patient do respond moderate or do not respond to the treatment with a TNF antagonist, anti-CD20 antibody, CTLA4Ig or anti-IL6 antibody. A further embodiment of the invention is the use of an anti-IL-17 antibody, preferably an antibody according to the invention, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, said patient responding moderately or not responding to the treatment with a TNF antagonist, anti-CD20 antibody, CTLA4Ig or anti-IL 6 antibody. TNF antagonists for RA treatment are, for example, infliximab (IFX, Remicade®), etanercept (ETA, Enbrel®), and adalimumab (ADA, Humira®).

Plates are incubated at 37° C. on an orbital shaker with agitation for 2 hours. Thereafter coating solution is removed and 100 μl/well PBSTC (phosphate buffered saline, 0.05% Tween® 20, 2% chicken serum) is added. Plates are incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Blocking solution is removed and samples (blank: PBSTC, samples (10 μg/ml in PBS): anti-human IL-17 antibodies 3C1 and Mab 106 according to the invention; Mab 16-7178-85 of eBioscience (www.ebioscience.com); MAB 317 of R&D Systems (www.rndsystems.com), NVP-AIN-497 (WO 2006013107); are added to the plate (100 μl/well). Plates are incubated at room temperature with agitation. Samples are removed, plates are washed three times with 200 μl/well PBST (phosphate buffered saline, 0.05% Tween® 20) and second antibody (Goat anti-mouse IgG, Fc gamma, HRP conjugate; Chemicon AP127P, www.Millipore.com) for the detection of mouse antibodies or Goat Anti-human IgG, Fc gamma, HRP conjugate (Chemicon AP113P) for the detection of humanized antibodies is added.

It comprises the following functional elements:\n\n \n \n \n \nan origin of replication derived from the vector pUC18 (pUC origin),\n \na β(beta)-lactamase gene conferring ampicillin resistance in \nE. coli \n(Amp),\n \nan expression cassette for the expression of the gamma 1-heavy chain comprising the following elements:\n        \n \nthe major immediate-early promoter and enhancer from the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV IE1 promoter),\n \na synthetic 5′UTR including a Kozak sequence,\n \na murine immunoglobulin heavy chain signal sequence including the signal sequence intron (L1_Intron_L2),\n \nthe cDNA for the heavy chain variable region (VH) arranged with a splice donor site at the 3′ end,\n \nthe mouse immunoglobulin μ-enhancer region,\n \nthe human immunoglobulin heavy chain gamma 1-gene (IGHG1) including exons CH1, Hinge, CH2 and CH3, intervening introns and the 3′UTR bearing the polyadenylation signal sequence,\n \n\n\n \nan expression cassette for the expression of the kappa-light chain comprising the following elements:\n        \n \nthe major immediate-early promoter and enhancer from the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV IE1 promoter),\n \na synthetic 5′UTR including a Kozak sequence,\n \na murine immunoglobulin heavy chain signal sequence including the signal sequence intron (L1_Intron_L2),\n \nthe cDNA for the light chain variable region arranged with a splice donor site at the 3′ end (VL),\n \nthe intronic mouse Ig-kappa enhancer region,\n \nthe human immunoglobulin kappa gene (IGK) including the IGKC exon and the IGK 3′UTR bearing the polyadenylation signal sequence,\n \n\n\n \nan expression cassette for the expression of murine dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) suitable for auxotrophic selection in eukaryotic cells including\n        \n \na shortened version of the SV40 early promoter and origin,\n \nthe coding sequence for murine DHFR,\n \nthe SV40 early polyadenylation signal.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nP6454 was transfected into CHO-K1 cells and stable cell lines were isolated after selection with Methotrexate (MTX) and were screened for production of human antibody by ELISA for human IgG.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nInvestigation of Activation of the Complement System (C1q Binding ELISA)\n\n\nTo investigate C1q binding of an antibody according to the invention, an ELISA approach is used. C1q is part of the adaptive immune system and, upon binding to immune complexes, triggers the sequential activation of several zymogens. The enzymes in turn, cause the cleavage of C3 molecules, which can result in the onset of inflammatory reactions, opsonization of foreign or aberrant particles and lysis of cell membranes.\n\n\nA MTP (Nunc) is coated with the antibodies to be tested in PBS-buffer over night at 4° C. at seven concentrations between 10 μg/mL and 0.156 μg/mL, 100 μl/well. Blocking of free binding sites is done with 3% BPLA (Roche) in PBS for 1 h at RT, 200 μl/well. The MTP is incubated with 2 μg/mL C1q (Quiddel) in 3% BPLA in PBS, 100 μg/mL. The MTP is washed 3× at RT with 0.1% Tween®20 in PBS. Binding was detected by adding polyclonal rabbit anti-C1q antibody (DAKO) at 0.25 μg/mL in 3% BPLA, 0.1% Tween®20 in PBS, 100 μl/well for 1 h at RT. The MTP is washed 3 times at RT with 0.1% Tween20 in PBS. The secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG POD (Jackson Immuno Research) is added at 0.1 μg/mL in 3% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at RT, 100 μl/well. After washing the MTP 3 times with 0.1% Tween20 in PBS at RT the MTP is incubated with ABTS solution (Roche) and the absorption at a wavelength of 405 nm is measured with a reference wavelength of 490 nm. Background signals are determined in wells which are not coated with antibodies, but treated by the identical detection procedure. No C1q binding is found if the optical density (OD) at 405 nm for the test antibody is lower than 0.05 at an antibody concentration of 10 μg/ml.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nEpitope Region Mapping Via Biacore Crossblocking Experiments\n\n\nAll measurements were performed using the BIAcore 3000 instrument at 25° C. The system and sample buffer was HBS-EP (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.005% Polysorbate 20 (v/v)). A BIAcore CM5 sensor chip was subjected to a pre-conditioning procedure. Sequentially 0.1% SDS, 50 mM NaOH, 10 mM HCl and 100 mM H\n3\nPO\n4 \nwas injected for 30 sec over the flow cells FC1, FC2, FC3 and FC4. The amine coupling procedure was done according to the manufacturers instructions using the BIAcore 3000 wizard v. 4.1.\n\n\nIn order to perform crossblocking experiments with chimeric or humanized antibodies, after an EDC/NHS activation of the sensor surface a polyclonal goat anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson) was immobilized on all sensor flow cells (FCs). 30 μg/ml polyclonal goat anti-human IgG antibody in 10 mM NaAc pH 5.0 was used at 10 μl/min for 7 min to immobilize 10.000 RU of the antibody capturing system. The surface was deactivated by saturation with ethanolamine. The human capture system sensor was conditioned with 5 cycles of binding of huIgG analyte (Bayer) at 10 μl/min for 2 min and regeneration with 10 mM Glycine pH 1.7 at 30 μl/min for 3 min.\n\n\nAt a flow rate of 10 μl/min the primary mAb was injected for 3 min into FC1-FC4. Free binding capacity of the sensor's capturing system was blocked using a 3 min injection into FC1-FC4 at 10 μl/min of a cocktail from 50 μg/ml huIgG (Bayer) in HBS-EP buffer. Subsequently, the antigen rhuIL17-A was injected at 10 μl/min for 3 min into FC1-FC4 to saturate the primary antibodies binding capacity. A second injection into FC1-FC4 at 30 μl/min for 3 min was performed before the secondary antibodies were separately injected at 30 μl/min for 3 min into the flow cells FC1, FC2, FC3 and FC4. The sensor was regenerated using 10 mM Glycine pH 1.75 at 30 μl/min for 3 min.\n\n\nFirst, the 0 nM analyte injection was subtracted from all sensorgrams in order to correct the dissociation of the primary antibodies from the polyclonal goat anti-human IgG capturing system. A quotient was formed by the response signal of the secondary antibody and the primary antibody. The quotient carries the name Molar Ratio (MR) and indicates the accessibility of the epitope region.\n\n\nThe Molar Ratio values were listed in a matrix. Homologous mAb combinations served as a control, whether the blocking procedures had been successfully performed. The cut off was defined by homologous mAb combinations.\n\n\nThe cut off in the crossblocking experiments was set to the Mab106 homogenous assay format (9%). Molar Ratio values above MR=15% relate to access to independent epitopes.\n\n\nThe results from the Epitope Mapping (see Table 2) indicate that the Mab K106 and its derivative Mab107 bind to a different epitope region than NVP-AIN-497. Moreover, Mab K106 covers a different epitope than eBio64CAP17, and the same epitope region than Mab317.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope Mapping results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody 1\n\n\nAntibody 2\n\n\nMolar Ratio[%]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\neBio64CAP17\n\n\n106\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVP-AIN-497\n\n\n106\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMab317\n\n\n106\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVP-AIN-497\n\n\n107\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMab317\n\n\nMab317\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n106\n\n\n106\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\neBio64CAP17\n\n\neBio64CAP17\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVP-AIN-497\n\n\nNVP-AIN-497\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cut off of the analysis is defined by the homogenous assay combinations.

CCD-25SK cells express the IL-17 receptor, and soluble IL-17A binds to the receptors. Antibodies against IL-17A bind to IL-17A. The mechanism only works in the presence of TNFα. Through the binding of IL-17A to the IL-17 receptor, the cells produce hIL-8, which is detected by ELISA as a read out. The measured hIL-8 give the information in which concentrations anti-IL-17 antibodies inhibit the stimulation of CCD-25SK cells by IL-17.\n\n\nCCD-25SK cells were seeded with a cell density of 2.5×10\n4 \ncells/well in a 48-well plate (volume 0.45 ml/well) and incubated for 24 h at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. After overnight incubation, the cells were treated with anti-IL-17 antibodies for 30 min, with end concentrations of 9000; 3000; 1000; 333.3; 111.1; 37.03; 12.34; and 4.11 ng/ml. Each antibody dilution series was made with medium, 50 μl/well (10× concentrated). After 30 min, the cells were stimulated with a mixture of 10 ng/ml IL-17A and 50 pg/ml TNF-alpha, 50 μl/well (10× concentrated) and incubated for 24 h at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. After overnight incubation the supernatants were transferred to 96-well plates and frozen at −20° C. as intermediates for hIL-8 ELISA.\n\n\nhIL-8 ELISA was performed as follows: Diluted capture antibody (100 μl) was added to each well and incubated overnight at 4° C. Dilutions were made with coating buffer. Plates were aspirated, washed with 200 μl/well 3×, blocked with 200 μl/well assay diluent, and incubated for 1 h at RT. The plates were aspirated and washed with 200 μl/well 3×. 100 μl standard and samples were added and incubated for 2 h at RT. Standard dilution series: 400 pg/ml; 200 pg/ml; 100 pg/ml; 50 pg/ml; 25 pg/ml; 12.5 pg/ml; 6.3 pg/ml and assay diluent as negative control. Sample dilution was 1:200. Plates were aspirated and washed with 250 μl/well 4×, and 100 μl conjugate was added to each well. The conjugate was prepared with detection antibody and enzyme reagent 1:250 diluted in assay diluent. Plates were aspirated and washed with 250 μl/well 6×. 100 μl substrate was added to each well and incubated for 12 min. After incubation the reaction was stopped with 50 μl/well 1M H\n2\nSO\n4\n.

Specifically, the compounds of this invention are also useful in the treatment of various CNS disorders, hematological disorders, eating disorders, diseases associated with pain, respiratory diseases, genito-urological disorders, cardiovascular diseases and cancer.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nVarious central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, depression, motor disorders etc., are believed to involve a disturbance of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine or serotonin. Serotonin is localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is known to affect many types of conditions including psychiatric disorders, motor activity, feeding behavior, sexual activity and neuroendocrine regulation among others. 5-HT receptor subtypes regulate the various effects of serotonin. Known 5-HT receptor family includes the 5-HT\n1 \nfamily (e.g. 5-HT\n1A\n), the 5-HT\n2 \nfamily (e.g. 5-HT\n2A\n), 5-HT\n3\n, 5-HT\n4\n, 5-HT\n5\n, 5-HT\n6 \nand 5-HT\n7 \nsubtypes.\n\n\nThe 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor subtype was first cloned from rat tissue in 1993 (Monsma, F. J.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W., Sibley, D. R., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327) and subsequently, from human tissue (Kohen, R.; Metcalf, M. A.; Khan, N.; Druck, T.; Huebner, K.; Sibley, D. R., Journal of Neurochemistry, 1996, 66, 47-56). The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylate cyclase (Ruat, M.; Traiffort, E.; Arrang, J-M.; Tardivel-Lacombe, L.; Diaz, L.; Leurs, R.; Schwartz, J-C., Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications, 1993, 193, 268-276). The receptor is found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) areas both in rats as well as in humans.\n\n\nIn situ hybridization studies of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of 5-HT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and hippocampal formation (Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W.; Lachowicz, J. E.; Hoffman, B. J.; Sibley, D. R.; Dorsa, D. M., Neuroscience, 1995, 64, 1105-1111). Highest levels of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA has been observed in the olfactory tubercle, the striatum, nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus as well as CA\n1\n, CA\n2 \nand CA\n3 \nregions of the hippocampus. Lower levels of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA were seen in the granular layer of the cerebellum, several diencephalic nuclei, amygdala and in the cortex. Northern blots have revealed that 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA appears to be exclusively present in the brain, with little evidence for its presence in peripheral tissues.\n\n\nThe high affinity of number of antipsychotic agents towards 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor, the localization of its mRNA in striatum, olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens suggests that some of the clinical actions of these compounds may be mediated through this receptor. Its ability to bind a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of interacting with the said receptor (Ref: Sleight, A. J. et al. (1997) 5-HT\n6 \nand 5-HT\n7 \nreceptors: molecular biology, functional correlates and possible therapeutic indications, Drug News Perspect. 10, 214-224). Significant efforts are being made to understand the possible role of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in psychiatry, cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. The compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor are earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, for example see Reavill C. and Rogers D. C., Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(1): 104-109, Pharma Press Ltd.\n\n\nMonsma F. J. et al. (1993) and Kohen, R. et al. (2001) have shown that several tricyclic antidepressant compounds, such as amitriptyline and atypical antidepressant compounds, such as mianserin have high affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor. These findings have led to the hypothesis that the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is involved in the pathogenesis and/or treatment of affective disorders. Rodent models of anxiety-related behavior yield conflicting results about the role of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in anxiety. Treatment with 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonists increases seizure threshold in a rat maximal electroconvulsive-shock test [Stean, T. et al. (1999) Anticonvulsant properties of the selective 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonist SB-271046 in the rat maximal electroshock seizure threshold test. Br. J. Pharmacol. 127, 131P; Routledge, C. et al. (2000) Characterization of SB-271046: a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT\n6\n) receptor antagonist. Br. J. Pharmacol. 130, 1606-1612]. Although this indicates that 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors might regulate seizure threshold, the effect is not as pronounced as that of known anticonvulsant drugs.\n\n\nOur understanding of the roles of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands is most advanced in two therapeutic indications in which this receptor is likely to have a major role: learning and memory deficits and abnormal feeding behaviour. The exact role of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is yet to be established in other CNS indications such as anxiety; although one 5-HT\n6 \nagonist has reached Phase I clinical trials recently, the exact role of the receptor is still to be established and is the focus of significant investigation. There are many potential therapeutic uses for 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands in humans based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. These studies include the localization of the receptor; the affinity of ligands with known in-vivo activity and various animal studies conducted so far. Preferably, antagonist compounds of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors are sought after as therapeutic agents.\n\n\nOne potential therapeutic use of modulators of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor functions is in the enhancement of cognition and memory in human diseases such as Alzheimer's. The high levels of receptor found in structures such as the forebrain, including the caudate/putamen, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and cortex suggests a role for the receptor in memory and cognition since these areas are known to play a vital role in memory (Gerard, C.; Martres, M. P.; Lefevre, K.; Miguel, M. C.; Verge, D.; Lanfumey, R.; Doucet, E.; Hamon, M.; EI Mestikawy, S., Brain Research, 1997, 746, 207-219). The ability of known 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands to enhance cholinergic transmission also supports the potential cognition use (Bentey, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542).\n\n\nStudies have found that a known 5-HT\n6 \nselective antagonist significantly increased glutamate and aspartate levels in the frontal cortex without elevating levels of noradrenaline, dopamine or 5-HT. This selective elevation of certain neurochemicals is noted during memory and cognition, strongly suggests a role for 5-HT\n6 \nligands in cognition (Dawson, L. A.; Nguyen, H. Q.; Li, P. British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 130 (1), 23-26). Animal studies of memory and learning with a known selective 5-HT\n6 \nantagonist has some positive effects (Rogers, D. C.; Hatcher, P. D.; Hagan, J. J. Society of Neuroscience, Abstracts, 2000, 26, 680).\n\n\nA related potential therapeutic use for 5-HT\n6 \nligands is in the treatment of attention deficit disorders (ADD, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD) in children as well as adults. As 5-HT\n6 \nantagonists appear to enhance the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and AMID has been linked to abnormalities in the caudate (Ernst, M; Zametkin, A. J.; Matochik, J. H.; Jons, P. A.; Cohen, R. M., Journal of Neuroscience, 1998, 18(15), 5901-5907), 5-HT\n6 \nantagonists may attenuate attention deficit disorders.\n\n\nAt present, a few fully selective agonists are available. The Wyeth agonist WAY-181187 is currently in Phase I trials to target anxiety [Cole, D. C. et al. (2005) Discovery of a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor agonist, WAY-181187. 230th ACS Natl. Meet. (August 28-September 1, Washington D. C.), Abstract MEDI 17.]\n\n\nInternational Patent Publication WO 03/066056 A1 reports that antagonism of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor could promote neuronal growth within the central nervous system of a mammal. Another International Patent Publication WO 03/065046 A2 discloses new variant of human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor and proposes that 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is associated with numerous other disorders.\n\n\nEarly studies examining the affinity of various CNS ligands with known therapeutic utility or a strong structural resemblance to known drugs suggests a role for 5-HT\n6 \nligands in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. For example, clozapine (an effective clinical antipsychotic) has high affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor subtype. Also, several clinical antidepressants have high affinity for the receptor as well and act as antagonists at this site (Branchek, T. A.; Blackburn, T. P., Annual Reviews in Pharmacology and Toxicology, 2000, 40, 319-334).\n\n\nFurther, recent in-vivo studies in rats indicate that 5-HT\n6 \nmodulators may be useful in the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy (Stean, T.; Routledge, C.; Upton, N., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 127 Proc. Supplement-131P; and Routledge, C.; Bromidge, S. M.; Moss, S. F.; Price, G. W.; Hirst, W.; Newman, H.; Riley, G.; Gager, T.; Stean, T.; Upton, N.; Clarke, S. E.; Brown, A.

See for example, Roth, B. L.; et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1994, 268, pages 1403-1412; Sibley, D. R.; et al., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327, Sleight, A.

J.; et al., Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997, 2(3), 115-118.\n\n\nFurthermore, the effect of 5-HT\n6 \nantagonist and 5-HT\n6 \nantisense oligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported, thus potentially in treatment of obesity. See for example, Bentey, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542); Wooley et al., Neuropharmacology, 2001, 41: 210-129; and WO 02/098878.\n\n\nRecently a review by Holenz, Jo″rg et. al., Drug Discovery Today, 11, 7/8, Apr. 2006, Medicinal chemistry strategies to 5-H\n6 \nreceptor ligands as potential cognitive enhancers and antiobesity agents, gives elaborate discussion on evolution of 5-HT\n6 \nligands. It had summarized pharmacological tools and preclinical candidates used in evaluation of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in illnesses such as schizophrenia, other dopamine-related disorders and depression and to profile the neurochemical and electrophysiological effects of either blockade or activation of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors. Furthermore, they have been used to characterize the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor and to investigate its distribution.\n\n\nSo far several clinical candidates form the part of indole-type structures and are closely related structurally to the endogenous ligand 5-HT, for example compounds by Glennon, R.

While some 5-HT\n6 \nmodulators have been disclosed, there continues to be a need for compounds that are useful for modulating 5-HT\n6\n. Surprisingly, it has been found that aminoalkoxy arylsulphonamide compounds of formula (I) demonstrate very high 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor affinity. Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide compounds, which are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of a variety of central nervous system disorders or disorders affected by the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel aminoalkoxy azylsulfonamide compounds, of the formula (I), their derivatives, their stereoisomers, their

three to six carbon atoms and includes cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl, which may be substituted or unsubstituted and optionally the substituents may be selected from halogen, (C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl or (C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkoxy;\n\n\n“Cyclo(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy” means cyclic or branched cyclic alkyl radicals containing three to six carbon atoms and includes cyclopropyloxy, cyclobutyloxy, cyclopentyloxy or cyclohexyloxy.\n\n\n“Cyclo alkyl(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy” means cyclopropylmethyloxy, cyclobutylmethyloxy, cyclopentylmethyloxy or cyclohexylmethyloxy and the like;\n\n\n“Heterocyclyl” means a non-aromatic saturated monocyclic or multicyclic ring system comprising about 3 to 10 ring atoms in which one or more of the atoms in the ring system is an element other than carbon, for example nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur, alone or in combination. Preferred heterocyclyls contain about 5 to 6 ring atoms. The prefix aza, oxa or thia before the heterocyclyl root name means that at least a nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atom respectively is present as a ring atom. The heterocyclyl can be optionally substituted by replacing an available hydrogen on the ring by one or more substituents, which may be the same or different.

Non-limiting examples of suitable monocyclic heterocyclyl rings include piperidyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperazinyl, pyranyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl, morpholinyl and the like\n\n\nThe term “schizophrenia” means schizophrenia, schizophreniform, disorder, schizoaffective disorder and psychotic disorder wherein the term “psychotic” refers to delusions, prominent hallucinations, disorganized speech or disorganized or catatonic behavior. See Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, fourth edition, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D.C.\n\n\nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, the mammal being treated therewith.\n\n\n“Therapeutically effective amount” is defined as ‘an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition or disorder (ii) attenuates, ameliorates or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition or disorder (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein’.\n\n\nThe terms “treating”, “treat” or “treatment” embrace all the meanings such as preventative, prophylactic and palliative.\n\n\nThe term “stereoisomers” is a general term for all isomers of the individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes mirror image isomers (enantiomers), geometric (cis-trans) isomers and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral centre that are not mirror images of one another (diastereomers).\n\n\nCertain compounds of formula (I) are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms (e.g. diastereomers and enantiomers) and the invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated from one another by the usual methods or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The invention also extends to tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof.\n\n\nThe stereoisomers as a rule are generally obtained as racemates that can be separated into the optically active isomers in a manner known per se. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) having an asymmetric carbon atom the present invention relates to the D-form, the L-form and D,L-mixtures and in the case of a number of asymmetric carbon atoms, the diastereomeric forms and the invention extends to each of these stereo isomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. Those compounds of general formula (I) which have an asymmetric carbon and as a rule are obtained as racemates can be separated one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereo specific or asymmetric synthesis. However, it is also possible to employ an optically active compound from the start, a correspondingly optically active enantiomeric or diastereomeric compound then being obtained as the final compound.\n\n\nThe stereoisomers of compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by one or more ways presented below:\n\n \n \ni) One or more of the reagents may be used in their optically active form.\n \nii) Optically pure catalyst or chiral ligands along with metal catalyst may be employed in the reduction process. The metal catalyst may be Rhodium, Ruthenium, Indium and the like. The chiral ligands may preferably be chiral phosphines (Principles of Asymmetric synthesis, J. E. Baldwin Ed., Tetrahedron series, 14, 311-316).\n \niii) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional, methods such as forming diastereomeric salts with chiral acids or chiral amines, or chiral amino alcohols, chiral amino acids. The resulting mixture of diastereomers may then be separated by methods such as fractional crystallization, chromatography and the like, which is followed by an additional step of isolating the optically active product by hydrolyzing the derivative (Jacques et. al., “Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolution”, Wiley Interscience, 1981).\n \niv) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as microbial resolution, resolving the diastereomeric salts formed with chiral acids or chiral bases.\n \n\n\nChiral acids that can be employed may be tartaric acid, mandelic acid, lactic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, amino acids and the like. Chiral bases that can be employed may be cinchona alkaloids, brucine or a basic amino acid such as lysine, arginine and the like.

The chronic effect of the compounds of general formula (I) on food intake in well-fed rats was then determined as follows.\n\n\nThe rats were housed in single home cages for 28 days. During this period, the rats were either dosed orally or ip, with a composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or a corresponding composition (vehicle) without the said compound (control group), once a day. The rat is provided with ad libitum food and water.\n\n\nOn 0, 1\nst\n, 7\nth\n, 14\nth\n, 21\nst \nand 28\nth \nday the rats were left with the pre-weighed amounts of food. Food intake and weight gain were measured on a routine basis. Also a food ingestion method is disclosed in the literature (Kask et al., European Journal of Pharmacology, 414, 2001, 215-224, and Turnball et. al., Diabetes, vol 51, August, 2002, and some in-house modifications). The respective parts of the descriptions are herein incorporated as a reference and they form part of the disclosure.\n\n\nSome representative compounds have shown the statistically significant decrease in food intake, when conducted in the above manner at the doses of either 10 mg/Kg, or 30 mg/Kg or both.\n\n\nExample 87\n\n\nTablet Comprising a Compound of Formula (I)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound according to\n\n\n5 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nexample 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLactose\n\n\n60 mg \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCrystalline cellulose\n\n\n25 mg \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK 90 Povidone\n\n\n5 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPregelatinised starch\n\n\n3 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nColloidal silicon dioxide\n\n\n1 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMagnesium stearate\n\n\n1 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal weight per tablet\n\n\n100 mg \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ingredients were combined and granulated using a solvent such as methanol.

I. N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as experimental animals. Four animals were housed in each cage. Animals were kept on 20% food deprivation before one day and given water ad libitum throughout the experiment and maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle. Also the rats were habituated to individual arenas for 1 hour in the absence of any objects.\n\n\nOne group of 12 rats received vehicle (1 mL/Kg) orally and another set of animals received compound of the formula (I) either orally or i.p., before one hour of the familiar (T1) and choice trial (T2).\n\n\nThe experiment was carried out in a 50×50×50 cm open field made up of acrylic. In the familiarization phase, (T1), the rats were placed individually in the open field for 3 minutes, in which two identical objects (plastic bottles, 12.5 cm height×5.5 cm diameter) covered in yellow masking tape alone (a1 and a2) were positioned in two adjacent corners, 10 cm. from the walls. After 24 hours of the (T1) trial for long-term memory test, the same rats were placed in the same arena as they were placed in T1 trial. Choice phase (T2) rats were allowed to explore the open field for 3 minutes in presence of one familiar object (a3) and one novel object (b) (Amber color glass bottle, 12 cm high and 5 cm in diameter). Familiar objects presented similar textures, colors and sizes. During the T1 and T2 trial, explorations of each object (defined as sniffing, licking, chewing or having moving vibrissae whilst directing the nose towards the object at a distance of less than 1 cm) were recorded separately by stopwatch. Sitting on an object was not regarded as exploratory activity, however, it was rarely observed.\n\n\nT1 is the total time spent exploring the familiar objects (a1+a2).\n\n\nT2 is the total time spent exploring the familiar object and novel object (a3+b).\n\n\nThe object recognition test was performed as described by Ennaceur, A., Delacour, J., 1988, A new one-trial test for neurobiological studies of memory in rats—Behavioral data, Behay. Brain Res., 31, 47-59.\n\n\nSome representative compounds have shown positive effects indicating the increased novel object recognition viz; increased exploration time with novel object and higher discrimination index.\n\n\nExample 94\n\n\nChewing/Yawning/Stretching Induction by 5-HT\n6 \nR Antagonists\n\n\nMale Wister rats weighing 200-250 grams were used. Rats were given vehicle injections and placed in individual, transparent chambers for 1 hour each day for 2 days before the test day, to habituate them to the observation chambers and testing procedure. On the test day, rats were placed in the observation chambers immediately after, drug administration and observed continuously for yawning, stretching, and chewing behaviors from 60 to 90 minutes after drug or vehicle injections. 60 minutes prior to the drug administration Physostigmine, 0.1 mg/kg i.p, was administered to all the animals. Average number of yawns, stretches and vacuous chewing movements during the 30 minutes observation period were recorded.\n\n\nReference: (A) King M. V., Sleight A., J., Woolley M.

The 10 cm\n2 \nperspex platform, lying 1 cm below the water surface, was placed in the centre of one of the four imaginary quadrants, which remained constant for all rats. The black Perspex used in the construction of the maze and platform offered no intramaze cues to guide escape behavior. By contrast, the training room offered several strong extramaze visual cues to aid the formation of the spatial map necessary for escape learning. An automated tracking system, [Videomot 2 (5.51), TSE systems, Germany] was employed. This program analyzes video images acquired via a digital camera and an image acquisition board that determined path length, swim speed and the number of entries and duration of swim time spent in each quadrant of the water maze.\n\n\nReference: (A) Yamada N., Hattoria A., Hayashi T., Nishikawa T., Fukuda H. et.

The training apparatus consisted of a chamber 300 mm in length, 260 mm wide, and 270 mm in height, constructed to established designs. The front and top were transparent, allowing the experimenter to observe the behavior of the animal inside the apparatus. The chamber was divided into two compartments, separated by a central shutter that contained a small opening 50 mm wide and 75 mm high set close to the front of the chamber. The smaller of the compartments measured 9 mm in width and contained a low-power (6V) illumination source. The larger compartment measured 210 mm in width and was not illuminated. The floor of this dark compartment consisted of a grid of 16 horizontal stainless-steel bars that were 5 mm in diameter and spaced 12.5 mm apart. A current generator supplied 0.75 mA to the grid floor, which was scrambled once every 0.5 seconds across the 16 bars. A resistance range of 40-60 micro ohms was calculated for a control group of rats and the apparatus was calibrated accordingly. An electronic circuit detecting the resistance of the animal ensured an accurate current delivery by automatic variation of the voltage with change in resistance.\n\n\nExperimental Procedure:\n\n\nThis was carried out as described previously. Adult male Wister rats weighing 200-230 grams were used. Animals were brought to the laboratory 1 hour before the experiment. On the day of training, animals were placed facing the rear of the light compartment of the apparatus. The timer was started once the animal has completely turned to face the front of the chamber. Latency to enter the dark chamber was recorded (usually <20 seconds) and having completely entered the dark compartment an inescapable foot shock of 0.75 mA for 3 seconds was administered to the animal. Animals were then returned to their home cages. Between each training session, both compartments of the chamber were cleaned to remove any confounding olfactory cues. Recall of this inhibitory stimulus was evaluated 24 hours, 72 hours and on 7 day post-training by returning the animal into the light chamber and recording their latency to enter the dark chamber, a criterion time of 300 seconds was employed.\n\n\nReference: (A) Callahan P.

(43): 320-327 (1993).\n\n\nExample 98\n\n\n5-HT\n6 \nFunctional Assay Cyclic AMP\n\n\nThe antagonist property of the compounds at the human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors was determined by testing their effect on cAMP accumulation in stably transfected HEK293 cells. Binding of an agonist to the human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor will lead to an increase in adenyl cyclase activity. A compound that is an agonist will show an increase in cAMP production and a compound that is an antagonist will block the agonist effect.\n\n\nHuman 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors were cloned and stably expressed in HEK293 cells. These cells were plated in 6 well plates in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 500 μg/mL G418 and incubated at 37° C. in a CO\n2 \nincubator. The cells were allowed to grow to about 70% confluence before initiation of the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the culture media was removed and the cells were washed once with serum free medium (SFM). Two mL of SFM+IBMX media was added and incubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes. The media were removed and fresh SFM+IBMX media containing various compounds and 1 μM serotonin (as antagonist) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes. Following incubation, the media were removed and the cells were washed once with 1 mL of PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Each well was treated with 1 mL cold 95% ethanol and 5 μM EDTA (2:1) at 4° C. for 1 hour. The cells were then scraped and transferred into Eppendorf tubes. The tubes were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4° C. and the supernatants were stored at 4° C. until assayed.\n\n\ncAMP content was determined by EIA (enzyme-immunoassay) using the Amersham Biotrak cAMP EIA kit (Amersham RPN 225). The procedure used is as described for the kit. Briefly, cAMP is determined by the competition between unlabeled cAMP and a fixed quantity of peroxidase-labelled cAMP for the binding sites on anti-cAMP antibody. The antibody is immobilized onto polystyrene microtitre wells precoated with a second antibody. The reaction is started by adding 50 μL, peroxidase-labeled cAMP to the sample (100 μL) pre-incubated with the antiserum (100 mL) for 2 hOurs at 4° C. Following 1 hour incubation at 4° C., the unbound ligand is separated by a simple washing procedure. Then an enzyme substrate, trimethylbenzidine (1), is added and incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 100 mL 1.0 M sulphuric acid and the resultant color read by a microtitre plate spectrophotometer at 450 nm within 30 minutes.\n\n\nIn the functional adenylyl cyclase assay, some of the compound of this invention was found to be a competitive antagonist with good selectivity over a number of other receptors including other serotonin receptors such as 5-HT\n1A \nand 5-HT\n7\n.\n\n\nExample 99\n\n\nRodent Pharmacokinetic Study\n\n\nMale wistar rats (230-280 grams) obtained from N. I. N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as an experimental animal.\n\n\nThree to five animals were housed in each cage. Animals were kept on 20% food deprivation before one day and given water ad libitum throughout the experiment and maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle. One group of rats received NCE compound (3-30 mg/Kg) orally and another group of animals received same compound through intravenously.\n\n\nAt each time point blood was collected by jugular vein. Plasma was stored frozen at −20° C. until analysis. The concentrations of the NCE compound in plasma were determined using LC-MS/MS method.\n\n\nSchedule time points: Pre dose 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours after dosing (n=3). The NCE compounds were quantified in plasma by validated LC-MS/MS method using solid phase extraction technique. NCE compounds were quantified in the calibration range of 2-2000 ng/ml in plasma and brain homogenate. Study samples were analyzed using calibration samples in the batch and quality control samples spread across the batch.\n\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, Tmax, AUCt, AUCinf, half life, volume of distribution, clearance, mean residence time and thereby oral bioavailability were calculated by non-compartmental model using software WinNonlin version 4.1.\n\n\nExample 100\n\n\nRodent Brain Penetration Study\n\n\nMale Wister rats (230-280 grams) obtained from N.

Animals were kept on 20% food deprivation before one day and given water ad libitum throughout the experiment, and maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle. Each group of animals received NCE compound (3-30 mg/Kg) orally or ip.\n\n\nAt each time point blood was collected by jugular vein. Animals will be sacrificed to collect the brain tissue and was homogenized. Plasma and Brain was stored frozen at −20° C. until analysis. The concentrations of the NCE compound in plasma and Brain were determined using LC-MS/MS method.\n\n\nSchedule time points: Pre dose 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours after dosing (n=3). The NCE compounds were quantified in plasma and brain homogenate by validated LC-MS/MS method using solid phase extraction technique. NCE compounds were quantified in the calibration range of 2-2000 ng/ml in plasma and brain homogenate. Study samples were analyzed using calibration samples in the batch and quality control samples spread across the batch.\n\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, Tmax, AUCt, AUCinf, half life, volume of distribution, clearance, mean residence time and thereby Cb/Cp, ratio of NCE in brain versus plasma were calculated by non-compartmental model using software WinNonlin version 4.1.\n\n\nExample 101\n\n\nRodent Brain Micro Dialysis Study for Possible Modulation of Neurotransmitters\n\n\nMale Wister rats (230-280 grams) obtained from N. I. N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as an experimental animal.\n\n\nGroup allocation Group 1: Vehicle (Water; 5 mg/kg; p.o.), Group 2: NCE (3 mg/kg; p.o.), Group 3: NCE (10 mg/kg; p.o.)\n\n\nSurgical Procedure: Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and placed in Stereotaxic frame. Guide cannula (CMA/12) was placed at AP: −5.2 mm, ML: +5.0 mm relative from bregma and DV: −3.8 mm from the brain surface according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (1986). While the animal was still anesthetized, a micro dialysis probe (CMA/12, 4 mm, PC) was inserted through the guide cannula and secured in place. After surgery recovery period of 48-72 hours was maintained before subjecting the animal for study.\n\n\nA day prior to study animals were transferred to home cages for acclimatization and implanted probe was perfused overnight with a modified Ringer's solution comprised of: 1.3 μM CaCl2 (Sigma), 1.0 μM MgCl\n2 \n(Sigma), 3.0 μM KCl (Sigma), 147.0 μM NaCl (Sigma), 1.0 μM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO and 0.2 μM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n.2H\n2\nO and 0.3 μM neostigmine bromide (Sigma) (pH to 7.2) at a rate of 0.2 μL/minute set by a microinfusion pump (PicoPlus, Hayward). On the day of experiment perfusion rate was changed to 1.2 μL/minutes and allowed for 3 hours stabilization. After stabilization period, four basals were collected at 20 minutes intervals before dosing. Dialysate samples were collected in glass vials using CMA/170 refrigerated fraction collector.\n\n\nVehicle or NCE (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was administered by gavage after four fractions had been collected. The perfusate was collected until 6 hours after administration.\n\n\nAcetylcholine concentrations in dialysate samples were measured by LC-MS/MS (API 4000, MDS SCIEX) method. Acetylcholine is quantified in the calibration range of 0.250 to 8.004 ng/mL in dialysates.\n\n\nOn completion of the microdialysis experiments, the animals were sacrificed and their brains were removed and stored in a 10% formalin solution. Each brain was sliced at 50μ on a cryostat (Leica) stained and examined microscopically to confirm probe placement. Data from animals with incorrect probe placement were discarded.\n\n\nMicrodialysis data were expressed as percent changes (Mean±S.E.M.) of baseline that was defined as the average absolute value (in fM/10 μL) of the four samples before drug administration.\n\n\nEffects of NCE (3 & 10 mg/kg) and Vehicle treatments were statistically evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests. In all statistical measures, a p<0.05 was considered significant. The Graph Pad Prism program statistically evaluated the data."
