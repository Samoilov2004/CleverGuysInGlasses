In some instances IBAT inhibitor therapy eliminates side effects associated with metformin therapy and/or DPP-IV inhibitor therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of any of the methods described herein, administration of an ASBT inhibitor described herein in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor increases the level of GLP-1 in the blood and/or plasma of an individual by from about 1.5 times to about 30 times compared to the level of GLP-1 in the blood and/or plasma of the individual prior to administration of the IBAT inhibitor in combination with the DPP-IV inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, an increase in GLP-1 level of from about 2 times to about 3 times following the administration of an ASBT inhibitor described herein in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor compared to the level of GLP-1 in the blood and/or plasma of the individual prior to administration of the IBAT inhibitor in combination with the DPP-IV inhibitor is associated with an anti-diabetic effect and/or with reduction in food intake and/or induction of satiety and/or weight loss.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of any of the methods described herein, administration of an IBAT inhibitor in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor reduces blood and/or plasma sugar levels for a longer period of time (e.g., at least 24 hours) compared to reduction in blood and/or plasma sugar levels upon administration of metformin in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of any of the methods described herein, administration of a single dose of an IBAT inhibitor in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor sustains reduced blood and/or plasma sugar levels for at least 6 hours, at least 12 hours, at least 14 hours, at least 16 hours, at least 18 hours, at least 20 hours, at least 24 hours, at least 30 hours, at least 36 hours or at least 48 hours compared to reduction in blood and/or plasma sugar levels upon administration of a single dose of metformin in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one embodiment, administration of an IBAT inhibitor in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor reduces blood and/or plasma sugar levels by at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50% at least 60%, at least 70% or at least 80% compared to blood and/or plasma sugar levels prior to administration of the IBAT linhibitor in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of any of the methods described herein, administration of an IBAT INHIBITOR in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor reduces blood and/or plasma sugar levels by at least 20%, e.g. at least 30%, such as at least 40%, e.g. at least 50% compared to blood and/or plasma sugar levels prior to administration of the IBAT inhibitor in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one embodiment of the invention, administration of an IBAT inhibitor in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor results in higher levels of GLP-1 in blood and/or plasma of an individual compared to levels of GLP-1 in blood and/or plasma of a normal individual. In some embodiments of any of the methods described herein, administration of an IBAT inhibitor in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor results in higher levels of GLP-1 in blood and/or plasma of an individual compared to levels of GLP-1 in blood and/or plasma of an individual undergoing therapy with metformin and/or a DPP-IV inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an IBAT inhibitor is administered in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor and/or a biliary shunt. Biliary shunts may be selected from the shunts described in WO 2007/0050628, which is incorporated herein by reference. A biliary shunt may move bile acid to the distal ileum and/or the rectum and/or the colon thereby increasing the concentration of bile acids in the vicinity of L-cells present in the distal portion of the gastrointestinal tract. Such an increase in the concentration of bile acids in the vicinity of L-cells increases in some instances the secretion of GLP-1 from L-cells thereby inducing satiey and/or reduction in hunger and/or weight loss and/or reduction in plasma glucose levels or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe other active substance and the IBAT inhibitor are used such that the combination is present in a therapeutically effective amount. For example an IBAT inhibitor and the other active substance (e.g., a DPP-IV inhibitor) are each is used in a therapeutically effective amount. When an additive or synergistic effect is present, they can each be used in a subclinical therapeutically effective amount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the use of a combination of an IBAT inhibitor and any other active ingredient as described herein encompasses combinations where the IBAT inhibitor or the other active ingredient is present in a therapeutically effective amount, and the other is present in a subclinical therapeutically effective amount, provided that the combined use is therapeutically effective owing to their additive or synergistic effects. As used herein, the term “additive effect” describes the combined effect of two (or more) pharmaceutically active agents that is equal to the sum of the effect of each agent given alone. A synergistic effect is one in which the combined effect of two (or more) pharmaceutically active agents is greater than the sum of the effect of each agent given alone. Any suitable combination of an ASBTI with one or more of the aforementioned other active ingredients and optionally with one or more other pharmacologically active substances is contemplated as being within the scope of the methods described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for experimentally determining therapeutically-effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are described in the literature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds may be administered concurrently e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, the condition of the individual, and the actual choice of compounds used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe multiple therapeutic agents are optionally administered in any order or simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents are optionally provided in a single, unified form or in multiple forms, e.g. as a single pill or as two separate pills. In certain instances, one of the therapeutic agents is optionally given in multiple doses. In other instances, both are optionally given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may be, e.g., from more than a couple of days to less than four weeks. In addition, the combination methods, compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents. The use of multiple therapeutic combinations is also envisioned including two or more of the active substances described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active substances in a combination therapy described herein may be provided in a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. In some embodiments, the active compounds are administered sequentially, with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen using a two-step administration. In some embodiments, two-step administration regimen calls for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced-apart administration of the separate active agents. In certain embodiments, the time period between the multiple administration steps varies, by way of non-limiting example, from a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent, such as potency, solubility, bioavailability, plasma half-life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a dosage regimen to treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s), is modified depending on e.g. the disorder from which the subject suffers, as well as the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the subject. Thus, in various embodiments, the dosage regimen actually employed may differ from the dosage regimens set forth herein. In certain embodiments, IBAT inhibitor compounds described herein are combined with or one or more of: insulin, insulin-mimetics, incretin mimetics, GLP-1 or analogues thereof,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP-2 or analogues thereof, oxyntomodulin, PYY, DPP-IV inhibitors, or TGR5 modulators in any combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also regards IBAT inhibitor compounds described herein in combination with at least one bile acid binder e.g. a resin such as cholestyramine, cholestipol and colesevelam.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBile acid binders (bile acid sequestrants, resins)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following bile acid binders may be used according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCholestyramine a hydrophilic polyacrylic quaternary ammonium anion exchange resin, which is known to be effective in reducing blood cholesterol levels.

At sacrifice, the gall bladder and the whole intestine were removed, and the faeces during the 24-hour period after 75SeHCAT administration was collected for each mouse. The gamma radioactivities of 75SeHCAT in the faeces and in the gall bladder-intestine were separately counted by 1282 CompuGamma CS Gamma counter (Wallac oy, Turku, Finland). The stability as well as the quantity of the 75SeHCAT administered to each mouse, were controlled with an additional 75SeHCAT aliquot following the same experimental process as other tested samples in the study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sum of the gamma counts from both the faeces and the gall bladder-intestine was considered as the total recovered 75SeHCAT, which was averaged around 85% of the total 75SeHCAT administered to each mouse. Of the recovered radioactivity of 75SeHCAT, the percentage of the 75SeHCAT detected in the faeces was considered as the faecal excretion while that in the gall bladder-intestine as body retention. Inhibitory effect of Example 14 IBAT inhibitor on 75SeHCAT intestinal absorption was calculated following the 75SeHCAT body retention and the faecal excretion, and the ED50 of the compound was estimated following the dose-effect curve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mean IBAT inhibitory effect (%) at a dose (pmol/kg): 0.156 was determined for the compounds of examples 1-14 and is reported in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% inhibition\n\n\nMean IC50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nStructure\n\n\n0.156 μmol/\nkg\n \n \nnM\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\n0.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\n0.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n74\n\n\n0.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n66\n\n\n0.36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n67\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample  16 \n\n\n \n \n \nInterruption of bile acid circulation by inhibition of the bile acid transporter Slc 10a2 improves triglyceride metabolism and normalizes plasma glucose levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpermintal Procedures\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimals\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSlc10a2+/− and Slc10a2−/− mice were generated at AstraZeneca R&D, Molndal, as described below and as outlined by Dawson et al (2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTargeting the Slc10a2 Locus\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe targeting vector used to modify the mouse Slc10a2 locus was a kind gift from P. Dawson and has been previously described (2). In brief, it consisted of a˜\n14kb\n 5′homology arm, an inverted Neo (neomycin phosphotransferase) cassette driven off the PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase) promoter and a 1.6 kb 3′ homology arm. The targeting vector was designed so that correct targeting would result in most of \nintron\n 2, exon 3, intron 3 and the very 5′ end of \nexon\n 4 being deleted and replaced by the Neo cassette in order to inactivate the Slc10a2 gene (see \nFIG. 1A\n). B, BamHI; H, HeeIII. After linearization, the targeting construct was electroporated into R1 ES cells (derived from 129/SvJ) and neomycin-resistant clones were selected in G-418-containing (300 pg/ml) media. Of 400 G418-resistant clones screened, 2 targeted clones were identified using a PCR screening over the short arm and then confirmed by Southern analysis. The primers used for detecting the targeted allele were a forward primer located in the inverted Neo cassette and a reverse primer located downstream of the short arm (5′-cgtactggggcatagaatctttgc-3′). The same reverse primer was combined with a forward primer in intron 3 (5′-ctcttcctatgaagctaaaggggc-3′) for detection of the wild-type allele. One positive clone was expanded and injected into C57B1/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Chimeric males were backcrossed to\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC57B1/6 females and genotyping of the offspring was performed from tail biopsies by both\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCR and Southern to confirm germline transmission. To verify that the targeted SLC10A2 allele resulted in a null mutation, total RNA was prepared from the kidneys and intestines of 8-10 week old homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type littermates using TRIzol Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). cDNA was synthezised using Super-script II Rnase H-Reverse Transcriptase and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). TaqMan real-time PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). All samples were run in triplicate and data were normalized using the mouse acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO (M36B4) as an internal control. The TaqMan primers and probe for SLC10A2 were: 5′-accacttgctccacactgctt-3′(forward), 5′-acccacatcttggtgtagacga-3′(reverse) and 5′-ccttggaatgatgcctctttgcctc-3′ (probe).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA diet enriched in sucrose (D12329, Research Diets, NJ) together with drinking water supplemented with 10% fructose was used for the high carbohydrate experiment. Animals had free access to the diet for two weeks. Control animals received standard mouse chow and tap water. Male ob/ob animals were from Taconic, DK. Ob/ob animals were gavaged with a specific Slc10a2 inhibitor Example 14 or a control vehicle for 11 days. Animals had free access to food and water. All animal care and experiments were conducted in accordance with accepted standards of humane animal care and approved by the Ethics Committee of Goteborg University.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood was centrifuged, and plasma was analyzed for total cholesterol and TGs using the IL TestTM cholesterol 181618-10 and TG 181610-60 kits on the Monarch 2000 system (IL Scandinavia, Gothenburg, Sweden). Lipoprotein cholesterol profiles were obtained by separation of 10 pl of plasma using a micro fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system for the generation of lipoprotein profiles (15). Plasma insulin levels were analyzed using a rodent insulin RIA kit (Linco, St. Charles, Mich.). Total plasma glucose was analyzed using the IL Test (IL Scandinavia, Gothenburg, Sweden) on the Monark 2000 system. Blood glucose was determined using a Bayer Elite glucometer (Bayer diagnostics, Germany). Plasma free fatty acids were analyzed employing a commercial 3 NEFA kit (Wako Chemicals\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUSA Inc. Richmond, Va.). Serum levels of 7a-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) were used as an indirect measurement of CYP7A1 activity, and analyzed in either pooled or individual plasma samples by high pressure liquid chromatography (16).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzymatic Activities\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHMGCoA reductase and CYP7A1 enzymatic activities were assayed in hepatic microsomes as described (17).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA Extraction and Quantitative Real Time PCR\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTotal RNA was extracted from frozen livers or distal ileum with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The RNA was DNase-treated with RQ1 Dnase (Promega, Madison, Wis.). cDNA synthesis and quantitative real time PCR was performed employing HPRT as endogenous control (18). Primer and probe information are available upon request.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiver Protein and Immunoblotting\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA ligand blot employing \n125\nI-labeled rabbit β-VLDL was used to detect LDL receptors in liver as described (19). Hepatic SR-BI was assayed by immunoblot using a rodent specific rabbit polyclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals Inc., Littleton, Colo.), as described (20). Cyp7a1 protein levels were assayed in liver microsomal protein samples by immunoblot using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminus of the CYP7A1 (18). To detect SREBP1 protein, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein preparations from liver were performed using the NE—PER reagent (Pierce), including Complete protease inhibitor (Roche), 1 mM phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM leupeptin, 5 μg/ml Calpain inhibitor I (Biomol, Pa.), following the manufacturer's instructions. 50 μg and 25 μg of cytoplasmic and nuclear liver protein fractions, respectively, were electrophoresed on NuPage Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% skimmed milk powder and incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the N′-terminus of SREBP1 (Labvision Corporation, Calif.) at 1.5 μg/mL in 5% skimmed milk powder for two hours at room temperature. An HRP conjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab)2 antibody (Pierce) was used for detection of specific signals together with Supersignal reagent (Pierce) and a Fuji BAS 1800 analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co.). To analyze phosphorylated liver proteins by western blot, total liver protein homogenates were prepared from frozen tissue by homogenization using a polytron followed by sonication in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-Hcl, \n \n \npH\n \n \n 7,4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% Glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM betaglycerophosphate, 20 mM sodium floride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM leupeptin, Complete proteinase inhibitor (Roche), and then centrifuged at 14 000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was recovered. 50 μg protein was loaded on NuPage Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in Starting Block—PBS (Pierce) and incubated in 3% BSA with phosphorylation site specific antibodies, pAkt1, pErk1/2, pMek1/2, pAmpk as indicated in figures overnight at +4 C, then stripped with Restore (Pierce) and reprobed with antibodies detecting total amounts of Akt1, Mek1/2, Erk1/2, and Ampk and finally stripped and reprobed with an antibody against beta-actin (Abcam) to verify gel loading. Antibodies against kinases were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Blots were developed as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of Liver TGs and Cholesterol\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiver cholesterol was determined as previously described and liver TGs were extracted (21) and determined employing a commercially available kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStatistics\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData show mean +/− SEM. The significance of differences between groups was tested by 1-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc comparisons according to Dunnett using GraphPad PrismSoftware. For the studies on ob/ob mice, the significance between groups was tested by Student's t-test.\n\n\n \nRESULTS\n\n\n \n \n \nGeneration of Slc10a2−/− mice\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneration of Slc10a2−/− mice was performed as described in detail in \nFIG. 1\n experimental procedures. Southern blotting, quantitative real time PCR and immunoblotting confirmed appropriate targeting and lack of Slc10a2 expression in the null mice (\nFIG. 1\n and not shown.) Slc10a2−/− animals were viable and fertile. No abnormalities in behaviour, gross appearance or survival were seen, consistent with the previous report by Dawson et al. (2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased BA synthesis in male Slc10a2+/− and Slc10a2−/− mice\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn established response following disruption of the enterohepatic circulation of BAs is an induced synthesis of BAs (2,6-8,22). Indeed, when the hepatic mRNA levels for CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of BAs, were assayed by quantitative real time PCR (qrtPCR), there was an ˜7-fold induction in Slc10a2−/− mice (\nFIG. 2A\n). Also, in the Slc10a2+/− mice there was a clear but less pronounced (-3-fold) increase in CYP7A1 mRNA. Consistent with the CYP7A1 mRNA increase, the enzymatic activity and the protein mass of CYP7A1 were higher in both Slc10a2+/− and −/− mice, when examined in pooled microsomes (\nFIGS. 2B\n and 2C). The CYP7A1 reaction product 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), present in blood serum, has been demonstrated to be an accurate marker of CYP7A1 enzyme activity (16). Analysis of pooled serum from both heterozygous and homozygous animals revealed higher serum C4 levels as compared to control animals (\nFIG. 2D\n). In conjunction with the observed increase in CYP7A1, the mRNA levels for the 12 alphahydroxylase, CYP8B1, were also induced dosedependently (\nFIG. 2E\n). When the circulation of BAs is disrupted, the amount of available ligand for the hepatic nuclear BA receptor FXR decreases. In line with this, decreased hepatic mRNA levels of the FXR target gene, Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP), a suppressor of CYP7A1 gene transcription, were found in heterozygous and homozygous mice, with the most drastic change in the latter group (\nFIG. 2F\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLowered plasma TGs in Slc10a2+/− and Slc10a2−/− mice\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma total TGs were significantly reduced by 22% in Slc10a2+/− mice and by 35% in Slc10a2−/− mice compared to controls (\nFIG. 3A\n). The plasma cholesterol and TG lipoprotein profiles were then analyzed by fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) (\nFIGS. 3B\n and C). The plasma cholesterol profiles did not vary notably between controls and homozygous animals. However, larger changes were found in the plasma TG profiles of these mice (\nFIG. 3C\n). In Slc10a2+/− mice, TGs were reduced within LDL, whereas in Slc10a2−/− mice TGs were reduced in both VLDL- and LDL (\nFIG. 3C\n). Plasma glucose and insulin were however not altered in Slc10a2−/− animals in this experiment (not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdaptation of Hepatic Cholesterol Metabolism to BA Deficiency\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere were no changes in the hepatic expression of the LDL-receptor or the HDL-receptor SR-BI, neither at mRNA nor at protein levels (data not shown). The increased need for cholesterol as substrate for CYP7A1 in the livers of Slc10a2+/− and Slc10a2−/− mice was reflected in increased enzymatic activity of the hepatic HMGCoAreductase, with a 2-fold increase in the heterozygous and a 3.5-fold increase in homozygous animals, based upon analysis of pooled microsomal samples (\nFIG. 3D\n). The increases in hepatic HMGCoA reductase mRNA levels had a similar pattern, although smaller differences were observed between groups (\nFIG. 3D\n). The gene expression of the hepatic sterol transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8 were suppressed by up to 50% in a gene-dose dependent manner (\nFIG. 3E\n). In line with the findings for HMGCoA reductase, the hepatic levels of SREBP2 mRNA were increased in both Slc10a2+/− and Slc10a2−/− mice (\nFIG. 3F\n). Intriguingly, the regulation of the SREBP1 c gene in the liver displayed an opposite pattern, with reduced mRNA levels in heterozygous and homozygous mice compared to controls, again in a gene-dose dependent manner (\nFIG. 3F\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHepatic TG production is suppressed in Slc10a2−/− mice\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further explore TG metabolism in this animal model of BA malabsorption, Slc10a2−/− and wt control animals received a sucrose-rich diet (SRdiet), to increase substrate availability, for two weeks while animals on chow served as controls. Neither plasma glucose, insulin nor food intake were significantly different between Slc10a2−/− and respective wt control group, for both diet types used (data not shown). Likewise, a densitometric x-ray analysis (DEXA) did not reveal any significant changes in body composition of Slc10a2−/− animals as compared to wt controls (not shown). The hepatic TG content tended to be lower in Slc10a2−/− mice fed regular chow (\nFIG. 4A\n). This difference was more evident on the SR diet; hepatic TGs increased by 120% in wt animals, whereas in Slc10a2−/− animals this increase was significantly blunted (\nFIG. 4A\n). Also, hepatic cholesterol was lower in Slc10a2−/− mice fed the SR diet compared to wt controls on this diet (Fig.4A). Since the lower hepatic TG levels in Slc10a2−/− mice could be due to decreased fatty acid synthesis the mRNA levels of ACL, ACC, FAS and SCD1 by qRT PCR were measured The gene expression of these enzymes was reduced in the livers of Slc10a2−/− animals (\nFIG. 4B\n); this finding was more pronounced when animals were challenged with the SR diet. The transcription factor SREBP1c is crucial for optimal activation of most genes in the fatty acid synthesis pathways (23). The protein expression of SREBP1c (mature and precursor form) was reduced in the Slc10a2−/− mice, as evaluated by Western blot on cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions using an antibody against the N′-terminus of SREBP1c (\nFIG. 4C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisruption of BA Circulation Alters the Expression of Genes Involved in Hepatic Glucose Handling\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHepatic TG synthesis is dependent on substrate flow in the glycolytic pathway and thus on the activity and gene expression of glucose metabolizing enzymes (24). The mRNA levels of the hepatic glycolytic enzyme glucokinase (GK) were unaltered in Slc10a2−/− animals as compared to wt controls both on chow and on the SR diet (\nFIG. 4D\n). However, the mRNA levels of liver pyruvate kinase (LPK) were reduced by 30% in Slc10a2−/− on chow (\nFIG. 4D\n). Interestingly, feeding the SR diet to Slc10a2−/− mice resulted in a 4.3-fold upregulation of LPK mRNA from basal levels, whereas in wt control animals there was a more modest 1.8-fold stimulation under the same conditions. Determination of the NADPH generating enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) mRNA showed increased levels inSlc10a2−/− animals as compared to wt mice on regular chow (\nFIG. 4E\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFeeding the SR diet resulted in a three-fold increase of G6PDH mRNA in wt mice whereas in Slc10a2−/− mice there was only a modest 60% increase (\nFIG. 4E\n). It was therefore of interest to also determine if the gene expression of malic enzyme (ME), also part of a NADPH generating step converting malate to pyruvate was changed in Slc10a2−/− livers. As seen from \nFIG. 4E\n, ME mRNA tended to be decreased in Slc10a2−/− mice on regular chow and increased during the SR diet to similar extents in wt and Slc10a2−/− animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of Slc10a2 in ob/ob mice reduces plasma glucose and TGs in conjunction with increased hepatic FGF21 mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough serum glucose in Slc10a2−/− mice was not changed, these animals were hypolipidemic. It was therefore evaluated if beneficial effects could be obtained in ob/ob mice, a model where plasma glucose and TGs are chronically elevated. Ob/ob mice were treated with the specific Slc2a10 inhibitor Example 14 for 11 days. Fasting levels of glucose were reduced by 30% in drug-treated ob/ob mice compared to vehicletreated animals (\nFIG. 5A\n). Likewise, this treatment reduced fasting insulin levels by 50% in drug-treated animals. Also, the total plasma TG levels were reduced by 73% in drug-treated controls, whereas total plasma cholesterol tended to be slightly (16%) increased (\nFIG. 5B\n). It was previously found that the mRNA levels of the hormone FGF21 are increased 10-fold in ob/ob livers compared to that of wt animals (25). In addition, administration of exogenous FGF21 reduces serum TGs, insulin and glucose (26). Interestingly, the hepatic mRNA expression of FGF21 was doubled in mice treated with the Slc10a2 inhibitor (\nFIG. 5C\n). As expected, the hepatic mRNA level of CYP7A1 was increased in drug-treated mice (\nFIG. 5C\n). When the hepatic cholesterol and TG content was analyzed no difference was seen between inhibitor-treated and control animal (\nFIG. 5D\n). To verify Slc10a2 blockade, the mRNA levels of the FXR target genes FGF15, SHP and IBABP were assayed in samples from the distal ileum; they were all significantly reduced in response to treatment as could be expected from a diminished influx of BAs into the distal ileum (\nFIG. 5E\n). The gene expression for FXR was unaltered in the distal ileum following treatment with the Slc10a2 protein inhibitor (\nFIG. 5E\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of Ileal Slc10a2 in ob/ob Mice Reduces SREBP1c and its Target Genes in the Liver\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince dysregulated SREBP1c has been reported to be a major determinant of the increased lipogenic response in ob/ob liver, ultimately leading to reduced hepatic insulin sensitivity, the mRNA expression of hepatic SREBP1c was next analyzed and three of its target genes. In accordance with the reduced SREBP1c levels observed in Slc10a2−/− mice both under basal and SR diet challenge, markedly reduced mRNA levels of SREBP1c were observed in response to treatment (\nFIG. 6A\n). Moreover, the mRNA levels of the SREBP1c liver target genes ACC and FAS were strongly decreased, by 50% and 80%, respectively (\nFIG. 6A\n). However, the SCD1 mRNA level was not significantly altered compared to the vehicle-treated controls (\nFIG. 6A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAltered Expression of Hepatic Glucose Metabolic Genes in Slc10a2-Inhibitor Treated ob/ob Mice\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNext the expression levels of important enzymes for glucose handling in the livers of ob/ob mice treated with Example 14 was investigated. As seen in \nFIG. 6B\n, the mRNA level for GK, the initial step in glycolysis, was increased in treated mice, in line with decreased blood glucose levels. However, in contrast, mRNA for the glycolytic gene LPK was reduced by 30% (\nFIG. 6B\n). A similar result for the LPK mRNA was also found in the Slc10a2−/− livers (\nFIG. 4D\n). Also, the expression of the gluconeogenic genes G6Pase and PEPCK (\nFIG. 6B\n) was analyzed and found that they were both reduced in the inhibitor treated mice, in line with the finding of reduced blood glucose levels in these animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of Slc10a2 reduces Akt and Mek1/2 activity in ob/ob mouse liver\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further study the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed changes in hepatic gene transcription in the inhibitor treated ob/ob mice, the activity of major kinase signal pathways known to be important in hepatic regulation of both glucose metabolism and lipogenesis was examined. Akt has been demonstrated to be a crucial component in regulating the hepatic response to insulin and other circulating factors with capacity to favour glycolysis and lipogenesis, and inhibit luconeogenesis upon food intake. The induction of SREBP 1c transcription by insulin is dependent on an Akt pathway (27). When Akt actvity was evaluated by phosphospecific antibodies, a reduced serine 473 phosphorylation was noted in liver lysates from inhibitor-treated animals (\nFIG. 7A\n). Another kinase pathway activated by the insulin receptor and the \nFGF receptor\n 4/beta-Klotho complex, known as the FGF15 receptors, is the Mek1/2—Erk1/2 pathway. Interestingly, it was found that also these important kinases displayed reduced activation in the ob/ob livers upon Slc10a2 inhibitor treatment.\n\n\n \nConclusions\n\n\n \n \n \nInterruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (BA) increases cholesterol metabolism, thereby stimulating hepatic cholesterol synthesis from acetate. The subsequent reduction of the hepatic acetate pool may alter triglyceride (TG) and glucose metabolism. This was explored in mice genetically deficient of the ileal apical sodium BA transporter (Slc10a2) and in ob/ob mice treated with Example 14 an inhibitor of Slc10a2. Plasma TG levels were reduced in Slc10a2 deficient mice, and when challenged with a sucrose-rich diet, they displayed a reduced response in hepatic TG production as observed from the mRNA levels for key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis, ACL, ACC, FAS, SCD1. This effect was paralleled by a diminished induction of mature SREBP1c. Consistently, pharmacologic inhibition of Slc10a2 in diabetic ob/ob mice reduced serum glucose, insulin and TGs, as well as hepatic mRNA levels of SREBP1c and its target genes ACC and FAS. These responses are contrary to those reported following treatment of ob/ob or db/db mice with a BA binding resin. Moreover, when key metabolic signal transduction intermediates in the liver were investigated, it was found that the Mek1/2-Erk1/2 pathway together with Akt were blunted in ob/ob mice after treatment with the Slc10a2 inhibitor. It is concluded that abrogation of Slc10a2 reduces hepatic SREBP1c activity and serum TGs, and in the diabetic ob/ob model also reduces glucose and insulin levels. Hence, targeting Slc10a2 may be a strategy to treat hypertriglyceridemia and diabetes.\n\n\n \nExample  17  \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a Phase Ilb, Double-blind, Randomised, Placebo-controlled, Multi-centre, Dose-finding,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEfficacy and Safety of a Range of Doses of the substance according to Example 14 in Patients with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation in addition also have glucose values above Upper limit of normal (ULN), treated for 56 days.

In certain embodiments, these cyclodextrin-containing polymers improve drug stability and/or solubility, and/or reduce toxicity, and/or improve efficacy of the topoisomerase inhibitor when used in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, by selecting from a variety of linker groups that link or couple CDP to a topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative, and/or targeting ligands, the rate of drug release from the polymers can be attenuated for controlled delivery. The invention also relates to methods of treating subjects with compositions described herein. The invention further relates to methods for conducting a pharmaceutical business comprising manufacturing, licensing, or distributing kits containing or relating to the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore generally, the present invention provides water-soluble, biocompatible polymer conjugates comprising a water-soluble, biocompatible polymer covalently attached to the topoisomerase inhibitor through attachments that are cleaved under biological conditions to release the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymeric conjugates featured in the methods described herein may be useful to improve solubility and/or stability of a bioactive/therapeutic agent, such as camptothecin, reduce drug-drug interactions, reduce interactions with blood elements including plasma proteins, reduce or eliminate immunogenicity, protect the agent from metabolism, modulate drug-release kinetics, improve circulation time, improve drug half-life (e.g., in the serum, or in selected tissues, such as tumors), attenuate toxicity, improve efficacy, normalize drug metabolism across subjects of different species, ethnicities, and/or races, and/or provide for targeted delivery into specific cells or tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative. The term “camptothecin derivative”, as used herein, includes camptothecin analogues and metabolites of camptothecin.

Exemplary cyclodextrin moieties include cyclic structures consisting essentially of from 7 to 9 saccharide moieties, such as cyclodextrin and oxidized cyclodextrin. A cyclodextrin moiety optionally comprises a linker moiety that forms a covalent linkage between the cyclic structure and the polymer backbone, preferably having from 1 to 20 atoms in the chain, such as alkyl chains, including dicarboxylic acid derivatives (such as glutaric acid derivatives, succinic acid derivatives, and the like), and heteroalkyl chains, such as oligoethylene glycol chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCyclodextrins are cyclic polysaccharides containing naturally occurring D-(+)-glucopyranose units in an α-(1,4) linkage. The most common cyclodextrins are alpha ((α)-cyclodextrins, beta (β)-cyclodextrins and gamma (γ)-cyclodextrins which contain, respectively six, seven, or eight glucopyranose units. Structurally, the cyclic nature of a cyclodextrin forms a torus or donut-like shape having an inner apolar or hydrophobic cavity, the secondary hydroxyl groups situated on one side of the cyclodextrin torus and the primary hydroxyl groups situated on the other. Thus, using (β)-cyclodextrin as an example, a cyclodextrin is often represented schematically as follows.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe side on which the secondary hydroxyl groups are located has a wider diameter than the side on which the primary hydroxyl groups are located. The present invention contemplates covalent linkages to cyclodextrin moieties on the primary and/or secondary hydroxyl groups. The hydrophobic nature of the cyclodextrin inner cavity allows for host-guest inclusion complexes of a variety of compounds, e.g., adamantane.

In still other embodiments, linker groups with one or more terminal hydroxyl, thiol, or amino groups may be incorporated into the polymer. In preferred embodiments, one or more of these terminal hydroxyl groups may be capped by covalently attaching them to a therapeutic agent, a targeting moiety, or a cyclodextrin moiety via an (thio)ester, amide, carbonate, carbamate, thiocarbonate, or thiocarbamate bond. In certain embodiments, these (thio)ester, amide, (thio)carbonate or (thio)carbamates bonds may be biohydrolyzable, i.e., capable of being hydrolyzed under biological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a linker group represents a hydrocarbylene group wherein one or more methylene groups is optionally replaced by a group Y (provided that none of the Y groups are adjacent to each other), wherein each Y, independently for each occurrence, is selected from, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, or —O—, C(═X) (wherein X is NR\n1\n, O or S), —C(═O)O, —NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\nCO—, —C(O)NR\n1\n—, —S(O)\nn\n— (wherein n is 0, 1, or 2), —OC(O)—NR\n1\n, —NR\n1\n—C(O)—NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\n—C(NR\n1\n)—NR\n1\n—, and —B(OR\n1\n)—; and R\n1\n, independently for each occurrence, represents H or a lower alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a linker group, e.g., between a topoisomerase inhibitor and the CDP, comprises a self-cyclizing moiety. In certain embodiments, a linker group, e.g., between a topoisomerase inhibitor and the CDP, comprises a selectivity-determining moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, a linker group, e.g., between a topoisomerase inhibitor and the CDP, comprises a self-cyclizing moiety and a selectivity-determining moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the topoisomerase inhibitor or targeting ligand is covalently bonded to the linker group via a biohydrolyzable bond (e.g., an ester, amide, carbonate, carbamate, or a phosphate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the CDP comprises cyclodextrin moieties that alternate with linker moieties in the polymer chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the linker moieties are attached to topoisomerase inhibitors or prodrugs thereof that are cleaved under biological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, at least one linker that connects the topoisomerase inhibitor or prodrug thereof to the polymer comprises a group represented by the formula\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\nP is phosphorus;\n\n\nO is oxygen;\n\n\nE represents oxygen or Ne;\n\n\nK represents hydrocarbyl;\n\n\nX is selected from OR\n42 \nor Nee; and\n\n\nR\n40\n, R\n41\n, R\n42\n, R\n43\n, and R\n44 \nindependently represent hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, E is NR\n40 \nand R\n40 \nis hydrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, K is lower alkylene (e.g., ethylene).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, at least one linker comprises a group selected from\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, X is OR\n42\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the linker group comprises an amino acid or peptide, or derivative thereof (e.g., a glycine or cysteine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the linker is connected to the topoisomerase inhibitor through a hydroxyl group. In certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the linker is connected to the topoisomerase inhibitor through an amino group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the linker group that connects to the topoisomerase inhibitor may comprise a self-cyclizing moiety, or a selectivity-determining moiety, or both. In certain embodiments, the selectivity-determining moiety is a moiety that promotes selectivity in the cleavage of the bond between the selectivity-determining moiety and the self-cyclizing moiety. Such a moiety may, for example, promote enzymatic cleavage between the selectivity-determining moiety and the self-cyclizing moiety. Alternatively, such a moiety may promote cleavage between the selectivity-determining moiety and the self-cyclizing moiety under acidic conditions or basic conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, any of the linker groups may comprise a self-cyclizing moiety or a selectivity-determining moiety, or both. In certain embodiments, the selectivity-determining moiety may be bonded to the self-cyclizing moiety between the self-cyclizing moiety and the polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, any of the linker groups may independently be or include an alkyl chain, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, polysuccinic anhydride, poly-L-glutamic acid, poly(ethyleneimine), an oligosaccharide, an amino acid chain, or any other suitable linkage. In certain embodiments, the linker group itself can be stable under physiological conditions, such as an alkyl chain, or it can be cleavable under physiological conditions, such as by an enzyme (e.g., the linkage contains a peptide sequence that is a substrate for a peptidase), or by hydrolysis (e.g., the linkage contains a hydrolyzable group, such as an ester or thioester). The linker groups can be biologically inactive, such as a PEG, polyglycolic acid, or polylactic acid chain, or can be biologically active, such as an oligo- or polypeptide that, when cleaved from the moieties, binds a receptor, deactivates an enzyme, etc. Various oligomeric linker groups that are biologically compatible and/or bioerodible are known in the art, and the selection of the linkage may influence the ultimate properties of the material, such as whether it is durable when implanted, whether it gradually deforms or shrinks after implantation, or whether it gradually degrades and is absorbed by the body. The linker group may be attached to the moieties by any suitable bond or functional group, including carbon-carbon bonds, esters, ethers, amides, amines, carbonates, carbamates, sulfonamides, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, any of the linker groups may independently be an alkyl group wherein one or more methylene groups is optionally replaced by a group Y (provided that none of the Y groups are adjacent to each other), wherein each Y, independently for each occurrence, is selected from aryl, heteroaryl, carbocyclyl, heterocyclyl, or —O—, C(═X) (wherein X is NR\n1\n, O or S), —OC(O)—, —C(═O)O—, —NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\nCO—, —C(O)NR\n1\n—, —S(O)\nn\n— (wherein n is 0, 1, or 2), —OC(O)—NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\n—C(O)—NR\n1\n—, —NR\n1\n—C(NR\n1\n)—NR\n1\n—, and —B(OR\n1\n)—; and R\n1\n, independently for each occurrence, is H or lower alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the present invention contemplates a CDP, wherein a plurality of topoisomerase inhibitors are covalently attached to the polymer through attachments that are cleaved under biological conditions to release the therapeutic agents as discussed above, wherein administration of the polymer to a subject results in release of the therapeutic agent over a period of at least 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 24, 36, 48 or even 72 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the conjugation of the topoisomerase inhibitor to the CDP improves the aqueous solubility of the topoisomerase inhibitor and hence the bioavailability. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention, the topoisomerase inhibitor has a log P>0.4, >0.6, >0.8, >1, >2, >3, >4, or even >5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate of the present invention preferably has a molecular weight in the range of 10,000 to 500,000; 30,000 to 200,000; or even 70,000 to 150,000 amu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the present invention contemplates attenuating the rate of release of the topoisomerase inhibitor by introducing various tether and/or linking groups between the therapeutic agent and the polymer. Thus, in certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates of the present invention are compositions for controlled delivery of the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDP-Topoisomerase Inhibitor Conjugate Characteristics\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP and/or CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition as described herein have polydispersities less than about 3, or even less than about 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention provides an improved delivery of certain topoisomerase inhibitor by covalently attaching one or more topoisomerase inhibitors to a CDP. Such conjugation can improve the aqueous solubility and hence the bioavailability of the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein preferably have molecular weights in the range of 10,000 to 500,000; 30,000 to 200,000; or even 70,000 to 150,000 amu. In certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the compound has a number average (M\nn\n) molecular weight between 1,000 to 500,000 amu, or between 5,000 to 200,000 amu, or between 10,000 to 100,000 amu. One method to determine molecular weight is by gel permeation chromatography (“GPC”), e.g., mixed bed columns, CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nsolvent, light scattering detector, and off-line do/dc. Other methods are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is biodegradable or bioerodable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments as disclosed herein, the topoisomerase inhibitor, e.g., the camptothecin, camptothecin derivative, or prodrug thereof makes up at least 3% (e.g., at least about 5%) by weight of the polymer. In certain embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor, e.g., the camptothecin, camptothecin derivative or prodrug thereof makes up at least 20% by weight of the compound. In certain embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor, e.g., the camptothecin, camptothecin derivative or prodrug thereof makes up at least 5%, 10%, 15%, or at least 20% by weight of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions of the present invention may be useful to improve solubility and/or stability of the topoisomerase inhibitor, reduce drug-drug interactions, reduce interactions with blood elements including plasma proteins, reduce or eliminate immunogenicity, protect the topoisomerase inhibitor from metabolism, modulate drug-release kinetics, improve circulation time, improve topoisomerase inhibitor half-life (e.g., in the serum, or in selected tissues, such as tumors), attenuate toxicity, improve efficacy, normalize topoisomerase inhibitor metabolism across subjects of different species, ethnicities, and/or races, and/or provide for targeted delivery into specific cells or tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be a flexible or flowable material. When the CDP used is itself flowable, the CDP composition of the invention, even when viscous, need not include a biocompatible solvent to be flowable, although trace or residual amounts of biocompatible solvents may still be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile it is possible that the biodegradable polymer or the biologically active agent may be dissolved in a small quantity of a solvent that is non-toxic to more efficiently produce an amorphous, monolithic distribution or a fine dispersion of the biologically active agent in the flexible or flowable composition, it is an advantage of the invention that, in a preferred embodiment, no solvent is needed to form a flowable composition. Moreover, the use of solvents is preferably avoided because, once a polymer composition containing solvent is placed totally or partially within the body, the solvent dissipates or diffuses away from the polymer and must be processed and eliminated by the body, placing an extra burden on the body's clearance ability at a time when the illness (and/or other treatments for the illness) may have already deleteriously affected it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, when a solvent is used to facilitate mixing or to maintain the flowability of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, it should be non-toxic, otherwise biocompatible, and should be used in relatively small amounts. Solvents that are toxic should not be used in any material to be placed even partially within a living body. Such a solvent also must not cause substantial tissue irritation or necrosis at the site of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable biocompatible solvents, when used, include N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, ethanol, propylene glycol, acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, caprolactam, oleic acid, or 1-dodecylazacylcoheptanone. Preferred solvents include N-methylpyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide, and acetone because of their solvating ability and their biocompatibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions are soluble in one or more common organic solvents for ease of fabrication and processing. Common organic solvents include such solvents as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, 2-butanone, butyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, acetone, ethyl acetate, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein, upon contact with body fluids, undergo gradual degradation. The life of a biodegradable polymer in vivo depends upon, among other things, its molecular weight, crystallinity, biostability, and the degree of crosslinking. In general, the greater the molecular weight, the higher the degree of crystallinity, and the greater the biostability, the slower biodegradation will be.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a subject composition is formulated with a topoisomerase inhibitor or other material, release of the topoisomerase inhibitor or other material for a sustained or extended period as compared to the release from an isotonic saline solution generally results. Such release profile may result in prolonged delivery (over, say 1 to about 2,000 hours, or alternatively about 2 to about 800 hours) of effective amounts (e.g., about 0.0001 mg/kg/hour to about 10 mg/kg/hour, e.g., 0.001 mg/kg/hour, 0.01 mg/kg/hour, 0.1 mg/kg/hour, 1.0 mg/kg/hour) of the topoisomerase inhibitor or any other material associated with the polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of factors may affect the desired rate of hydrolysis of CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions, the desired softness and flexibility of the resulting solid matrix, rate and extent of bioactive material release. Some of such factors include the selection/identity of the various subunits, the enantiomeric or diastereomeric purity of the monomeric subunits, homogeneity of subunits found in the polymer, and the length of the polymer. For instance, the present invention contemplates heteropolymers with varying linkages, and/or the inclusion of other monomeric elements in the polymer, in order to control, for example, the rate of biodegradation of the matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo illustrate further, a wide range of degradation rates may be obtained by adjusting the hydrophobicities of the backbones or side chains of the polymers while still maintaining sufficient biodegradability for the use intended for any such polymer. Such a result may be achieved by varying the various functional groups of the polymer. For example, the combination of a hydrophobic backbone and a hydrophilic linkage produces heterogeneous degradation because cleavage is encouraged whereas water penetration is resisted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne protocol generally accepted in the field that may be used to determine the release rate of a therapeutic agent such as a topoisomerase inhibitor or other material loaded in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles or compositions of the present invention involves degradation of any such matrix in a 0.1 M PBS solution (pH 7.4) at 37° C., an assay known in the art. For purposes of the present invention, the term “PBS protocol” is used herein to refer to such protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the release rates of different CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions of the present invention may be compared by subjecting them to such a protocol. In certain instances, it may be necessary to process polymeric systems in the same fashion to allow direct and relatively accurate comparisons of different systems to be made. For example, the present invention teaches several different methods of formulating the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions. Such comparisons may indicate that any one CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition releases incorporated material at a rate from about 2 or less to about 1000 or more times faster than another polymeric system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a comparison may reveal a rate difference of about 3, 5, 7, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 or 750 times. Even higher rate differences are contemplated by the present invention and release rate protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, when formulated in a certain manner, the release rate for CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions of the present invention may present as mono- or bi-phasic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelease of any material incorporated into the polymer matrix, which is often provided as a microsphere, may be characterized in certain instances by an initial increased release rate, which may release from about 5 to about 50% or more of any incorporated material, or alternatively about 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or 40%, followed by a release rate of lesser magnitude.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe release rate of any incorporated material may also be characterized by the amount of such material released per day per mg of polymer matrix. For example, in certain embodiments, the release rate may vary from about 1 ng or less of any incorporated material per day per mg of polymeric system to about 500 or more ng/day/mg. Alternatively, the release rate may be about 0.05, 0.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500 ng/day/mg. In still other embodiments, the release rate of any incorporated material may be 10,000 ng/day/mg, or even higher. In certain instances, materials incorporated and characterized by such release rate protocols may include therapeutic agents, fillers, and other substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the rate of release of any material from any CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition of the present invention may be presented as the half-life of such material in the matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the embodiment involving protocols for in vitro determination of release rates, in vivo protocols, whereby in certain instances release rates for polymeric systems may be determined in vivo, are also contemplated by the present invention. Other assays useful for determining the release of any material from the polymers of the present system are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhysical Structures of the CDP-Topoisomerase Inhibitor Conjugates, Particles and Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions may be formed in a variety of shapes. For example, in certain embodiments, CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates may be presented in the form of microparticles or nanoparticles. Microspheres typically comprise a biodegradable polymer matrix incorporating a drug. Microspheres can be formed by a wide variety of techniques known to those of skill in the art. Examples of microsphere forming techniques include, but are not limited to, (a) phase separation by emulsification and subsequent organic solvent evaporation (including complex emulsion methods such as oil in water emulsions, water in oil emulsions and water-oil-water emulsions); (b) coacervation-phase separation; (c) melt dispersion; (d) interfacial deposition; (e) in situ polymerization; (f) spray drying and spray congealing; (g) air suspension coating; and (h) pan and spray coating. These methods, as well as properties and characteristics of microspheres are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,438,253; U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,441; U.S. Pat. No. 5,100,669; U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,768; U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; U.S. Pat. No. 5,889,110; U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,175; and European Patent 0258780, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo prepare microspheres, several methods can be employed depending upon the desired application of the delivery vehicles. Suitable methods include, but are not limited to, spray drying, freeze drying, air drying, vacuum drying, fluidized-bed drying, milling, co-precipitation and critical fluid extraction. In the case of spray drying, freeze drying, air drying, vacuum drying, fluidized-bed drying and critical fluid extraction; the components (stabilizing polyol, bioactive material, buffers, etc.) are first dissolved or suspended in aqueous conditions. In the case of milling, the components are mixed in the dried form and milled by any method known in the art. In the case of co-precipitation, the components are mixed in organic conditions and processed as described below. Spray drying can be used to load the stabilizing polyol with the bioactive material. The components are mixed under aqueous conditions and dried using precision nozzles to produce extremely uniform droplets in a drying chamber. Suitable spray drying machines include, but are not limited to, Buchi, NIRO, APV and Lab-plant spray driers used according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe shape of microparticles and nanoparticles may be determined by scanning electron microscopy. Spherically shaped nanoparticles are used in certain embodiments, for circulation through the bloodstream. If desired, the particles may be fabricated using known techniques into other shapes that are more useful for a specific application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to intracellular delivery of a topoisomerase inhibitor, it also possible that particles of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, such as microparticles or nanoparticles, may undergo endocytosis, thereby obtaining access to the cell. The frequency of such an endocytosis process will likely depend on the size of any particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the surface charge of the molecule is neutral, or slightly negative. In some embodiments, the zeta potential of the particle surface is from about −80 mV to about 50 mV.\n\n\n \nCDPs, Methods of Making Same, and Methods of Conjugating CDPS to Topoisomerase Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nGenerally, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions described herein can be prepared in one of two ways: monomers bearing topoisomerase inhibitors, targeting ligands, and/or cyclodextrin moieties can be polymerized, or polymer backbones can be derivatized with topoisomerase inhibitors, targeting ligands, and/or cyclodextrin moieties. Exemplary methods of making CDPs and CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,270,808, the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDPs described herein can be made using a variety of methods including those described herein. In some embodiments, a CDP can be made by: providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors; providing comonomer precursors which do not contain cyclodextrin moieties (comonomer precursors); and copolymerizing the said cyclodextrin moiety precursors and comonomer precursors to thereby make a CDP wherein CDP comprises at least four cyclodextrin moieties and at least four comonomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the at least four cyclodextrin moieties and at least four comonomers alternate in the water soluble linear polymer. In some embodiments, the method includes providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors modified to bear one reactive site at each of exactly two positions, and reacting the cyclodextrin moiety precursors with comonomer precursors having exactly two reactive moieties capable of forming a covalent bond with the reactive sites under polymerization conditions that promote reaction of the reactive sites with the reactive moieties to form covalent bonds between the comonomers and the cyclodextrin moieties, whereby a CDP comprising alternating units of a cyclodextrin moiety and a comonomer is produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin momomers comprise linkers to which the topoisomerase inhibitor may be further linked.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the comonomer precursor is a compound containing at least two functional groups through which reaction and thus linkage of the cyclodextrin moieties is achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer precursor comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thio, acyl halide, —HC═CH—, —C≡C— group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the two functional groups are the same and are located at termini of the comonomer precursor. In some embodiments, a comonomer contains one or more pendant groups with at least one functional group through which reaction and thus linkage of a therapeutic agent can be achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer pendant group comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thiol, acyl halide, ethylene, ethyne group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the pendant group is a substituted or unsubstituted branched, cyclic or straight chain C1-C10 alkyl, or arylalkyl optionally containing one or more heteroatoms within the chain or ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moiety comprises an alpha, beta, or gamma cyclodextrin moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP is suitable for the attachment of sufficient topoisomerase inhibitor such that up to at least 3%, 5%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, or even 35% by weight of the CDP, when conjugated, is topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP has a molecular weight of 10,000-500,000 amu. In some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moieties make up at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% or 80% of the CDP by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP of the following formula can be made by the scheme below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R is of the form:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \ncomprising the steps of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nreacting a compound of the formula below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwith a compound of the formula below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein the group\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nhas a Mw of 3.4 kDa or less and n is at least four,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nin the presence of a non-nucleophilic organic base in a solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the solvent is a polar aprotic solvent.

This can be achieved, for example, when less than 100% yield is achieved when coupling the CPT to the polymer and/or when less than an equivalent amount of CPT is used in the reaction. Accordingly, the loading of the topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin, by weight of the polymer, can vary. Therefore, while Scheme XIII depicts CPT at each cysteine residue of each polymer subunit, the CDP-CPT conjugate can have less than 2 CPT molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-CPT conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include two, one or no CPT attached at each cysteine residue of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-CPT conjugates having two, one or no CPT attached at each cysteine residue of each polymer subunit of the CDP-CPT conjugate and the conjugates include a mixture of CDP-CPT conjugates that can vary as to the number of CPTs attached to the gly at each of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate can be made by providing a CDP comprising cyclodextrin moieties and comonomers which do not contain cyclodextrin moieties (comonomers), wherein the cyclodextrin moieties and comonomers alternate in the CDP and wherein the CDP comprises at least four cyclodextrin moieties and at least four comonomers; and attaching a topoisomerase inhibitor to the CDP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more of the topoisomerase inhibitor moieties in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate can be replaced with another therapeutic agent, e.g., another anticancer agent or anti-inflammatory agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer via a linker. In some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer through an attachment that is cleaved under biological conditions to release the topoisomerase inhibitor. In some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer at a cyclodextrin moiety or a comonomer. In some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the water soluble linear polymer via an optional linker to a cyclodextrin moiety or a comonomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moieties comprise linkers to which therapeutic agents are linked.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP is made by a process comprising: providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors, providing comonomer precursors, and copolymerizing said cyclodextrin moiety precursors and comonomer precursors to thereby make a CDP comprising cyclodextrin moieties and comonomers. In some embodiments, the CDP is conjugated with a topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin to provide a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the method includes providing cyclodextrin moiety precursors modified to bear one reactive site at each of exactly two positions, and reacting the cyclodextrin moiety precursors with comonomer precursors having exactly two reactive moieties capable of forming a covalent bond with the reactive sites under polymerization conditions that promote reaction of the reactive sites with the reactive moieties to form covalent bonds between the comonomers and the cyclodextrin moieties, whereby a CDP comprising alternating units of a cyclodextrin moiety and a comonomer is produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is attached to the CDP via a linker. In some embodiments, the linker is cleaved under biological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor makes up at least 5%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, or even 35% by weight of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the comonomer comprises polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 3,400 Da, the cyclodextrin moiety comprises beta-cyclodextrin, the theoretical maximum loading of camptothecin on a CDP-camptothecin conjugate is 13%, and camptothecin is 6-10% by weight of the CDP-camptothecin conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the comonomer precursor is a compound containing at least two functional groups through which reaction and thus linkage of the cyclodextrin moieties is achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer precursor comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thio, acyl halide, —HC═CH—, —C≡C— group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the two functional groups are the same and are located at termini of the comonomer precursor. In some embodiments, a comonomer contains one or more pendant groups with at least one functional group through which reaction and thus linkage of a therapeutic agent is achieved. In some embodiments, the functional groups, which may be the same or different, terminal or internal, of each comonomer pendant group comprise an amino, acid, imidazole, hydroxyl, thiol, acyl halide, ethylene, ethyne group, or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the pendant group is a substituted or unsubstituted branched, cyclic or straight chain C1-C10 alkyl, or arylalkyl optionally containing one or more heteroatoms within the chain or ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moiety comprises an alpha, beta, or gamma cyclodextrin moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the topoisomerase inhibitor is poorly soluble in water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition to a subject results in release of the topoisomerase inhibitor over a period of at least 6 hours. In some embodiments, administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition to a subject results in release of the topoisomerase inhibitor over a period of 6 hours to a month. In some embodiments, upon administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition to a subject the rate of topoisomerase inhibitor release is dependent primarily upon the rate of hydrolysis as opposed to enzymatic cleavage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition has a molecular weight of 10,000-500,000 amu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cyclodextrin moieties make up at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% or 80% of the polymer by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP-polymer conjugate of the following formula can be made as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nproviding a polymer below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand coupling the polymer with a plurality of L-D moieties, wherein L is a linker, or absent and D is topoisomerase inhibitor such as camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative, to provide:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein the group\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nhas a Mw of 3.4 kDa or less and n is at least 4, wherein on the final product, L can be a linker, a bond, or OH, and D can be a topoisomerase inhibitor (e.g., camptothecin or a camptothecin derivative) or absent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more of the topoisomerase inhibitor moieties in the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate can be replaced with another therapeutic agent, e.g., another anticancer agent or anti-inflammatory agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction scheme as provided above includes embodiments where L-D is absent in one or more positions as provided above. This can be achieved, for example, when less than 100% yield is achieved when coupling the topoisomerase inhibitor-linker to the polymer and/or when less than an equivalent amount of topoisomerase inhibitor-linker is used in the reaction. Accordingly, the loading of the topoisomerase inhibitor, by weight of the polymer, can vary, for example, the loading of the topoisomerase inhibitor can be at least about 3% by weight, e.g., at least about 5%, at least about 8%, at least about 10%, at least about 11%, at least about 12%, at least about 13%, at least about 14%, at least about 15%, or at least about 20%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, at least a portion of the L moieties of L-D is absent. In some embodiments, each L is independently an amino acid or derivative thereof (e.g., glycine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the coupling of the polymer with the plurality of L-D moieties results in the formation of a plurality of amide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the CDPs are random copolymers, in which the different subunits and/or other monomeric units are distributed randomly throughout the polymer chain. Thus, where the formula X\nm\n—Y\nn\n—Z\no \nappears, wherein X, Y and Z are polymer subunits, these subunits may be randomly interspersed throughout the polymer backbone. In part, the term “random” is intended to refer to the situation in which the particular distribution or incorporation of monomeric units in a polymer that has more than one type of monomeric units is not directed or controlled directly by the synthetic protocol, but instead results from features inherent to the polymer system, such as the reactivity, amounts of subunits and other characteristics of the synthetic reaction or other methods of manufacture, processing, or treatment.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a composition, e.g., a pharmaceutical composition, comprising a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate or particle and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or adjuvant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition may include a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound described herein, e.g., a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acid salts include acetate, adipate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, butyrate, citrate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, formate, fumarate, glycolate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, palmoate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, salicylate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, tosylate and undecanoate. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N-(alkyl)\n4\n \n+\n salts. This invention also envisions the quaternization of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds described herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such quaternization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gailate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition may include a liquid used for suspending a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, which may be any liquid solution compatible with the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, which is also suitable to be used in pharmaceutical compositions, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic liquid. Suitable suspending liquids including but are not limited to suspending liquids selected from the group consisting of water, aqueous sucrose syrups, corn syrups, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition described herein may also include another component, such as an antioxidant, antibacterial, buffer, bulking agent, chelating agent, an inert gas, a tonicity agent and/or a viscosity agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is provided in lyophilized form and is reconstituted prior to administration to a subject. The lyophilized CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be reconstituted by a diluent solution, such as a salt or saline solution, e.g., a sodium chloride solution having a pH between 6 and 9, lactated Ringer's injection solution, or a commercially available diluent, such as PLASMA-LYTE A Injection pH 7.4® (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a lyophilized formulation includes a lyoprotectant or stabilizer to maintain physical and chemical stability by protecting the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition from damage from crystal formation and the fusion process during freeze-drying. The lyoprotectant or stabilizer can be one or more of polyethylene glycol (PEG), a PEG lipid conjugate (e.g., PEG-ceramide or D-alpha-\ntocopheryl polyethylene glycol\n 1000 succinate), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), polyoxyethylene esters, poloxomers, Tweens, lecithins, saccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and polyols (e.g., trehalose, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, sucrose, glucose and dextran), salts and crown ethers. In one embodiment, the lyoprotectant is mannitol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the lyophilized CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is reconstituted with a mixture of equal parts by volume of Dehydrated Alcohol, USP and a nonionic surfactant, such as a polyoxyethylated castor oil surfactant available from GAF Corporation, Mount Olive, N.J., under the trademark, Cremophor EL. In some embodiments, the lyophilized CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is reconstituted in water for infusion. The lyophilized product and vehicle for reconstitution can be packaged separately in appropriately light-protected vials, e.g., amber or other colored vials. To minimize the amount of surfactant in the reconstituted solution, only a sufficient amount of the vehicle may be provided to form a solution having a concentration of about 2 mg/mL to about 4 mg/mL of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. Once dissolution of the drug is achieved, the resulting solution is further diluted prior to injection with a suitable parenteral diluent. Such diluents are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These diluents are generally available in clinical facilities. It is, however, within the scope of the present invention to package the subject CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition with a third vial containing sufficient parenteral diluent to prepare the final concentration for administration. A typical diluent is Lactated Ringer's Injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe final dilution of the reconstituted CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be carried out with other preparations having similar utility, for example, 5% Dextrose Injection, Lactated Ringer's and Dextrose for Injection (D5W), Sterile Water for Injection, and the like. However, because of its narrow pH range, pH 6.0 to 7.5, Lactated Ringer's Injection is most typical. Per 100 mL, Lactated Ringer's Injection contains Sodium Chloride USP 0.6 g, Sodium Lactate 0.31 g, Potassium chloride USP 0.03 g and Calcium Chloride2H2O USP 0.02 g. The osmolarity is 275 mOsmol/L, which is very close to isotonicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The dosage form can be, e.g., in a bog, e.g., a bag for infusion or intraperitoneal administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 1 percent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 percent to about 70 percent, most preferably from about 10 percent to about 30 percent.\n\n\n \nRoutes of Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be administered orally, parenterally (e.g., via intravenous, subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional or intracranial injection), topically, mucosally (e.g., rectally or vaginally), nasally, buccally, ophthalmically, via inhalation spray (e.g., delivered via nebulzation, propellant or a dry powder device) or via an implanted reservoir. Typically, the compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions. The preferred mode of administration is, e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate(s), particle(s) or composition(s) in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the agent from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition in an oil vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, gums, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouthwashes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of an agent as an active ingredient. A compound may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered peptide or peptidomimetic moistened with an inert liquid diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTablets, and other solid dosage forms, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuspensions, in addition to the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for topical administration are useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical application. For application topically to the skin, the pharmaceutical composition should be formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the a particle described herein include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated with a suitable lotion or cream containing the active particle suspended or dissolved in a carrier with suitable emulsifying agents. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, \npolysorbate\n 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by rectal suppository formulation or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches are also included herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration. Suppositories may be prepared by mixing one or more CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein with one or more suitable non-irritating excipients which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature. The composition will therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. Such materials include, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate. Compositions of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOphthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosages and Dosing Regimens\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular subject, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered to a subject at a dosage of, e.g., about 1 to 40 mg/m\n2\n, about 3 to 35 mg/m\n2\n, about 9 to 40 mg/m\n2\n, e.g., about 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 mg/m\n2 \nof the topoisomerase inhibitor. Administration can be at regular intervals, such as weekly, or every 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 weeks. The administration can be over a period of from about 10 minutes to about 6 hours, e.g., from about 30 minutes to about 2 hours, from about 45 minutes to 90 minutes, e.g., about 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours or more. The CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be administered, e.g., by intravenous or intraperitoneal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered as a bolus infusion or intravenous push, e.g., over a period of 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes or less.

The informational material can also be provided in any combination of formats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein, the composition of the kit can include other ingredients, such as a surfactant, a lyoprotectant or stabilizer, an antioxidant, an antibacterial agent, a bulking agent, a chelating agent, an inert gas, a tonicity agent and/or a viscosity agent, a solvent or buffer, a stabilizer, a preservative, a flavoring agent (e.g., a bitter antagonist or a sweetener), a fragrance, a dye or coloring agent, for example, to tint or color one or more components in the kit, or other cosmetic ingredient, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or a second agent for treating a condition or disorder described herein. Alternatively, the other ingredients can be included in the kit, but in different compositions or containers than a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein. In such embodiments, the kit can include instructions for admixing a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein and the other ingredients, or for using a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein together with the other ingredients. For example, the kit can include an agent which reduces or inhibits one or more symptom of hypersensitivity, a polysaccharide, and/or an agent which increases urinary excretion and/or neutralizes one or more urinary metabolite.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the kit includes a second therapeutic agent, such as a second chemotherapeutic agent, e.g., a chemotherapeutic agent or combination of chemotherapeutic agents described herein. In one embodiment, the second agent is in lyophilized or in liquid form. In one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and the second therapeutic agent are in separate containers, and in another embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and the second therapeutic agent are packaged in the same container.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a component of the kit is stored in a sealed vial, e.g., with a rubber or silicone closure (e.g., a polybutadiene or polyisoprene closure). In some embodiments, a component of the kit is stored under inert conditions (e.g., under Nitrogen or another inert gas such as Argon). In some embodiments, a component of the kit is stored under anhydrous conditions (e.g., with a desiccant). In some embodiments, a component of the kit is stored in a light blocking container such as an amber vial.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein can be provided in any form, e.g., liquid, frozen, dried or lyophilized form. It is preferred that a composition including the conjugate, particle or composition, e.g., a composition comprising a particle or particles that include a conjugate described herein be substantially pure and/or sterile. When a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein is provided in a liquid solution, the liquid solution preferably is an aqueous solution, with a sterile aqueous solution being preferred. In one embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is provided in lyophilized form and, optionally, a diluent solution is provided for reconstituting the lyophilized agent. The diluent can include for example, a salt or saline solution, e.g., a sodium chloride solution having a pH between 6 and 9, lactated Ringer's injection solution, D5W, or PLASMA-LYTE A Injection pH 7.4® (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kit can include one or more containers for the composition containing a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein. In some embodiments, the kit contains separate containers, dividers or compartments for the composition and informational material. For example, the composition can be contained in a bottle, vial, IV admixture bag, IV infusion set, piggyback set or syringe, and the informational material can be contained in a plastic sleeve or packet. In other embodiments, the separate elements of the kit are contained within a single, undivided container. For example, the composition is contained in a bottle, vial or syringe that has attached thereto the informational material in the form of a label. In some embodiments, the kit includes a plurality (e.g., a pack) of individual containers, each containing one or more unit dosage forms (e.g., a dosage form described herein) of a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition described herein. For example, the kit includes a plurality of syringes, ampules, foil packets, or blister packs, each containing a single unit dose of a particle described herein. The containers of the kits can be air tight, waterproof (e.g., impermeable to changes in moisture or evaporation), and/or light-tight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kit optionally includes a device suitable for administration of the composition, e.g., a syringe, inhalant, pipette, forceps, measured spoon, dropper (e.g., eye dropper), swab (e.g., a cotton swab or wooden swab), or any such delivery device. In one embodiment, the device is a medical implant device, e.g., packaged for surgical insertion.\n\n\n \nCombination Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be used in combination with other known therapies. Administered “in combination”, as used herein, means that two (or more) different treatments are delivered to the subject during the course of the subject's affliction with the disorder, e.g., the two or more treatments are delivered after the subject has been diagnosed with the disorder and before the disorder has been cured or eliminated or treatment has ceased for other reasons. In some embodiments, the delivery of one treatment is still occurring when the delivery of the second begins, so that there is overlap in terms of administration. This is sometimes referred to herein as “simultaneous” or “concurrent delivery”. In other embodiments, the delivery of one treatment ends before the delivery of the other treatment begins. In some embodiments of either case, the treatment is more effective because of combined administration. For example, the second treatment is more effective, e.g., an equivalent effect is seen with less of the second treatment, or the second treatment reduces symptoms to a greater extent, than would be seen if the second treatment were administered in the absence of the first treatment, or the analogous situation is seen with the first treatment. In some embodiments, delivery is such that the reduction in a symptom, or other parameter related to the disorder is greater than what would be observed with one treatment delivered in the absence of the other. The effect of the two treatments can be partially additive, wholly additive, or greater than additive. The delivery can be such that an effect of the first treatment delivered is still detectable when the second is delivered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and the at least one additional therapeutic agent can be administered simultaneously, in the same or in separate compositions, or sequentially. For sequential administration, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be administered first, and the additional agent can be administered second, or the order of administration can be reversed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with other therapeutic treatment modalities, including surgery, radiation, cryosurgery, and/or thermotherapy. Such combination therapies may advantageously utilize lower dosages of the administered agent and/or other chemotherapeutic agent, thus avoiding possible toxicities or complications associated with the various monotherapies. The phrase “radiation” includes, but is not limited to, external-beam therapy which involves three dimensional, conformal radiation therapy where the field of radiation is designed to conform to the volume of tissue treated; interstitial-radiation therapy where seeds of radioactive compounds are implanted using ultrasound guidance; and a combination of external-beam therapy and interstitial-radiation therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered with at least one additional therapeutic agent, such as a chemotherapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agent, e.g., with one or more chemotherapeutic agents described herein.

For example, cystisis can be mitigated or treated with MESNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiarrhea may be treated with antidiarrheal agents including, but not limited to opioids (e.g., codeine (Codicept®, Coducept®), oxicodeine, percocet, paregoric, tincture of opium, diphenoxylate (Lomotil®), diflenoxin), and loperamide (Imodium A-D®), bismuth subsalicylate, lanreotide, vapreotide (Sanvar®, Sanvar MC1), motiln antagonists, COX2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib (Celebrex®), glutamine (NutreStore®), thalidomide (Synovir®, Thalomid®), traditional antidiarrhea remedies (e.g., kaolin, pectin, berberine and muscarinic agents), octreotide and DPP-IV inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDPP-IV inhibitors employed in the present invention are generically and specifically disclosed in PCT Publication Nos.: WO 98/19998, DE 196 16 486 A1, WO 00/34241 and WO 95/15309.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNausea and vomiting may be treated with antiemetic agents such as dexamethasone (Aeroseb-Dex®, Alba-Dex®, Decaderm®, Decadrol®, Decadron®, Decasone®, Decaspray®, Deenar®, Deronil®, Dex-4®, Dexace®, Dexameth®, Dezone®, Gammacorten®, Hexadrol®, Maxidex®, Sk-Dexamethasone®), metoclopramide (Reglan®), diphenylhydramine (Benadryl®, SK− Diphenhydramine®), lorazepam (Ativan®), ondansetron (Zofran®), prochlorperazine (Bayer A 173®, Buccastem®, Capazine®, Combid®, Compazine®, Compro®, Emelent®, Emetiral®, Eskatrol®, Kronocin®, Meterazin®, Meterazin Maleate®, Meterazine®, Nipodal®, Novamin®, Pasotomin®, Phenotil®, Stemetil®, Stemzine®, Tementil®, Temetid®, Vertigon®), thiethylperazine (Norzine®, Torecan®), and dronabinol (Marinol®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with an immunosuppressive agent. Immunosuppressive agents suitable for the combination include, but are not limited to natalizumab (Tysabri®), azathioprine (Imuran®), mitoxantrone (Novantrone®), mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept®), cyclosporins (e.g., Cyclosporin A (Neoral®, Sandimmun®, Sandimmune®, SangCya®), cacineurin inhibitors (e.g., Tacrolimus (Prograf®, Protopic®), sirolimus (Rapamune®), everolimus (Afinitor®), cyclophosphamide (Clafen®, Cytoxan®, Neosar®), or methotrexate (Abitrexate®, Folex®, Methotrexate®, Mexate®)), fingolimod, mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept®), mycophenolic acid (Myfortic®), anti-CD3 antibody, anti-CD25 antibody (e.g., Basiliximab (Simulect®) or daclizumab (Zenapax®)), and anti-TNFα antibody (e.g., Infliximab (Remicade®) or adalimumab (Humira®)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole (Nizoral®, Xolegel®), itraconazole (Sporanox®), clarithromycin (Biaxin®), atazanavir (Reyataz®), nefazodone (Serzone®, Nefadar®), saquinavir (Invirase®), telithromycin (Ketek®), ritonavir (Norvir®), amprenavir (also known as Agenerase, a prodrug version is fosamprenavir (Lexiva®, Telzir®), indinavir (Crixivan®), nelfinavir (Viracept®), delavirdine (Rescriptor®) or voriconazole (Vfend®)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen employing the methods or compositions, other agents used in the modulation of tumor growth or metastasis in a clinical setting, such as antiemetics, can also be administered as desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen formulating the pharmaceutical compositions featured in the invention the clinician may utilize preferred dosages as warranted by the condition of the subject being treated. For example, in one embodiment, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be administered at a dosing schedule described herein, e.g., once every one, two, three or four weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in general, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and an additional chemotherapeutic agent(s) do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. For example, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be administered intravenously while the chemotherapeutic agent(s) may be administered orally. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered once every three weeks and an additional therapeutic agent (or additional therapeutic agents) may also be administered every three weeks for as long as treatment is required. Examples of other chemotherapeutic agents which are administered one every three weeks include: an antimetabolite (e.g., floxuridine (FUDF®), pemetrexed (ALIMTA®), 5FU (Adrucil®, Efudex®, Fluoroplex®)); an anthracycline (e.g., daunorubicin (Cerubidine®, Rubidomycin®), epirubicin (Ellence®), idarubicin (Idamycin®), mitoxantrone (Novantrone®), valrubicin (Valstar®)); a vinca alkaloid (e.g., vinblastine (Velban®, Velsar®), vincristine (Vincasar®, Oncovin®), vindesine (Eldisine®) and vinorelbine (Navelbine®)); a taxane (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel, larotaxel and cabazitaxel); and a platinum-based agent (e.g., cisplatin (Platinol®), carboplatin (Paraplat®, Paraplatin®), oxaliplatin (Eloxatin®)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered once every two weeks in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agent that is administered orally. For example, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be administered once every two weeks in combination with one or more of the following chemotherapeutic agents: capecitabine (Xeloda®), estramustine (Emcyt®), erlotinib (Tarceva®), rapamycin (Rapamune®), SDZ-RAD, CP-547632; AZD2171, sunitinib (Sutent®), sorafenib (Nexavar®) and everolimus (Afinitor®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe actual dosage of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and/or any additional chemotherapeutic agent employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the subject and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small amounts until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, when a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agent, the additional chemotherapeutic agent (or agents) is administered at a standard dose. For example, a standard dosage for cisplatin is 75-120 mg/m\n2 \nadministered every three weeks; a standard dosage for carboplatin is within the range of 200-600 mg/m\n2 \nor an AUC of 0.5-8 mg/ml×min; e.g., at an AUC of 4-6 mg/ml×min; a standard dosage for irinotecan is within 100-125 mg/m\n2\n, once a week; a standard dosage for gemcitabine is within the range of 80-1500 mg/m\n2 \nadministered weekly; a standard dose for UFT is within a range of 300-400 mg/m\n2 \nper day when combined with leucovorin administration; a standard dosage for leucovorin is 10-600 mg/m\n2 \nadministered weekly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosure also encompasses a method for the synergistic treatment of cancer wherein a CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition is administered in combination with an additional chemotherapeutic agent or agents. For example, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition can be administered in combination with one of the following chemotherapeutic agents: and a platinum-based agent (e.g., cisplatin (Platinol®), carboplatin (Paraplat®, Paraplatin®), oxaliplatin (Eloxatin®); a taxane (e.g., docetaxel, paclitaxel, larotaxel or cabazitaxel); gemctitabine; sorafenib.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particular choice of conjugate, particle or composition and anti-proliferative cytotoxic agent(s) or radiation will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the subject and the appropriate treatment protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition and the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation are not administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously, then the initial order of administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, and the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation, may be varied. Thus, for example, the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition may be administered first followed by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation; or the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and/or radiation may be administered first followed by the administration of the CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition. This alternate administration may be repeated during a single treatment protocol. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in accordance with experience and knowledge, the practicing physician can modify each protocol for the administration of a component (CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, particle or composition, anti-neoplastic agent(s), or radiation) of the treatment according to the individual subject's needs, as the treatment proceeds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe attending clinician, in judging whether treatment is effective at the dosage administered, will consider the general well-being of the subject as well as more definite signs such as relief of disease-related symptoms, inhibition of tumor growth, actual shrinkage of the tumor, or inhibition of metastasis. Size of the tumor can be measured by standard methods such as radiological studies, e.g., CAT or MRI scan, and successive measurements can be used to judge whether or not growth of the tumor has been retarded or even reversed. Relief of disease-related symptoms such as pain, and improvement in overall condition can also be used to help judge effectiveness of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosed CDP-topoisomerase inhibitor conjugates, particles and compositions are useful in treating proliferative disorders, e.g., treating a tumor, e.g., a primary tumor, and/or metastases thereof, wherein the tumor is a primary tumor or a metastases thereof, e.g., a cancer described herein or a metastases of a cancer described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods described herein can be used to treat a solid tumor, a soft tissue tumor or a liquid tumor.

The study was composed of two parts. Part 1 of the Phase 1 study had a primary objective to determine the safety profile, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of CRLX101 when administered weekly for 3 consecutive weeks of every 4-week cycle (the initial dosing regimen, sometimes referred to herein as “weekly×3”). In \npart\n 2, after the first twelve patients were enrolled, an every other week schedule was initiated for the remainder of the Phase 1 program (sometimes referred to herein as “biweekly”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEligibility Criteria. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable solid tumors refractory to standard therapy, or for which no standard curative or palliative therapy existed, were eligible for this trial. Prior treatment with topoisomerase inhibitors was allowed. Main eligibility criteria included male or female patients, at least 18 years of age, with advanced, histologically confirmed solid tumor refractory to standard treatment, or for which no standard therapy existed, measurable or evaluable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≦2, acceptable organ and bone marrow function, no evidence of clinically significant conduction abnormalities or ischemia, and ejection fraction ≦45%. Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or investigational therapy had to be completed within a prescribed interval before enrollment, could not have included high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue bone marrow transplantation, and patients could not have been refractory to prior treatment with a topoisomerase I inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis trial was conducted at City of Hope (COH) (Duarte, Calif.) following approval of the Clinical Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (CPRMC) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB). After the initial 18 patients were enrolled, an additional site was added at TGen (Scottsdale, Ariz.) following the approval of WIRB (Western Institutional Review Board).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudy design and drug administration. This was an open-labeled, single-arm dose-escalation phase 1 study of CRLX101. In part 1, CRLX101 was administered at 6, 12, or 18 mg/m\n2 \non a weekly schedule three weeks per month. In \npart\n 2, CRLX101 was administered at 12, 15 or 18 mg/m\n2 \non an every other week schedule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn part 1, CRLX101 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes on \ndays\n 1, 8, and 15 followed by a 7 day rest period (28 day cycle). In \npart\n 2, CRLX101 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes on \ndays\n 1 and 15, every 28 days. CRLX101 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on \ndays\n 1 and 15, every 28 days for the last six patients in \npart\n 2 of the Phase 1 study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe starting dose in part 1 was 6 mg/m\n2\n. Dose escalation was done using an accelerated Simon design (Simon et al., “Accelerated Titration Designs for Phase I Clinical Trials in Oncology” \nJ Natl Cancer Inst. \n89:1138-47, 1997) with a modified Fibonacci dose escalation scheme. In brief, patients were accrued in cohorts of one at escalating doses until the occurrence of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first cycle. Once a DLT occurred, additional patients were accrued in that dosage group to provide for either 3 or 6 patients as provided in a standard dose escalation with the intent of determining the maximum tolerated dose. Concurrent accrual was allowed within the same dose level. No intrapatient dose escalation was permitted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity Assessment. Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCl) common toxicity criteria (CTCAE) version 3.0. The DLT in a given patient was defined as any treatment-related grade III non-hematologic toxicity, any grade IV hematologic toxicity, or persisting toxicities of any grade requiring delay of scheduled treatment by more than 2 weeks. DLT was based on the first course of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRules for dose escalation. One patient was treated at each dose level. If a DLT attributable to the study drug(s) was experienced, up to 5 additional patients were subsequently treated at that dose level. If no additional DLTs were observed at the expanded dose level (i.e., at most 1/6 with an attributable DLT), the dose was escalated. Escalation was terminated when two of six patients experienced any DLT attributable to the study drug at a given dose level. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the dose level preceding the dose at which ≧2/6 patients experienced a first-course DLT. Treatment was continued in an individual patient for a total of 6 cycles at the same dose level if no DLT was observed and if clinical benefit was observed. Therapy was discontinued in any patient if excessive toxicity was experienced. No intra-patient dose escalation was permitted. Patients who completed 6 cycles with clinical benefit had the option of continuing treatment at the same dose level every other week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSafety and efficacy evaluations. Patients were seen, examined and a complete blood count with differential and serum chemistry was obtained before each dose. Radiographic assessments of tumor response (as evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor criteria RECIST) were performed every two cycles (Therasse et al., “New Guidelines to Evaluate the Response to Treatment in Solid Tumors. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, National Cancer Institute of the United States, National Cancer Institute of Canada” \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst. \n92:205-16, 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment modification. Patients who experienced a DLT during the initial cycle, or a severe or life threatening non-hematologic toxicity at any time during the study, were dose reduced at the next dose administration when their DLT returned to Grade 1. If a non-hematologic DLT occurred in the interval between dose administrations within a cycle, and the toxicity was not life threatening and resolved rapidly, the next dose administration within the cycle was to be at the next lower dose level. If a hematologic DLT occurred in the interval between dose administrations within a cycle, the next dose administration was to be at the next lower dose level, even if the blood cell counts recovered by the date of the next scheduled administration. Dosing was to be held for any non-hematologic toxicity grade ≧2, except for \ngrade\n 2 fatigue and anorexia. After the first cycle, dose modifications were based on interval toxicity, and platelet and granulocyte counts were obtained on the day of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHematologic toxicity: On day 1 of a cycle, administration of CRLX101 required an absolute granulocyte count (AGC) of ≧1500 and platelet count of ≧100,000. On day 8, if the AGC was ≧1000 and platelet count ≧75,000, then CRLX101 was given at full dose and in the same manner for \nday\n 15. If the AGC was <1000, the treating physicians could delay the dose of CRLX101 on \ndays\n 8 and 15. If unacceptable hematologic toxicity persisted >7 days, the CRLX101 dose was reduced to the next lower dose level. Similar standards were used in the biweekly part.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-hematologic toxicity: Any \ngrade\n 2 toxicity that was intolerable to the patients, or any \ngrade\n 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity that was attributed to CRLX101, had to return to grade 1 before a new cycle of treatment was started. Any treatment delay >2 weeks because of toxicity due to CRLX101 would result in the patient being removed from the study. If a patient experienced any \ngrade\n 3 genitourinary (GU) toxicity, the dose of CRLX101 was reduced to the next lower dose level, as CPT has been reported to cause hematuria, cystitis or other GU toxicities, which can be irreversible. If the patient experienced \ngrade\n 3 non-hematologic toxicities that did not recover to grade 1 before the next treatment, treatment was held until recovery and then reduced by one dose level. If the patient experienced \ngrade\n 4 non-hematologic toxicities that did not recover to grade 1 before the next treatment, then the dose was reduced by 50% in subsequent cycles. If there were conflicting dose attenuations by hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity, the greater dose reduction was applied. All dose modifications were permanent. Criteria for removal from treatment included disease progression, clinical progression, excessive toxicity, or patient withdrawal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma/urine sampling and analysis. Whole blood samples (5 mL) were collected in heparinized tubes at the following times during cycle one: pre-dose, during dosing at 30 minutes, 60 minutes and just prior to end of administration (90 minutes), and then at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, (48-72 hr optional), 168 hours (1 week), and 336 hours (only for patients on biweekly schedule) following the first dose. A spot trough PK blood sample was collected prior to dosing on Day 1 and \nDay\n 15 of every cycle. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 1,300×g for 10 minutes at 4° C. Plasma was immediately frozen at −20° C., and stored frozen until analysis. For determination of urinary excretion of polymer conjugated and unbound CPT, total urine collections were performed following dose 1 of the first cycle (0-24 and 24-48 hours post administration. A spot urine sample (15 mL) was collected at 8, 24, 48, 168 (1 wk), and 336 hours (pre-second dose) for more accurate determination of total to free CPT ratio. Once each urine collection was complete, the actual collection times and total volume of urine was recorded and a 5-10 mL aliquot of each was frozen for subsequent drug level analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples were extracted and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry) using a validated method. In order to determine total CPT in samples, a 20 μL aliquot was incubated with 5 μL 0.2N NaOH for 1 hour to release all CPT from the polymer conjugate. The solution was acidified with 7 μL 44% formic acid. Proteins were precipitated by addition of 160 μL cold (<-20° C.) methanol containing the internal standard 9-nitro camptothecin (9-NC) at a concentration of 8 ng/mL, incubation for 30 minutes on ice, and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of 0.5 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 3.5, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to determine unconjugated CPT in samples, a 20 μL aliquot was acidified with 3 μL 44% formic acid. Proteins were precipitated by addition of 160 μL cold (<-20° C.) methanol containing 9-NC at a concentration of 8 ng/mL, incubation for 30 minutes on ice, and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of 0.5 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 3.5 and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLC-MS/MS was performed on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Palo Alto, Calif.) coupled to a Micromass Quattro Ultima Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Micromass, Inc., Beverly, Mass.). HPLC separation was achieved using a Synergy Hydro-\nRP\n 4 \nμm\n 75×2 mm analytical column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif.) preceded by a C\n18 \nguard column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif.). The isocratic mobile phase consisted of 34% acetonitrile, 66% 0.5 mM ammonium acetate, pH 3.5 at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min at room temperature. MassLynx version 3.5 software was used for data acquisition and processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunohistochemical analysis of topoisomerase I expression. Ascites fluid from one patient with ovarian cancer was obtained pre-treatment and on \nday\n 2 post treatment with CRLX101 at 6 mg/m\n2\n. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and the pellet frozen. The pellet was formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 5 μm thick sections. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene followed by 100% ethanol. Samples were then quenched in 3% hydrogen peroxide and pretreated to promote antigen retrieval by steam in DIVA/citrate buffer (pH 6.0, Biocare Medical, Concord, Calif.) solution. After antigen retrieval, slides were incubated in Protein Block for 20 minutes. Slides were then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4° C. Topoisomerase I antibody was rabbit polyclonal from Abcam (Cambridge, Mass.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe next day, slides were washed in Dako Buffer (DB) and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 30 minutes at room temperature. After washes in DB, slides were incubated with the chromogen diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB), counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTopoisomerase I enzymatic activity assay. Lysates containing total cellular protein were made from the plain frozen ascites cells according to the method of Minagawa et al. (“Enhanced Topoisomerase I Activity and Increased Topoisomerase II Alpha Content in Cisplatin-Resistant Cancer Cell Lines” \nJpn J Cancer Res. \n88:1218-23, 1997), a procedure used specifically for frozen cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe catalytic activity of topoisomerase I was determined by measuring the relaxation of supercoiled plasmid substrate DNA using the Topo I assay kit (TopoGEN, Port Orange, Fla.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, reaction mixtures consisted of supercoiled plasmid substrate DNA (0.5 μg), whole cell lysate (0.25 μg or 0.5 μg, as indicated in data) and the assay buffer (final concentrations: 10 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.9], 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.1 mM spermidine, and 5% glycerol). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes, and terminated by adding 5 μL stop buffer/gel loading buffer. Samples were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel in 1×TAE buffer (40 mM Tris base [pH 8.3, adjusted in the 50× stock buffer using glacial acetic acid], 2.5 mM NaOAc, and 0.05 mM EDTA) and electrophoresed at 4-5 volts per centimeter for 3-4 hours. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) and relaxed DNA (0.5 μg) provided by the Topo I assay kit were used as the control markers. The gel was stained with 0.2 μg/mL ethidium bromide for 20 minutes at room temperature, destained in water for 20 minutes and photographed under ultraviolet (UV) light.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. Plasma concentration versus time data were analyzed using the ADAPT II (Biomedical Simulations Resource, Los Angeles) non-compartmental model. Results are summarized using descriptive statistics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatient Enrollment. Twenty-four patients were enrolled from June 2006 to April 2010. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The patients had a variety of solid tumors, and lung cancer was the most common tumor type.

The first patient, a breast cancer patient, who had metastatic disease to lung and other organs and had previously received multiple chemotherapy regimens, developed \ngrade\n 3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. This patient required platelet transfusions. The second patient had metastatic lung cancer, and had previously received carboplatin and paclitaxel with a brief response. This patient developed \ngrade\n 3 neutropenia, requiring dose reduction and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. This hematological toxicity in 2 of 3 patients established 18 mg/m\n2 \nas the DLT level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne pancreatic cancer patient experienced \ngrade\n 2 anemia on cycle 5, day 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne patient with hepatocellular cancer passed away one week after \ncycle\n 3, day 1 due to progressive disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne patient with lung cancer who had received multiple prior regimens, developed \ngrade\n 2 neutropenia on \ncycle\n 3, \nday\n 15. This patient required a dose reduction and G-CSF support.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the long terminal half-life of polymer conjugated, and especially unconjugated, CPT (see \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n), the protocol was amended in \npart\n 2 to evaluate an every other week schedule. A total of 12 patients were treated on this schedule, three at 12 mg/m\n2 \nand six at 15 mg/m\n2 \nand three at 18 mg/m\n2\n. Except for one occurrence of \ngrade\n 3 neutropenia, no \ngrade\n 3/4 hematologic events were recorded at dose level 12 mg/m\n2 \nand 15 mg/m\n2\n. At dose level 18 mg/m\n2 \none \ngrade\n 4 leukopenia, two \ngrade\n 4 neutropenia, two \ngrade\n 4 thrombocytopenia and one \ngrade\n 3 anemia were reported under hematological toxicities. This determined the DLT of bone marrow suppression at 18 mg/m\n2 \non this schedule. The only other notable non hematologic event was a \ngrade\n 3 hypersensitivity reaction. (Table 4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 4 shows a summary of all \ngrade\n 3/4 treatment related toxicities for all evaluable patients. Four patients on the weekly schedule developed delayed onset (after cycle 4) mild hematuria and mild dysuria that may have been related to treatment as previously reported for CPT (Muggia et al., “Phase I Clinical Trial of Weekly and Daily Treatment with Camptothecin (NSC-100880): Correlation with Preclinical Studies” \nCancer Chemother Rep \n56:515-521, 1972). However, upon evaluation by a urologist, cystitis could not be confirmed. Thus, at 18 mg/m\n2 \nbiweekly two patients were reported who developed DLT, and the MTD for the biweekly schedule was established as 15 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment related grade ¾ hematologic and non-hematologic adverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevents by dose cohort observed during all courses of therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nDOSE\n \n \nGrade\n \n 3\n\n\n \nGrade\n 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6 mg/m\n2\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nElevated CPK\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFatigue\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlymphopenia\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12 mg/m\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhyponatremia\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDysuria/\ncystitis\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18 mg/m\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthrombocytopenia\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nleukopenia\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nneutropenia\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nanemia\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nfatigue\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndehydration\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrash\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSOB\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHypersensitivity\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nreaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic analysis. Samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected from all patients during cycle 1. Results from this analysis are summarized in \nFIGS. 2A\n, \n2\nB and Table 5. The mean elimination half-lives were 31.8±5.7 hr and 43.8±9.7 hr for conjugated and unconjugated CPT, respectively. Volume of distribution of the polymer conjugate was 4.2±1.1 liter and was independent of dose. The low volume of distribution suggests that CRLX101 is initially retained in plasma and avoids rapid first pass clearance. C\nmax \nand AUC\n0-inf \nwere linear across doses and similar when normalized for dose/m\n2\n. \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n summarize pharmacokinetic parameters measured for polymer conjugated and unconjugated CPT for both schedules. Unconjugated CPT was slowly released from CRLX101 as shown by increasing plasma concentrations that peaked at 20.2±9.7 hrs. Plasma concentrations of unconjugated CPT were significantly below the plasma concentrations of conjugated CPT at all timepoints, with unconjugated CPT accounting for an average of 8.7±2.7% of total CPT plasma exposure. \nFIG. 2A\n shows average plasma time-concentration curves for the biweekly 12 mg/m cohort Systemic plasma clearance of conjugated CPT was 0.12±0.2 L/h, significantly below the kidney and liver blood flows in humans, and was also independent of dose. \nFIG. 2B\n shows average urinary excretion of polymer conjugated and unconjugated CPT in the first 48 hours following CRLX101 administration. Urinary loss of total CPT was variable with an average of 22.8±12.1% of dose excreted during the first 48 hours, of which 78±9% was in the conjugated form. Interestingly, urinary excretion of the polymer conjugate was primarily in the first 24 hours (16.4%±10.0% of dose) compared to the second 24 hours (1.5±1.3% of dose) post administration. Urinary excretion of unconjugated CPT remained approximately constant over both 24 hour periods (2.0±1.1% vs. 2.9±1.4% of dose). Toxicokinetic analysis of the two schedules showed that the predicted monthly exposure for conjugated and unconjugated CPT was similar for 6 mg/m\n2 \nweekly vs. 12 mg/m\n2 \nbi-weekly and 12 mg/m\n2 \nweekly vs. 15 mg/m\n2 \nbi-weekly; however, fewer patients experienced cycle one drug related adverse events with the bi-weekly regimen.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters and toxicokinetic summary.

Ascites cells were collected from one patient with ovarian cancer pre-treatment and on \n \nDays\n \n 2 and 25 post-treatment. Pellets of these cells were frozen for later analysis. Levels of polymer conjugated and unconjugated CPT were also determined in the ascites fluid pre-treatment and on \nday\n 2 post-treatment. On \nday\n 2, the concentrations detected were 46.6 μg/L for conjugated CPT and 19.6 μg/L for fully active, unconjugated CPT. For each amount of lysate used, there was less topoisomerase I unwinding activity (i.e., more remaining supercoiled DNA) in the \nDay\n 2 samples than in the pretreatment or \nDay\n 25 samples. This suggests an inhibitory effect of CRLX101 on these cells at this early time point after administration. The ascites cells were also used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess the levels of topoisomerase I. Basic agreement was observed between the topoisomerase I activity assay and topoisomerase I IHC. As seen in \nFIGS. 3A and 3B\n, there was a reduction of approximately 30% in staining in the nucleus of ovarian cancer cells isolated from the patient's \nascites fluid\n 2 days after treatment (\nFIG. 3B\n), compared to a similar sample taken before drug administration (\nFIG. 3A\n). The decrease in topoisomerase I levels directly seen by IHC in these cells at 48 hours explains why much of the supercoiled DNA remains present in lanes of \nFIG. 3C\n with reactions from \nDay\n 2 lysates; i.e., there is much less enzyme available to act on these substrate molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSummary. In the phase I trial reported above, two dosing schedules, weekly x3 and every other week (biweekly), were investigated. In the weekly×3 schedule the maximum tolerated dose was approximately 9 mg/m\n2\n. Hematologic toxicity and cystitis were the DLTs in this schedule. \nNon-hematologic grade\n 3/4 adverse events included fatigue in 3 patients (25%), delayed onset hematuria/dysuria in 2 patients (17%), elevated CPK (creatine phosphokinase) in 1 patient (8%), and dehydration in 1 patient (8%), all of which were reversible. Cumulative bladder toxicity in some patients on this schedule was primarily observed post cycle one and may have been related to the long terminal half-life of unconjugated CPT, which is primarily cleared through the kidneys, leading to cumulative bladder irritation. Based on this observation, it was decided to investigate a biweekly schedule as a strategy to reduce cumulative toxicity while maintaining dose delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biweekly schedule allowed for similar per cycle plasma exposure to be achieved in patients but with a significantly reduced incidence of adverse events. The only observed \ngrade\n 3/4 adverse event was \ngrade\n 3 neutropenia in one patient that was reversible. One dose reduction was required on this schedule. On this schedule, CRLX101 was well tolerated without the toxicities normally associated with camptothecin analogs, such as severe diarrhea and hemorrhagic cystitis. The MTD on this schedule was determined to be 15 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic analysis of CRLX101 was performed after the first dose for all patients. Consistent with preclinical data, the pharmacokinetics of CRLX101 were characterized by a low volume of distribution and limited systemic clearance. Preclinical studies showed accumulation of CRLX101 in tumors and tissues of the reticuloendothelial system such as liver and spleen. Increased release of active CPT from the conjugate was also observed in these tissues. This study also confirmed that release kinetics of CPT were such that plasma levels of unconjugated CPT remained significantly below levels of conjugate at all times. After one week, approximately 10% of the maximum recorded concentration of unconjugated CPT was still detected in plasma, possibly leading to the cumulative toxicity observed on the weekly×3 schedule. On the biweekly schedule however, unconjugated CPT levels dropped below the limit of quantitation before the second dose, which may explain the lack of urinary side effects on this schedule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, CRLX101 was well tolerated and myelosuppression was the DLT. Ten out of twenty-four patients demonstrated stable disease on CT scan evaluation at the end of \ncycle\n 2. One pancreatic cancer patient remained stable for 22.8 months. Serum and urine PK data from all the treated patients indicated that the mean elimination half-lives for conjugated and unconjugated CPT were 31.8 hr and 43.8 hr, respectively. C\nmax \nand AUC\n0-inf \nwere linear across doses and similar when normalized for dose/m\n2\n. The biweekly schedule allowed for similar per cycle plasma exposure to be achieved in patients, but with a significantly reduced incidence of adverse events.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nSynthesis of 6\nA\n,6\nD\n-Bis-(2-amino-2-carboxylethylthio)-6\nA\n,6\nD\n-dideoxy-β-cyclodextrin, 4 (CD-BisCys)\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n167 mL of 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer were degassed for 45 minutes in a 500 mL 2-neck round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a condenser and septum.

The resulting suspension was heated at a reflux temperature for 4.5 h until the solution turned clear (colorless). The solution was then cooled to room temperature and acidified to \npH\n 3 using 1N HCl. The product was precipitated by slow addition of acetone (3 times weight ratio of the solution). This afforded 9.0 g crude material containing CD-biscysteine (90.0%), unreacted cyclodextrin, CD-mono-cysteine and cystine. The resulting solid was subjected to anionic exchange column chromatography (SuperQ650M, Tosoh Bioscience) using a gradient elution of 0-0.4M ammonium bicarbonate. All fractions were analyzed by HPLC. The desired fractions were combined and the solvent was reduced to 100 mL under vacuum.

When 2.3 eq. of DIEA were added, the viscosity of the polymerization solution increased dramatically after 4-6 hours of reaction. DIEA deprotonates the amino groups of 4 to render them more nucleophilic for coupling with PEG-DiSPA. There were essentially no differences in the polymerizations if other bases, such as TEA or DMAP, were used (36b-c, Table 6). Polymerization using 4 recovered by the two different precipitation methods (acetone and methanol) produced polymers with different MWs. 4 that was purified by the methanol-precipitation method (contains no free cystine) gave higher MW polymer (36d-e) as compared to the less pure 4 that was obtained from the acetone-precipitation method (36a). Polymerization of 4 with PEG-DiSPA typically produced polymer yields greater than 90%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4 was polymerized with other activated monomers such as PEG-DiSBA, PEG-DiBTC, and PEG-DiNPC.

The polymer was precipitated with ethyl ether (1 L). The ether was poured out and the precipitate was washed with CH\n3\nCN (3×100 mL). The precipitate was dissolved in \nwater\n 600 mL. Some insoluble solid was filtered through 0.2 μm filters. The solution was dialyzed using 25,000 MWCO membrane (Spectra/Por 7) for 10 h at 10-15° C. in DI water. Dialysis water was changed every 60 minutes. The polymer-drug conjugate solution was sterilized by passing it through 0.2 μM filters.

An aliquot of corresponding stock solution was diluted to 100 μg/mL using 1 N NaOH. CPT was completely hydrolyzed in this basic solution and transformed to its carboxylate form within 2 h at room temperature. An aliquot of this solution was diluted to 10 μg/mL using 8.5% H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and the CPT carboxylate form was transformed to its lactone form. 30 μL of this solution was injected into the HPLC. The peak area from the CPT lactone form was integrated and compared to a standard curve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n11 and 12 were conjugated to 36e or 36f (Table 2) using conventional coupling methods. Due to the instability of the ester linker of 11 and 12 in aqueous solution, the conjugation was conducted in anhydrous DMSO under argon. An organic base was required to deprotonate the TFA salts of 11 and 12 to facilitate the coupling. For polymer conjugation with 12, the weight percent (wt %) drug loading was around 6-10%. The theoretical maximum drug loading is around 13% using PEG with MW of 3400 Da; maximum values can be increased by decreasing the MW of the PEG segments. Solubilities of all conjugates in water or PBS were more than 200 mg/mL (equivalent to a 12-20 mg CPT/mL for 6-10 wt % drug loading, respectively).

This solution was added to a lyophilized powder of human plasma to reconstitute 100% human plasma by the recommended amount. The solution was divided into equal volume (250 μL) to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, incubated at 37° C., and stopped at selected time point. Samples were stored at −80° C. until the analysis. Samples were separated from plasma by solid phase extraction columns The solid phase extraction cartridge (Oasis HLB lcc cartridge from Waters) was pre-conditioned with 1 mL of acetonitrile and then with 1 mL of 8.5% H\n3\nPO\n4 \nbefore loading. Samples were acidified with equal volume of 8.5% H\n3\nPO\n4 \nprior to loading. After the acidified solution was loaded on the cartridge, the bed was washed with 3×1 mL of water.

Therefore, a particle comprising conjugates described above may include a conjugate reacted at all positions available for attachment and particles that have less than all of the positions available for attachment containing the drug, e.g., the particle can include CPD reacted at one or none of the positions available for attachment. Thus, while Scheme VI depicts CPT at every point of attachment of each polymer subunit, the CDP-CPT conjugate can have less than 2 CPT molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-CPT conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include two, one or no CPT attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-CPT conjugates having two, one or no CPT attached to each polymer subunit of the CDP-CPT conjugate and the conjugates can also include a mixture of CDP-CPT conjugates that can vary as to the number of CPTs attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethod II.

CD-BisCys-Peg-GluBis(G1yCPT) 43 is precipitated with CH\n3\nCN and washed with the same solvent until no free drug is detected using UV or TLC. 43 is dried under high vacuum. While Scheme VII shows that the drug is attached at all available positions, not all positions may be reacted. Therefore, a particle comprising conjugates described above may include a conjugate reacted at all positions available for attachment and particles that have less than all of the positions available for attachment containing the drug, e.g., the particle can include CDP reacted at three, two, one or none of the positions available for attachment. Thus, while Scheme VII depicts CPT at every point of attachment of each polymer subunit, the CDP-CPT conjugate can have less than 4 CPT molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-CPT conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include four, three, two, one or no CPT attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-CPT conjugates having four, three, two, one or no CPT attached to each polymer subunit of the CDP-CPT conjugate and the conjugates can also include a mixture of CDP-CPT conjugates that can vary as to the number of CPTs attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nSynthesis and In vitro Analysis of CDP-Gly-SN-38\n\n\n \n \n \nSN-38 was derivatized with the amino acid glycine at the 20-OH position as shown in Scheme VIII. Briefly, 20(S)-7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38, 1.0 g, mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of 70 mL dimethylformamide (DMF) and 30 mL pyridine. A solution of di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate (0.83 g, 3.8 mmol) in 10 mL DMF was added and the mixture stirred at room temperature overnight (12 hours). The solvent was removed under vacuum to yield a yellow solid and re-crystallized from boiling 2-propanol (75 mL) to yield 20(s)-10-tert-butoxycarbonyloxy-7-ethyl-camptothecin (Boc-SN-38) as a yellow solid (0.6 g, 48% yield).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoc-SN-38 (0.73 g, 1.5 mmol), N-(tertbutoxycarbonyl)glycine (0.26 g, 1.5 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 0.18 g, 1.5 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous methylene chloride (30 mL) and chilled to 0° C. 1,3-Diisopropyl-carbodiimide (DIPC, 0.19 g, 1.5 mmol) was added, the mixture stirred at 0° C. for 30 minutes followed by stiffing for 4 hours at room temperature. The mixture was diluted with methylene chloride to 100 mL, washed twice with an aqueous solution of 0.1N hydrochloric acid (25 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent removed under vacuum. The resulting yellow solid was purified by flash chromatography in methylene chloride:acetone (9:1) followed by solvent removal under vacuum to yield 20-O—(N-(cert-butoxycarbonyl) glycyl)-10-tert-butyoxycarbonyloxy-7-ethylcamptothecin (diBoc-Gly-SN-38, 640 mg, 67% yield).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDP was synthesized as previously described (Cheng et al.

The polymer was precipitated by addition of 50 mL acetone followed by 50 mL diethyl ether. Precipitate was centrifuged, washed twice with 20 mL acetone each, and dissolved in water acidified to pH 3.0 with hydrochloric acid. Polymer solution was dialized for 24 hours against pH 3.0 water using a 25 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane. The resulting solution was lyophilized to yield CDP-Gly-SN-38 (180 mg, 67% yield). The polymer was analyzed for total and free SN-38 content by HPLC using SN-38 as a standard curve as previously described (Cheng et al. (2003) Bioconjugate Chemistry 14(5):1007-1017). Total SN-38 content was 7.66% w/w of which 97.4% was polymer bound.

Thus, while Scheme IX depicts SN-38 at every point of attachment of each polymer subunit, the CDP-SN-38 conjugate can have less than 2 SN-38 molecules attached to any given polymer subunit of the CDP. For example, in one embodiment, the CDP-SN-38 conjugate includes several polymer subunits and each of the polymer subunits can independently include two, one or no Sn-38 attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunit. In addition, the particles and compositions can include CDP-SN-38 conjugates having two, one or no Sn-38 attached to each polymer subunit of the CDP-Sn-38 conjugate and the conjugates can also include a mixture of CDP-Sn-38 conjugates that can vary as to the number of Sn-38s attached at each point of attachment of the polymer subunits of the conjugates in the particle or composition.\n\n\n \nIn Vitro Evaluation of CDP-Gly-SN-38\n\n\n \n \n \nCDP-Gly-SN-38 was evaluated in A2780 human ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe human ovarian carcinoma A2780 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a concentration of 5,000 cells per well and grown in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37° C. for 24 h in a humidified 5% CO\n2 \natmosphere. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the test compound at concentrations ranging from 0.01 nmol/L to 1 μmol/L. Triplicate wells per plate were treated at each concentration. Controls were vehicle-treated cells and medium only blank. Plates were incubated at 37° C. for 72 h. MTS assay reagent was prepared by diluting CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution (Promega) 5-fold into PBS/glucose (4.5 g/L). Cell culture medium was aspirated and 100 μL of MTS reagent were added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37° C. for 1 h. The plates were shaken for 5 min and the absorbance was measured at 485 nm using a SPECTRAFluor Plus plate reader (Tecan). The percentage of cell survival was calculated relative to untreated cells, and IC50s were estimated from the graphs of log dose (nmol/L) versus % cell survival (GraphPad Prizm).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of this experiment are shown in Table 9 below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 of SN-38 and CDP-Gly-SN-38 on A2780 ovarian cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSN-38\n\n\n2.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDP-PEG-Gly-SN-38\n\n\n7.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nCRLX101 Causes a Dose-Dependent Inhibition of Tumor Growth in a Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Model (A549) Possessing a KRAS mutation\n\n\n \n \n \nA549 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

A tumor fragment (˜1 mm\n3\n) was implanted subcutaneously in the right flank of test animals (9-week old female nu/nu mice, Harlan, body weight 18.8-25.8 gm) on day-1 of the study Animals were randomly divided into seven groups and treatment was started on day-15 post implantation, when the mean tumor volume was approximately 115 mm\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe seven treatment groups that were administered to the mice were: (1) PBS (vehicle control group), i.v. once weekly for three weeks (qwk×3), (2) gemcitabine i.p. at 120 mg/kg once every three days for four doses (q3d×4); (3) docetaxel i.v. at 30 mg/kg qwk×3; (4) topotecan i.p. at 12 mg/kg once every four days for three doses (q4d×3); (5) erlotinib orally (p.o.) at 100 mg/kg once daily for 21 days (qd×21); (6) pemetrexed p.o. at 500 mg/kg qd×14; (7) CRLX101 i.v. at 6 mg/kg (active compound camptothecin equivalent) qwk×3; and (8) CRLX101 i.v. at 6 mg/kg (active compound camptothecin equivalent) qwk×3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBody weight was measured daily on Days 1-5, then twice weekly until the completion of the study. Tumor volume was measured twice weekly and each animal was euthanized when the calculated tumor volume reached the 2000 mm\n3 \nendpoint, or on day-88 post implantation, whichever came first. Treatment evaluations were based on tumor growth delay (TGD), defined as the increase in the median time-to-endpoint (TTE) in drug-treated versus vehicle-treated mice, on the logrank significance of survival extensions on day-88 (74 days post first treatment) survival rates, and on regression responses. Tumors in all control mice reached the volume endpoint with a median TTE of 24.4 days, allowing a maximum possible TGD of 49.6 days (203%) in the study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGemcitabine, docetaxel, and topotecan therapies each provided significant survival extension (P<0.001). Gemcitabine at 120 mg/kg resulted in a median TTE of 68.7 days, corresponding to 44.3-day TGD (182%), five tumor-free survivors (TFS) with a median tumor volume (MTV) of 0 mm3, two partial regressions (PR\ns\n), and one transient complete regression (CR). Docetaxel at 30 mg/kg resulted in 13.4-day TGD (55%), two D74 survivors with an MTV of 302 mm3, and one PR. Topotecan at 12 mg/kg resulted in 14.8-day TGD (61%), and one TFS. Docetaxel therapy resulted in acceptable 9.3% group mean body weight loss on D21; mean weight losses were <3% with all other drugs. Erlotinib and pemetrexed produced non-significant survival extensions. Erlotinib at 100 mg/kg resulted in 4.7-day TGD (19%), pemetrexed at 500 mg/kg resulted in 1.9-day TGD (8%), and neither drug yielded D74 survivors or regressions. Both were well-tolerated. Two deaths among pemetrexed-treated mice were classified as non-treatment-related. CRLX101 at 10 mg/kg was well tolerated and resulted in assigned median TTEs of 74 days post first treatment, corresponding to the maximum possible 49.6-day TGD (203%), and yielded 100% complete response and survivors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, CRLX101 at 10 mg/kg qwk×3 resulted in 100% tumor-free survival for 74 days (post first treatment) in the H1299 human NSCLC xenograft model. In comparison, among the marketed drugs administered on optimal preclinical regimens: gemcitabine yielded 50% TFS and three transient regressions; topotecan yielded 10% TFS; docetaxel yielded 20% survival and no TFS; and erlotinib and pemetrexed each had non-significant activities. Docetaxel caused body weight loss within the acceptable limit (<20%) and CRLX101 and all other treatment agents were well-tolerated, except that one animal dosed at 10 mg/kg experienced >15% BW loss on Days 18-25, and was documented to be thin, hunched, and have an impaired gait on D25. This animal subsequently gained weight and survived to the end of the study. Although drug toxicity could not be excluded in this animal, it was unlikely, as no substantial weight loss occurred in other CRLX101-treated mice.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Summary of different treatment regimens in a NSCLC H1299\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nResponse Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTreatment\n\n\nDose\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\nρ\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBW\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGr\n\n\nn\n\n\nRegimen\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\nTTE\n\n\nT-C\n\n\nTGD\n\n\nvalue\n\n\nPR\n\n\nCR\n\n\nTFS\n\n\nNadir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n10\n\n\nVehicle\n\n\n—\n\n\nqwk × 3,\n\n\n24.4\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nGemcitabine\n \n\n\n120\n\n\nq3d × 4,\n\n\n68.7\n\n\n44.3\n\n\n182\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n2\n\n\n6\n\n\n5\n\n\n−2.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.p.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nDocetaxel\n \n\n\n30\n\n\nqwk × 3,\n\n\n27.8\n\n\n13.4\n\n\n55\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n−9.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n10\n\n\nTopotecan\n\n\n12\n\n\nq4d × 3,\n\n\n39.2\n\n\n14.8\n\n\n61\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n−0.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.p.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nErlotinib\n \n\n\n100\n\n\nqd × 21,\n\n\n29.1\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n19\n\n\n \nNS\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n−2.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\np.o.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nPemetrexed\n \n\n\n500\n\n\nqd × 14,\n\n\n26.3\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n8\n\n\n \nNS\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\np.o.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nCRLX101\n \n\n\n6\n\n\nQwk × 3,\n\n\n74.0\n\n\n49.6\n\n\n203\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n1\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nCRLX101\n \n\n\n10\n\n\nqwk × 3,\n\n\n74.0\n\n\n49.6\n\n\n203\n\n\n<.001\n\n\n0\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n−1.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nn = number of animals in a group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTE = time to endpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT-C = difference between median TTE (days) of treated versus control group,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n% TGD = [(T-C)/C] × 100.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C §119(e) of U.S. provisional application Nos. 61/411,276 filed Nov. 8, 2010; and 61/478,309 filed Apr. 22, 2011, both of which are herein specifically incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is related to human antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of human antibodies that specifically bind human TNF-like ligand 1A (hTL1A), and therapeutic methods of using those antibodies.\n\n\n \nSTATEMENT OF RELATED ART\n\n\n \n \n \nTL1A is a type II cell membrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF) and also designated as TNFSF15. It is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, and activated cells of the hematopoietic lineage, including monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, lamina propria mononuclear cells, dendritic cells and plasma cells (Tan, K. B. et al., 1997, \nGene \n204:35-46; Prehn, J. L. et al., 2007, \nJ Immunol \n178:4033-4038). It is also expressed in kidney, lung, prostate and thymus (Tan et al., 1997, supra). In endothelial cells, expression of TL1A is upregulated by IL-1α and TNFα (Migone, T. S. et al., 2002, \nImmunity \n16:479-492). In human fresh blood monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells, TL1A expression is upregulated by FcγR-mediated or Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (Prehn et al., 2007, supra; Meylan, F. et al., 2008, \nImmunity \n29:79-89). TL1A can be cleaved from the cell membrane via a mechanism analogous to TNFα and a soluble ectodomain form of TL1A has been reported (Migone et al., 2002, supra; Kim, S. et al., 2005, \nJ Immunol Methods \n298:1-8; Yang, C. R. et al., 2004, \nCancer Res \n64:1122-1129). Protein sequencing has confirmed that this form of TL1A is liberated following cleavage of the membrane-anchored precursor between residues Ala-71 and Leu-72 (Migone et al., 2002, supra). Two variant cDNAs that potentially encode N-terminally truncated versions of TL1A have been identified: VEGI-174 (or TL1) (Zhai, Y. et al., 1999, \nFASEB J \n13:181-189) and VEGI-192 (Chew, L. J. et al., 2002, \nFASEB J \n16:742-744). The published data suggest the biologically active products of the TL1A gene are the full-length type II transmembrane protein (residues 1-251) and its proteolytically cleaved ectodomain (residues 72-251) (Migone et al., 2002, supra; Jin et al., 2007, \nBiochem Biophys Res Commun \n364:1-6). A variant of hTL1A, designated as “Fhm”, containing a single amino acid substitution of Gln-167 with Arg, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,422.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTL1A mediates signals via its cognate receptor Death Receptor 3 (DR3; also known as TNFRSF25; the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:251 and 252, respectively), resulting in promoting cell survival and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or promoting apoptosis, in a context-dependent manner. TL1A is one of three known ligands (in addition to FasL and LIGHT) that are bound by the endogenous soluble decoy receptor, DcR3 (also known as TR6, NTR3 or TNFRSF21; the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:253 and 254, respectively) (Migone et al., 2002, supra; Yang C. R. et al., 2004, \nCancer Res \n64:1122-1129). DR3 is a TNF receptor-related death-domain receptor expressed on the majority of activated T lymphocytes and NK cells (Migone et al., 2002, supra; Screaton G. R. et al., 1997, \nProc Natl Acad Sci \n(\nUSA\n) 94:4615-4619). TL1A engages DR3 on T cells, enhancing their responsiveness to IL-2 (Migone et al., 2002, supra), potentiating T cell proliferation and release of IFN\n7 \nand GM-CSF under conditions of suboptimal costimulation (Migone et al., 2002, supra; Meylan et al., 2008, supra). TL1A has also been shown to synergize with suboptimal levels of IL-12/IL-18 to induce IFNγ production by CD4\n+\n T cells (Papadakis, K. A. et al., 2004, \nJ Immuno/\n172:7002-7007; Prehn, J. L. et al., 2004, \nClin Immunol \n112:66-77; Papadakis, K. A. et al., 2005, \nJ Immunol \n174:4985-4990; Cassatella, M. A. et al., 2007, \nJ Immunol \n178:7325-7333).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTL1A has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases and/or auto immune diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases [e.g., ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD)], rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS), atherosclerosis, and the like (see Bayry, J., 2010, \nNature Reviews/Rheumatology \n6:67-68; Takedatsu, H. et al., 2008, \nGastroenterology \n135:552-567; Prehn et al., 2004, supra; Bamias, G. et al., 2008, \nClin Immunol \n129:249-255; Bull, M. J. et al., 2008, \nJ Exp Med \n205:2457-2464; Pappu, B. P. et al., 2008, \nJ Exp Med \n205:1049-1062; Bamias, G. et al., 2003, \nJ Immuno/\n171:4868-4874; Kang, Y. et al., 2005, \nCytokine \n29:229-235). Although the majority of the published data are consistent with a pivotal role for TL1A in driving differentiation of T\nH\n1 and T\nH\n17 effector function, a recent study has proposed a role for the TL1A/DR3 interaction in development of T\nH\n2 T cell responses in asthma models (Fang, L. et al., 2008, \nJ Exp Med \n205:1037-1048). Thus, the use of TL1A inhibitors, such as fully human antibodies against TL1A with high affinities and neutralizing activity, alone or in combination with currently available anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppresants (e.g., TNF-α antagonists, cortisone or steroids, and the like), and/or anti-allergy agents, provides effective treatment for these diseases and disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid and the amino acid sequences of human TL1A are shown in SEQ ID NOS: 243 and 244, respectively, and those of Fhm are shown in SEQ ID NOS:245 and 246, respectively. Antibodies to TL1A are disclosed in, for example, US 7,597,886, US 7,820,798 and US 2009/0280116.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a first aspect, the invention provides fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antigen-binding fragments thereof that specifically bind and neutralize human TL1A (hTL1A) activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies can be full-length (for example, an IgG1 or IgG4 antibody) or may comprise only an antigen-binding portion (for example, a Fab, F(ab)\n2 \nor scFv fragment), and may be modified to affect functionality, e.g., to eliminate residual effector functions (Reddy et al., 2000, \nJ.

Suitable anti-inflammatory agents and/or analgesics for combination therapies with anti-hTL1A antibodies include, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, Cox-2 inhibitors, and the like, TNF-a antagonists, IL-1 antagonists, IL-6 antagonists, acetaminophen, morphinomimetics, and the like. Suitable anti-allergy agents include antihistamines, glucocorticoids, epinephrine (adrenaline), theophylline, cromolyn sodium and anti-leukotrienes, as well as anti-cholinergics, decongestants, mast cell stabilizers, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a ninth aspect, the invention features methods for inhibiting hTL1A activity using the anti-hTL1A antibody or antigen-binding portion of the antibody of the invention, wherein the therapeutic methods comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the invention and, optionally, one or more additional therapeutic agents described above. The disease or disorder treated is any disease or condition which is improved, ameliorated, inhibited or prevented, or its occurrence rate reduced compared to that without anti-hTL1A antibody treatment, by removal, inhibition or reduction of TL1A activity. Examples of diseases or disorders treatable by the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, inflammatory diseases and/or autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including UC and CD, RA, MS, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, atopic dermatitis, and the like; allergic reactions or conditions, including asthma, allergic lung inflammation, and the like; cancers atherosclerosis, infections, neurodegenerative diseases, graft rejection, graft vs. host diseases (GVHD), cardiovascular disorders/diseases, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments will become apparent from a review of the ensuing detailed description.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\n \n \n \nBefore the present invention is described in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular methods, and experimental conditions described, as such methods and conditions may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only by the appended claims.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, preferred methods and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nDefinitions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term “human TNF-like ligand 1A” or “hTL1A”, as used herein, refers to hTL1A having the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:243 and the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:244, or a biologically active fragment thereof, as well as hTL1A variants, including Fhm having the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:245 and the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:246, or a biologically active fragment thereof, unless specifically indicated otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody”, as used herein, is intended to refer to immunoglobulin molecules comprised of four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (HCVR) and a heavy chain constant region (C\nH\n; comprised of domains C\nH\n1, C\nH\n2 and C\nH\n3). Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (LCVR) and a light chain constant region (C\nL\n). The HCVR and LCVR can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each HCVR and LCVR is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution of one or more CDR residues or omission of one or more CDRs is also possible. Antibodies have been described in the scientific literature in which one or two CDRs can be dispensed with for binding. Padlan et al. (1995 FASEB J. 9:133-139) analyzed the contact regions between antibodies and their antigens, based on published crystal structures, and concluded that only about one fifth to one third of CDR residues actually contact the antigen. Padlan also found many antibodies in which one or two CDRs had no amino acids in contact with an antigen (see also, Vajdos et al. 2002 \nJ Mol Biol \n320:415-428).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDR residues not contacting antigen can be identified based on previous studies (for example, residues H60-H65 in CDRH2 are often not required), from regions of Kabat CDRs lying outside Chothia CDRs, by molecular modeling and/or empirically. If a CDR or residue(s) thereof is omitted, it is usually substituted with an amino acid occupying the corresponding position in another human antibody sequence or a consensus of such sequences. Positions for substitution within CDRs and amino acids to substitute can also be selected empirically. Empirical substitutions can be conservative or non-conservative substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “human antibody”, as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human mAbs of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. However, the term “human antibody”, as used herein, is not intended to include mAbs in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species (e.g., mouse), have been grafted onto human FR sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fully-human anti-TL1A antibodies disclosed herein may comprise one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions and/or deletions in the framework and/or CDR regions of the heavy and light chain variable domains as compared to the corresponding germline sequences. Such mutations can be readily ascertained by comparing the amino acid sequences disclosed herein to germline sequences available from, for example, public antibody sequence databases. The present invention includes antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments thereof, which are derived from any of the amino acid sequences disclosed herein, wherein one or more amino acids within one or more framework and/or CDR regions are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of the germline sequence from which the antibody was derived, or to the corresponding residue(s) of another human germline sequence, or to a conservative amino acid substitution of the corresponding germline residues(s) (such sequence changes are referred to herein collectively as “germline mutations”). A person of ordinary skill in the art, starting with the heavy and light chain variable region sequences disclosed herein, can easily produce numerous antibodies and antigen-binding fragments which comprise one or more individual germline back-mutations or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, all of the framework and/or CDR residues within the V\nH \nand/or V\nL \ndomains are mutated back to the residues found in the original germline sequence from which the antibody was derived. In other embodiments, only certain residues are mutated back to the original germline sequence, e.g., only the mutated residues found within the first 8 amino acids of FR1 or within the last 8 amino acids of FR4, or only the mutated residues found within CDR1, CDR2 or CDR3. In other embodiments, one or more of the framework and/or CDR residue(s) are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of a different germline sequence (i.e., a germline sequence that is different from the germline sequence from which the antibody was originally derived). Furthermore, the antibodies of the present invention may contain any combination of two or more germline mutations within the framework and/or CDR regions, e.g., wherein certain individual residues are mutated to the corresponding residues of a particular germline sequence while certain other residues that differ from the original germline sequence are maintained or are mutated to the corresponding residue of a different germline sequence. Once obtained, antibodies and antigen-binding fragments that contain one or more germline mutations can be easily tested for one or more desired property such as, improved binding specificity, increased binding affinity, improved or enhanced antagonistic or agonistic biological properties (as the case may be), reduced immunogenicity, etc. Antibodies and antigen-binding fragments obtained in this general manner are encompassed within the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes anti-TL1A antibodies comprising variants of any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein having one or more conservative substitutions. For example, the present invention includes anti-TL1A antibodies having HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences with, e.g., 10 or fewer, 8 or fewer, 6 or fewer, 4 or fewer, 2 or 1, conservative amino acid substitution(s) relative to any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless specifically indicated otherwise, the term “antibody” (Ab), as used herein, shall be understood to encompass antibody molecules comprising two immunoglobulin heavy chains and two immunoglobulin light chains (i.e., “full antibody molecules”) as well as antigen-binding fragments thereof. The terms “antigen-binding portion” of an antibody, “antigen-binding fragment” of an antibody, and the like, as used herein, include any naturally occurring, enzymatically obtainable, synthetic, or genetically engineered polypeptide or glycoprotein that specifically binds an antigen to form a complex. Antigen-binding fragments of an antibody may be derived, e.g., from full antibody molecules using any suitable standard techniques such as proteolytic digestion or recombinant genetic engineering techniques involving the manipulation and expression of DNA encoding antibody variable and (optionally) constant domains. Such DNA is known and/or is readily available from, e.g., commercial sources, DNA libraries (including, e.g., phage-display antibody libraries), or can be synthesized. The DNA may be sequenced and manipulated chemically or by using molecular biology techniques, for example, to arrange one or more variable and/or constant domains into a suitable configuration, or to introduce codons, create cysteine residues, modify, add or delete amino acids, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-limiting examples of antigen-binding fragments include: (i) Fab fragments; (ii) F(ab′)2 fragments; (iii) Fd fragments; (iv) Fv fragments; (v) single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules; (vi) dAb fragments; and (vii) minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the hypervariable region of an antibody (e.g., an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) such as a CDR3 peptide), or a constrained FR3-CDR3-FR4 peptide. Other engineered molecules, such as domain-specific antibodies, single domain antibodies, domain-deleted antibodies, chimeric antibodies, CDR-grafted antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, minibodies, nanobodies (e.g. monovalent nanobodies, bivalent nanobodies, etc.), small modular immunopharmaceuticals (SMIPs), and shark variable IgNAR domains, are also encompassed within the expression “antigen-binding fragment,” as used herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antigen-binding fragment of an antibody will typically comprise at least one variable domain. The variable domain may be of any size or amino acid composition and will generally comprise at least one CDR which is adjacent to or in frame with one or more framework sequences. In antigen-binding fragments having a V\nH \ndomain associated with a V\nL \ndomain, the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains may be situated relative to one another in any suitable arrangement. For example, the variable region may be dimeric and contain V\nH\n-V\nH\n, V\nH\n-V\nL \nor V\nL\n-V\nL \ndimers. Alternatively, the antigen-binding fragment of an antibody may contain a monomeric V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody may contain at least one variable domain covalently linked to at least one constant domain. Non-limiting, exemplary configurations of variable and constant domains that may be found within an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention include: (i) V\nH\n-C\nH\n1; (ii) V\nH\n-C\nH\n2; V\nH\n-C\nH\n3; (iv) V\nH\n-C\nH\n1-C\nH\n2; (v) V\nH\n-C\nH\n1-C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3; (VI) V\nH\n-C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3; (Vii) V\nH\n-C\nL\n; (Viii) V\nL\n-C\nH\n1; (ix) V\nL\n-C\nH\n2; (X) V\nL\n-C\nH\n3; (xi) V\nL\n-C\nH\n1-C\nH\n2; (xii) V\nL\n-C\nH\n1-C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3; (xiii) V\nL\n-C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3; and (xiv) V\nL\n-C\nL\n. In any configuration of variable and constant domains, including any of the exemplary configurations listed above, the variable and constant domains may be either directly linked to one another or may be linked by a full or partial hinge or linker region. A hinge region may consist of at least 2 (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60 or more) amino acids which result in a flexible or semi-flexible linkage between adjacent variable and/or constant domains in a single polypeptide molecule. Moreover, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention may comprise a homo-dimer or hetero-dimer (or other multimer) of any of the variable and constant domain configurations listed above in non-covalent association with one another and/or with one or more monomeric V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain (e.g., by disulfide bond(s)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with full antibody molecules, antigen-binding fragments may be monospecific or multispecific (e.g., bispecific). A multispecific antigen-binding fragment of an antibody will typically comprise at least two different variable domains, wherein each variable domain is capable of specifically binding to a separate antigen or to a different epitope on the same antigen. Any multispecific antibody format, including the exemplary bispecific antibody formats disclosed herein, may be adapted for use in the context of an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention using routine techniques available in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, antibody or antibody fragments of the invention may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety (“immunoconjugate”), such as a cytotoxin, a chemotherapeutic drug, an immunosuppressant or a radioisotope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “specifically binds,” or the like, means that an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof forms a complex with an antigen that is relatively stable under physiological conditions. Specific binding can be characterized by an equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of about 3000 nM or less (i.e., a smaller K\nD \ndenotes a tighter binding), about 2000 nM or less, about 1000 nM or less; about 500 nM or less; about 300 nM or less; about 200 nM or less; about 100 nM or less; about 50 nM or less; about 1 nM or less; or about 0.5 nM or less. Methods for determining whether two molecules specifically bind are well known in the art and include, for example, equilibrium dialysis, surface plasmon resonance, and the like. An isolated antibody that specifically binds hTL1A may, however, exhibit cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as TL1A molecules from other species, for example, cynomolgus monkey TL1A (SEQ ID NO:248), and/or mouse TL1A (SEQ ID NO:250), and/or a TL1A variant, such as Fhm (SEQ ID NO:246). Moreover, multi-specific antibodies (e.g., bispecifics) that bind to hTL1A and one or more additional antigens are nonetheless considered antibodies that “specifically bind’ hTL1A, as used herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “high affinity” antibody refers to those antibodies having a binding affinity to hTL1A, expressed as K\nD\n, of about 1×10\n−9 \nM or less, about 0.5×10\n−9 \nM or less, about 0.25×10\n−9 \nM or less, about 1×10\n10 \nM or less, or about 0.5×10\n−10 \nM or less, as measured by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE™ or solution-affinity ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “K\nD\n”, as used herein, is intended to refer to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the term “slow off rate”, “Koff” or “k\nd\n” is meant an antibody that dissociates from hTL1A with a rate constant of 1×10\n−3 \ns\n−1 \nor less, preferably 1×10\n−4\ns\n−1 \nor less, as determined by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE™.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the term “intrinsic affinity constant” or “k\na\n” is meant an antibody that associates with hTL1A at a rate constant of about 1×10\n3 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nor higher, as determined by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE™.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “isolated antibody”, as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody that is substantially free of other mAbs having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds hTL1A is substantially free of Abs that specifically bind antigens other than hTL1A). An isolated antibody that specifically binds hTL1A may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as TL1A molecules from other species, such as cynomolgus monkey and mouse, and/or hTL1A variants, such as Fhm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “neutralizing antibody”, as used herein (or an “antibody that neutralizes TL1A activity”), is intended to refer to an antibody whose binding to TL1A results in inhibition of at least one biological activity of TL1A. This inhibition of the biological activity of TL1A can be assessed by measuring one or more indicators of TL1A biological activity by one or more of several standard in vitro or in vivo assays known in the art (also see examples below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “surface plasmon resonance”, as used herein, refers to an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIACORE™ system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, N.J.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “epitope” is a region of an antigen that is bound by an antibody. Epitopes may be defined as structural or functional. Functional epitopes are generally a subset of the structural epitopes and have those residues that directly contribute to the affinity of the interaction. Epitopes may also be conformational, that is, composed of non-linear amino acids. In certain embodiments, epitopes may include determinants that are chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups, and, in certain embodiments, may have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substantial identity” or “substantially identical,” when referring to a nucleic acid or fragment thereof, indicates that, when optimally aligned with appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions with another nucleic acid (or its complementary strand), there is nucleotide sequence identity in at least about 90%, and more preferably at least about 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the nucleotide bases, as measured by any well-known algorithm of sequence identity, such as FASTA, BLAST or GAP, as discussed below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs applied to polypeptides, the term “substantial similarity” or “substantially similar” means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 90% sequence identity, even more preferably at least 95%, 98% or 99% sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. A “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which an amino acid residue is substituted by another amino acid residue having a side chain (R group) with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity). In general, a conservative amino acid substitution will not substantially change the functional properties of a protein. In cases where two or more amino acid sequences differ from each other by conservative substitutions, the percent or degree of similarity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Pearson (1994) \nMethods Mol. Biol. \n24: 307-331, which is herein incorporated by reference. Examples of groups of amino acids that have side chains with similar chemical properties include 1) aliphatic side chains: glycine, alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine; 2) aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains: serine and threonine; 3) amide-containing side chains: asparagine and glutamine; 4) aromatic side chains: phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; 5) basic side chains: lysine, arginine, and histidine; 6) acidic side chains: aspartate and glutamate, and 7) sulfur-containing side chains: cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamate-aspartate, and asparagine-glutamine. Alternatively, a conservative replacement is any change having a positive value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix disclosed in Gonnet et al. (1992) \nScience \n256: 1443 45, herein incorporated by reference. A “moderately conservative” replacement is any change having a nonnegative value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequence similarity for polypeptides is typically measured using sequence analysis software. Protein analysis software matches similar sequences using measures of similarity assigned to various substitutions, deletions and other modifications, including conservative amino acid substitutions. For instance, GCG software contains programs such as GAP and BESTFIT which can be used with default parameters to determine sequence homology or sequence identity between closely related polypeptides, such as homologous polypeptides from different species of organisms or between a wild type protein and a mutein thereof. See, e.g., GCG Version 6.1. Polypeptide sequences also can be compared using FASTA with default or recommended parameters; a program in GCG Version 6.1. FASTA (e.g., FASTA2 and FASTA3) provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences (Pearson, 2000, supra). Another preferred algorithm when comparing a sequence of the invention to a database containing a large number of sequences from different organisms is the computer program BLAST, especially BLASTP or TBLASTN, using default parameters. See, e.g., Altschul et al., 1990, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n215: 403 410 and, 1997, \nNucleic Acids Res. \n25:3389 402, each of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the phrase “therapeutically effective amount” is meant an amount that produces the desired effect for which it is administered. The exact amount will depend on the purpose of the treatment, the age and the size of a subject treated, the route of administration, and the like, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques (see, for example, Lloyd (1999) The Art, Science and Technology of Pharmaceutical Compounding).\n\n\n \nPreparation of Human Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for generating human antibodies in transgenic mice are known in the art. Any such known methods can be used in the context of the present invention to make human antibodies that specifically bind to TL1A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing VELOCIMMUNE™ technology or any other known method for generating monoclonal antibodies, high affinity chimeric antibodies to TL1A are initially isolated having a human variable region and a mouse constant region. As in the experimental section below, the antibodies are characterized and selected for desirable characteristics, including affinity, selectivity, epitope, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the antibodies of the instant invention possess very high affinities, typically possessing K\nD \nof from about 10\n−12 \nM through about 10\n−9 \nM, when measured by binding to antigen either immobilized on solid phase or in solution phase. The mouse constant regions are replaced with desired human constant regions, for example, wild-type IgG1 (SEQ ID NO:255) or IgG4 (SEQ ID NO:256), or modified IgG1 or IgG4 (for example, IgG4 with Ser-108 substituted with Pro as shown in SEQ ID NO:257), to generate the fully human antibodies of the invention. While the constant region selected may vary according to specific use, high affinity antigen-binding and target specificity characteristics of the antibodies reside in the variable region.\n\n\n \nEpitope Mapping and Related Technologies\n\n\n \n \n \nTo screen for antibodies that bind to a particular epitope, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies, Harlow and Lane (Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harb., N.Y.) can be performed. Other methods include alanine scanning mutants, peptide blots (Reineke, 2004, \nMethods Mol Biol \n248:443-63) (herein specifically incorporated by reference in its entirety), or peptide cleavage analysis. In addition, methods such as epitope excision, epitope extraction and chemical modification of antigens can be employed (Tomer, 2000, \nProtein Science \n9: 487-496) (herein specifically incorporated by reference in its entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “epitope” refers to a site on an antigen to which B and/or T cells respond. B-cell epitopes can be formed both from contiguous amino acids or noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of a protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically retained on exposure to denaturing solvents, whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost on treatment with denaturing solvents. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModification-Assisted Profiling (MAP), also known as Antigen Structure-based Antibody Profiling (ASAP) is a method that categorizes large numbers of mAbs directed against the same antigen according to the similarities of the binding profile of each antibody to chemically or enzymatically modified antigen surfaces (US 2004/0101920, herein specifically incorporated by reference in its entirety). Each category may reflect a unique epitope either distinctly different from or partially overlapping with epitope represented by another category. This technology allows rapid filtering of genetically identical mAbs, such that characterization can be focused on genetically distinct mAbs. When applied to hybridoma screening, MAP may facilitate identification of rare hybridoma clones that produce mAbs having the desired characteristics. MAP may be used to sort the anti-TL1A mAbs of the invention into groups of mAbs binding different epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes hTL1A antibodies that bind to the same epitope as any of the specific exemplary antibodies described herein. Likewise, the present invention also includes anti-hTL1A antibodies that compete for binding to hTL1A or a hTL1A fragment with any of the specific exemplary antibodies described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne can easily determine whether an antibody binds to the same epitope as, or competes for binding with, a reference anti-hTL1A antibody by using routine methods known in the art. For example, to determine if a test antibody binds to the same epitope as a reference anti-hTL1A antibody of the invention, the reference antibody is allowed to bind to a hTL1A protein or peptide under saturating conditions. Next, the ability of a test antibody to bind to the hTL1A molecule is assessed. If the test antibody is able to bind to hTL1A following saturation binding with the reference anti-hTL1A antibody, it can be concluded that the test antibody binds to a different epitope than the reference anti-hTL1A antibody. On the other hand, if the test antibody is not able to bind to the hTL1A molecule following saturation binding with the reference anti-hTL1A antibody, then the test antibody may bind to the same epitope as the epitope bound by the reference anti-hTL1A antibody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine if an antibody competes for binding with a reference anti-hTL1A antibody, the above-described binding methodology is performed in two orientations: In a first orientation, the reference antibody is allowed to bind to a hTL1A molecule under saturating conditions followed by assessment of binding of the test antibody to the hTL1A molecule. In a second orientation, the test antibody is allowed to bind to a hTL1A molecule under saturating conditions followed by assessment of binding of the reference antibody to the TL1A molecule. If, in both orientations, only the first (saturating) antibody is capable of binding to the TL1A molecule, then it is concluded that the test antibody and the reference antibody compete for binding to hTL1A. As will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, an antibody that competes for binding with a reference antibody may not necessarily bind to the identical epitope as the reference antibody, but may sterically block binding of the reference antibody by binding an overlapping or adjacent epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo antibodies bind to the same or overlapping epitope if each competitively inhibits (blocks) binding of the other to the antigen. That is, a 1-, 5-, 10-, 20- or 100-fold excess of one antibody inhibits binding of the other by at least 50% but preferably 75%, 90% or even 99% as measured in a competitive binding assay (see, e.g., Junghans et al., \nCancer Res. \n1990:50:1495-1502). Alternatively, two antibodies have the same epitope if essentially all amino acid mutations in the antigen that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other. Two antibodies have overlapping epitopes if some amino acid mutations that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional routine experimentation (e.g., peptide mutation and binding analyses) can then be carried out to confirm whether the observed lack of binding of the test antibody is in fact due to binding to the same epitope as the reference antibody or if steric blocking (or another phenomenon) is responsible for the lack of observed binding. Experiments of this sort can be performed using ELISA, RIA, surface plasmon resonance, flow cytometry or any other quantitative or qualitative antibody-binding assay available in the art.\n\n\n \nImmunoconjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention encompasses a human anti-TL1A monoclonal antibody conjugated to a therapeutic moiety (“immunoconjugate”), such as a cytotoxin, a chemotherapeutic drug, an immunosuppressant or a radioisotope. Cytotoxin agents include any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples of suitable cytotoxin agents and chemotherapeutic agents for forming immunoconjugates are known in the art, see for example, WO 05/103081, herein specifically incorporated by reference).\n\n\n \nBispecifics\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific, bispecific, or multispecific. Multispecific mAbs may be specific for different epitopes of one target polypeptide or may contain antigen-binding domains specific for more than one target polypeptide. See, e.g., Tutt et al., 1991, \nJ. Immunol. \n147:60-69. The human anti-hTL1A mAbs can be linked to or co-expressed with another functional molecule, e.g., another peptide or protein. For example, an antibody or fragment thereof can be functionally linked (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other molecular entities, such as another antibody or antibody fragment, to produce a bispecific or a multispecific antibody with a second binding specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary bi-specific antibody format that can be used in the context of the present invention involves the use of a first immunoglobulin (Ig) C\nH\n3 domain and a second Ig C\nH\n3 domain, wherein the first and second Ig C\nH\n3 domains differ from one another by at least one amino acid, and wherein at least one amino acid difference reduces binding of the bispecific antibody to Protein A as compared to a bi-specific antibody lacking the amino acid difference. In one embodiment, the first Ig C\nH\n3 domain binds Protein A and the second Ig C\nH\n3 domain contains a mutation that reduces or abolishes Protein A binding such as an H95R modification (by IMGT exon numbering; H435R by EU numbering). The second C\nH\n3 may further comprise a Y96F modification (by IMGT; Y436F by EU). Further modifications that may be found within the second C\nH\n3 include: D16E, L18M, N44S, K52N, V57M, and V82I (by IMGT; D356E, L358M, N384S, K392N, V397M, and V422I by EU) in the case of IgG1 antibodies; N44S, K52N, and V82I (IMGT; N384S, K392N, and V422I by EU) in the case of IgG2 antibodies; and Q15R, N44S, K52N, V57M, R69K, E79Q, and V82I (by IMGT; Q355R, N384S, K392N, V397M, R409K, E419Q, and V422I by EU) in the case of IgG4 antibodies. Variations on the bi-specific antibody format described above are contemplated within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \nBioequivalents\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-hTL1A antibodies and antibody fragments of the present invention encompass proteins having amino acid sequences that vary from those of the described mAbs, but that retain the ability to bind human TL1A. Such variant mAbs and antibody fragments comprise one or more additions, deletions, or substitutions of amino acids when compared to parent sequence, but exhibit biological activity that is essentially equivalent to that of the described mAbs. Likewise, the hTL1A mAb-encoding DNA sequences of the present invention encompass sequences that comprise one or more additions, deletions, or substitutions of nucleotides when compared to the disclosed sequence, but that encode an anti-hTL1A antibody or antibody fragment that is essentially bioequivalent to an anti-hTL1A antibody or antibody fragment of the invention. Examples of such variant amino acid and DNA sequences are discussed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo antigen-binding proteins, or antibodies, are considered bioequivalent if, for example, they are pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives whose rate and extent of absorption do not show a significant difference when administered at the same molar dose under similar experimental conditions, either single does or multiple dose. Some antibodies will be considered equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives if they are equivalent in the extent of their absorption but not in their rate of absorption and yet may be considered bioequivalent because such differences in the rate of absorption are intentional and are reflected in the labeling, are not essential to the attainment of effective body drug concentrations on, e.g., chronic use, and are considered medically insignificant for the particular drug product studied. In one embodiment, two antigen-binding proteins are bioequivalent if there are no clinically meaningful differences in their safety, purity, and potency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, two antigen-binding proteins are bioequivalent if a patient can be switched one or more times between the reference product and the biological product without an expected increase in the risk of adverse effects, including a clinically significant change in immunogenicity, or diminished effectiveness, as compared to continued therapy without such switching.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, two antigen-binding proteins are bioequivalent if they both act by a common mechanism or mechanisms of action for the condition or conditions of use, to the extent that such mechanisms are known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBioequivalence may be demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro methods. Bioequivalence measures include, e.g., (a) an in vivo test in humans or other mammals, in which the concentration of the antibody or its metabolites is measured in blood, plasma, serum, or other biological fluid as a function of time; (b) an in vitro test that has been correlated with and is reasonably predictive of human in vivo bioavailability data; (c) an in vivo test in humans or other mammals in which the appropriate acute pharmacological effect of the antibody (or its target) is measured as a function of time; and (d) in a well-controlled clinical trial that establishes safety, efficacy, or bioavailability or bioequivalence of an antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBioequivalent variants of anti-hTL1A antibodies of the invention may be constructed by, for example, making various substitutions of residues or sequences or deleting terminal or internal residues or sequences not needed for biological activity. For example, cysteine residues not essential for biological activity can be deleted or replaced with other amino acids to prevent formation of unnecessary or incorrect intramolecular disulfide bridges upon renaturation.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Administration and Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides therapeutic compositions comprising the anti-hTL1A antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof of the present invention and the therapeutic methods using the same. The administration of therapeutic compositions in accordance with the invention will be administered with suitable carriers, excipients, and other agents that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the like. A multitude of appropriate formulations can be found in the formulary known to all pharmaceutical chemists: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. These formulations include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as LIPOFECTIN™), DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax. See also Powell et al. “Compendium of excipients for parenteral formulations” PDA, 1998, \nJ Pharm Sci Technol \n52:238-311.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose may vary depending upon the age and the size of a subject to be administered, target disease, the purpose of the treatment, conditions, route of administration, and the like. When the antibody of the present invention is used for treating various conditions and diseases directly or indirectly associated with TL1A, including inflammatory diseases/disorders, autoimmune diseases/disorders, allergic reactions, and the like, in an adult patient, it is advantageous to intravenously or subcutaneously administer the antibody of the present invention at a single dose of about 0.01 to about 20 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.02 to about 7, about 0.03 to about 5, or about 0.05 to about 3 mg/kg body weight. Depending on the severity of the condition, the frequency and the duration of the treatment can be adjusted. In certain embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention can be administered as an initial dose of at least about 0.1 mg to about 800 mg, about 1 to about 500 mg, about 5 to about 300 mg, or about 10 to about 200 mg, to about 100 mg, or to about 50 mg. In certain embodiments, the initial dose may be followed by administration of a second or a plurality of subsequent doses of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof in an amount that can be approximately the same or less than that of the initial dose, wherein the subsequent doses are separated by at least 1 day to 3 days; at least one week, at least 2 weeks; at least 3 weeks; at least 4 weeks; at least 5 weeks; at least 6 weeks; at least 7 weeks; at least 8 weeks; at least 9 weeks; at least 10 weeks; at least 12 weeks; or at least 14 weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the mutant viruses, receptor mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu et al., 1987, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n262:4429-4432). Methods of introduction include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The composition may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition can be also delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, 1990, \nScience \n249:1527-1533; Treat et al., 1989, in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365; Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327; see generally ibid.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain situations, the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, \nCRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. \n14:201). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used; see, Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the composition's target, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138, 1984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe injectable preparations may include dosage forms for intravenous, subcutaneous, intracutaneous and intramuscular injections, drip infusions, etc. These injectable preparations may be prepared by methods publicly known. For example, the injectable preparations may be prepared, e.g., by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying the antibody or its salt described above in a sterile aqueous medium or an oily medium conventionally used for injections. As the aqueous medium for injections, there are, for example, physiological saline, an isotonic solution containing glucose and other auxiliary agents, etc., which may be used in combination with an appropriate solubilizing agent such as an alcohol (e.g., ethanol), a polyalcohol (e.g., propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol), a nonionic surfactant [e.g., polysorbate 80, HCO-50 (polyoxyethylene (50 mol) adduct of hydrogenated castor oil)], etc. As the oily medium, there are employed, e.g., sesame oil, soybean oil, etc., which may be used in combination with a solubilizing agent such as benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, etc. The injection thus prepared is preferably filled in an appropriate ampoule. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered subcutaneously or intravenously with a standard needle and syringe. In addition, with respect to subcutaneous delivery, a pen delivery device readily has applications in delivering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Such a pen delivery device can be reusable or disposable. A reusable pen delivery device generally utilizes a replaceable cartridge that contains a pharmaceutical composition. Once all of the pharmaceutical composition within the cartridge has been administered and the cartridge is empty, the empty cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge that contains the pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can then be reused. In a disposable pen delivery device, there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather, the disposable pen delivery device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a reservoir within the device. Once the reservoir is emptied of the pharmaceutical composition, the entire device is discarded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous reusable pen and autoinjector delivery devices have applications in the subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Examples include, but certainly are not limited to AUTOPEN™ (Owen Mumford, Inc., Woodstock, UK), DISETRONIC™ pen (Disetronic Medical Systems, Burghdorf, Switzerland), HUMALOG MIX 75/25™ pen, HUMALOG™ pen, HUMALIN 70/30™ pen (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Ind.), NOVOPEN™ I, II and III (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), NOVOPEN JUNIOR™ (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), BD™ pen (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.), OPTIPEN™, OPTIPEN PRO™, OPTIPEN STARLET™, and OPTICLIK™ (sanofi-aventis, Frankfurt, Germany), to name only a few. Examples of disposable pen delivery devices having applications in subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention include, but certainly are not limited to the SOLOSTAR™ pen (sanofi-aventis), the FLEXPEN™ (Novo Nordisk), and the KWIKPEN™ (Eli Lilly).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdvantageously, the pharmaceutical compositions for oral or parenteral use described above are prepared into dosage forms in a unit dose suited to fit a dose of the active ingredients. Such dosage forms in a unit dose include, for example, tablets, pills, capsules, injections (ampoules), suppositories, etc. The amount of the aforesaid antibody contained is generally about 0.1 to about 800 mg per dosage form in a unit dose; especially in the form of injection, the aforesaid antibody is contained in about 1 to about 500 mg, in about 5 to 300 mg, in about 8 to 200 mg, and in about 10 to about 100 mg for the other dosage forms.\n\n\n \nCombination Therapies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention further provides therapeutic methods for treating diseases or disorders, which is directly or indirectly associated with hTL1A, by administering the hTL1A mAb or fragment thereof of the invention in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents. The additional therapeutic agent may be one or more of any agent that is advantageously combined with the antibody or fragment thereof of the invention, including immunosuppressants, anti-inflammatory agents, analgesic agents, anti-allergy agents, and the like. Suitable immunosuppressants include, but are not limited to, glucocorticoids, cyclosporin, methotrexate, interferon β (IFN-β), tacrolimus, sirolimus, azathioprine, mercaptopurine, opioids, mycophenolate, TNF-binding proteins, such as infliximab, eternacept, adalimumab, and the like, cytotoxic antibiotics, such as dactinomycin, anthracyclines, mitomycin C, bleomycin, mithramycin, and the like, antibodies targeting immune cells, such as anti-CD20 antibodies, anti-CD3 antibodies, and the like. Suitable anti-inflammatory agents and/or analgesics for combination therapies with the anti-hTL1A antibodies include, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, Cox-2 inhibitors, and the like, TNF-a antagonists (e.g., Infliximab or REMICADE® by Centocor Inc.; golimumab by Centocor Inc.; etanercept or ENBREL® by AmgenANyeth; adalimumab or HUMIRA® by Abbott Laboratories, and the like), IL-1 antagonists (e.g., IL-1-binding fusion proteins, for example, ARCALYST® by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., see U.S. Pat. No. 6,927,044; KINERET® by Amgen, and the like), IL-6 antagonists (e.g., anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,582,298, and ACTEMRA® by Roche), acetaminophen, morphinomimetics, and the like. Suitable anti-allergy agents, which can block the action of allergic mediators, or to prevent activation of cells and degranulation processes, include antihistamines, glucocorticoids, epinephrine (adrenaline), theophylline, cromolyn sodium and anti-leukotrienes, such as montelukast (SINGULAIR® by Merck) or zafirlukast (ACCOLATE® by AstraZeneca), as well as anti-cholinergics, decongestants, mast cell stabilizers, and other compounds that can impair eosinophil chemotaxis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hTL1A mAb or fragment thereof of the invention and the additional therapeutic agent(s) can be co-administered together or separately. Where separate dosage formulations are used, the antibody or fragment thereof of the invention and the additional agents can be administered concurrently, or separately at staggered times, i.e., sequentially, in appropriate orders.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the methods and compositions of the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers used but some experimental errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, molecular weight is average molecular weight, temperature is in degrees Centigrade, and pressure is at or near atmospheric.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nGeneration of Human Antibodies to Human TL1A\n\n\n \n \n \nVELOCIMMUNE™ mice were immunized with human TL1A, and the antibody immune response monitored by antigen-specific immunoassay using serum obtained from these mice. Anti-hTL1A antibody-expressing B cells were harvested from the spleens of immunized mice shown to have elevated anti-hTL1A antibody titers and were fused with mouse myeloma cells to form hybridomas. The hybridomas were screened and selected to identify cell lines expressing hTL1A-specific antibodies using assays as described below. The assays identified several cell lines that produced chimeric anti-hTL1A antibodies designated as H2M1681N, H2M1704N, H2M1804N, H2M1805N, H2M1817N and H2M1818N. These antibodies were later converted to hIgG4 isotype by replacing the respective mouse constant regions with the hIgG4 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:257, which contains a S108P mutation in the hinge region, and designated as H4H1681N, H4H1704N, H4H1804N, H4H1805N, H4H1817N and H4H1818N, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman TL1A-specific antibodies were also isolated directly from antigen-immunized B cells without fusion to myeloma cells, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,582,298, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Heavy and light chain variable regions were cloned to generate fully human anti-hTL1A antibodies designated as H4H1719P, H4H1725P, H4H1738P, H4H1742P, H4H1745P, H4H1750P and H4H1752P. Stable recombinant antibody-expressing CHO cell lines were established.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nVariable Gene Utilization Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nTo analyze the structure of antibodies produced, the nucleic acids encoding antibody variable regions were cloned and sequenced. From the nucleic acid sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of the antibodies, gene usage was identified for each Heavy Chain Variable Region (HCVR) and Light Chain Variable Region (LCVR). Table 1 shows the gene usage for selected antibodies in accordance with the invention.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHCVR\n\n\n \n\n\nLCVR\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nV\nH\n \n\n\nD\nH\n \n\n\nJ\nH\n \n\n\nV\nK\n \n\n\nJ\nK\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH2M1704\n\n\n3-7\n\n\n1-7\n\n\n6\n\n\n4-1\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH2M1681\n\n\n3-23\n\n\n2-21\n\n\n4\n\n\n1-5\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH2M1817\n\n\n4-34\n\n\n3-9\n\n\n4\n\n\n3-20\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH2M1804\n\n\n4-34\n\n\n1-1\n\n\n4\n\n\n3-20\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH2M1818\n\n\n3-11\n\n\n4-17\n\n\n6\n\n\n4-1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH2M1805\n\n\n4-34\n\n\n3-3\n\n\n4\n\n\n2-24\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH4H1719\n\n\n3-9\n\n\n3-3\n\n\n6\n\n\n2-28\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH4H1725\n\n\n1-2\n\n\n2-15\n\n\n3\n\n\n1-12\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH4H1738\n\n\n3-15\n\n\n4-4\n\n\n6\n\n\n2-28\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH4H1742\n\n\n3-23\n\n\n2-2\n\n\n6\n\n\n1-9\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH4H1745\n\n\n3-23\n\n\n6-6\n\n\n4\n\n\n1-9\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH4H1750\n\n\n3-30\n\n\n4-17\n\n\n6\n\n\n1-17\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH4H1752\n\n\n3-23\n\n\n1-7\n\n\n4\n\n\n1-5\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 2 shows the heavy and light chain variable region amino acid sequence pairs of selected anti-hTL1A antibodies and their corresponding antibody identifiers.

Binding constants were also determined for the hTL1A variant, Fhm (\nE. coli\n-expressed, residues 72-251 of SEQ ID NO:246 containing Q167R substitution, with or without N-terminal Met). Measurements were conducted on a T100 BIACORE™ instrument. Antibodies, expressed with either mouse Fc (designated with prefix “H2M”) or human IgG4(S108P) Fc (designated with prefix “H4H”), were captured onto an anti-Fc sensor surface, and at least three different concentrations of the soluble TL1A proteins ranging from 1.25 nM to 100 nM were injected over the sensor surface. Kinetic association (k\na\n) and dissociation (k\nd\n) rate constants were determined by fitting the data to a 1:1 binding model using BIAevaluation 4.1 curve fitting software (BIAcore Life Sciences). Molar concentrations of TL1A/Fhm used in the data fitting assumed a monomeric state for TL1A in solution. Binding dissociation equilibrium constants (K\nD\n) and dissociative half-lives (t\n1/2\n) were calculated from the kinetic rate constants as: K\nD\n(M)=k\nd\n/k\na\n; and t\n1/2 \n(min) =[In2/(60*k\nd\n)]. NB: No binding under the conditions tested; NT: Not tested in this experiment; *: Fitted k\nd \nvalues below 1x10\n-6 \n(1/s) are slower than the detection limit under these experimental conditions; therefore, k\nd \nvalues were set at 1×10\n−6 \n(1/s) for the purpose of approximating K\nD \nand t\n1/2\n: **: Equilibrium dissociation constants for antibodies were determined under steady state conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Tables 3 and 4, antibodies bound with high affinity to CHO-expressed forms of both human and monkey TL1A proteins at 25° C. (13 and 12 antibodies with K\nD \n<1 nM, respectively) and at 37° C. (13 and 12 antibodies with K\nD\n<1 nM, respectively). H4H1750P bound significantly weaker to the monkey compared to the human TL1A protein. H4H1704N bound to CHO-expressed mTL1A with K\nD\n<2nM at both 25° C. and 37° C. H4H1818N bound CHO-expressed mTL1A at 25° C. (K\nD\n<7 nM) but not at 37° C. Five antibodies, H4H1681N, H4H1738P, H4H1750P, H4H1752P and H4H1805N, did not bind to CHO-expressed rat TL1A at either 25° C. or 37° C.; the other eight antibodies bound to rat TL1A at both temperatures with K\nD \nranging from ˜0.6 pM to ˜16 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 5, three antibodies (H2M1681N, H4H1752P and H2M1805N) did not demonstrate binding to the \nE. coli\n-expressed Fhm variant [hTL1A(Q167R)] under the conditions tested. Three antibodies (H2M1704N, H4H1725P, and H2M1818N) demonstrated weak binding (K\nD \nranging from ˜60 nM to ˜170 nM) to mouse TL1A expressed in \nE. coli \nas assessed under steady-state conditions, while all other tested antibodies did not bind to the mouse TL1A protein under the tested conditions.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n

TL1A by Anti-hTL1A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nHEK293 cell lines (CRK01573, ATCC) were generated to stably express human DR3 (full-length; SEQ ID NO:252) or mouse DR3 (full-length; SEQ ID NO:259) along with a luciferase reporter [NFκB response element (5×)-luciferase-IRES-GFP]. NFκB activation by TL1A has been shown previously (Migone et al., 2002, \nImmunity \n16:479-492). In order to test the membrane-bound form of TL1A and TL1A variants, HEK293 cell lines were generated that stably express full length human TL1A (SEQ ID NO:244), full-length human TL1A with Gln-167 substituted by Arg [Fhm; TL1A(Q167R); SEQ ID NO:246], full-length TL1A from cynomolgus monkey, Macaca fascicularis (MfTL1A; SEQ ID NO:248), full length mouse TL1A (SEQ ID NO:250), and full length rat TL1A (SEQ ID NO:258). The stable cell lines were isolated and maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Irvine Scientific), Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium(DMEM; Irvine Scientific), non-essential amino acids (NEAA; Irvine Scientific), Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 6418 (Invitrogen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the bioassay, human or mouse DR3 reporter cells were seeded into 96-well assay plates at 1×10\n4 \ncells/well in low serum media, i.e., 0.1% FBS and OPTIMEM® (Invitrogen), and incubated at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \novernight. The next day, soluble TL1A or FHM (sTL1A or sFHM) was serially diluted at 1:3 and added to cells at concentrations ranging from 0.002 nM to 100 nM (plus a buffer control containing no TL1A). For inhibition, antibodies were serially diluted at 1:3 and added to cells at concentrations ranging from 0.002 nM to 100 nM (plus a buffer control containing no antibody) in the presence of constant concentrations of TL1A or Fhm: 800 pM hTL1A (CHO cell-expressed; residues 72-251 of SEQ ID NO:244, with N-terminal His\n6\n-tag), 100 pM hTL1A (\nE. coli\n-expressed; residues 72-251 of SEQ ID NO:244, with or without N-terminal Met), 500 pM Fhm (CHO cell-expressed; residues 72-251 of SEQ ID NO:246), 400 pM MfTL1A (CHO cell-expressed; residues 72-251 of SEQ ID NO:248, with N-terminal His\n6\n-tag), 400 pM MfTL1A (\nE. coli\n-expressed; residues 72-251 of SEQ ID NO:248, with or without N-terminal Met), 50 pM mouse TL1A (CHO cell-expressed; residues 76-252 of SEQ ID NO:250, with N-terminal His\n6\n-tag), 20 pM mouse TL1A (\nE. coli\n-expressed; residues 76-252 of SEQ ID NO:250, with or without N-terminal Met), and 50 pM rat TL1A (CHO cell-expressed; residues 76-252 of SEQ ID NO:258, with N-terminal His\n6\n-tag). Luciferase activity was detected after 5.5 hours of incubation at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. The results are shown in Table 6.

A positive control antibody (control mAb1) inhibited \nE. coli\n-expressed, but not CHO-expressed, hTL1A. Ten antibodies also inhibited stimulation of hDR3-expressing cells by Fhm (hTL1A with Q167R). H4H1681N, H4H1805N and H4H1752P did not fully inhibit Fhm at the highest antibody concentration of 100 nM. All thirteen antibodies also blocked MfTL1A (Table 6). Mouse TL1A (produced from both CHO and \nE. coli\n) stimulated NFκB activation in the hDR3 reporter cells; however, none of the 13 anti-human TL1A antibodies inhibited \nE. coli\n-expressed mouse TL1A in this assay (Table 6). Nine selected antibodies were further tested and did not demonstrate blocking of CHO-expressed mouse TL1A in this assay (Table 6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test the ability of TL1A expressed on cells to stimulate signaling in the hDR3 reporter system, bioassays were performed as described above for soluble TL1A with the following changes: Adherent HEK293/TL1A cells were dissociated using Enzyme-Free Dissociation Solution (Chemicon) and added to adherent hDR3 reporter cells after serially diluting the TL1A cells at 1:2 starting from 2×10\n5 \ncells to 195 cells (plus a no-cell control). For inhibition by antibodies, 1×10\n4 \ncells were added together with serially diluted antibodies from 100 nM to 0.002 nM (plus a control containing no antibody). The results are shown in Table 7. Control mAb1 and mAb2: Same as the assays above.

With cell-bound Fhm, all antibodies inhibited significantly except H4H1681N, H4H1805N, H4H1750P and H4H1752P, which did not inhibit fully at the highest tested antibody concentration of 100 nM. With cell-bound MfTL1A, all antibodies inhibited, except H4H1750 that did not inhibit completely at the highest tested antibody concentration of 100 nM. Six of the antibodies H4H1704N, H4H1804N, H4H1805N, H4H1817N, H4H1725P, and H4H1742P were tested for blocking cell-surface mTL1A stimulation of mDR3 cells; and none showed inhibition. Reporter cells expressing mouse DR3 could also be stimulated by rTL1A-expressing 293 cells, with an observed EC\n50 \nof 9773 cells (Table 7). Four antibodies were tested in the rTL1A/mDR3 assay: three antibodies H4H1804N, H4H1817N, H4H1725P blocked while H4H1805N did not block stimulation of mDR3 cells by cell-surface rTL1A (Table 7). Control mAb1 blocked \nE. coli\n-expressed soluble hTL1A and MfTL1A stimulation of hDR3 cells, but failed to block the CHO-expressed forms of hTL1A and MfTL1A under all tested conditions (Table 6). Control mAb1 also did not inhibit stimulation of hDR3-expressing cells by any of the cell-surface expressed TL1A and Fhm under all tested conditions (Table 7).\n\n\n \n \nExperiment 5: Blocking of TL1A to hDR3 and DcR3 by Anti-TL1A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of antibodies to block human TL1A binding to its cognate receptors, the DR3 and DcR3 receptors, was measured using a competition sandwich ELISA. In addition, blocking of a human TL1A variant FHM (human TL1A Q167R) and the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) TL1A (MfTL1A) protein binding to the human DR3 or DcR3 receptors was measured in the same manner. Constant amounts of biotinylated human TL1A or FHM (both expressed with a 6-His tag in CHO cells) or biotinylated MfTL1A (expressed in CHO cells) were separately titrated with varying amounts of antibodies. The antibody-protein complexes were incubated in solution (1 hr, 25° C.) and then transferred to microtiter plates coated with human DR3 (hDR3) or human DcR3 (hDcR3) expressed as human IgG1 Fc fusion proteins. After one hour at 25° C. the wells were washed, and bound human or monkey TL1A was detected with streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Wells were developed with a TMB solution to produce a colorimetric reaction and quenched with aqueous sulfuric acid before reading absorbance at 450 nm on a Perkin-Elmer Victor X5 plate reader. A sigmoidal dose-response curve was fit to the data using the Prism™ data analysis package. The calculated IC50 value, defined as the concentration of antibody required to block 50% of TL1A binding to hDR3 or hDcR3, was used as an indicator of blocking potency. Both fully human anti-hTL1A mAbs and comparator antibodies, i.e., control mAb1 (an anti-hTL1A antibody with heavy and light chain variable domains having the amino acid sequences corresponding to SEQ ID NOS:21 and 27, respectively, of US 2009/0280116) and control mAb3 (an anti-hTL1A antibody with heavy and light chain variable domains having the amino acid sequences corresponding to SEQ ID NOS:57 and 48, respectively, of US 2009/0280116), were included in the study. The results are shown in Table 8. NB: No binding under the conditions tested; NT: Not tested. Concentrations of biotinylated soluble ligands: (1) 150 pM; (2) 500 pM; (3) 10 pM; and (4) 50 pM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 8, most of the fully human mAbs show effective blocking of the TL1A/hDR3 and TL1A/hDcR3 binding interaction, with several showing IC50 values below 50 pM. Two of the antibodies, H4H1752P and H4H1805N, strongly blocked binding of both human and monkey TL1A binding to both hDR3 and hDcR3 but failed to block binding of FHM to either hDR3 or hDcR3, suggesting that the binding epitope for these two antibodies may involve the region near the FHM mutation site (hTL1A with Q167R). The crystal structure of hTL1A shows that residue Q167 occurs within a surface-exposed loop (Zhan et al., 2009, Biochemistry 48: 7636-7645).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhDR3\n\n\nhDR3\n\n\nhDR3\n\n\nDcR3\n\n\nDcR3\n\n\nDcR3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhTL1A (CHO)\n1\n \n\n\nFHM (CHO)\n1\n \n\n\nMfTL1A (CHO)\n2\n \n\n\nhTL1A (CHO)\n3\n \n\n\nFHM (CHO)\n3\n \n\n\nMfTL1A (CHO)\n4\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb ID\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(pM)\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(pM)\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(pM)\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(pM)\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(pM)\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4H1681N\n\n\n60\n\n\n>10000\n\n\n141\n\n\n17\n\n\n90\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2M1681N\n\n\n37\n\n\n>10000\n\n\n61\n\n\n13\n\n\n234\n\n\n149\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4H1704N\n\n\n30\n\n\n44\n\n\n42\n\n\n77\n\n\n170\n\n\n110\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2M1704N\n\n\nNT\n\n\nNT\n\n\nNT\n\n\nNT\n\n\nNT\n\n\nNT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4H1719P\n\n\n22\n\n\n23\n\n\n46\n\n\n44\n\n\n45\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4H1725P\n\n\n15\n\n\n18\n\n\n16\n\n\n68\n\n\n85\n\n\n145\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4H1738P\n\n\n69\n\n\n152\n\n\n117\n\n\n122\n\n\n150\n\n\n68\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4H1742P\n\n\n64\n\n\n214\n\n\n240\n\n\n181\n\n\n231\n\n\n127\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4H1745P\n\n\n18\n\n\n44\n\n\n50\n\n\n58\n\n\n85\n\n\n118\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4H1750P\n\n\n341\n\n\n589\n\n\n5209\n\n\n656\n\n\n626\n\n\nNB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4H1752P\n\n\n104\n\n\nNB\n\n\n110\n\n\n31\n\n\nNB\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4H1804N\n\n\n40\n\n\n69\n\n\n71\n\n\n175\n\n\n>10000\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2M1804N\n\n\n46\n\n\n102\n\n\n81\n\n\n120\n\n\n>10000\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4H1805N\n\n\n14\n\n\nNB\n\n\n26\n\n\n33\n\n\n436\n\n\n313\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2M1805N\n\n\n6\n\n\nNB\n\n\n13\n\n\n12\n\n\n2241\n\n\n1138\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4H1817N\n\n\n114\n\n\n235\n\n\n101\n\n\n270\n\n\nNT\n\n\n322\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2M1817N\n\n\n154\n\n\n249\n\n\n137\n\n\n890\n\n\n666\n\n\n776\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4H1818N\n\n\n119\n\n\n202\n\n\n123\n\n\n232\n\n\nNT\n\n\n1102\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2M1818N\n\n\n154\n\n\n317\n\n\n239\n\n\n396\n\n\nNB\n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\n\n>10000\n\n\nNB\n\n\n5300\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nNT\n\n\n21000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\n\n>10000\n\n\nNB\n\n\n17000\n\n\n8600\n\n\nNT\n\n\nNT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample 6: Cell Surface Binding Competition of Anti-TUA Antibodies with Soluble hTL1A\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected to over-express cell-surface hTL1A were first stained in a flow cytometric experiment with eight anti-hTL1A antibodies at four concentrations (1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.003 μg/ml). Bound human antibodies were detected using an allophycocyanin-labeled goat F(ab′)\n2 \nspecific for human Fcγ [or anti-hFcγ-APC F(ab′)\n2\n, Jackson ImmunoResearch, #109-136-170]. The lowest antibody concentration providing significant staining levels was then used in a competition binding experiment. A negative isotype control antibody (human IgG4) was used at 1 μg/ml to define the background signal. For the competition experiment, eight antibody samples, at the minimal concentrations identified above, were first treated with soluble hTL1A expressed from CHO cells at concentrations ranging from 0.03 μg/ml to 10 μg/ml. After pre-incubation for 30 min on ice, the antibody/hTL1A mixture was added to 293/HEK-hTL1A cells that had been isolated by centrifugation in a 96-well conical plate. After incubation for an additional 10 minutes on ice, the cells were washed. The secondary reagent, anti-hFcγ-APC F(ab′)\n2\n, was added to all wells at a 200-fold dilution to detect bound antibodies. Samples were incubated for 15 minutes on ice, away from light, and then washed. Cells were processed on an BD™ LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) to detect anti-hTL1A antibodies bound to the cell surface, and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 8.8.6; Tree Star Inc.).

Human CD4\n+\n T-cells were isolated from fresh buffy coats prepared from human blood samples obtained from the New York Blood Center. Cells from a single donor were kept separate from other donor cells for each assay. The CD4\n+\n T-cells were added to the wells of a 96-well plate at 3.5×10\n5 \ncells per well. To each well was then added soluble hTL1A (residues 72-251 of NP 005109.2 with an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag, expressed from CHO cells) to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml (16 nM, assuming hTL1A forming trimers in solution) in RPMI +10% FBS, L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. To each well was also added the anti-hTL1A antibodies or an isotype control antibody to final concentrations of 1.0 μg/ml or 3.0 μg/ml (6.7 nM or 20 nM, respectively). The samples were incubated for 15 minutes at 4° C. in the dark, followed by the additions of anti-hCD3 (BD Pharmingen, cat #555336) and anti-hCD28 (BD Pharmingen, cat # 555725) to each well to final concentrations of 1.0 μg/ml. Samples were incubated for 24 hours at 37° C., the supernatants harvested, and IFN-γ levels determined by ELISA. The blocking effect (average from two separate wells for each condition) of each antibody on each human CD4\n+\n T-cell donor sample is represented as the reduction from maximal signal divided by maximal response window; i.e., % Blocking=[(Max−Inhib)/(Max−Min)]×100, where “Max”, “Inhib”, and “Min” are concentrations of IFN-γ measured for CD4\n+\n human T-cells treated as follows: “Max”—treated with [hTL1A+anti-hCD3+anti-hCD28+isotype control mAb]; “Min:”—treated with [anti-hCD3+anti-hCD28+isotype control mAb]; and “Inhib”—treated with [hTL1A+anti-hCD3+anti-hCD28+anti-hTL1A test mAb]. Antibodies for which IFN-γ blockade surpassed the “Min” baseline level are represented as 100% blockade. Ratio (Max/Min) is the ratio of the IFN-γ concentration produced from human CD4\n+\n T-cells treated under Max and Min conditions as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 10, the antibodies H4H1725P, H4H1805N, H4H1817N, and H4H1804N significantly blocked hTL1A-stimulated IFN-γ release at both 1 μg/ml and 3 μg/ml concentrations, with nearly complete blockade (>80%) observed for most donors at the higher antibody concentration. The results for blockade of IFN-γ secretion by thirteen different anti-hTL1A antibodies against CD4\n+\n T-cells from 10 different human donors are further summarized in Table 11.

A molecule also may be rendered substantially free of naturally associated components by isolation, using purification techniques well known in the art. Molecule purity or homogeneity may be assayed by a number of means well known in the art. For example, the purity of a polypeptide sample may be assayed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining of the gel to visualize the polypeptide using techniques well known in the art. For certain purposes, higher resolution may be provided by using HPLC or other means well known in the art for purification.\n\n\nThe terms “IGF-1R inhibitor” and “IGF-1R antagonist” are used interchangeably. Each is a molecule that detectably inhibits at least one function of IGF-1R. Conversely, an “IGF-1R agonist” is a molecule that detectably increases at least one function of IGF-1R. The inhibition caused by an IGF-1R inhibitor need not be complete so long as it is detectable using an assay. Any assay of a function of IGF-1R can be used, examples of which are provided herein. Examples of functions of IGF-1R that can be inhibited by an IGF-1R inhibitor, or increased by an IGF-1R agonist, include binding to IGF-1, IGF-12, and/or another IGF-1R-activating molecule, kinase activity, downstream signaling, and so on. Examples of types of IGF-1R inhibitors and IGF-1R agonists include, but are not limited to, IGF-1R binding polypeptides such as antigen binding proteins (e.g., IGF-1R inhibiting antiben binding proteins), antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody derivatives.\n\n\nThe terms “peptide,” “polypeptide” and “protein” each refers to a molecule comprising two or more amino acid residues joined to each other by peptide bonds. These terms encompass, e.g., native and artificial proteins, protein fragments and polypeptide analogs (such as muteins, variants, and fusion proteins) of a protein sequence as well as post-translationally, or otherwise covalently or non-covalently, modified proteins. A peptide, polypeptide, or protein may be monomeric or polymeric.\n\n\nThe term “polypeptide fragment” as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion as compared to a corresponding full-length protein. Fragments can be, for example, at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 50, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150 or 200 amino acids in length. Fragments can also be, for example, at most 1,000, 750, 500, 250, 200, 175, 150, 125, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, or 10 amino acids in length. A fragment can further comprise, at either or both of its ends, one or more additional amino acids, for example, a sequence of amino acids from a different naturally-occurring protein (e.g., an Fc or leucine zipper domain) or an artificial amino acid sequence (e.g., an artificial linker sequence).\n\n\nPolypeptides of the invention include polypeptides that have been modified in any way and for any reason, for example, to: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties. Analogs include muteins of a polypeptide. For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (e.g., conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally occurring sequence (e.g., in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts. A “conservative amino acid substitution” is one that does not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterize the parent sequence or are necessary for its functionality). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); Introduction to Protein Structure (C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et al. Nature 354:105 (1991), which are each incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides non-peptide analogs of IGF-1R binding polypeptides. Non-peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed “peptide mimetics” or “peptidomimetics”. Fauchere, J. Adv. Drug Res. 15:29 (1986); Veber and Freidinger TINS p. 392 (1985); and Evans et al. J. Med. Chem. 30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by reference. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a desired biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as a human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: —CH\n2\nNH—, —CH\n2\nS—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH═CH-(cis and trans), —COCH\n2\n—, —CH(OH)CH\n2\n—, and —CH\n2\nSO—, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may also be used to generate more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61:387 (1992), incorporated herein by reference), for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.\n\n\nA “variant” of a polypeptide (e.g., an antibody) comprises an amino acid sequence wherein one or more amino acid residues are inserted into, deleted from and/or substituted into the amino acid sequence relative to another polypeptide sequence. Variants of the invention include fusion proteins.\n\n\nA “derivative” of a polypeptide is a polypeptide (e.g., an antibody) that has been chemically modified, e.g., via conjugation to another chemical moiety such as, for example, polyethylene glycol, albumin (e.g., human serum albumin), phosphorylation, and glycosylation. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “antibody” includes, in addition to antibodies comprising two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light chains, derivatives, variants, fragments, and muteins thereof, examples of which are described below.\n\n\nAn “antigen binding protein” is a protein comprising a portion that binds to an antigen and, optionally, a scaffold or framework portion that allows the antigen binding portion to adopt a conformation that promotes binding of the antigen binding protein to the antigen. Examples of antigen binding proteins include antibodies, antibody fragments (e.g., an antigen binding portion of an antibody), antibody derivatives, and antibody analogs. The antigen binding protein can comprise, for example, an alternative protein scaffold or artificial scaffold with grafted CDRs or CDR derivatives. Such scaffolds include, but are not limited to, antibody-derived scaffolds comprising mutations introduced to, for example, stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the antigen binding protein as well as wholly synthetic scaffolds comprising, for example, a biocompatible polymer. See, for example, Korndorfer et al., 2003, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, \nVolume\n 53, Issue 1:121-129; Roque et al., 2004, Biotechnol. Prog. 20:639-654. In addition, peptide antibody mimetics (“PAMs”) can be used, as well as scaffolds based on antibody mimetics utilizing fibronection components as a scaffold.\n\n\nAn antigen binding protein can have, for example, the structure of a naturally occurring immunoglobulin. An “immunoglobulin” is a tetrameric molecule. In a naturally occurring immunoglobulin, each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one “light” (about 25 kDa) and one “heavy” chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a “J” region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a “D” region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site such that an intact immunoglobulin has two binding sites.\n\n\nNaturally occurring immunoglobulin chains exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. From N-terminus to C-terminus, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat et al. in \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5\nth \nEd., US Dept. of Health and Human Services, PHS, NIH, NIH Publication no. 91-3242, 1991.\n\n\nAn “antibody” refers to an intact immunoglobulin or to an antigen binding portion thereof that competes with the intact antibody for specific binding, unless otherwise specified. Antigen binding portions may be produced by recombinant DNA techniques or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Antigen binding portions include, inter alia, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, domain antibodies (dAbs), and complementarity determining region (CDR) fragments, single-chain antibodies (scFv), chimeric antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, and polypeptides that contain at least a portion of an immunoglobulin that is sufficient to confer specific antigen binding to the polypeptide.\n\n\nA Fab fragment is a monovalent fragment having the V\nL\n, V\nH\n, C\nL \nand \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domains; a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment is a bivalent fragment having two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; a Fd fragment has the V\nH \nand \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domains; an Fv fragment has the V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of a single arm of an antibody; and a dAb fragment has a V\nH \ndomain, a V\nL \ndomain, or an antigen-binding fragment of a V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,846,634, 6,696,245, US App. Pub. No. 05/0202512, 04/0202995, 04/0038291, 04/0009507, 03/0039958, Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546, 1989).\n\n\nA single-chain antibody (scFv) is an antibody in which a V\nL \nand a V\nH \nregion are joined via a linker (e.g., a synthetic sequence of amino acid residues) to form a continuous protein chain wherein the linker is long enough to allow the protein chain to fold back on itself and form a monovalent antigen binding site (see, e.g., Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-26 and Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-83). Diabodies are bivalent antibodies comprising two polypeptide chains, wherein each polypeptide chain comprises V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains joined by a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between two domains on the same chain, thus allowing each domain to pair with a complementary domain on another polypeptide chain (see, e.g., Holliger et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-48, and Poljak et al., 1994, Structure 2:1121-23). If the two polypeptide chains of a diabody are identical, then a diabody resulting from their pairing will have two identical antigen binding sites. Polypeptide chains having different sequences can be used to make a diabody with two different antigen binding sites Similarly, tribodies and tetrabodies are antibodies comprising three and four polypeptide chains, respectively, and forming three and four antigen binding sites, respectively, which can be the same or different.\n\n\nComplementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FR) of a given antibody may be identified using the system described by Kabat et al. in Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., US Dept. of Health and Human Services, PHS, NIH, NIH Publication no. 91-3242, 1991. One or more CDRs may be incorporated into a molecule either covalently or noncovalently to make it an antigen binding protein. An antigen binding protein may incorporate the CDR(s) as part of a larger polypeptide chain, may covalently link the CDR(s) to another polypeptide chain, or may incorporate the CDR(s) noncovalently. The CDRs permit the antigen binding protein to specifically bind to a particular antigen of interest.\n\n\nAn antigen binding protein may have one or more binding sites. If there is more than one binding site, the binding sites may be identical to one another or may be different. For example, a naturally occurring human immunoglobulin typically has two identical binding sites, while a “bispecific” or “bifunctional” antibody has two different binding sites.\n\n\nThe term “human antibody” includes all antibodies that have one or more variable and constant regions derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. In one embodiment, all of the variable and constant domains are derived from human immunoglobulin sequences (a fully human antibody). These antibodies may be prepared in a variety of ways, examples of which are described below, including through the immunization with an antigen of interest of a mouse that is genetically modified to express antibodies derived from human heavy and/or light chain-encoding genes.\n\n\nA humanized antibody has a sequence that differs from the sequence of an antibody derived from a non-human species by one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or additions, such that the humanized antibody is less likely to induce an immune response, and/or induces a less severe immune response, as compared to the non-human species antibody, when it is administered to a human subject. In one embodiment, certain amino acids in the framework and constant domains of the heavy and/or light chains of the non-human species antibody are mutated to produce the humanized antibody. In another embodiment, the constant domain(s) from a human antibody are fused to the variable domain(s) of a non-human species. In another embodiment, one or more amino acid residues in one or more CDR sequences of a non-human antibody are changed to reduce the likely immunogenicity of the non-human antibody when it is administered to a human subject, wherein the changed amino acid residues either are not critical for immunospecific binding of the antibody to its antigen, or the changes to the amino acid sequence that are made are conservative changes, such that the binding of the humanized antibody to the antigen is not significantly worse than the binding of the non-human antibody to the antigen. Examples of how to make humanized antibodies may be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,054,297, 5,886,152 and 5,877,293.\n\n\nThe term “chimeric antibody” refers to an antibody that contains one or more regions from one antibody and one or more regions from one or more other antibodies. In one embodiment, one or more of the CDRs are derived from a human anti-IGF-1R antibody. In another embodiment, all of the CDRs are derived from a human anti-IGF-1R antibody. In another embodiment, the CDRs from more than one human anti-IGF-1R antibodies are mixed and matched in a chimeric antibody. For instance, a chimeric antibody may comprise a CDR1 from the light chain of a first human anti-IGF-1R antibody, a CDR2 and a CDR3 from the light chain of a second human anti-IGF-1R antibody, and the CDRs from the heavy chain from a third anti-IGF-1R antibody. Further, the framework regions may be derived from one of the same anti-IGF-1R antibodies, from one or more different antibodies, such as a human antibody, or from a humanized antibody. In one example of a chimeric antibody, a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with, homologous to, or derived from an antibody from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with, homologous to, or derived from an antibody (-ies) from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. Also included are fragments of such antibodies that exhibit the desired biological activity (i.e., the ability to specifically bind IGF-1R). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 and Morrison, 1985, Science 229:1202-07.\n\n\nA “neutralizing antibody” or “an inhibitory antibody” is an antibody that inhibits the binding of IGF-1R to IGF-I and/or IGF-2 when an excess of the anti-IGF-1R antibody reduces the amount of IGF-I and/or IGF-2 bound to IGF-1R by at least about 20% using the assay described in Example 9. In various embodiments, the antibody reduces the amount of IGF-I and/or IGF-2 bound to IGF-1R by at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 99%, and 99.9%.\n\n\nAn “activating antibody” is an antibody that activates IGF-1R by at least about 20% when added to a cell, tissue or organism expressing IGF-1R, where “100% activation” is the level of activation achieved under physiological conditions by the same molar amount of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2. In various embodiments, the antibody activates IGF-1R activity by at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, 400%, 450%, 500%, 750%, or 1000%.\n\n\nFragments or analogs of antibodies can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art following the teachings of this specification and using techniques well-known in the art. Preferred amino- and carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains. Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Computerized comparison methods can be used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and/or function. Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. See, e.g., Bowie et al., 1991, Science 253:164.\n\n\nA “CDR grafted antibody” is an antibody comprising one or more CDRs derived from an antibody of a particular species or isotype and the framework of another antibody of the same or different species or isotype.\n\n\nA “multi-specific antibody” is an antibody that recognizes more than one epitope on one or more antigens. A subclass of this type of antibody is a “bi-specific antibody” which recognizes two distinct epitopes on the same or different antigens.\n\n\nAn antigen binding protein “specifically binds” to an antigen (e.g., human IGF-1R) if it binds to the antigen with a dissociation constant of 1 nanomolar or less.\n\n\nAn “antigen binding domain,” “antigen binding region,” or “antigen binding site” is a portion of an antigen binding protein that contains amino acid residues (or other moieties) that interact with an antigen and contribute to the antigen binding protein's specificity and affinity for the antigen. For an antibody that specifically binds to its antigen, this will include at least part of at least one of its CDR domains.\n\n\nAn “epitope” is the portion of a molecule that is bound by an antigen binding protein (e.g., by an antibody). An epitope can comprise non-contiguous portions of the molecule (e.g., in a polypeptide, amino acid residues that are not contiguous in the polypeptide's primary sequence but that, in the context of the polypeptide's tertiary and quaternary structure, are near enough to each other to be bound by an antigen binding protein).\n\n\nThe “percent identity” of two polynucleotide or two polypeptide sequences is determined by comparing the sequences using the GAP computer program (a part of the GCG Wisconsin Package, version 10.3 (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.)) using its default parameters.\n\n\nThe terms “polynucleotide,” “oligonucleotide” and “nucleic acid” are used interchangeably throughout and include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA), RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA), analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs (e.g., peptide nucleic acids and non-naturally occurring nucleotide analogs), and hybrids thereof. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules of the invention comprise a contiguous open reading frame encoding an antibody, or a fragment, derivative, mutein, or variant thereof, of the invention.\n\n\nTwo single-stranded polynucleotides are “the complement” of each other if their sequences can be aligned in an anti-parallel orientation such that every nucleotide in one polynucleotide is opposite its complementary nucleotide in the other polynucleotide, without the introduction of gaps, and without unpaired nucleotides at the 5′ or the 3′ end of either sequence. A polynucleotide is “complementary” to another polynucleotide if the two polynucleotides can hybridize to one another under moderately stringent conditions. Thus, a polynucleotide can be complementary to another polynucleotide without being its complement.\n\n\nA “vector” is a nucleic acid that can be used to introduce another nucleic acid linked to it into a cell. One type of vector is a “plasmid,” which refers to a linear or circular double stranded DNA molecule into which additional nucleic acid segments can be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), wherein additional DNA segments can be introduced into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors comprising a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. An “expression vector” is a type of vector that can direct the expression of a chosen polynucleotide.\n\n\nA nucleotide sequence is “operably linked” to a regulatory sequence if the regulatory sequence affects the expression (e.g., the level, timing, or location of expression) of the nucleotide sequence. A “regulatory sequence” is a nucleic acid that affects the expression (e.g., the level, timing, or location of expression) of a nucleic acid to which it is operably linked. The regulatory sequence can, for example, exert its effects directly on the regulated nucleic acid, or through the action of one or more other molecules (e.g., polypeptides that bind to the regulatory sequence and/or the nucleic acid). Examples of regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements (e.g., polyadenylation signals). Further examples of regulatory sequences are described in, for example, Goeddel, 1990, Gene Expression Technology: Methods in \nEnzymology\n 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. and Baron et al., 1995, Nucleic Acids Res. 23:3605-06.\n\n\nA “host cell” is a cell that can be used to express a nucleic acid, e.g., a nucleic acid of the invention. A host cell can be a prokaryote, for example, \nE. coli\n, or it can be a eukaryote, for example, a single-celled eukaryote (e.g., a yeast or other fungus), a plant cell (e.g., a tobacco or tomato plant cell), an animal cell (e.g., a human cell, a monkey cell, a hamster cell, a rat cell, a mouse cell, or an insect cell) or a hybridoma. Examples of host cells include the COS-7 line of monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL 1651) (see Gluzman et al., 1981, Cell 23:175), L cells, C127 cells, 3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 163), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or their derivatives such as Veggie CHO and related cell lines which grow in serum-free media (see Rasmussen et al., 1998, Cytotechnology 28:31) or CHO strain DX-B11, which is deficient in DHFR (see Urlaub et al., 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-20), HeLa cells, BHK (ATCC CRL 10) cell lines, the CV1/EBNA cell line derived from the African green monkey kidney cell line CV1 (ATCC CCL 70) (see McMahan et al., 1991, EMBO J. 10:2821), human embryonic kidney cells such as 293, 293 EBNA or MSR 293, human epidermal A431 cells, human Colo205 cells, other transformed primate cell lines, normal diploid cells, cell strains derived from in vitro culture of primary tissue, primary explants, HL-60, U937, HaK or Jurkat cells. Typically, a host cell is a cultured cell that can be transformed or transfected with a polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid, which can then be expressed in the host cell. The phrase “recombinant host cell” can be used to denote a host cell that has been transformed or transfected with a nucleic acid to be expressed. A host cell also can be a cell that comprises the nucleic acid but does not express it at a desired level unless a regulatory sequence is introduced into the host cell such that it becomes operably linked with the nucleic acid. It is understood that the term host cell refers not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to, e.g., mutation or environmental influence, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein.\n\n\nIGF-1R\n\n\nIGF-1R is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (Blume-Jensen et al., 2001, Nature 411:355-65). The human IGF-1R is synthesized as a 1367 amino acid precursor polypeptide that includes a 30 amino acid signal peptide removed during translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (Swiss-Prot: P08069). The IGF-1R proreceptor is glycosylated and cleaved by a protease at positions 708-711 (counting from the first amino acid following the signal peptide sequence) during maturation in the ER-golgi resulting in the formation of an α-chain (1-707) and a β-chain (712-1337) that remain linked by disulfide bonds (Bhaumick et al., 1981, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 78:4279-83, Chernausek et al., 1981, Biochemistry 20:7345-50, Jacobs et al., 1983, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 80:1228-31, LeBon et al., 1986, J Biol Chem 261:7685-89, Elleman, et al., 2000, Biochem J 347:771-79). The predominant form of the IGF-1R (and INSR) that exists on the cell-surface is a proteolytically processed and glycosylated (αβ)\n2 \ndimer joined covalently by one or more disulfide bonds.\n\n\nThe extracellular portion of the IGF-1R consists of the α-chain and 191 amino acids of the β-chain (712-905). The receptor contains a single transmembrane spanning sequence (906-929) and a 408-residue cytoplasmic domain that includes a functional tyrosine kinase (Rubin et al., 1983, Nature 305:438-440). Comparative sequence analysis has revealed that the IGF-1R is composed of 11 distinct structural motifs (reviewed by Adams et al., 2000, Cell Mol Life Sci 57:1050-93, Marino-Buslje et al., 1998, FEBS Ltrs 441:331-36, Ward et al., 2001, BMC Bioinformatics 2:4). The N-terminal half of the extracellular domain contains two homologous domains referred to as L1 (1-151) and L2 (299-461) (Ward et al., 2001, supra) separated by a cysteine-rich (CR) region (152-298) consisting of several structural modules with disulfide linkages that align with repeating units present in the TNF receptor and laminin (Ward et al., 1995, Proteins 22:141-53). The crystal structure of the L1-CR-L2 domain has been solved (Garrett et al., 1998, Nature 394:395-99). The L2 domain is followed by three fibronectin type III domains (Marino-Buslje et al., 1998, supra, Mulhern et al., 1998, Trends Biochem Sci 23:465-66, Ward et al., 1999, Growth Factors 16:315-22). The first FnIII domain (FnIII-1, 461-579) is 118 amino acids in length. The second FnIII domain (FnIII-2, 580-798) is disrupted by a major insert sequence (ID) of about 120 amino acids in length. The ID domain includes a furin protease cleavage site that separates the α and β chains of the mature receptor. The third FnIII domain (FnIII-3) is located entirely in the β-chain (799-901) terminating several residues before the transmembrane sequence. The catalytic domain of the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase is located between amino acids positions 973-1229, and its structure has been solved (Favelyukis et al., 2001, Nature Structural Biol 8:1058-63, Pautsch et al., 2001, Structure 9:955-65). The kinase is flanked by two regulatory regions, the juxtamembrane region (930-972) and a 108 amino acid C-terminal tail (1220-1337) (Surmacz et al., 1995, Experimental Cell Res 218:370-80, Hongo et al., 1996, Oncogene 12:1231-38). The two regulatory regions contain tyrosine residues that serve as docking sites for signal transducing proteins when phosphorylated by the activated IGF-1R tyrosine kinase (reviewed by Baserga (ed.), 1998 \nThe IGF\n-1 \nReceptor in Normal and Abnormal Growth\n, Hormones and Growth Factors in Development and Neoplasia, Wiley-Liss, Inc., Adams et al., 2000, Cell Mol Life Sci 57:1050-93).\n\n\nThe IGF-1R amino acid sequence is about 70% identical to the insulin receptor (INSR; Swiss-Prot: P06213). The highest homology between the receptors is located in the tyrosine kinase domain (84%); the lowest identity is in the CR region and the C-terminus. The IGF-1R is also highly related (˜55% identical) to the insulin related receptor (IRR; Swiss-Prot: P14616).\n\n\nHuman IGF-1R can be activated by the insulin-like growth factors, IGF-1 and IGF-2 and insulin (INS) (Hill et al., 1985, Pediatric Research 19:879-86). IGF-1 and IGF-2 are encoded nonallelic genes (Brissenden et al., 1984, Nature 310: 781-8, Bell et al., 1985, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 82: 6450-54), and both genes express alternative proteins related by differential RNA splicing and protein processing. The most common and well-studied mature forms of IGF-1 and IGF-2 are respectively 70 and 67 amino acids in length (Jansen et al., 1983, Nature 306:609-11, Dull et al., 1984, Nature 310: 777-81). These proteins (and their isoforms) are identical at 11/21 positions to the insulin A-peptide, and identical at 12/30 positions with the insulin B-peptide.\n\n\nIGF-1R is expressed in all cells types in the normal adult animal except for liver hepatocytes and mature B-cells. Human blood plasma contains high concentrations of IGF-1 and IGF-2, and IGF-1 can be detected in most tissues. The receptor is an integral component of the physiological mechanism controlling organ size and homeostasis. Without being bound to a particular theory, the “Somatomedin Hypothesis” states that Growth Hormone (GH) mediated somatic growth that occurs during childhood and adolescence is dependent on the endocrine form of IGF-1 that is mainly produced and secreted by the liver (Daughaday, 2000, Pediatric Nephrology 14: 537-40). The synthesis of hepatic IGF-1 is stimulated by GH release in the pituitary in response to hypothalamic GHRH (GH releasing hormone). The serum concentration of IGF-1 increases over 100 fold between ages 5-15 in humans. The bioavailability of IGF-1 is regulated by IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) with approximately 99% of the growth factor compartmentalized in the bound state. Primary IGF-1 deficiency arising form partial gene deletions, and secondary IGF-1 deficiency resulting from defects in GH production or signaling are not lethal (Woods, 1999, \nIGF Deficiency \nin Contemporary Endocrinology: The IGF System, R. a. R. Rosenfeld, C. Jr. Totowa, ed.s, Humana Press, NJ: 651-74). The affected individuals exhibit growth retardation at birth, grow slowly and can face certain CNS abnormalities.\n\n\nIGF-1R signaling promotes cell growth and survival through the IRS adapter protein-dependent activation of the PI3Kinase/Akt pathway. IGF-1R transmits a signal to its major substrates, IRS-1 through IRS-4 and the Shc proteins (Blakesley et al., 1999, \nIGF\n-1 \nreceptor function: transducing the IGF\n-1 \nsignal into intracellular events \nin The IGF System, R. G. a. R. Rosenfeld, Jr. C. T. Totowa, ed.s, Humana Press, NJ: 143-63). This results in activation of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase and PI3 Kinase/Akt signaling pathways. However, induction of Akt-mediated cell survival via IRS is the dominant pathway response upon IGF stimulation of most cells. See \nFIG. 10\n.\n\n\nAntigen Binding Proteins\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies, antibody fragments, antibody derivatives, antibody muteins, and antibody variants), that bind to IGF-1R, e.g., human IGF-1R.\n\n\nAntigen binding proteins in accordance with the present invention include antigen binding proteins that inhibit a biological activity of IGF-1R. Examples of such biological activities include binding a signaling molecule (e.g. IGF-1 and/or IGF-2), and transducing a signal in response to binding a signaling molecule.\n\n\nDifferent antigen binding proteins may bind to different domains or epitopes of IGF-1R or act by different mechanisms of action. Examples include but are not limited to antigen binding proteins that interfere with binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R or that inhibit signal transduction. The site of action may be, for example, intracellular (e.g., by interfering with an intracellular signaling cascade) or extracellular. An antigen binding protein need not completely inhibit an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 induced activity to find use in the present invention; rather, antigen binding proteins that reduce a particular activity of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 are contemplated for use as well. (Discussions herein of particular mechanisms of action for IGF-1R-binding antigen binding proteins in treating particular diseases are illustrative only, and the methods presented herein are not bound thereby.)\n\n\nIt has been observed that IGF-1 and IGF-2 each exhibits biphasic binding to IGF-1R. High affinity binding has been reported to have a K\nD \nin the range of 0.2 nM; high affinity binding, about ten fold higher. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an IGF-1R inhibitor that inhibits both the high and low affinity binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-R. It has been suggested that the high affinity binding, rather than the low affinity binding, of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R is required for the conformation change that activates the tyrosine kinase activity of IGF-1R. Thus, in another embodiment, the IGF-1R inhibitor preferentially inhibits the high affinity binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R as compared to the low affinity binding.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides antigen binding proteins that comprise a light chain variable region selected from the group consisting of L1 through L52 and/or a heavy chain variable region selected from the group consisting of H1 through H52, and fragments, derivatives, muteins, and variants thereof (see \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n). Such an antigen binding protein can be denoted using the nomenclature “LxHy”, wherein “x” corresponds to the number of the light chain variable region and “y” corresponds to the number of the heavy chain variable region as they are labeled in \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n. For example, L2H1 refers to an antigen binding protein with a light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of L2 and a heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of H1, as shown in \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n. \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n also indicate the location of the CDR and framework regions of each of these variable domain sequences. The CDR regions of each light and heavy chain also are grouped by type and by sequence similarity in \nFIGS. 4 through 9\n.

MQALQTPZT; iii. QQ(R/S)(N/S)(S/N)ZPLT; and iv. QSYDSSNXJV; b. a heavy chain CDR3 comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of: i. a heavy chain CDR3 sequence that differs by no more than a total of three amino acid additions, substitutions, or deletions from a CDR3 sequence selected from the group consisting of the heavy chain CDR3 sequences of H1-H52 as shown in \nFIG. 9\n; ii. SRLDAFDI; iii. SXYDYYGMDV; iv. HRXDXAWYFDL; and v. DSSG; or c. the light chain CDR3 sequence of (a) and the heavy chain CDR3 sequence of (b); wherein amino acid residue symbols enclosed in parentheses identify alternative residues for the same position in a sequence, each X is independently any amino acid residue, each Z is independently a glycine residue, an alanine residue, a valine residue, a leucine residue, an isoleucine residue, a proline residue, a phenylalanine residue, a methionine residue, a tryptophan residue, or a cysteine residue, each J is independently a glutamine residue, an arginine residue, a valine residue, or a tryptophan residue, and the antigen binding protein binds to human IGF-1R.\n\n\nThe nucleotide sequences of \nFIG. 1\n, or the amino acid sequences of \nFIGS. 2 through 9\n, can be altered, for example, by random mutagenesis or by site-directed mutagenesis (e.g., oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis) to create an altered polynucleotide comprising one or more particular nucleotide substitutions, deletions, or insertions as compared to the non-mutated polynucleotide. Examples of techniques for making such alterations are described in Walder et al., 1986, Gene 42:133; Bauer et al. 1985, Gene 37:73; Craik, BioTechniques, January 1985, 12-19; Smith et al., 1981, \nGenetic Engineering: Principles and Methods\n, Plenum Press; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,518,584 and 4,737,462. These and other methods can be used to make, for example, derivatives of anti-IGF-1R antibodies that have a desired property, for example, increased affinity, avidity, or specificity for IGF-1R, increased activity or stability in vivo or in vitro, or reduced in vivo side-effects as compared to the underivatized antibody.\n\n\nOther derivatives of anti-IGF-1R antibodies within the scope of this invention include covalent or aggregative conjugates of anti-IGF-1R antibodies, or fragments thereof, with other proteins or polypeptides, such as by expression of recombinant fusion proteins comprising heterologous polypeptides fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of an anti-IGF-1R antibody polypeptide. For example, the conjugated peptide may be a heterologous signal (or leader) polypeptide, e.g., the yeast alpha-factor leader, or a peptide such as an epitope tag. Antigen binding protein-containing fusion proteins can comprise peptides added to facilitate purification or identification of antigen binding protein (e.g., poly-His). An antigen binding protein also can be linked to the FLAG peptide Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (DYKDDDDK) (SEQ ID NO:255) as described in Hopp et al., \nBio/Technology \n6:1204, 1988, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,912. The FLAG peptide is highly antigenic and provides an epitope reversibly bound by a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), enabling rapid assay and facile purification of expressed recombinant protein. Reagents useful for preparing fusion proteins in which the FLAG peptide is fused to a given polypeptide are commercially available (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.).\n\n\nOligomers that contain one or more antigen binding proteins may be employed as IGF-1R antagonists. Oligomers may be in the form of covalently-linked or non-covalently-linked dimers, trimers, or higher oligomers. Oligomers comprising two or more antigen binding protein are contemplated for use, with one example being a homodimer. Other oligomers include heterodimers, homotrimers, heterotrimers, homotetramers, heterotetramers, etc.\n\n\nOne embodiment is directed to oligomers comprising multiple antigen binding proteins joined via covalent or non-covalent interactions between peptide moieties fused to theantigen binding proteins. Such peptides may be peptide linkers (spacers), or peptides that have the property of promoting oligomerization. Leucine zippers and certain polypeptides derived from antibodies are among the peptides that can promote oligomerization of antigen binding proteins attached thereto, as described in more detail below.\n\n\nIn particular embodiments, the oligomers comprise from two to four antigen binding proteins. The antigen binding proteins of the oligomer may be in any form, such as any of the forms described above, e.g., variants or fragments. Preferably, the oligomers comprise antigen binding proteins that have IGF-1R binding activity.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an oligomer is prepared using polypeptides derived from immunoglobulins. Preparation of fusion proteins comprising certain heterologous polypeptides fused to various portions of antibody-derived polypeptides (including the Fc domain) has been described, e.g., by Ashkenazi et al., 1991, PNAS USA 88:10535; Byrn et al., 1990, Nature 344:677; and Hollenbaugh et al., 1992 “Construction of Immunoglobulin Fusion Proteins”, in \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology\n, Suppl. 4, pages 10.19.1-10.19.11.\n\n\nOne embodiment of the present invention is directed to a dimer comprising two fusion proteins created by fusing an IGF-1R binding fragment of an anti-IGF-1R antibody to the Fc region of an antibody. The dimer can be made by, for example, inserting a gene fusion encoding the fusion protein into an appropriate expression vector, expressing the gene fusion in host cells transformed with the recombinant expression vector, and allowing the expressed fusion protein to assemble much like antibody molecules, whereupon interchain disulfide bonds form between the Fc moieties to yield the dimer.\n\n\nThe term “Fc polypeptide” as used herein includes native and mutein forms of polypeptides derived from the Fc region of an antibody. Truncated forms of such polypeptides containing the hinge region that promotes dimerization also are included. Fusion proteins comprising Fc moieties (and oligomers formed therefrom) offer the advantage of facile purification by affinity chromatography over Protein A or Protein G columns.\n\n\nOne suitable Fc polypeptide, described in PCT application WO 93/10151 (hereby incorporated by reference), is a single chain polypeptide extending from the N-terminal hinge region to the native C-terminus of the Fc region of a human IgG1 antibody. Another useful Fc polypeptide is the Fc mutein described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,457,035 and in Baum et al., 1994, EMBO J. 13:3992-4001. The amino acid sequence of this mutein is identical to that of the native Fc sequence presented in WO 93/10151, except that \namino acid\n 19 has been changed from Leu to Ala, \namino acid\n 20 has been changed from Leu to Glu, and \namino acid\n 22 has been changed from Gly to Ala. The mutein exhibits reduced affinity for Fc receptors.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the variable portion of the heavy and/or light chains of an anti-IGF-1R antibody may be substituted for the variable portion of an antibody heavy and/or light chain.\n\n\nAlternatively, the oligomer is a fusion protein comprising multiple antigen binding proteins, with or without peptide linkers (spacer peptides). Among the suitable peptide linkers are those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,751,180 and 4,935,233.\n\n\nAnother method for preparing oligomeric antigen binding proteins involves use of a leucine zipper. Leucine zipper domains are peptides that promote oligomerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA-binding proteins (Landschulz et al., 1988, Science 240:1759), and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble oligomeric proteins are described in PCT application WO 94/10308, and the leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD) described in Hoppe et al., 1994, FEBS Letters 344:191, hereby incorporated by reference. The use of a modified leucine zipper that allows for stable trimerization of a heterologous protein fused thereto is described in Fanslow et al., 1994, Semin. Immunol 6:267-78. In one approach, recombinant fusion proteins comprising an anti-IGF-1R antibody fragment or derivative fused to a leucine zipper peptide are expressed in suitable host cells, and the soluble oligomeric anti-IGF-1R antibody fragments or derivatives that form are recovered from the culture supernatant.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides antigen binding proteins that interfere with the binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to an IGF-1R. Such antigen binding proteins can be made against IGF-1R, or a fragment, variant or derivative thereof, and screened in conventional assays for the ability to interfere with binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R. Examples of suitable assays are assays that test the antigen binding proteins for the ability to inhibit binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to cells expressing IGF-1R, or that test antigen binding proteins for the ability to reduce a biological or cellular response that results from the binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to cell surface IGF-1R receptors.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that blocks the binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R but does not significantly block the binding of insulin to insulin receptor (INS-R). In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not bind to INS-R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to the INS-R with such a low affinity that it does not effectively block the binding of insulin to INS-R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to INS-R, but antigen binding protein-bound INS-R can still bind to insulin. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein's selectivity for IGF-1R is at least 50 times greater than its selectivity for insulin receptor. In another embodiment, the selectivity of the antigen binding protein is more than 100 times greater than its selectivity for insulin receptor.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that demonstrates species selectivity. In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to one or more mammalian IGF-1R, for example, to human IGF-1R and one or more of mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, gerbil, cat, rabbit, dog, goat, sheep, cow, horse, camel, and non-human primate IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to one or more primate IGF-1R, for example, to human IGF-1R and one or more of cynomologous, marmoset, rhesus, and chimpanzee IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds specifically to human, cynomologous, marmoset, rhesus, or chimpanzee IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not bind to one or more of mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, gerbil, cat, rabbit, dog, goat, sheep, cow, horse, camel, and non-human primate IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not bind to a New World monkey species such as a marmoset. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally occurring protein other than IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally occurring protein other than mammalian IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally occurring protein other than primate IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally occurring protein other than human IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein specifically binds to mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein specifically binds to mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R with a similar binding affinity. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein blocks binding of human IGF-1 and IGF-2 with mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein blocks binding of human IGF-1 and IGF-2 with mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R with similar K\ni\n. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein blocks binding of human IGF-1 and IGF-2 with mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R with a K\ni \nof between about 0.57 and about 0.61 nM.\n\n\nOne may determine the selectivity of an antigen binding protein for an IGF-1R using methods well known in the art and following the teachings of the specification. For example, one may determine the selectivity using Western blot, FACS, ELISA or RIA.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein (for example, an anti-IGF-1R antibody), that has one or more of the following characteristics: binds to both human and murine IGF-1R, inhibits the binding of both IGF-1 and IGF-2 to human IGF-1R, inhibits the binding of both IGF-1 and IGF-2 to murine IGF-1R, preferentially inhibits the high affinity binding of IGF-1 and/or of IGF-2 to IGF-1R, binds to the L2 domain of IGF-1R, causes relatively little down-regulation of cell-surface expressed IGF-1R after 17 hours of exposure (as compared to MAB391 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, Minn.); e.g., amount of IGF-1R is reduced by less than 20%), causes a level of down-regulation of cell-surface expressed IGF-1R on Colo-205 or MiaPaCa-2 xenograft tumor cells in mice as MAB391 after four weeks of once weekly doses of 200 micrograms.\n\n\nAntigen-binding fragments of antigen binding proteins of the invention may be produced by conventional techniques. Examples of such fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab and F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments. Antibody fragments and derivatives produced by genetic engineering techniques also are contemplated.\n\n\nAdditional embodiments include chimeric antibodies, e.g., humanized versions of non-human (e.g., murine) monoclonal antibodies. Such humanized antibodies may be prepared by known techniques, and offer the advantage of reduced immunogenicity when the antibodies are administered to humans. In one embodiment, a humanized monoclonal antibody comprises the variable domain of a murine antibody (or all or part of the antigen binding site thereof) and a constant domain derived from a human antibody. Alternatively, a humanized antibody fragment may comprise the antigen binding site of a murine monoclonal antibody and a variable domain fragment (lacking the antigen-binding site) derived from a human antibody. Procedures for the production of chimeric and further engineered monoclonal antibodies include those described in Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature 332:323, Liu et al., 1987, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 84:3439, Larrick et al., 1989, Bio/Technology 7:934, and Winter et al., 1993, TIPS 14:139. In one embodiment, the chimeric antibody is a CDR grafted antibody. Techniques for humanizing antibodies are discussed in, e.g., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/194,975 (published Feb. 27, 2003), U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,869,619, 5,225,539, 5,821,337, 5,859,205, Padlan et al., 1995, FASEB J. 9:133-39, and Tamura et al., 2000, J. Immunol 164:1432-41.\n\n\nProcedures have been developed for generating human or partially human antibodies in non-human animals. For example, mice in which one or more endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been inactivated by various means have been prepared. Human immunoglobulin genes have been introduced into the mice to replace the inactivated mouse genes. Antibodies produced in the animal incorporate human immunoglobulin polypeptide chains encoded by the human genetic material introduced into the animal. In one embodiment, a non-human animal, such as a transgenic mouse, is immunized with an IGF-1R polypeptide, such that antibodies directed against the IGF-1R polypeptide are generated in the animal. One example of a suitable immunogen is a soluble human IGF-1R, such as a polypeptide comprising the extracellular domain of the protein of \nFIG. 10\n, or other immunogenic fragment of the protein of \nFIG. 10\n. Examples of techniques for production and use of transgenic animals for the production of human or partially human antibodies are described in U.S. Pat.

Monoclonal antibodies may be produced using any technique known in the art, e.g., by immortalizing spleen cells harvested from the transgenic animal after completion of the immunization schedule. The spleen cells can be immortalized using any technique known in the art, e.g., by fusing them with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas. Myeloma cells for use in hybridoma-producing fusion procedures preferably are non-antibody-producing, have high fusion efficiency, and enzyme deficiencies that render them incapable of growing in certain selective media which support the growth of only the desired fused cells (hybridomas). Examples of suitable cell lines for use in mouse fusions include Sp-20, P3-X63/Ag8, P3-X63-Ag8.653, NS1/1.Ag41, Sp210-Ag14, FO, NSO/U, MPC-11, MPC11-X45-GTG 1.7 and S194/5XX0 Bul; examples of cell lines used in rat fusions include R210.RCY3, Y3-Ag 1.2.3, IR983F and 4B210. Other cell lines useful for cell fusions are U-266, GM1500-GRG2, LICR-LON-HMy2 and UC729-6.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a hybridoma cell line is produced by immunizing an animal (e.g., a transgenic animal having human immunoglobulin sequences) with an IGF-1R immunogen; harvesting spleen cells from the immunized animal; fusing the harvested spleen cells to a myeloma cell line, thereby generating hybridoma cells; establishing hybridoma cell lines from the hybridoma cells, and identifying a hybridoma cell line that produces an antibody that binds an IGF-1R polypeptide. Such hybridoma cell lines, and anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies produced by them, are encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies secreted by a hybridoma cell line can be purified using any technique known in the art. Hybridomas or mAbs may be further screened to identify mAbs with particular properties, such as the ability to block an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 induced activity. Examples of such screens are provided in the examples below.\n\n\nMolecular evolution of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in the center of the antibody binding site also has been used to isolate antibodies with increased affinity, for example, antibodies having increased affinity for c-erbB-2, as described by Schier et al., 1996, J. Mol. Biol. 263:551. Accordingly, such techniques are useful in preparing antibodies to IGF-1R.\n\n\nAntigen binding proteins directed against an IGF-1R can be used, for example, in assays to detect the presence of IGF-1R polypeptides, either in vitro or in vivo. The antigen binding proteins also may be employed in purifying IGF-1R proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography. Those antigen binding proteins that additionally can block binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R may be used to inhibit a biological activity that results from such binding. Blocking antigen binding proteins can be used in the methods of the present invention. Such antigen binding proteins that function as IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 antagonists may be employed in treating any IGF-1 and/or IGF-2-induced condition, including but not limited to cancer. In one embodiment, a human anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody generated by procedures involving immunization of transgenic mice is employed in treating such conditions.\n\n\nAntigen binding proteins may be employed in an in vitro procedure, or administered in vivo to inhibit an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2-induced biological activity. Disorders caused or exacerbated (directly or indirectly) by the interaction of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 with cell surface IGF-1R, examples of which are provided above, thus may be treated. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a therapeutic method comprising in vivo administration of an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 blocking antigen binding protein to a mammal in need thereof in an amount effective for reducing an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2-induced biological activity.\n\n\nAntigen binding proteins of the invention include partially human and fully human monoclonal antibodies that inhibit a biological activity of IGF-1 and also inhibit a biological activity of IGF-2. One embodiment is directed to a human monoclonal antibody that at least partially blocks binding of IGF-1 and of IGF-2 to a cell that expresses human IGF-1R. In one embodiment, the antibodies are generated by immunizing a transgenic mouse with an IGF-1R immunogen. In another embodiment, the immunogen is a human IGF-1R polypeptide (e.g., a soluble fragment comprising all or part of the IGF-1R extracellular domain). Hybridoma cell lines derived from such immunized mice, wherein the hybridoma secretes a monoclonal antibody that binds IGF-1R, also are provided herein.\n\n\nAlthough human, partially human, or humanized antibodies will be suitable for many applications, particularly those involving administration of the antibody to a human subject, other types of antigen binding proteins will be suitable for certain applications. The non-human antibodies of the invention can be, for example, derived from any antibody-producing animal, such as mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, donkey, or non-human primate (such as monkey (e.g., cynomologous or rhesus monkey) or ape (e.g., chimpanzee)). Non-human antibodies of the invention can be used, for example, in in vitro and cell-culture based applications, or any other application where an immune response to the antibody of the invention does not occur, is insignificant, can be prevented, is not a concern, or is desired. In one embodiment, a non-human antibody of the invention is administered to a non-human subject. In another embodiment, the non-human antibody does not elicit an immune response in the non-human subject. In another embodiment, the non-human antibody is from the same species as the non-human subject, e.g., a mouse antibody of the invention is administered to a mouse. An antibody from a particular species can be made by, for example, immunizing an animal of that species with the desired immunogen (e.g., a soluble IGF-1R polypeptide) or using an artificial system for generating antibodies of that species (e.g., a bacterial or phage display-based system for generating antibodies of a particular species), or by converting an antibody from one species into an antibody from another species by replacing, e.g., the constant region of the antibody with a constant region from the other species, or by replacing one or more amino acid residues of the antibody so that it more closely resembles the sequence of an antibody from the other species. In one embodiment, the antibody is a chimeric antibody comprising amino acid sequences derived from antibodies from two or more different species.\n\n\nAntigen binding proteins may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. For example, they may be purified from cells that naturally express them (e.g., an antibody can be purified from a hybridoma that produces it), or produced in recombinant expression systems, using any technique known in the art. See, for example, \nMonoclonal Antibodies, Hybridomas: A New Dimension in Biological Analyses\n, Kennet et al. (eds.), Plenum Press, New York (1980); and \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\n, Harlow and Land (eds.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1988).\n\n\nAny expression system known in the art can be used to make the recombinant polypeptides of the invention. In general, host cells are transformed with a recombinant expression vector that comprises DNA encoding a desired polypeptide. Among the host cells that may be employed are prokaryotes, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for example \nE. coli \nor bacilli. Higher eukaryotic cells include insect cells and established cell lines of mammalian origin. Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include the COS-7 line of monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL 1651) (Gluzman et al., 1981, Cell 23:175), L cells, 293 cells, C127 cells, 3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 163), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, BHK (ATCC CRL 10) cell lines, and the CVI/EBNA cell line derived from the African green monkey kidney cell line CVI (ATCC CCL 70) as described by McMahan et al., 1991, EMBO J. 10: 2821. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts are described by Pouwels et al. (\nCloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual\n, Elsevier, N.Y., 1985).\n\n\nThe transformed cells can be cultured under conditions that promote expression of the polypeptide, and the polypeptide recovered by conventional protein purification procedures. One such purification procedure includes the use of affinity chromatography, e.g., over a matrix having all or a portion (e.g., the extracellular domain) of IGF-1R bound thereto. Polypeptides contemplated for use herein include substantially homogeneous recombinant mammalian anti-IGF-1R antibody polypeptides substantially free of contaminating endogenous materials.\n\n\nAntigen binding proteins may be prepared, and screened for desired properties, by any of a number of known techniques. Certain of the techniques involve isolating a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide chain (or portion thereof) of an antigen binding protein of interest (e.g., an anti-IGF-1R antibody), and manipulating the nucleic acid through recombinant DNA technology. The nucleic acid may be fused to another nucleic acid of interest, or altered (e.g., by mutagenesis or other conventional techniques) to add, delete, or substitute one or more amino acid residues, for example.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides antigen-binding fragments of an anti-IGF-1R antibody of the invention. Such fragments can consist entirely of antibody-derived sequences or can comprise additional sequences. Examples of antigen-binding fragments include Fab, F(ab′)2, single chain antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, and domain antibodies. Other examples are provided in Lunde et al., 2002, Biochem. Soc. Trans. 30:500-06.\n\n\nSingle chain antibodies may be formed by linking heavy and light chain variable domain (Fv region) fragments via an amino acid bridge (short peptide linker), resulting in a single polypeptide chain. Such single-chain Fvs (scFvs) have been prepared by fusing DNA encoding a peptide linker between DNAs encoding the two variable domain polypeptides (V\nL \nand V\nH\n). The resulting polypeptides can fold back on themselves to form antigen-binding monomers, or they can form multimers (e.g., dimers, trimers, or tetramers), depending on the length of a flexible linker between the two variable domains (Kortt et al., 1997, Prot. Eng. 10:423; Kortt et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:95-108). By combining different V\nL \nand V\nH\n-comprising polypeptides, one can form multimeric scFvs that bind to different epitopes (Kriangkum et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:31-40). Techniques developed for the production of single chain antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, 1988, Science 242:423; Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879; Ward et al., 1989, Nature 334:544, de Graaf et al., 2002, Methods Mol Biol. 178:379-87. Single chain antibodies derived from antibodies provided herein include, but are not limited to, scFvs comprising the variable domain combinations L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52) are encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\nAntigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody derivatives) of the invention can comprise any constant region known in the art. The light chain constant region can be, for example, a kappa- or lambda-type light chain constant region, e.g., a human kappa- or lambda-type light chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region can be, for example, an alpha-, delta-, epsilon-, gamma-, or mu-type heavy chain constant regions, e.g., a human alpha-, delta-, epsilon-, gamma-, or mu-type heavy chain constant region. In one embodiment, the light or heavy chain constant region is a fragment, derivative, variant, or mutein of a naturally occurring constant region.\n\n\nTechniques are known for deriving an antibody of a different subclass or isotype from an antibody of interest, i.e., subclass switching Thus, IgG antibodies may be derived from an IgM antibody, for example, and vice versa. Such techniques allow the preparation of new antibodies that possess the antigen-binding properties of a given antibody (the parent antibody), but also exhibit biological properties associated with an antibody isotype or subclass different from that of the parent antibody. Recombinant DNA techniques may be employed. Cloned DNA encoding particular antibody polypeptides may be employed in such procedures, e.g., DNA encoding the constant domain of an antibody of the desired isotype. See also Lantto et al., 2002, Methods Mol. Biol. 178:303-16.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an antigen binding protein of the invention comprises the IgG1 heavy chain domain of \nFIG. 13\n or a fragment of the IgG1 heavy chain domain of \nFIG. 13\n. In another embodiment, an antigen binding protein of the invention comprises the kappa light chain constant chain region of \nFIG. 13\n or a fragment of the kappa light chain constant region of \nFIG. 13\n. In another embodiment, an antigen binding protein of the invention comprises both the IgG1 heavy chain domain, or a fragment thereof, of \nFIG. 13\n and the kappa light chain domain, or a fragment thereof, of \nFIG. 13\n.\n\n\nAccordingly, the antigen binding proteins of the present invention include those comprising, for example, the variable domain combinations L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52, having a desired isotype (for example, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgM, IgE, and IgD) as well as Fab or F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments thereof. Moreover, if an IgG4 is desired, it may also be desired to introduce a point mutation (CPSCP->CPPCP) in the hinge region as described in Bloom et al., 1997, Protein Science 6:407, incorporated by reference herein) to alleviate a tendency to form intra-H chain disulfide bonds that can lead to heterogeneity in the IgG4 antibodies.\n\n\nMoreover, techniques for deriving antigen binding proteins having different properties (i.e., varying affinities for the antigen to which they bind) are also known. One such technique, referred to as chain shuffling, involves displaying immunoglobulin variable domain gene repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, often referred to as phage display. Chain shuffling has been used to prepare high affinity antibodies to the hapten 2-phenyloxazol-5-one, as described by Marks et al., 1992, BioTechnology, 10:779.\n\n\nIn particular embodiments, antigen binding proteins of the present invention have a binding affinity (K\na\n) for IGF-1R of at least 10\n6\n, measured as described in the Examples. In other embodiments, the antigen binding proteins exhibit a K\na \nof at least 10\n7\n, at least 10\n8\n, at least 10\n9\n, or at least 10\n10\n.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that has a low dissociation rate from IGF-1R. In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein has a K\noff \nof 1×10\n−4 \ns\n−1 \nor lower. In another embodiment, the K\noff \nis 5×10\n−5 \ns\n−1 \nor lower. In another embodiment, the K\noff \nis substantially the same as an antibody having a combination of light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequences selected from the group of combinations consisting of L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to IGF-1R with substantially the same K\noff \nas an antibody that comprises one or more CDRs from an antibody having a combination of light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequences selected from the group of combinations consisting of L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to IGF-1R with substantially the same K\noff \nas an antibody that comprises one of the amino acid sequences illustrated in \nFIGS. 2 through 9\n. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to IGF-1R with substantially the same K\noff \nas an antibody that comprises one or more CDRs from an antibody that comprises one of the amino acid sequences illustrated in \nFIGS. 2 through 9\n.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that binds to the L2 domain of human IGF-1R. Antigen binding proteins that bind to the L2 domain can be made using any technique known in the art. For example, such antigen binding proteins can be isolated using the full-length IGF-1R polypeptide (e.g., in a membrane-bound preparation), a soluble extracellular domain fragment of IGF-1R (an example of which is provided in Example 1), or a smaller fragment of the IGF-1R extracellular domain comprising or consisting of the L2 domain (examples of which are provided in Example 10). Antigen binding proteins so isolated can be screened to determine their binding specificity using any method known in the art (an example of which is provided in Example 10).\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that binds to human IGF-1R expressed on the surface of a cell and, when so bound, inhibits IGF-1R signaling activity in the cell without causing a significant reduction in the amount of IGF-1R on the surface of the cell. Any method for determining or estimating the amount of IGF-1R on the surface and/or in the interior of the cell can be used. In one embodiment, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that binds to the L2 domain of a human IGF-1R expressed on the surface of a cell and, when so bound, inhibits IGF-1R signaling activity in the cell without significantly increasing the rate of internalization of the IGF-1R from the surface of the cell. In other embodiments, binding of the antigen binding protein to the IGF-1R-expressing cell causes less than about 75%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 1%, or 0.1% of the cell-surface IGF-1R to be internalized. In another aspect, binding of the antigen binding protein to the IGF-1R-expressing cell causes a gradual reduction in the amount of IGF-1R on the cell surface such that within a few hours of contacting the cell with the antigen binding protein, little or no decrease in cell surface IGF-1R is detected, but, after several days or weeks of exposure of the cell to the antigen binding protein, a marked decrease in cell surface IGF-1R is detected.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein having a half-life of at least one day in vitro or in vivo (e.g., when administered to a human subject). In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein has a half-life of at least three days. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein has a half-life of four days or longer. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein has a half-life of eight days or longer. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein is derivatized or modified such that it has a longer half-life as compared to the underivatized or unmodified antigen binding protein. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein contains one or more point mutations to increase serum half life, such as described in WO 00/09560, published Feb. 24, 2000, incorporated by reference.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides multi-specific antigen binding proteins, for example, bispecific antigen binding protein, e.g., antigen binding protein that bind to two different epitopes of IGF-1R, or to an epitope of IGF-1R and an epitope of another molecule, via two different antigen binding sites or regions. Moreover, bispecific antigen binding protein as disclosed herein can comprise an IGF-1R binding site from one of the herein-described antibodies and a second IGF-1R binding region from another of the herein-described antibodies, including those described herein by reference to other publications. Alternatively, a bispecific antigen binding protein may comprise an antigen binding site from one of the herein described antibodies and a second antigen binding site from another IGF-1R antibody that is known in the art, or from an antibody that is prepared by known methods or the methods described herein.\n\n\nNumerous methods of preparing bispecific antibodies are known in the art, and discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/839,632, filed Apr. 20, 2001 (incorporated by reference herein). Such methods include the use of hybrid-hybridomas as described by Milstein et al., 1983, Nature 305:537, and others (U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,893, U.S. Pat. No. 6,106,833), and chemical coupling of antibody fragments (Brennan et al., 1985, Science 229:81; Glennie et al., 1987, J. Immunol 139:2367; U.S. Pat. No. 6,010,902). Moreover, bispecific antibodies can be produced via recombinant means, for example by using leucine zipper moieties (i.e., from the Fos and Jun proteins, which preferentially form heterodimers; Kostelny et al., 1992, J. Immnol 148:1547) or other lock and key interactive domain structures as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,582,996. Additional useful techniques include those described in Kortt et al., 1997, supra; U.S. Pat. No. 5,959,083; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,706.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the antigen binding protein of the present invention comprises a derivative of an antibody. The derivatized antibody can comprise any molecule or substance that imparts a desired property to the antibody, such as increased half-life in a particular use. The derivatized antibody can comprise, for example, a detectable (or labeling) moiety (e.g., a radioactive, colorimetric, antigenic or enzymatic molecule, a detecable bead (such as a magnetic or electrodense (e.g., gold) bead), or a molecule that binds to another molecule (e.g., biotin or streptavidin)), a therapeutic or diagnostic moiety (e.g., a radioactive, cytotoxic, or pharmaceutically active moiety), or a molecule that increases the suitability of the antibody for a particular use (e.g., administration to a subject, such as a human subject, or other in vivo or in vitro uses). Examples of molecules that can be used to derivatize an antibody include albumin (e.g., human serum albumin) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Albumin-linked and PEGylated derivatives of antibodies can be prepared using techniques well known in the art. In one embodiment, the antibody is conjugated or otherwise linked to transthyretin (TTR) or a TTR variant. The TTR or TTR variant can be chemically modified with, for example, a chemical selected from the group consisting of dextran, poly(n-vinyl pyurrolidone), polyethylene glycols, propropylene glycol homopolymers, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols and polyvinyl alcohols. US Pat. App. No. 20030195154.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides methods of screening for a molecule that binds to IGF-1R using the antigen binding proteins of the present invention. Any suitable screening technique can be used. In one embodiment, an IGF-1R molecule, or a fragment thereof to which an antigen binding protein of the present invention binds, is contacted with the antigen binding protein of the invention and with another molecule, wherein the other molecule binds to IGF-1R if it reduces the binding of the antigen binding protein to IGF-1R. Binding of the antigen binding protein can be detected using any suitable method, e.g., an ELISA. Detection of binding of the antigen binding protein to IGF-1R can be simplified by detectably labeling the antigen binding protein, as discussed above. In another embodiment, the IGF-1R-binding molecule is further analyzed to determine whether it inhibits IGF-1R, IGF-1, and/or IGF-2-mediated signaling.\n\n\nNucleic Acids\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules. The nucleic acids comprise, for example, polynucleotides that encode all or part of an antigen binding protein, for example, one or both chains of an antibody of the invention, or a fragment, derivative, mutein, or variant thereof, polynucleotides sufficient for use as hybridization probes, PCR primers or sequencing primers for identifying, analyzing, mutating or amplifying a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide, anti-sense nucleic acids for inhibiting expression of a polynucleotide, and complementary sequences of the foregoing. The nucleic acids can be any length. They can be, for example, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,500, 3,000, 5,000 or more nucleotides in length, and/or can comprise one or more additional sequences, for example, regulatory sequences, and/or be part of a larger nucleic acid, for example, a vector. The nucleic acids can be single-stranded or double-stranded and can comprise RNA and/or DNA nucleotides, and artificial variants thereof (e.g., peptide nucleic acids).\n\n\nNucleic acids encoding antibody polypeptides (e.g., heavy or light chain, variable domain only, or full length) may be isolated from B-cells of mice that have been immunized with IGF-1R. The nucleic acid may be isolated by conventional procedures such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n provides nucleic acid sequences encoding the variable regions of the heavy and light chain variable regions shown in \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n. The skilled artisan will appreciate that, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, each of the polypeptide sequences in \nFIGS. 2 through 9\n also is encoded by a large number of other nucleic acid sequences. The present invention provides each degenerate nucleotide sequence encoding each antigen binding protein of the invention.\n\n\nThe invention further provides nucleic acids that hybridize to other nucleic acids (e.g., nucleic acids comprising a nucleotide sequence of \nFIG. 1\n) under particular hybridization conditions. Methods for hybridizing nucleic acids are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6. As defined herein, a moderately stringent hybridization condition uses a prewashing solution containing 5× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), hybridization buffer of about 50% formamide, 6×SSC, and a hybridization temperature of 55° C. (or other similar hybridization solutions, such as one containing about 50% formamide, with a hybridization temperature of 42° C.), and washing conditions of 60° C., in 0.5×SSC, 0.1% SDS. A stringent hybridization condition hybridizes in 6×SSC at 45° C., followed by one or more washes in 0.1×SSC, 0.2% SDS at 68° C. Furthermore, one of skill in the art can manipulate the hybridization and/or washing conditions to increase or decrease the stringency of hybridization such that nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences that are at least 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98 or 99% identical to each other typically remain hybridized to each other. The basic parameters affecting the choice of hybridization conditions and guidance for devising suitable conditions are set forth by, for example, Sambrook, Fritsch, and Maniatis (1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., \n \nchapters\n \n 9 and 11; and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1995, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., sections 2.10 and 6.3-6.4), and can be readily determined by those having ordinary skill in the art based on, for example, the length and/or base composition of the DNA.\n\n\nChanges can be introduced by mutation into a nucleic acid, thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide (e.g., an antigen binding protein) that it encodes. Mutations can be introduced using any technique known in the art. In one embodiment, one or more particular amino acid residues are changed using, for example, a site-directed mutagenesis protocol. In another embodiment, one or more randomly selected residues is changed using, for example, a random mutagenesis protocol. However it is made, a mutant polypeptide can be expressed and screened for a desired property (e.g., binding to IGF-1R or blocking the binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R).\n\n\nMutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid without significantly altering the biological activity of a polypeptide that it encodes. For example, one can make nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at non-essential amino acid residues. In one embodiment, a nucleotide sequence provided in \nFIG. 1\n, or a desired fragment, variant, or derivative thereof, is mutated such that it encodes an amino acid sequence comprising one or more deletions or substitutions of amino acid residues that are shown in \nFIGS. 2 through 9\n to be residues where two or more sequences differ. In another embodiment, the mutagenesis inserts an amino acid adjacent to one or more amino acid residues shown in \nFIGS. 2 through 9\n to be residues where two or more sequences differ. Alternatively, one or more mutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid that selectively change the biological activity (e.g., binding of IGF-1R, inhibiting IGF-1 and/or IGF-2, etc.) of a polypeptide that it encodes. For example, the mutation can quantitatively or qualitatively change the biological activity. Examples of quantitative changes include increasing, reducing or eliminating the activity. Examples of qualitative changes include changing the antigen specificity of an antigen binding protein.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides nucleic acid molecules that are suitable for use as primers or hybridization probes for the detection of nucleic acid sequences of the invention. A nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a full-length polypeptide of the invention, for example, a fragment that can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding an active portion (e.g., an IGF-1R binding portion) of a polypeptide of the invention.\n\n\nProbes based on the sequence of a nucleic acid of the invention can be used to detect the nucleic acid or similar nucleic acids, for example, transcripts encoding a polypeptide of the invention. The probe can comprise a label group, e.g., a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. Such probes can be used to identify a cell that expresses the polypeptide.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides vectors comprising a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention or a portion thereof. Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, plasmids, viral vectors, non-episomal mammalian vectors and expression vectors, for example, recombinant expression vectors.\n\n\nThe recombinant expression vectors of the invention can comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell. The recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory sequences, selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, which is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Regulatory sequences include those that direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cells (e.g., SV40 early gene enhancer, Rous sarcoma virus promoter and cytomegalovirus promoter), those that direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory sequences, see Voss et al., 1986, Trends Biochem. Sci. 11:287, Maniatis et al., 1987, Science 236:1237, incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), and those that direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in response to particular treatment or condition (e.g., the metallothionin promoter in mammalian cells and the tet-responsive and/or streptomycin responsive promoter in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems (see id.). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, etc. The expression vectors of the invention can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce proteins or peptides, including fusion proteins or peptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides host cells into which a recombinant expression vector of the invention has been introduced. A host cell can be any prokaryotic cell (for example, \nE. coli\n) or eukaryotic cell (for example, yeast, insect, or mammalian cells (e.g., CHO cells)). Vector DNA can be introduced into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. For stable transfection of mammalian cells, it is known that, depending upon the expression vector and transfection technique used, only a small fraction of cells may integrate the foreign DNA into their genome. In order to identify and select these integrants, a gene that encodes a selectable marker (e.g., for resistance to antibiotics) is generally introduced into the host cells along with the gene of interest. Preferred selectable markers include those which confer resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin and methotrexate. Cells stably transfected with the introduced nucleic acid can be identified by drug selection (e.g., cells that have incorporated the selectable marker gene will survive, while the other cells die), among other methods.\n\n\nIndications\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides methods of treating a subject. The method can, for example, have a generally salubrious effect on the subject, e.g., it can increase the subject's expected longevity. Alternatively, the method can, for example, treat, prevent, cure, relieve, or ameliorate (“treat”) a disease, disorder, condition, or illness (“a condition”). Among the conditions to be treated in accordance with the present invention are conditions characterized by inappropriate expression or activity of IGF-1, IGF-2, and/or IGF-1R. In some such conditions, the expression or activity level is too high, and the treatment comprises administering an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein. In other such conditions, the expression or activity level is too low, and the treatment comprises administering an IGF-1R agonist as described herein.\n\n\nOne example of a type of condition that can be treated using the methods and compositions of the present invention is a condition that involves cell growth, for example, a cancerous condition. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides compositions and methods for treating a cancerous condition. The cancerous condition can be any cancerous condition that can be treated using the compositions comprised herein, for example, IGF-1R antagonizing antigen binding proteins such as anti-IGF-1R antibodies, antibody fragments, or antibody derivatives. Examples of cancerous conditions include, for example, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Adrenocortical Carcinoma, AIDS-Related Cancers, AIDS-Related Lymphoma, Anal Cancer, Childhood Cerebellar Astrocytoma, Childhood Cerebral Astrocytoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer, Bladder Cancer, Osteosarcoma/Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma Bone Cancer, Brain Tumors (e.g., Brain Stem Glioma, Cerebellar Astrocytoma, Cerebral Astrocytoma/Malignant Glioma, Ependymoma, Medulloblastoma, Supratentorial Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors, Visual Pathway and Hypothalamic Glioma), Breast Cancer, Bronchial Adenomas/Carcinoids, Burkitt's Lymphoma, Carcinoid Tumor, Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumor, Carcinoma of Unknown Primary, Primary Central Nervous System, Cerebellar Astrocytoma, Cerebral Astrocytoma/Malignant Glioma, Cervical Cancer, Childhood Cancers, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders, Colon Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma, Endometrial Cancer, Ependymoma, Esophageal Cancer, Ewing's Family of Tumors, Extracranial Germ Cell Tumor, Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumor, Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer, Intraocular Melanoma Eye Cancer, Retinoblastoma Eye Cancer, Gallbladder Cancer, Gastric (Stomach) Cancer, Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumor, Germ Cell Tumors (e.g., Extracranial, Extragonadal, and Ovarian), Gestational Trophoblastic Tumor, Glioma (e.g., Adult, Childhood Brain Stem, Childhood Cerebral Astrocytoma, Childhood Visual Pathway and Hypothalamic), Hairy Cell Leukemia, Head and Neck Cancer, Hepatocellular (Liver) Cancer, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Hypopharyngeal Cancer, Hypothalamic and Visual Pathway Glioma, Intraocular Melanoma, Islet Cell Carcinoma (Endocrine Pancreas), Kaposi's Sarcoma, Kidney (Renal Cell) Cancer, Laryngeal Cancer, Leukemia (e.g., Acute Lymphoblastic, Acute Myeloid, Chronic Lymphocytic, Chronic Myelogenous, and Hairy Cell), Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer, Liver Cancer, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Small Cell Lung Cancer, Lymphoma (e.g., AIDS-Related, Burkitt's, Cutaneous T-Cell, Hodgkin's, Non-Hodgkin's, and Primary Central Nervous System), Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone/Osteosarcoma, Medulloblastoma, Melanoma, Intraocular (Eye) Melanoma, Merkel Cell Carcinoma, Mesothelioma, Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndrome, Multiple Myeloma/Plasma Cell Neoplasm, Mycosis Fungoides, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Diseases, Myelogenous Leukemia, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Multiple Myeloma, Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders, Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinus Cancer, Nasopharyngeal Cancer, Neuroblastoma, Oral Cancer, Oropharyngeal Cancer, Osteosarcoma/Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone, Ovarian Cancer, Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Ovarian Germ Cell Tumor, Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumor, Pancreatic Cancer, Islet Cell Pancreatic Cancer, Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer, Parathyroid Cancer, Penile Cancer, Pheochromocytoma, Pineoblastoma, Pituitary Tumor, Plasma Cell Neoplasm/Multiple Myeloma, Pleuropulmonary Blastoma, Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma, Prostate Cancer, Rectal Cancer, Renal Cell (Kidney) Cancer, Renal Pelvis and Ureter Transitional Cell Cancer, Retinoblastoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma, Salivary Gland Cancer, Soft Tissue Sarcoma, Uterine Sarcoma, Sezary Syndrome, non-Melanoma Skin Cancer, Merkel Cell Skin Carcinoma, Small Intestine Cancer, Soft Tissue Sarcoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma, Testicular Cancer, Thymoma, Thymic Carcinoma, Thyroid Cancer, Gestational Trophoblastic Tumor, Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Site, Cancer of Unknown Primary Site, Urethral Cancer, Endometrial Uterine Cancer, Uterine Sarcoma, Vaginal Cancer, Visual Pathway and Hypothalamic Glioma, Vulvar Cancer, Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, and Wilms' Tumor.\n\n\nFour different groups have studied a total of 425 breast cancers, mostly ductal in origin, and 48 normal tissues or benign specimens by radioimmunoassay (“RIA”) or immunohistochemistry (“IHC”) (Papa et al., 1993, Cancer Research 53: 3736-40, Happerfield et al., 1997, Journal of Pathology 183: 412-17; Ellis et al., 1998, Breast Cancer Research & Treatment 52: 175-84, Lee et al., 1998, Breast Cancer Research & Treatment 47: 295-302, Schnarr et al., 2000, International Journal of Cancer 89: 506-13). These studies suggest that elevated IGF-1R expression, on the order of 5-10 fold, is associated with favorable prognosis and biomarkers (ER+PR+), suggesting that estrogen and IGF cooperate in the maintenance or progression of well differentiated tumor Similarly, estrogen has been shown to be essential for the growth and survival of the ER+MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, and in this context IGF-1R is up-regulated by estrogen treatment (reviewed in Ellis et al., 1998, Breast Cancer Research & Treatment 52: 175-84). Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating breast cancer in a subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein. In another embodiment, the method further comprises administering a hormone inhibitor, e.g., an estrogen inhibitor.\n\n\nA retrospective IGF-1R IHC analysis has been reported for a collection of 12 colonic adenomas, 36 primary colorectal adenocarcinomas and 27 corresponding metastases, and 34 adjacent normal tissues (Hakam et al., 1999, Human Pathology. 30: 1128-33). The frequency of moderate to strong IHC staining appeared to dramatically increase with higher stage and tumor grade (0% normal vs. 93% metastases). The results are consistent with RNA analysis by RNAse protection assay (“RPA”) (Freier et al., 1999, Gut 44: 704-08). Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating colon cancer in a subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein.\n\n\nHigh plasma IGF-1 and reduced IGFbp3 in men 40-80 years old is associated with increased prostate cancer risk (Chan et al., 1998, Science 279: 563-6). High IGF-1 is associated with a risk of other cancers including breast (Hankinson et al., 1998, Lancet 351: 1393-96), colon (Ma et al., 1999, Journal of the National Cancer Institute 91: 620-25) and lung (Yu et al., 1999, Journal of the National Cancer Institute 91: 151-56). In transgenic mouse models, tumor incidence is increased by IGF-1 overexpression in diverse locations (Bol et al., 1997, Oncogene 14: 1725-34; DiGiovanni et al., 2000, Cancer Research 60: 1561-70; DiGiovanni et al., 2000, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 97: 3455-60, Hadsell et al., 2000, Oncogene 19: 889-98). These mouse studies point to a role for both serum and stromal produced IGF-1. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an antagonist of IGF-1R as described herein, wherein the antagonist inhibits the activation of IGF-1R by IGF-1. In another embodiment, the subject has cancer. In another embodiment, the subject has a tumor. In another embodiment, the cancer is prostate, breast, colon or lung cancer.\n\n\nIt has been observed that bone is the major source of IGF-1 in the body. Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides compositions and methods for inhibiting IGF-1R in a bone of a subject. In one embodiment, an IGF-1R inhibitor of the present invention is administered to a subject that has, or is at risk for developing, a tumor in a bone. The tumor can be, for example, a primary tumor or a metastatic tumor. The treatment optionally further comprises administering to the subject one or more additional therapeutic and/or palliative treatments, for example, an anti-tumor treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or anti-hormone therapy) or a treatment that inhibits bone turnover (e.g., denosumab (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.)).\n\n\nIGF-2 is overexpressed in a variety of tumors and stromal tissues. IGF-2 levels appear especially high (as much as 40 fold) in primary liver cancers (Cariani et al., 1988, Cancer Research 48: 6844-49) and adenocarcinoma of the colon (Freier et al., 1999, Gut 44: 704-08). Many of the overgrowth disorders are associated with an increased incidence of childhood tumors. Five to ten percent of individuals with either the prenatal growth disorder Beckwith-Weidmann Syndrome (BWS) or hemihyperplasia develop tumors such as nephroblastoma, adrenal carcinoma, and neuroblastoma (reviewed by Morison et al., 1998, Molecular Medicine Today 4: 110-05). The tumor-predisposing factor in these children appears to be the mosaic loss of maternal IGF-2 gene imprinting, or duplication of the paternal chromosomal arm (11p) that carries IGF-2. Both alterations would increase the level of IGF-2 expression. IGF-2 overexpression as a result of mosaic uniparental disomy or loss of IGF-2 imprinting has also been detected in Wilms tumors. Growth disorders are not observed in these children even though the IGF-2 gene alterations also occur in some normal tissues, perhaps reflecting the tissue distribution of the affected cells. Imprinting of the maternal IGF-2 gene also occurs in mice, and the effects of IGF-2 overexpression are consistent with the human situation (Cariani et al., 1991, Journal of Hepatology 13: 220-26, Schirmacher et al., 1992, Cancer Research 52: 2549-56; Harris et al., 1998, Oncogene 16: 203-09). The incidence of tumors and organomegaly increases in mice that transgenically express excess IGF-2 (Christofori et al., 1994, Nature 369: 414-18, Ward et al., 1994, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 91: 10365-9, Wolf et al., 1994, Endocrinology 135: 1877-86, Bates et al., 1995, British Journal of Cancer 72: 1189-93, Hassan et al., 2000, Cancer Research 60: 1070-76). Local IGF-2 overexpression increases the spontaneous appearance of prostate, mammary, intestinal, liver and epidermal tumors. Plasma specific expression using liver promoters elevate hepatocellular carcinomas and lymphoma. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an antagonist of IGF-1R as described herein, wherein the antagonist inhibits the activation of IGF-1R by IGF-2. In another embodiment, the subject has cancer. In another embodiment, the subject has a tumor. In another embodiment, the subject has liver cancer, adenocarcinoma of the colon, Beckwith-Weidmann Syndrome, hemihyperplasia, nephroblastoma, adrenal carcinoma, neuroblastoma, mosaic loss of maternal IGF-2 gene imprinting, duplication of the paternal chromosomal arm (11p), increased IGF-2 expression, a tumor (e.g., a prostate, mammary, intestinal, liver, epidermal, or Wilms tumor), organomegaly, hepatocellular carcinoma, or lymphoma.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods of preventing or inhibiting a cancer from spreading to another part of the body, or of treating a cancer that has spread to another part of the body. In one embodiment, the cancer has spread to a regional lymph node. In another embodiment, the cancer is metastatic. The primary tumor can be any kind of tumor, for example, an adenocarcinoma tumor (e.g., a prostate adenocarcinoma tumor, a breast carcinoma tumor, or a renal cell carcinoma tumor), a non-small cell or small cell lung cancer tumor, a thyroid cancer tumor, etc. The site of the metastatic tumor can be anywhere in the body. It can be, for example, in bone, the lymph system, lung, brain, eye, skin, pancrease, or liver. In one particular embodiment, a subject having a tumor disease is treated with an effective amount of an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention such that the primary tumor is prevented from metastasizing. In another particular embodiment, a subject having a primary tumor is treated with an effective amount of an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention such that the primary tumor is inhibited from metastasizing. In another particular embodiment, a subject having a metastatic tumor is treated with an effective amount of an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention such that growth or spreading of the secondary tumor is inhibited. In another particular embodiment, a subject having a metastatic tumor is treated with an effective amount of an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention such that the secondary tumor is reduced in size. In a more particular embodiment, the primary tumor is an adenocarcinoma tumor, a non-small cell lung tumor, a small cell lung tumor, or a thyroid cancer. In another more particular embodiment, the metastatic tumor is in a bone. In another more particular embodiment, a metastatic tumor is prevented or inhibited from forming in a bone. In another more particularly defined embodiment, the method comprises treating the subject with an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention and one or more other treatments (e.g., a treatment that kills or inhibits the growth of cancer cells, such as radiation, hormonal therapy, or chemotherapy, or a treatment that inhibits the turnover of bone, such as denosumab), non-limiting examples of which are provided herein. The one or more other treatments can include, for example the standard of care for the subject's particular condition and/or palliative care.\n\n\nWithout being bound to any particular theory, tumor cells appear to depend on the PI3 Kinase/Akt signaling pathway to resist the apoptosis-inducing activity of chemotherapeutics, radiation, and anti-hormone therapy. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides methods of treating a subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to the subject an IGF-1R antagonist of the present invention and a chemotherapeutic, radiation, and/or an anti-hormone therapy. This concept has been validated experimentally in cell culture models and rodent tumor models by antisense and dominant negative mutations (reviewed by Baserga et al., 1997, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1332: F105-26, Baserga, 2000, Oncogene 19: 5574-81). In one embodiment, the chemotherapeutic agents is selected from the group consisting of mitotic inhibitors, alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, intercalating antibiotics, growth factor inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, enzymes, topoisomerase inhibitors, anti-survival agents, biological response modifiers, anti-hormones, e.g. anti-androgens, and anti-angiogenesis agents.\n\n\nOne example of a chemotherapeutic agent that can be administered in combination with an IGF-1 receptor inhibitor of the invention is CPT-11. CPT-11 (Irinotecan hydorchloride trihydrate) is a semi synthetic, water soluble derivative of camptothecin, a plant alkaloid. CPT-11 and an associated metabolite called SN38 inhibit topoisomerase 1 (TOPO1). This enzyme introduces reversible single-strand breaks in DNA that allow unwinding and permit DNA replication to proceed Inhibition of TOPO1 prevents religation of single-strand breaks after DNA replication resulting in greatly increased chromosomal fragmentation. This DNA damage promotes cell death by apoptosis through the action of p53 and other systems that monitor genome integrity. The cytotoxic effect of CPT-11 is generally limited to cells that are replicating DNA (S-Phase). Quiescent cells are largely unaffected.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides treating a subject in need thereof with an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist of the present invention and with an effective amount of an apoptosis-inducing agent.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, an anti-angiogenesis agent, such as an MMP-2 (matrix-metalloproteinase 2) inhibitor, an MMP-9 (matrix-metalloproteinase 9) inhibitor, and/or a COX-II (cyclooxygenase II) inhibitor, is used in conjunction with a compound of the invention. Examples of useful COX-II inhibitors include CELEBREX™ (alecoxib), BEXTRA™ (valdecoxib), and VIOXX™ (rofecoxib). Examples of useful matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors are described in WO 96/33172 (published Oct. 24, 1996), WO 96/27583 (published Mar. 7, 1996), European Patent Application No. 97304971.1 (filed Jul. 8, 1997), European Patent Application No. 99308617.2 (filed Oct. 29, 1999), WO 98/07697 (published Feb. 26, 1998), WO 98/03516 (published Jan. 29, 1998), WO 98/34918 (published Aug. 13, 1998), WO 98/34915 (published Aug. 13, 1998), WO 98/33768 (published Aug. 6, 1998), WO 98/30566 (published Jul. 16, 1998), European Patent Publication 606,046 (published Jul. 13, 1994), European Patent Publication 931,788 (published Jul. 28, 1999), WO 90/05719 (published May 31, 1990), WO 99/52910 (published Oct. 21, 1999), WO 99/52889 (published Oct. 21, 1999), WO 99/29667 (published Jun. 17, 1999), PCT International Application No. PCT/IB98/01113 (filed Jul. 21, 1998), European Patent Application No. 99302232.1 (filed Mar. 25, 1999), Great Britain patent application number 9912961.1 (filed Jun. 3, 1999), U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/148,464 (filed Aug. 12, 1999), U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,949 (issued Jan. 26, 1999), U.S. Pat. No. 5,861,510 (issued Jan. 19, 1999), and European Patent Publication 780,386 (published Jun. 25, 1997), all of which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference. In one embodiment, the MMP inhibitor is one that does not demonstrate arthralgia. In another embodiment, the MMP inhibitor selectively inhibits MMP-2 and/or MMP-9 relative to other matrix-metalloproteinases (i.e., MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-4, MMP-5, MMP-6, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-10, MMP-11, MMP-12, and MMP-13). Some specific examples of MMP inhibitors useful in the present invention are AG-3340, RO 32-3555, RS 13-0830, and the compounds recited in the following list: 3-[[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzene-sulfonyl]-(1-hydroxycarbamoyl-cyclopentyl)-amino]-propionic acid; 3-exo-3-[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-8-oxa-bicyclo[3.2.1]o-ctane-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; (2R,3R) 1-[4-(2-chloro-4-fluoro-ben-zyloxy)-benzenesulfonyl]-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-piperidine-2-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; 4-[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-tetrahydro-py-ran-4-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; 3-[[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfon-yl]-(1-hydroxycarbamoyl-cyclobutyl)-amino]-propionic acid; 4-[4-(4-chloro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-tetrahydro-pyran-4-carboxyl-is acid hydroxyamide; (R) 3-[4-(4-chloro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-te-trahydro-pyran-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; (2R,3R) 1-[4-(4-fluoro-2-methyl-benzyloxy)-benzenesulfonyl]-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-pi-peridine-2-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; 3-[[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenes-ulfonyl]-(1-hydroxycarbamoyl-1-methyl-ethyl)-amino]-propionic acid; 3-[[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonyl]-(4-hydroxycarbamoyl-tetrahydro-pyran-4-yl)-amino]-propionic acid; 3-exo-3-[4-(4-chloro-phenoxy)-benzenesu-lfonylamino]-8-oxa-icyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; 3-endo-3-[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-8-oxa-icyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; and (R) 3-[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-b-enzenesulfonylamino]-tetrahydro-furan-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, derivatives, and other preparations of the compounds.\n\n\nSporadic mutations that inactivate the PETN gene product occur relatively frequently in most human cancers (Yamada et al., 2001, J Cell Sci 114:2375-82, Hill et al., 2002, Pharmacol Therapeut 93:243-51). Loss of PTEN causes the Akt phosphorylated state to persist through loss of the ability to down-regulate stimulatory signals originating from IGF-1R and other sources. The status of the p53 tumor suppressor also influences the activity of the IGF-1R signaling system. In the ground state, the basal or constitutive transcription of IGF-1R is repressed by p53 via an indirect mechanism. Activation of Akt promotes the phosphorylation of mdm2, which then binds the p53 tumor suppressor and promotes its degradation (Mayo et al., 2002, TIBS 27:462-67), resulting in increased IGF-1R expression. A similar outcome is observed when p53 is inactivated by mutation. When transiently expressed in Saos-2 (a human osteosarcoma cell line) and RD (a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line), wild-type p53 is able to suppress the activity of a cotransfected IGF-1R promoter construct, whereas tumor-derived, mutant versions of p53 have no effect. It has been proposed that the increased level of IGF-1R promotes the resistance to apoptosis associated with p53 loss in malignant cells (Werner et al., 2000, Cell Mol Life Sci 57:932-42). Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a cancerous condition in a subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein, wherein the cancerous condition is characterized by cells that have a reduced expression or activity of p53.\n\n\nThe WT1 (Wilms \nkidney tumor suppressor\n 1 protein) also has been shown to bind and repress the IGF-1R promoter. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a cancerous condition in a subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein wherein the cancerous condition is characterized by a reduced expression or activity of WT1.\n\n\nThe proliferation of normal fibroblasts has been shown to require, under defined culture conditions, the combined action of IGF and a stromal growth factor (e.g. PDGF, EGF) to ramp-up Ras/Raf/Map Kinase and promote cell cycle entry (the G0 to G1 transition). Fibroblasts derived from IGF-1R (−/−) mice do not respond to growth factor alone, or most oncogenes (e.g. oncogenic Ras) that activate the Ras/Raf/Map Kinase pathway. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to the subject an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein and an agent that targets a growth factor and/or a growth factor receptor, such as a growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, e.g., the EGFR, HER-2, bcr-abl, VEGFR, Kit, raf, mTOR, CDK1/2, VEGFR2, PKCβ, Mek, and/or KDR. Examples of molecules that target such growth factors and/or receptors include panitumumab (Abgenix, Fremont, Calif./Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Calif.), HERCEPTIN™ (Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.), GLEEVEC™ (Novartis, East Hanover, N.J.), IRESSA™ (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Del.), ERBITUX™, (ImClone, New York, N.Y.), AVASTIN™, (Genentech), PTK787 (Novartis), SU11248 (Pfizer, New York, N.Y.), TARCEVA™ (OSI Pharmaceuticals, Melville, N.Y.), 43-9006 (Bayer, West Haven, Conn.), CCI-779 (Wyeth, Madison, N.J.), RAD001 (Novartis), BMS-387032 (Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, N.Y.), IMC-1C11 (ImClone), LY333531 (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, Ind.), PD 184352 (Pfizer), 2C4 (Genentech), and GW2016 (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, N.C.).\n\n\nThe role of IGF-1R in hematological malignancies has been reviewed by (Novak et al., 2003, \nInsulin\n-\nLike Growth Factors and Hematological Malignancies \nin Insulin-Like Growth Factors, LeRoith et al., ed.s, Landes Bioscience). A functional role for the IGF-1R in hematopoietic malignancies is demonstrated by, for example, the ability of IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies to block transformed cell growth in culture. IGF-I has been found to enhance growth of freshly isolated human acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia blasts. With respect to T cell malignancies, IGF-I has been shown to influence the growth of murine lymphoma cells bearing a pre-T cell phenotype and, immature and mature primary human T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were found to express high numbers of IGF-1R. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides methods of treating a hematological malignancy in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an antagonist of IGF-1R as described herein. In another embodiment, the malignancy is an acute myelogenous leukemia, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or a T cell malignancy.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides methods of identifying subjects who are more likely to benefit from treatment using the compositions and/or methods of treatment of the present invention. Such methods can enable a caregiver to better tailor a therapeutic regimen to a particular subject's needs and reduce the likelihood of an ineffective or counterproductive course of treatment. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of determining whether a subject is a candidate for treatment using a composition or method as described herein comprising determining whether a target cell type in the subject expresses IGF-1R, wherein if the target cell type expresses IGF-1R, then the subject is a candidate for treatment. In another embodiment, the method comprises determining the approximate average number of IGF-1R molecules per target cell, wherein 10\n2\n, 10\n3\n, 10\n4\n, 10\n5\n, or 10\n6 \nIGF-1R per cell indicates that the subject is a candidate for treatment. The approximate average number of IGF-1R molecules per target cell can be determined using any technique known in the art, for example, by staining a sample comprising cells of the target cell type with an IGF-1R binding molecule, and detecting the amount of IGF-1R binding molecule bound to the sample, where the amount of IGF-1R binding molecule detected is proportional to the average number of IGF-1R molecules in the sample. In another embodiment, the method comprises comparing the approximate average number of IGF-1R molecules per target cell to a reference standard, wherein if the approximate average number of IGF-1R molecules per target cell is greater than the reference standard, then the subject is more likely to benefit from treatment using the compositions and/or methods of treatment of the present invention. In another embodiment, the target cell type is a cancerous cell type. In another embodiment, the target cell type is a colon cancer cell type, a breast cancer cell type, an NSCLC cell type, or a leukemic cell type.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a subject who is a candidate for treatment is identified by detecting IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 in the target cell type, or in the stratum of the target cell type. In another embodiment, the target cell type is a cancerous cell type. In another embodiment, the target cell type is a colon cancer cell type, a breast cancer cell type, an NSCLC cell type, or a leukemic cell type.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a subject who is a candidate for treatment is identified by detecting activity of IGF-1R-mediated signaling in the target cell type, wherein IGF-1R-mediated signaling in the target cell type indicates that the subject is a candidate for treatment. Examples of molecules that can be monitored for IGF-1R-dependent changes are shown in \nFIG. 10\n, such as molecules in the PI3/Akt pathway, e.g., IGF-1R, IRS adapters, Akt, etc. Such molecules can be monitored for, for example, a change in phosphorylation status, e.g., an increase in phosphorylation. Phosphospecific antibodies that recognize the activated forms of these protein markers are highly developed, and these reagents have proven to be reliable for immunoblot detection in experimental systems.\n\n\nThe compositions and/or methods of the present invention also can be used, for example, in cosmetic treatments, in veterinary treatments, to increase longevity, to treat reproductive defects, and to treat a variety of growth related disorders.\n\n\nTherapeutic Methods and Administration of Antigen Binding Proteins\n\n\nCertain methods provided herein comprise administering an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein to a subject, thereby reducing an IGF-1-induced biological response that plays a role in a particular condition. In particular embodiments, methods of the invention involve contacting endogenous IGF-1R with an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein, e.g., via administration to a subject or in an ex vivo procedure.\n\n\nThe term “treatment” encompasses alleviation or prevention of at least one symptom or other aspect of a disorder, or reduction of disease severity, and the like. An antigen binding protein need not effect a complete cure, or eradicate every symptom or manifestation of a disease, to constitute a viable therapeutic agent. As is recognized in the pertinent field, drugs employed as therapeutic agents may reduce the severity of a given disease state, but need not abolish every manifestation of the disease to be regarded as useful therapeutic agents. Similarly, a prophylactically administered treatment need not be completely effective in preventing the onset of a condition in order to constitute a viable prophylactic agent. Simply reducing the impact of a disease (for example, by reducing the number or severity of its symptoms, or by increasing the effectiveness of another treatment, or by producing another beneficial effect), or reducing the likelihood that the disease will occur or worsen in a subject, is sufficient. One embodiment of the invention is directed to a method comprising administering to a patient an IGF-1R antagonist in an amount and for a time sufficient to induce a sustained improvement over baseline of an indicator that reflects the severity of the particular disorder.\n\n\nAs is understood in the pertinent field, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the molecules of the invention are administered to a subject in a manner appropriate to the indication. Pharmaceutical compositions may be administered by any suitable technique, including but not limited to parenterally, topically, or by inhalation. If injected, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered, for example, via intra-articular, intravenous, intramuscular, intralesional, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous routes, by bolus injection, or continuous infusion. Localized administration, e.g. at a site of disease or injury is contemplated, as are transdermal delivery and sustained release from implants. Delivery by inhalation includes, for example, nasal or oral inhalation, use of a nebulizer, inhalation of the antagonist in aerosol form, and the like. Other alternatives include eyedrops; oral preparations including pills, syrups, lozenges or chewing gum; and topical preparations such as lotions, gels, sprays, and ointments.\n\n\nUse of antigen binding proteins in ex vivo procedures also is contemplated. For example, a patient's blood or other bodily fluid may be contacted with an antigen binding protein that binds IGF-1R ex vivo. The antigen binding protein may be bound to a suitable insoluble matrix or solid support material.\n\n\nAdvantageously, antigen binding proteins are administered in the form of a composition comprising one or more additional components such as a physiologically acceptable carrier, excipient or diluent. Optionally, the composition additionally comprises one or more physiologically active agents, for example, a second IGF-1 receptor-inhibiting substance, an anti-angiogenic substance, a chemotherapeutic substance, an analgesic substance, etc., non-exclusive examples of which are provided herein. In various particular embodiments, the composition comprises one, two, three, four, five, or six physiologically active agents in addition to an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprise an antigen binding protein of the invention together with one or more substances selected from the group consisting of a buffer, an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid, a low molecular weight polypeptide (such as those having fewer than 10 amino acids), a protein, an amino acid, a carbohydrate such as glucose, sucrose or dextrins, a chelating agent such as EDTA, glutathione, a stabilizer, and an excipient. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with conspecific serum albumin are examples of appropriate diluents. In accordance with appropriate industry standards, preservatives such as benzyl alcohol may also be added. The composition may be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipient solutions (e.g., sucrose) as diluents. Suitable components are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. Further examples of components that may be employed in pharmaceutical formulations are presented in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16\nth \nEd. (1980) and 20\nth \nEd. (2000), Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa.\n\n\nKits for use by medical practitioners include an IGF-1 receptor-inhibiting substance of the invention and a label or other instructions for use in treating any of the conditions discussed herein. In one embodiment, the kit includes a sterile preparation of one or more IGF-1R binding antigen binding proteins, which may be in the form of a composition as disclosed above, and may be in one or more vials.\n\n\nDosages and the frequency of administration may vary according to such factors as the route of administration, the particular antigen binding proteins employed, the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, whether the condition is acute or chronic, and the size and general condition of the subject. Appropriate dosages can be determined by procedures known in the pertinent art, e.g. in clinical trials that may involve dose escalation studies.\n\n\nAn IGF-1 receptor inhibiting substance of the invention may be administered, for example, once or more than once, e.g., at regular intervals over a period of time. In particular embodiments, an antigen binding protein is administered over a period of at least a month or more, e.g., for one, two, or three months or even indefinitely. For treating chronic conditions, long-term treatment is generally most effective. However, for treating acute conditions, administration for shorter periods, e.g. from one to six weeks, may be sufficient. In general, the antigen binding protein is administered until the patient manifests a medically relevant degree of improvement over baseline for the chosen indicator or indicators.\n\n\nParticular embodiments of the present invention involve administering an antigen binding protein at a dosage of from about 1 ng of antigen binding protein per kg of subject's weight per day (“1 ng/kg/day”) to about 10 mg/kg/day, more preferably from about 500 ng/kg/day to about 5 mg/kg/day, and most preferably from about 5 μg/kg/day to about 2 mg/kg/day, to a subject. In additional embodiments, an antigen binding protein is administered to adults one time per week, two times per week, or three or more times per week, to treat an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 mediated disease, condition or disorder, e.g., a medical disorder disclosed herein. If injected, the effective amount of antigen binding protein per adult dose may range from 1-20 mg/m\n2\n, and preferably is about 5-12 mg/m\n2\n. Alternatively, a flat dose may be administered; the amount may range from 5-100 mg/dose. One range for a flat dose is about 20-30 mg per dose. In one embodiment of the invention, a flat dose of 25 mg/dose is repeatedly administered by injection. If a route of administration other than injection is used, the dose is appropriately adjusted in accordance with standard medical practices. One example of a therapeutic regimen involves injecting a dose of about 20-30 mg of antigen binding protein to one to three times per week over a period of at least three weeks, though treatment for longer periods may be necessary to induce the desired degree of improvement. For pediatric subjects (age 4-17), one exemplary suitable regimen involves the subcutaneous injection of 0.4 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 25 mg of antigen binding protein administered two or three times per week.\n\n\nParticular embodiments of the methods provided herein involve subcutaneous injection of from 0.5 mg to 10 mg, preferably from 3 to 5 mg, of an antigen binding protein, once or twice per week. Another embodiment is directed to pulmonary administration (e.g., by nebulizer) of 3 or more mg of antigen binding protein once a week.\n\n\nExamples of therapeutic regimens provided herein comprise subcutaneous injection of an antigen binding protein once a week, at a dose of 1.5 to 3 mg, to treat a condition in which IGF-1R signaling plays a role. Examples of such conditions are provided herein and include, for example, cancer, acromegaly and other overgrowth disorders, diabetes, obesity, macular degeneration, and aging. Weekly administration of antigen binding protein is continued until a desired result is achieved, e.g., the subject's symptoms subside. Treatment may resume as needed, or, alternatively, maintenance doses may be administered.\n\n\nOther examples of therapeutic regimens provided herein comprise subcutaneous or intravenous administration of a dose of 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, or 20 milligrams of an IGF-1R inhibitor of the present invention per kilogram body mass of the subject (mg/kg). The dose can be administered once to the subject, or more than once at a certain interval, for example, once a day, three times a week, twice a week, once a week, three times a month, twice a month, once a month, once every two months, once every three months, once every six months, or once a year. The duration of the treatment, and any changes to the dose and/or frequency of treatment, can be altered or varied during the course of treatment in order to meet the particular needs of the subject.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, an antigen binding protein is administered to the subject in an amount and for a time sufficient to induce an improvement, preferably a sustained improvement, in at least one indicator that reflects the severity of the disorder that is being treated. Various indicators that reflect the extent of the subject's illness, disease or condition may be assessed for determining whether the amount and time of the treatment is sufficient. Such indicators include, for example, clinically recognized indicators of disease severity, symptoms, or manifestations of the disorder in question. In one embodiment, an improvement is considered to be sustained if the subject exhibits the improvement on at least two occasions separated by two to four weeks. The degree of improvement generally is determined by a physician, who may make this determination based on signs, symptoms, biopsies, or other test results, and who may also employ questionnaires that are administered to the subject, such as quality-of-life questionnaires developed for a given disease.\n\n\nElevated levels of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 are associated with a number of disorders, including, for example, cancer (e.g., lung, prostate, breast and colon cancers), and acromegaly and other overgrowth disorders (e.g., constitutionally tall children). Subjects with a given disorder may be screened, to identify those individuals who have elevated IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels, thereby identifying the subjects who may benefit most from treatment with an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein. Thus, treatment methods provided herein optionally comprise a first step of measuring a subject's IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels. An antigen binding protein may be administered to a subject in whom IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels are elevated above normal. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating an overgrowth disorder (e.g., acromegaly) comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an antigen binding protein of the present invention and pegvisomant.\n\n\nA subject's levels of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 may be monitored before, during and/or after treatment with an antigen binding protein, to detect changes, if any, in their levels. For some disorders, the incidence of elevated IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels may vary according to such factors as the stage of the disease or the particular form of the disease. Known techniques may be employed for measuring IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels, e.g., in a subject's serum. IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels in blood samples may be measured using any suitable technique, for example, ELISA.\n\n\nParticular embodiments of methods and compositions of the invention involve the use of an antigen binding protein and one or more additional IGF-1R antagonists, for example, two or more antigen binding proteins of the invention, or an antigen binding protein of the invention and one or more other IGF-1R antagonists. In further embodiments, antigen binding protein are administered alone or in combination with other agents useful for treating the condition with which the patient is afflicted. Examples of such agents include both proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous drugs. When multiple therapeutics are co-administered, dosages may be adjusted accordingly, as is recognized in the pertinent art. “Co-administration” and combination therapy are not limited to simultaneous administration, but also include treatment regimens in which an antigen binding protein is administered at least once during a course of treatment that involves administering at least one other therapeutic agent to the patient.\n\n\nExamples of other agents that may be co-administered with an antigen binding protein are other antigen binding proteins or therapeutic polypeptides that are chosen according to the particular condition to be treated. Alternatively, non-proteinaceous drugs that are useful in treating one of the particular conditions discussed above may be co-administered with an IGF-1R antagonist.\n\n\nCombination Therapy\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject with an IGF-1R inhibiting antigen binding protein and one or more other treatments. In one embodiment, such a combination therapy achieves synergy or an additive effect by, for example, attacking multiple sites or molecular targets in a tumor. Types of combination therapies that can be used in connection with the present invention include inhibiting or activating (as appropriate) multiple nodes in a single disease-related pathway, multiple pathways in a target cell, and multiple cell types within a target tissue (e.g., within a tumor). For example, an IGF-1R inhibitor of the present invention can be combined with a treatment that inhibits IGF-1, promotes apoptosis, inhibits angiogenesis, or inhibits macrophage. In another embodiment, a targeted agent, that, when used by itself, fails to elicit a therapeutically desired effect, could be used to, for example, sensitize cancer cells or augment treatment effect of other agents. In another embodiment, an IGF-1R inhibitor according to the invention is used in combination with a cytotoxic drug or other targeted agent that induces apoptosis. In another embodiment, an IGF-1R inhibitor is used in combination with one or more agents that inhibit different targets that are involved in cell survival (e.g., PKB, mTOR), different receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., ErbB1, ErbB2, c-Met, c-kit), or different cell types (e.g., KDR inhibitors, c-fms). In another embodiment, an IGF-1R inhibitor of the invention is added to the existing standard of care for a particular condition. Examples of therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, gemcitabine, taxol, taxotere, and CPT-11.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a combination therapy method comprises administering to the subject two, three, four, five, six, or more of the IGF-1R agonists or antagonists described herein. In another embodiment, the method comprises administering to the subject two or more treatments that together inhibit or activate (directly or indirectly) IGF-1R-mediated signal transduction. Examples of such methods include using combinations of two or more IGF-1R inhibiting antigen binding progeins, of an IGF-1R inhibiting antigen binding protein and one or more other IGF-1, IGF-2, and/or IGF-1R agonists or antagonists (e.g., IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 binding polypeptides, IGF-1R binding polypeptides, IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 derivatives, anti-IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 antibodies, anti-sense nucleic acids against IGF-1, IGF-2, and/or IGF-1R, or other molecules that bind to IGF-1, IGF-2, and/or IGF-1R polypeptides or nucleic acids), or of an IGF-1R inhibiting antigen binding protein and one or more other treatments (e.g., surgery, ultrasound, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or treatment with another anti-cancer agent), as described, for example, in U.S. Pat.

Furthermore, one or more anti-IGF-1R antibodies or antibody derivatives can be used in combination with one or more molecules or other treatments, wherein the other molecule(s) and/or treatment(s) do not directly bind to or affect IGF-1R, IGF-1, or IGF-2, but which combination is effective for treating or preventing a condition, such as cancer or an overgrowth disorder (e.g., acromegaly). In one embodiment, one or more of the molecule(s) and/or treatment(s) treats or prevents a condition that is caused by one or more of the other molecule(s) or treatment(s) in the course of therapy, e.g., nausea, fatigue, alopecia, cachexia, insomnia, etc. In every case where a combination of molecules and/or other treatments is used, the individual molecule(s) and/or treatment(s) can be administered in any order, over any length of time, which is effective, e.g., simultaneously, consecutively, or alternately. In one embodiment, the method of treatment comprises completing a first course of treatment with one molecule or other treatment before beginning a second course of treatment. The length of time between the end of the first course of treatment and beginning of the second course of treatment can be any length of time that allows the total course of therapy to be effective, e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or even years.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the method comprises administering one or more of the IGF-1R antagonists described herein and one or more other treatments (e.g., a therapeutic or palliative treatment), for example, anti-cancer treatments (such as surgery, ultrasound, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or treatment with another anti-cancer agent). Where a method comprises administering more than one treatment to a subject, it is to be understood that the order, timing, number, concentration, and volume of the administrations is limited only by the medical requirements and limitations of the treatment, i.e., two treatments can be administered to the subject, e.g., simultaneously, consecutively, alternately, or according to any other regimen. Examples of agents that can be administered in combination with the IGF-1R antagonists described herein include, but are not limited to, neutrophil-boosting agents, irinothecan, SN-38, gemcitabine, herstatin, or an IGF-1R-binding herstatin derivative (as described, for example, in U.S. patent Application Ser. No. 05/0272637), AVASTIN® (Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.), HERCEPTIN® (Genentech), RITUXAN® (Genentech), ARIMIDEX® (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Del.), IRESSA® (AstraZeneca), BEXXAR® (Corixa, Seattle, Wash.), ZEVALIN® (Biogen Idec, Cambridge, Mass.), ERBITUX® (Imclone Systems Inc., New York, N.Y.), GEMZAR® (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Ind.), CAMPTOSAR® (Pfizer, New York, N.Y.), GLEEVEC® (Novartis), SU-11248 (Pfizer), BMS-354825 (Bristol-Myers Squibb), panitumumab (Abgenix, Fremont, Calif./Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.), and denosumab (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.).\n\n\nThe following examples, both actual and prophetic, are provided for the purpose of illustrating specific embodiments or features of the instant invention and do not limit its scope.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nPreparation of Antibodies\n\n\nThis example demonstrates a method of preparing antibodies recognizing the IGF-1 receptor. IGF-1 receptor polypeptides may be employed as immunogens in generating monoclonal antibodies by conventional techniques. It is recognized that polypeptides in various forms may be employed as immunogens, e.g., full length proteins, fragments thereof, fusion proteins thereof such as Fc fusions, cells expressing the recombinant protein on the cell surface, etc.\n\n\nTo summarize an example of such a procedure, an IGF-1R immunogen emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant is injected subcutaneously into Lewis rats, in amounts ranging from 10-1004 Three weeks later, the immunized animals are boosted with additional immunogen emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and boosted every three weeks thereafter. Serum samples are periodically taken by retro-orbital bleeding or tail-tip excision for testing by dot-blot assay, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), or inhibition of binding of \n125\nI-IGF-1 or \n125\nI-IGF-2 to extracts of IGF-1R-expressing cells. Following detection an appropriate antibody titer, positive animals are given a final intravenous injection of antigen in saline. Three to four days later, the animals are sacrificed, splenocytes harvested, and fused to the murine myeloma cell line AG8653. The resulting hybridoma cell lines are plated in multiple microtiter plates in a HAT selective medium (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine) to inhibit proliferation of non-fused cells, myeloma hybrids, and spleen cell hybrids.\n\n\nHybridoma clones thus generated are screened for reactivity with IGF-1R. Initial screening of hybridoma supernatants utilizes an antibody capture and binding of partially purified \n125\nI-IGF-1 receptor. Hybridomas that are positive in this screening method are tested by a modified antibody capture to detect hybridoma cells lines that are producing blocking antibody. Hybridomas that secrete a monoclonal antibody capable of inhibiting \n125\nI-IGF-1 binding to cells expressing IGF-1R are thus detected. Such hydridomas then are injected into the peritoneal cavities of nude mice to produce ascites containing high concentrations (>1 mg/ml) of anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody. The resulting monoclonal antibodies may be purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel exclusion chromatography, and/or affinity chromatography based on binding of antibody to Protein G.\n\n\nSimilar methods can be used to generate human antibodies in transgenic mice.

The primers included a Kozak translation initiation sequence (underlined above) preceding the start codon, restriction sites for subsequent subcloning, and a caspace-3 site, which is inserted next to the extracellular domain C-terminus. PCR was performed on a PerkinElmer 2400 (PerkinElmer, Torrance, Calif.) under the following conditions: 1 cycle at 95° C. for 2 min, 23 cycles at 95° C. for 30 sec, 58.5° C. for 30 sec, and 72° C., for 3 min, and 1 cycle at 72° C. for 10 min. Final reaction conditions were 1× pfu TURBO® buffer (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.), 200 μM dNTPs, 2 μM each primer, 5 U pfu TURBO® (Stratagene) and 1 ng template DNA. The PCR product was purified using a Clontech Nucleospin Column (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) according to the manufacturers instructions, digested with Hind III and Sal I (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind.) and gel purified. The human IGF-1R insert was ligated into Hind III/Sal I digested pDSRα-muIgG1. Integrity of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The sequence of the protein encoded by the resulting open reading frame (IGF-1R-C3-muFc) is shown in \nFIG. 10\n.

transfected into AM-1/D CHOd-cells using LT1 lipofection reagent (PanVera Corp., Madison, Wis.), and cells cultured under conditions to allow expression and secretion of protein into the cell media. Twenty-four colonies were selected after 10-14 days on DHFR selection medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1× penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen)) and expression levels evaluated by western blot. To perform this assay, 0.5 ml of serum free medium was added to a single well confluent cells cultured in a 24 well plate (Falcon). The conditioned medium was recovered after 48 hr. Samples for western blotting were run in 10% Tris-glycine gel (Novex), and blotted on 0.45 μm Nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen), using the Mini Trans-Blot cell (Biorad). The blotted membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG Fc antibody, conjugated with Horseradish Peroxidase (Pierce). The clone expressing the highest level of IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-muIgG1Fc was expanded in DHFR selection medium and 2×10\n7 \ncells were inoculated into 50 roller bottles each (Corning) in 250 ml of high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen), 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen), 1× glutamine (Invitrogen), 1× Non essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1× sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Medium was gassed with 10% CO\n2\n/balance air for 5 seconds before capping the roller bottle. Roller bottles were kept at 37° C. on roller racks spinning at 0.75 rpm.\n\n\nWhen cells reached approximately 85-90% confluency (after approximately 5-6 days in culture), growth medium was discarded, cells washed with 100 ml PBS and 200 ml production medium was added (50% DMEM (Invitrogen)/50% F12 (Invitrogen), 1× glutamine (Invitrogen), 1× non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1× sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1.5% DMSO (Sigma)). The conditioned medium was harvested and replaced at one week intervals. The resulting 30 liters of conditioned medium were filtered through a 0.45 μm cellulose acetate filter (Corning, Acton, Mass.).\n\n\nPurification of hu IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-muIgG1Fc\n\n\nThe resulting filtrate from the conditioned medium was concentrated 20-fold using a spiral-wound cartridge (molecular weight cut-off=10 kDa), then diluted 1:1 with 3 M KCl, 1 M glycine, pH 9.0 to bring the final salt concentration to 1.5 M KCl, 0.5 M glycine, pH 9.0. This sample was applied to a rProtein A-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) which had been equilibrated in 1.5 M KCl, 0.5 M glycine, pH 9.0. The column was washed with 40 column volumes of the same buffer, then eluted with 20 column volumes of 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.8. Five-mL fractions were collected and immediately neutralized with 1 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing huIGF1R(ECD)-C3-muIgGFc were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. The yield was 2.4 mg/L of conditioned medium. The major protein species detected were the mature a and 3 chains and murine Fc, each of which appeared to be properly glycosylated based on their elevated and heterogeneous molecular weights. Unprocessed IGF-1R(ECD), as well as glycosylated but not proteolytically cleaved IGF-1R(CED), was also present in the preparation. The shift in bands to higher molecular weights under non-reducing conditions indicates that disulfide linkages joined the a and 3 chains Amino-terminal sequencing of the final product indicated that 60% of the protein was correctly processed between the α- and β-chains of IGF-1R(ECD), while 40% remained unprocessed.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\nIsolation of Human INSR(ECD)-muIgG1\n\n\nThis example presents a method of cloning and expressing a soluble fragment of the human insulin receptor.\n\n\nCloning of pDSRα:huINSR(ECD)-muIgG1Fc\n\n\nPrimers 2830-40:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 259\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′ \nAGC\nAAGCTT\nCCACCATGGGCACCGGGGGCCGG\n 3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Hind III site underlined) and 2830-41:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO: 260\n \n \n \n \n \n5′ \nATTT\nGTCGAC\nTTTTGCAATATTTGACGGGACGTCTAA\n 3′\n \n \n \n \n \n\n(Sal I site underlined) were used to amplify the human INSR extracellular domain (1-929) from and INSR parental plasmid encoding the B form of the INSR splice variant (Ullrich et al., 1985, Nature 313:756-61; Ebina et al., 1985, Cell 40:747-58). The primers included a Kozak translation initiation sequence preceding the start codon and restriction sites for subsequent sub-cloning. PCR was performed on a PerkinElmer 2400 under the following conditions: 1 cycle at 95° C. for 2 min, 32 cycles at 95° C. for 30 sec, 58.5° C. for 30 sec, and 72° C. for 3 min, and 1 cycle at 72° C. for 10 min. Final reaction conditions were 1× pfu TURBO® buffer, 200 μM dNTPs, 2 μM each primer, 5 U pfu TURBO® (Stratagene) and 10 ng template DNA. The PCR product was purified using a NUCLEOSPIN® Column (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, digested with Hind III and Sal I (Roche), and gel purified prior to ligation into Hind III/Sal I digested pDSRα-muIgG1. The integrity of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The protein sequence of the INSR-muFc is shown in \nFIG. 11\n.

\n\nExpression of hu INSR(ECD)-C3-muIgG1Fc\n\n\n\nAM-1/D CHOd-cells were transfected with 15 μm of linearized expression vector pDSRα:huINSR(ECD)-muIgG1Fc using \nFUGENE™\n 6 lipofection reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, Ind.), then cultured under conditions to allow expression and secretion of protein into the cell medium. Colonies were selected and analyzed as described above.\n\n\nPurification of hu INSR(ECD)-C3-muIgG1Fc\n\n\nThe filtered conditioned medium containing huINSR(ECD)-mulgGFc was concentrated 17-fold using a spiral-wound cartridge (molecular weight cut-off=10 kDa), then diluted 1:1 with 3 M KCl, 1 M glycine, pH 9.0 to bring the final salt concentration to 1.5 M KCl, 0.5 M glycine, pH 9.0. This sample was applied to a rProtein A-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) which had been equilibrated in 1.5 M KCl, 0.5 M glycine, pH 9.0. The column was washed with 40 column volumes of the same buffer, then eluted with 20 column volumes of 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.8. Five-mL fractions were collected and immediately neutralized with 1-mL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing huINSR(ECD)-muIgGFc were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. The yield was 0.9 mg/L of conditioned medium. The major protein species were the mature α and β chains and murine Fc. Each of these species appeared to be properly glycosylated based on its elevated and heterogeneous molecular weight. Unprocessed INSR (ECD) as well as glycosylated but not proteolytically cleaved INSR (CED) also was present in the preparation. The shift in bands to higher molecular weights under non-reducing conditions indicated that disulfide linkages joined the α and β chains Amino-terminal sequencing of the final product indicated that 87% of the protein was correctly processed between the α- and β-chains of INSR(ECD), while 13% remained unprocessed.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\nInitial Screen for Anti-IGF-1R Phage Fab\n\n\nThis example provides a method of identifying anti-IGF-1R antibodies.\n\n\nA Target Quest Q Fab library (“the TQ library”; Target Quest, Maastricht, the Netherlands), which was constructed using peripheral blood lymphocytes from four healthy donors and splenic lymphocytes from one patient with gastric carcinoma, was obtained. The library diversity was 3.7×10\n10 \nclones, containing 3×10\n9 \nheavy chains. The source, screening methods, and characterization of the library have been published (de Haard et al, 1999, J Biol Chem 274:18218-30). Dynabeads (200 μl) M-450 Uncoated (catalog #140.02, Dynal, Lake Success, N.Y.) were washed 3 times with PBS, resuspended in 200 μl of IGF1R(ECD)-C3-mFc to a concentration of 0.5 μM in PBS, and incubated at 4° C. on a rotator overnight. The IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-mFc coated beads were washed 3× with 1 ml of 2% non-fat dry milk (M) in PBS (2% MPBS), and then blocked with 1 ml of 2% MPBS at room temperature for 1 hour. In parallel, 750 μl of the TQ library (4×10\n12 \npfu) was preblocked by mixing with 250 \nμl\n 8% MPBS at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 500 μl of blocked beads were transferred into another microfuge tube and separated from the blocking solution on a magnetic separator. The preblocked phage mixture was added to the blocked beads and incubated for 90 minutes on a rotator at room temperature. Bead-bound phage were separated from the unbound phage, and then washed 6× with 1 \nml\n 2% MPBS/0.1\n \n% Tween\n \n 20, 6× with 1 ml PBS/0.1\n \n% Tween\n \n 20, 2× with PBS with a change of tubes between different wash solutions. Bound phage was eluted with 1 ml of 0.1M TEA (pH11) for 10 minutes, then immediately separated from the beads and neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1 M Tris.HCl. The eluted phage pool was mixed with 4 \nml\n 2× YT broth (10 g yeast extract, 16 g bacto-tryptone, 5 g NaCl per liter of water) and 5 ml of TG1 bacterial culture (O.D.\n590 \nabout 0.5) in a 50-ml conical tube. The infection mixture was incubate at 37° C. in an incubator for 30 min., then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 20 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1500 \nμl\n 2×YT-CG broth and 300 μl were spread on each of five 2×YT-CG (2× YT broth containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 2% glucose) plates. After 20 hours of incubation at 30° C., 4 ml of 2× YT-AG were added to each plate and the cells were recovered with cell scraper from the plates. This step was repeated three times. A small portion of the recovered cells was used for phage rescue (see below). The remaining cell suspension was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 20 min. The cell pellet was suspended into an amount of 50% glycerol roughly half the volume of the pellet size and stored at −80° C.\n\n\nIn order to rescue phage, the plated-amplified cell suspension was used to inoculate 40 ml of 2×YT-CG to an OD\n590 \nof about 0.05. The culture was incubated at 37° C. on a shaker to OD\n590 \n0.5. The log phase culture was infected with M13KO7 helper phage (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, Md., catalog #18311-019, 1.1×10\n11 \npfu/ml) at M.O.I. 20 followed by incubation at 37° C. for 30 min. The infected cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 200 ml of 2×YT-CK (100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 40 μg/ml kanamycin) and transferred to two 250-ml flasks and incubated at 30° C. with shaking at 270 rpm for 20 hours. The over-night culture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min to removal cell debris. The centrifugation was repeated to ensure the removal of cell debris. About ⅕ volume of PEG solution (20% PEG 8000, 2.5 M NaCl) was added to the supernatant to precipitate the phage particles. The mixture was incubated on ice for at least 1 hour, followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min to collect the precipitated phage particles. The phage pellet was re-suspended into 1 ml of PBS and transferred to a microfuge tube. The phage suspension was left on ice for 1 hour to allow complete suspension of phage particles, and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min to remove the residual cell debris. Phage precipitation step was repeated. The final phage pellet was suspended into PBS after clarification. The rescued phage suspension was used in the next round of selection.\n\n\nFour rounds of selection were performed that included alterations of various standard binding parameters. The second round of selection was identical to the first round of selection. Variations in input phage number and elution reagent were introduced in rounds three and four. For the round three selection, 5×10\n11 \npfu of phages were selected and bound phages were eluted either with 1 μM IGF-1 (catalog #I3769, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) or with a 1 μM concentration of a chimeric cdR3-huFc antibody to yield two round-three pools, TQ4-3IS and TQ4-3CA. Round four selection was carried out on rescued phage pools from both round three pools. Two rounds of negative selection with mouse IgG Fc-coated DYNABEADS® (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) were included to remove mouse Fc binders prior to actual IGF-1R selection. The incubation time for negative selection was 30 minutes each. 3.78×10\n11 \npfu of TQ4-3IS pool and 3.75×10\n12 \npfu of TQ4-3CA pool were selected separately. Bound phage were eluted with 1 μM IGF-2 (catalog #I2526, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) to yield two round-4 pools, TQ4-41512 and TQ4-4CAI2. The sequence of about 96-192 phage DNA inserts was determined at each elution step.\n\n\nIn some cases, a secondary screen was done. Phagemid DNA mixtures of the total TQ library, and the selected phage amplified after several rounds of selection against IGF-1R, were prepared using a DNA Maxiprep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.). All four DNA preparations were digested with Asc I and EcoR I (New England Biolab, Beverly, Mass.). The resulting two Asc I/EcoR I fragments were separated on preparative 0.5% agarose gels. The 2.1 kb fragments containing heavy chains were gel purified from the IGF-1R selected phage. The 3.9 kb fragments containing the light chains and pCES1 vector portion were gel purified from the total TQ library DNA. The 2.1 kb fragments were ligated to the 3.9 kb fragments from the DNA sample of TQ library in 3:1 ratio. The ligated DNA was precipitated and used to transform TG1 cells by electroporation. The library size of the resulted light chain shuffled secondary library was 8.8×10\n8\n. After sequencing 96 randomly picked clones, 76 unique light chain sequences were obtained, indicating that the attempt to shuffle light chains was successful.\n\n\nThe binding, washing and elution condition for screening the light chain shuffle library were essentially the same as described for the initial screen. However, several variations were included to increase selection pressure for amplification of IGF-1R binders with higher affinities, especially those with significantly slower off-rates. These parameters were: higher number of input phage (2-2.7×10\n13 \npfu), smaller bead volume (100 μl for round one, 50 μl for round two, and 25 μl for round three), and extended specific elution time up to 20 hours. Elution buffers were 0.1 M TEA for round one (RD1), 1 μM IGF-1 in 0.4% MPBS for RD2 and 1 μM IGF-1 or IGF-2 in 0.4% MPBS for RD3. In RD2 and RD3, binders that were eluted in 15 min or 2 hours were discarded. Elution was continued and eluted phages were collected after 8-10 hours and again after 20 hours.\n\n\nPhage Fab ELISA Screen\n\n\nIn 96-well 2-ml deep-well blocks, 480 μl/well 2×YT-CG broth was inoculated with 20 μl of overnight cultures of the individual clones, then incubated at 37° C., 300 rpm for 3 hours. To each well, 50 μl of 1:3 diluted M13KO7 helper phage were added to infect the cells. The block was incubated at 37° C. without shaking for 30 minutes, and then shaken gently for another 30 minutes at 150 rpm. The block was centrifuged at 3600 rpm for 20 minutes to pellet the infected cells. The cell pellet in each well was suspended into 480 μl of 2×YT-CK (2×YT broth containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 40 μg/ml kanamycin), and incubated at 30° C. overnight for about 20 hours. The cell debris was separated by centrifugation at 3600 rpm for 20 minutes. The rescued phage supernatant was used in the phage ELISA to check for IGF-1R-specific, INSR-cross reactive, or mouse Fc binding of individual clones.\n\n\nThree sets of Nunc MaxiSorb Immunoplates were coated with 100 μ/well of IGF-1R-C3-mFc at 5 μg/ml, INSR-mFc at 5 μg/ml, or mouse IgG1 (catalog #010-0103, Rockland, Gilbertsville, Pa.) at 2 μg/ml in PBS, respectively, at 4° C. overnight. The coated plates were washed 3× with 300 μg/well of PBS. The washed plates were blocked with 300 μl/well 2% MPBS at room temperature for one hour. Meanwhile, rescued phages of individual clones were pre-blocked by mixing 170 μl of rescued phage with 170 μl of 4% MPBS. The blocked plates were washed 5× with 300 μl/well TBST (TBS: 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl; Tween-20. 0.1%). 100 μl/well of pre-blocked phage dilutions were distributed to each set of coated plate, which were incubated at room temperature on a rocker for 90 minutes. The plates were washed 5× with 300 μl/well TBST. 100 μl/well of anti-M13-HRP in 2% MPBS (1:3000 dilution, catalog number 27-9421-01, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were distributed, and plates were incubated at room temperature on rocker for one hour. The plates were washed 5× with 300 μl/well TBST. 100 μl/well of the substrate 1-Step™ ABTS (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Ill., catalog number 37615) were added. Plates were incubated for one hour. OD\n405 \nwas measured for signal detection.\n\n\nThe phage displayed antibodies exhibited essentially no crossreactivity with the insulin receptor and murine Fc domain. The signal observed in the IGF-1R ELISA is therefore specific for the IGF-1R extracellular domain. Results from similar assays for four of the phage-displayed antibodies are shown in \nFIG. 14\n.\n\n\nThe DNA inserts of IGF-1R positive, INSR and mu IgG1 negative, clones were sequenced. Fifty-two unique Fab sequences were identified, having the following combinations of light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequences: L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52, wherein “Lx” indicates light chain variable domain number “x” and “Hx” indicates heavy chain variable domain number “x.” \nFIG. 1\n presents the polynucleotide sequences of each of these light and heavy variable domains. \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n present the corresponding amino acid sequences.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nSubcloning of V\nH \nand V\nL \ninto IgG1 Expression Vectors\n\n\nThis example presents a method of subcloning the previously identified variable domain sequences into an IgG1 expression vector.\n\n\nConstruction of DSRα20 and DSRα20:hIG1C\nH \n \n\n\nThe pDSRα20:hIgG1C\nH \nexpression vector (WO 90/14363) was a derivative of pDSR19:hIgG1C\nH \n(see U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/370,407, filed Apr. 5, 2002, “Human Anti-OPGL Neutralizing Antibodies As Selective OPGL Pathway Inhibitors,” incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The pDSRα19:hIgG1C\nH \nplasmid encoded a rat variable region/human constant region IgG1 (rVh/hCh1). The plasmid was constructed by the three-piece ligation of Xba I and BsmB I terminated rat antibody variable region PCR product, the human IgG1 constant region (C\nH1\n, hinge, C\nH2 \nand C\nH3 \ndomains) derived by Sal I cleavage and gel isolation of the BsmB I and Sal I fragment from the linear plasmid pDSRα19:hIgG1C\nH \n(Hind III and BsmB I ends) and a linearized pDSRα19 with Xba I and Sal I ends. pDSRα20 was produced by changing nucleotide 2563 in pDSRα19 from a guanosine to an adenosine by site directed mutagenesis. The heavy chain expression vector, pDSRα20:hIgG1C\nH \nrat variable region/human constant region IgG1 (rVh/hCh1), is 6163 base pairs and contains the 7 functional regions described in Table

This fragment was then ligated along with a human kappa constant region (\nFIG. 13\n) with a compatible BsmB I on the 5′ end and a 3′Sal I ends into pDSRα20 with Xba I and Sal I ends.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\nTransient Expression of Antibodies\n\n\nThis example provides a method of transiently expressing anti-IGF-1R antibodies.\n\n\nThe antibodies were expressed transiently in serum-free suspension adapted 293T cells. All transfections were performed as 250 mL cultures. Briefly, 1.25×10\n8 \ncells (5.0×10\n5 \ncells/mL×250 mL) were centrifuged at 2,500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4° C. to remove the conditioned medium. The cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM and centrifuged again at 2,500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4° C. After aspirating the wash solution, the cells were resuspended in growth medium [DMEM/F12 (3:1)+1× Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium Supplement+1× Pen Strep Glut+2 mM L-Glutamine+20 mM HEPES+0.01% Pluronic F68] in a 500 mL spinner flask culture. The spinner flask culture was maintained on magnetic stir plate at 125 RPM which was placed in a humidified incubator maintained at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. The plasmid DNA was incubated with the transfection reagent in a 50 mL conical tube. The DNA-transfection reagent complex was prepared in 5% of the final culture volume in serum-free DMEM. One microgram of plasmid DNA per milliliter of culture was first added to serum-free DMEM, followed by 1 μl X-TremeGene RO-1539/mL culture. The complexes were incubated at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes and then added to the cells in the spinner flask. The transfection/expression was performed for 7 days, after which the conditioned medium was harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 RPM for 60 minutes at 4° C.\n\n\nIf the initial transfection failed to yield the required 100 μg purified antibody, those clones were re-expressed in roller bottles. These transfections used 293T adherent cells grown and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS+1× Non-Essential Amino Acids+1× Pen Strep Glut+1× Sodium Pyruvate. Approximately, 4-5×10\n7 \n293T cells were seeded in a 850 cm\n2 \nroller bottles overnight. The previously seeded cells were then transfected the following day using \nFUGENE™\n 6 transfection reagent. The DNA-transfection reagent mixture was prepared in approximately in 6.75 mL serum-free DMEM. 675 \nμl FUGENE™\n 6 transfection reagent was first added, followed by 112.5 μg plasmid DNA. The complex was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The entire mixture was then added to a roller bottle. The roller bottle was infused with a 5% CO\n2 \ngas mixture, capped tightly and placed in a 37° C. incubator on a roller rack rotating at 0.35 RPM. The transfection was performed for 24 hours after which the medium was replaced with 100 mL DMEM+1× Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium Supplement+1× Pen Strep Glu+1× Non-Essential Amino Acids+1× Sodium Pyruvate. Typically, 2-3 harvests (100 ml) were obtained from each roller bottle at a 48 hr interval. The harvested serum-free conditioned medium was pooled together and centrifuged at 4,000 RPM for 30 minutes at 4° C.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nAnti-IGF-1R Antibody Small-Scale Purification\n\n\nThis example provides a method of purifying anti-IGF-1R antibodies on a small scale.\n\n\nConditioned medium was filtered through a 0.45 μm cellulose acetate filter and concentrated approximately 8-fold using a \nVivaflow\n 200 50 K tangential flow membrane (Vivascience, Goettingen, Germany). rProtein A SEPHAROSE™ Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.) was washed with phosphate buffered saline (2.7 mM potassium chloride, 138 mM sodium chloride, 1.5 mM potassium phosphate, and 8.1 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) (PBS) four times then directly applied to the concentrated media. The amount of resin used was based on antibody concentration determined by ELISA where 1 μl of resin was used per 5 μg antibody. The medium was incubated overnight at 4° C. with gentle agitation. The resin was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min. at 4° C. The supernatant was decanted as the unbound fraction. The resin was washed with PBS four times for one minute at room temperature with gentle agitation, each time collecting the resin by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min. at 4° C. The antibody was eluted by incubating the resin with 1.5 volumes of 0.1 M glycine pH 3.0 for 10 min. at room temperature. The resin was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min. at 4° C. and the supernatant decanted as eluted antibody. The elution step described above was repeated for a total of three elutions; each time the eluted material was neutralized with 0.04 volumes of 1.0 M tris-HCl, pH 9.2. The sample was filtered through a 0.2 μm cellulose acetate filter. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) as per the supplied instructions using Human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) as a standard. The sample was compared to a Human IgG1, K standard (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) using a 4-20% tris-glycine SDS polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) gel stained with Coomassie brilliant blue dye. No contaminating protein was visible in these preparations.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\nIsolation of Stable CHO Clones Expressing Antibodies\n\n\nThis example provides a method for isolating stable CHO cell lines expressing anti-IGF-1R antibodies.\n\n\nStable expression of TQ11C, TQ25, \nTQ\n 58 and TQ59 IgG1 was achieved by co-transfection of AM1-D CHO cells (U.S. Pat. No. 6,210,924, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) with pDSRα20 heavy and light chain IgG1 expression constructs. The plasmid transfections were performed using LF2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 4×106AM1-D CHO cells were plated 24 hours prior to transfection, in 100 mm diameter FALCON™ plastic petri dishes (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) in 10 ml of Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1× penicillin-streptomycin and glutamine (Invitrogen), non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), sodium pyruvate, and HT (0.1 mM sodiumhypoxanthine, 16 nM thymidine; Invitrogen). Approximately 15 mg of each pDSRα21—light chain and heavy chain plasmid DNA were linearized using Pvu I (New England Biolabs) and diluted in 2 ml of OPTI-MEM® (Invitrogen). The diluted plasmids were mixed with 75 μl of LIPOFECTAMINE™ 2000 (LF2000; GIBCO/BRL) diluted in 2 ml of OPTI-MEM® and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The following day fresh growth medium was added. The cells were cultured in complete growth medium for 48 hours, then plated in HT-selection medium in 1:20 and 1:50 dilutions. Approximately 2 weeks after transfection, 12-24 visible colonies were picked into 24-well plates, using the sterile cloning discs (RPI). The clones expressing the highest level of TQ11C, TQ25, TQ58 and TQ59 IgG1 were identified by western immunoblot analysis. To perform this assay, 0.5 ml of serum free medium was added to a single-well confluent cells cultured in a 24 well plate (BD Falcon). The conditioned medium was recovered after 24 hr, and 10 μl of CM was mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer to run a 10% Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide protein gel (Invitrogen). The gel was transferred to a 0.45 μm pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen), and western blot analysis was done using 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-human IgG Fc ImmunoPure antibody (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, Ill.) and ECL as detection agent.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nMid-Scale Expression of Antibodies\n\n\nThis example provides a method of expressing anti IGF-1R antibodies expressed by stable CHO cell lines.\n\n\nThe CHO cell lines made according to Example 7 were expanded to T-175 tissue culture flasks (Falcon) for scale-up expression. A confluent T175 flask (approximately 2-3×107 cells) was used to seed 3-850 cm2 roller bottles (Corning Life Sciences, Acton, Mass.), and three confluent roller bottles (approximately 1-2×108 cells per roller bottle) were used to seed 30 rollers in 250 ml of high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen), 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen), 1× glutamine (Invitrogen), 1× non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1× sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Medium was infused with 10% CO\n2\n/balance air for 5 seconds before capping the roller bottle. Roller bottles were incubated at 37° C. on roller racks spinning at 0.75 rpm.\n\n\nWhen cells reached approximately 85-90% confluency (approximately 5-6 days in culture), the growth medium was discarded, the cells were washed with 100 ml PBS, and 200 ml production medium was added (50% DMEM (Invitrogen)/50% F12 (Invitrogen), 1× glutamine (Invitrogen), 1× non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1× sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1.5% DMSO (Sigma). Conditioned medium was harvested every seven days for a total of four harvests.\n\n\nConditioned medium was filtered through a 0.45 μm cellulose acetate filter and concentrated approximately 10-fold using a Sartorius Sartocon Slice Disposable 30 K tangential flow membrane (Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany). The concentrated material was applied to a 10 ml rProtein A Sepharose column at 4° C. and the flowthrough was collected as the unbound fraction. The column was washed with four column volumes of PBS. The bound sample was eluted with approximately four column volumes of 0.1 M glycine pH 3.0. The eluate peak was collected and neutralized with 0.04 volumes of 1.0 M tris-HCl, pH 9.2. The eluate was dialyzed against 150 volumes of PBS overnight at 4° C. The sample was filtered through a 0.2 μm cellulose acetate filter and protein concentration was measured by determining the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 14,000 M-1. The sample was compared to a Human IgG1, K standard (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA) using a 4-20% tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie brilliant blue stain. Endotoxin levels in each antibody prepration was determined using the Pyrotell Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Inc., Falmouth, Ma) as per the supplied instructions.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nORIGEN® Dose Response Competition Assays\n\n\nThis example provides methods for testing the ability of an antibody to block ligand binding to IGF-1R.\n\n\nAn ORIGEN® binding assay was used to determine whether TQ11C, TQ25, \nTQ\n 58 and TQ59 IgG1 antibodies could block ligand binding to IGF-1R using procedures provided by the manufacturer (Igen, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). To label IGF-1 and IGF-2 with ruthenium, lyophilized proteins were dissolved into PBS to give a 1.0 mg/ml solution. Label (ORI-TAG-NHS ester from Igen, Cat #110034) was added to the protein at a molar ratio of 5:1 (label: protein) from a label stock of 5 mg/ml in DMSO. The mixture was incubated at room temperature (20-22° C.) for 1 hr in the dark then treated with 20 μl 2M glycine for 10 min at room temperature. The labeled protein was separated from the free label by application to an Amersham Biosciences NAP-5 column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.) equilibrated in PBS and 0.33 ml fractions collected. The protein concentration of the fractions was determined by Micro BCA Protein Assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, Ill.). Fractions two and three contained significant protein and were combined. The amount of incorporated ruthenium label was assessed using the following formula: ruthenium tris-bipyridyl compound (Ru(bpy)\n3\n \n2+\n) labeling of IGF-1 and IGF-2.\n\n\nDynal M450 paramagnetic beads coated with sheep anti-mouse IgG was used as the solid support phase for the IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-muFc. The M450 beads were prepared for receptor loading by washing three times with assay buffer containing 1×PBS, 0.05% TWEEN™ 20 (ICI Americas, Inc., Wilmington Del.) 0.1% BSA, 0.01% sodium azide. The IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-muFc was bound for 1 hr at a ratio of 50 ng receptor per 1×10\n6 \nM450 beads in a volume of 25 μl assay buffer. To generate dose response data, the antibodies or unlabeled IGF-1 and IGF-2 factors were added at increasing concentrations (10\n−11\nM to 10\n−6\nM) simultaneously with 1 nM Ru-IGF-1 or 2 nM Ru-IGF-2. The final reaction volume was 100 After incubation at room temperature in the dark for 2 hr, an M8 Analyzer (Igen) was used to remove free ruthenium labeled ligand and determine the amount of ligand bound to receptor. The data were expressed as the percent of total ligand bound minus background remaining after competition with excess \nunlabeled growth IGF\n 1 or IGF-2. Competition curves were generated with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.) using a single component equilibirium model. Essentially all (>98%) binding was competed with excess unlabeled growth factors.

The total reaction volume was 100 The INSR binding reactions were identical except they contained 50 ng INSR(ECD)-muFc and 0.64 nM \n125\nI-INS (Amersham). Receptor was loaded onto SPA PVT microspheres for 1 h at room temperature prior to assembly of the binding reactions. To generate dose response data, antibodies or unlabeled growth factors were added at increasing concentrations (10\n−11\nM to 10\n−6\nM) simultaneously with \n125\nI-labeled growth factors. Essentially all binding was competed with excess unlabeled growth factors. The receptor-independent background, caused by random γ stimulation of the SPT PVT microspheres, was less than 0.5% of the input \n125\nI cpm. The data were expressed as the percent of total ligand bound minus background remaining after competition with excess unlabeled growth IGF1 or IGF-2. Competition curves were generated with GraphPad Prism software using a single component equilibrium model.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\nAntibody Binding to IGF-1R\n\n\nThis example provides a method of detecting the binding of an anti-IGF-1R antibody to IGF-1R.\n\n\nBIACORE® 2000, sensor chip CMS, surfactant P20, HBS-EP (10 mM HEPES, 0.15M NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.005% P20, pH 7.4), amine coupling kit, 10 mM acetate pH 4.5 and 10 mM glycine pH 1.5 all were purchased from BIACore, Inc. (Piscataway, N.J.). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 1×, no calcium chloride, no magnesium chloride) was from Gibco. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V, IgG free) was from Sigma. Recombinant Protein G (“rProtein G”) was from Pierce Biotechnology.\n\n\nImmobilization of rProtein G and IGF-1R-C3-muFc to the sensor chip surface was performed according to manufacturer's instructions, using a continuous flow of 10 mM HEPES, 0.15M NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.005% P20, pH 7.4 (HBS-EP buffer). Briefly, carboxyl groups on the sensor chips's surfaces were activated by injecting 60 μl of a mixture containing 0.2 M N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and 0.05 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Specific surfaces were obtained by injecting rProtein A (Pierce) or IGF-1R-C3-mFc diluted in 10 mM acetate, pH 4.5 at concentrations between 20 and 50 μg/ml. Excess reactive groups on the surfaces were deactivated by injecting 60 μl of 1 M ethanolamine. Final immobilized levels were 5,000-6,000 resonance units (RU) for the Protein G surfaces, and 7,800 RU for the IGF-1R-mFc surfaces. A blank, mock-coupled reference surface was also prepared on the IGF-1R-mFc sensor chip.\n\n\nThe kinetic analysis of the interaction between IGF-1R-mFc and antibodies was performed as follows. Antibodies as well as a positive control antibody (anti-IR3-CDR-human-mouse chimera) were diluted in PBS+0.005% P20+0.1 mg/ml BSA and injected over the Protein G surfaces to capture the antibodies. IGF-1R-mFc was diluted in PBS+0.005% P20+0.1 mg/ml BSA from 500 nM to 3.9 nM, and each concentration was injected over the captured antibody surfaces, as well as over a blank Protein G surface for background subtraction. After a 10 minute dissociation, each surface was regenerated by injecting 10 mM glycine, pH 1.5. Kinetic analysis of the resulting sensorgrams was performed using BIAEvaluation, v. 3.2 (BIACore, Inc.).\n\n\nA solution affinity analysis was done by incubating two different concentrations (0.2 nM and 1 nM) of antibody with varying concentrations (0.01 nM to 50 nM) of IGF-1R-mFc in PBS+0.005% P-20+0.1 mg/ml BSA. Incubations were done at room temperature for at least five hours to allow samples to reach equilibrium. Samples were then injected over the immobilized IGF-1R-mFc surface. After the sample injection, the surfaces were regenerated by injecting 25 \nμl\n 8 mM glycine, pH 1.5. The binding signal obtained is proportional to the free antibody in solution at equilibrium. The dissociation equilibrium constant (K\nD\n) was obtained from nonlinear regression analysis of the competition curves using a dual-curve one-site homogeneous binding model (KinExA software v. 2.3, Sapidyne Instruments Inc., Boise Id.).

The IGF-1R subdomains were cloned into the expression vector pCep4avidin-N such that chicken avidin sequence (with endogenous signal sequence) is joined to the N-terminus of the expressed IGF-1R proteins. Expression of each avidin-fusion protein was achieved by transient transfection of human 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) in roller bottles cultures. The cells were grown and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS+1× Non-Essential Amino Acids+1× Pen Strep Glut+1× Sodium Pyruvate. Approximately 4-5×10\n7 \n293-EBNA cells were seeded in 850 cm\n2 \nroller bottles overnight. The previously seeded cells were then transfected with pCep4-avidin plasmid DNA the following day using \nFUGENE™\n 6 transfection reagent. The DNA-transfection reagent mixture was prepared in approximately in 6.75 mL serum-free DMEM. 6750 \nFUGENE™\n 6 transfection reagent was first added, followed by 112.5 μg plasmid DNA. The complex was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The entire mixture was then added to a roller bottle. The roller bottle was gassed with a 5% CO\n2 \ngas mixture, capped tightly and placed in a 37° C. incubator on a roller rack rotating at 0.35 RPM. The transfection was performed for 24 hours after which the medium was replaced with 100 mL DMEM+1× Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium Supplement+1× Pen Strep Glu+1× Non-Essential Amino Acids+1× Sodium Pyruvate. Harvest of the condition medium and replacement with fresh medium occurred 48 hr intervals (2-3 cycles). The harvested serum-free conditioned medium was pooled together and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000×g for 30 minutes at 4° C.\n\n\nThe concentration of avidin-fusion in each conditioned medium was determined using a quantitative FACS based method. The avidin fusion protein in 200 μl of conditioned medium was captured by incubation for 2 hr at room temperature with 5 μl (˜3.5×10\n5\n) of biotin coated polystyrene beads (Spherotech, Inc., Libertyville, Ill.). The conditioned medium was removed by three cycles of centrifugation and resuspension of the avidin-coated beads in PBS containing 0.5% BSA (BPBS). The avidin-beads were stained with 1 μg/ml of goat FITC-labeled anti-avidin antibody (Vector Lab Burlingame, Calif.) in 1 ml BPBS. After 0.5 hr incubation antibody-beads complexes were collected by centrifugation at 1800 rpm for 5 min and the pellet was washed three times. The FITC fluorescence was detected with a FACSCAN (Beckton Dickson Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). The signal was converted to protein mass using a standard curve derived with recombinant avidin. For epitope mapping the biotin-beads were loaded with 50-100 ng avidin-fusion protein per ˜3.5×10\n5 \nbeads of beads by incubation with the appropriate amount (1-20 ml) of conditioned medium. The loaded beads were washed extensively and resuspended in 1 ml BPBS. For all experiment the biotin-beads were blocked with 10% BSA in PBS prior to loading fusion protein.\n\n\n \nMethod\n 1, One Color Assay: Biotin-coated polystyrene beads loaded with IGF-1R (ECD) and IGF-1R subdomain fusion proteins were mixed with 1 μg of anti-IGF-1R antibody in 1 ml of BPBS. After incubation for 1 hr at room temperature, 4 ml washing buffer was added and the antibody-beads complexes were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 750 g. The pellet was washed 3 times by resuspension in 4 ml of BPBS. The antibody bound to avidin-bead complexes was detected by treatment with 0.5 μg/ml Phycoerythrin-(PE) labeled goat anti-human F(ab′)2 (Southern Biotech Associates, Inc., Birmingham, Ala.) in 1 ml BPBS. Tested antibodies were found to bind to the avidin-fusion protein containing the complete IGF-1R ECD and the L2 domain. Binding to L1, CR or FnIII-1 was not detected in this experiment. A relatively weak reaction was also observed with the L1 domain.\n\n\n \nMethod\n 2, Two color assay: To simultaneously monitor the amounts of anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody and avidin-fusion bound to biotin-beads, FITC-labeled anti-avidin antibody was included (1 μg/ml) was included in the binding reaction in combination with 0.5 μg/ml PE-labeled goat anti-human IgG1. The beads were prepared for FACSCAN analysis as described for the one color assay.\n\n\n \nMethod\n 3, Antibody Competition: To prepare for labeling with fluorescein the antibodies were dialyzed or resuspended at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in PBS (pH 8.5). Label ([6-fluorescein-5-(and-6)-carboxamido]hexanoic acid, succinimidyl ester 5(6)-SFX] mixed isomers from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oreg., Cat. No. F2181) was added to the protein at a molar ratio 9.5:1 (label: protein) from a label stock of 5 mg/ml in DMSO. The mixture was incubated at 4° C. overnight in the dark. The labeled antibody was separated from the free label by dialysis in PBS. The FITC/antibody ratios obtained ranged from 3 to 8. For each competition experiment, a binding reaction was assembled that contained a 50 fold excess (10-50 μg/ml) of unlabeled competitor antibody, 3.5×10\n5 \nbiotin beads coated with avidin fusion protein in BPBS. The FITC-labeled antibody (1 μg/ml) was added after a 30 min preincubation. The process followed the one color method from this point forward.\n\n\nEach of the four tested antibodies binds to the IGF-1R L2 domain, as shown in Table 8.

A Balb/C 3T3 cell line that stably overexpresses the human IGF-1R (˜3×10\n5 \nreceptors per cell) was derived using with a retroviral vector essentially as described by Pietrzkowski et al., 1992, Cell Growth Differentiation 3:199-205. MCF-7 breast cancer cells that overproduce huIGF-1R were transfected with a pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen Corp.). Zeocin resistant cells that express a high level of hu IGF-1R (˜4×10\n5 \nreceptors per cell) were expanded after selection by FACS using anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody αIR3 and an PE-labeled goat anti murine IgG antibody (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.). The process of selection and expansion was repeated four times.\n\n\nIGF-1R Receptor antibody staining and receptor expression was monitored by FACS as follows: the cells were released from T175 flasks (Corning) by washing 2 times with excess PBS (Ca/Mg free) followed by treatment with 5 ml of Cell Dissociation Buffer (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed two times by resuspending them in PBS and centrifugation. For primary antibody staining, 1 μg of antibody was added to 10\n6 \ncells resuspended in 100 μl PBS plus 0.5% BSA (BPBS) and the cells were incubated at 4° C. for 1.5 hr. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with BPBS to remove unbound primary antibody. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of BPBS and incubated with 1 μg of FITC-labeled goat anti-human F(ab′)2 (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, Ala.) at 4° C. for 30 minutes. After washing to remove unbound FITC secondary antibody, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS+0.5% BSA and FITC cell fluorescence was detected with a FACSCAN (Beckton Dickson Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). The fluorescence levels were converted to absolute receptor levels using Quantum microbead (Bangs Laboratories, Inc., Fishers, Ind.) with predetermined IgG1 binding capacity to generate a standard curve. Data reduction was performed with QuickCal v2.1 software (Verity Software House, Topsham, Me.) provided by the manufacturer.\n\n\nThe peak fluorescent intensity of anti-IGF-1R antibody labeling of the IGF-1R overexpressors was increased 10-20 fold relative to parental Balb/C 3T3 and MCF-7 cells for each of the tested antibodies. This is the result predicted for an antibody that specifically binds IGF-1R. Background fluorescence of cells treated with no antibodies or FITC-labeled secondary alone were insignificant.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 14\n\n\nInhibition of IGF-1R\n\n\nThis example presents methods of detecting inhibition of IGF-1R by anti-IGF-1R antibodies.\n\n\n32D hu IGF-1R+IRS-1 Cell Inhibition\n\n\nMurine 32D cells that coexpress the human IGF-1R receptor (20K per cell) and human IRS-1 have proven to be a effective system to examine the molecular components IGF-1R signaling Valentinis et al., 1999, J Biol Chem 274:12423-30. Normal 32D cells express relatively low levels of the murine orthologs of these two gene products. 32D cell normally required IL3 for growth and survival. IGF-1 or IGF-2 can replace IL3 in 32D huIGF-1R+IRS-1 cells as shown in \nFIG. 16\n, panel A. The EC\n50 \nto the IGF-1 dose response curve was about 0.5 nM, whereas the IGF-2 EC\n50 \n(2.8 nM) is about six fold higher reflecting weaker affinity of IGF-2 for IGF-1R. To assess the ability of the antibodies TQ11C, TQ25, TQ58, and TQ59 to block IGF-1 or IGF-2 stimulation, 96-well microtitre plates were seeded with 30,000 32D hu IGF-1R+IRS-1 cells per well in a volume of 200 μl of RPMI (Gibco/BRL) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco/BRL) and 1× penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine (Giboco/BRL) and increasing concentrations of antibody (10\n−12\nM to 10\n−6\nM) or no antibody. IGF-1 (2 nM), IGF-2 (8 nM) or nothing was added after 1 hr preincubation with antibody. \n3\nH-thymidine (1 μCi per well) was added at 27 hr post-antibody addition. The cells were harvested 21 hr later, and incorporation of \n3\nH-thymidine into DNA was determined for each sample. The assays were performed in triplicate. An anti-CD20 antibody was used as a negative control. Each of antibodies TQ11C, TQ25, TQ58, and TQ59 was able to completely block the IGF-1 and IGF-2 mediated stimulation of the 32D cells. The reduction of background proliferation in the absence of added IGF-1 and IGF-2 is due to the inhibition of serum IGF-1 and IGF-2. The binding data were analyzed using GraphPad PRIZM™ software. The data are shown in \nFIG. 16\n.\n\n\nBalb/C 3T3 hu IGF-1R Cell Inhibition\n\n\nIGF-1 greatly stimulates the incorporation of \n3\nH-thymidine by serum-starved cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Balb/C 3T3 or NIH 3T3) that overexpress IGF-1R (˜1×10\n6 \nIGF1R per cell). Kato et al., 1993, J Biol Chem 268:2655-61; Pietrzkowski et al., 1992, Cell Growth Differentiation 3:199-205. This phenomenon is recapitulated with both IGF-1 and IGF-2 in a Balb/C 3T3 cell line hu IGF-1R overexpressor. Both growth factors stimulated \n3\nH-thymidine incorporation by about 20-fold. The EC\n50 \nof the IGF-1 dose response curve was about 0.7 nM, whereas the IGF-2 EC\n50 \n(4.4 nM) is sevenfold higher, indicating a weaker affinity of IGF-2 for IGF-1R. To assess the ability of a given antibody to block IGF-1 or IGF-2 stimulation, 96-well microtitre plates were seeded with 10,000 cells per well in a volume of 200 μl of DMEM (Gibco/BRL) containing 10% calf serum (Gibco/BRL) and 1× penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine (Giboco/BRL). After overnight incubation when the cells were about 80% confluent the growth medium was replaced with 100 DMEM containing 0.1% BSA after washing once with 200 μl PBS. Antibodies at increasing concentrations (10\n−12\nM to 10\n−6\nM), or no antibody, were added at 24 hr post-serum starvation. IGF-1 (2 nM), IGF-2 (8 nM) and \n3\nH-thymindine (1 μCi per well) were added after a 1 hr preincubation with antibody. The cells were harvested 24 hr later, and incorporation of \n3\nH-thymidine into DNA was determined for each sample. The assays were performed in triplicate. Each tested antibody was able to completely block the IGF-1 and IGF-2 mediated stimulation of Balb/C 3T3 cells, as shown in \nFIG. 17\n. An anti-CD20 antibody was used as a negative control (“CD20” in \nFIG. 17\n).\n\n\nEach reference cited herein is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all that it teaches and for all purposes."
