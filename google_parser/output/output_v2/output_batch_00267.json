More particularly, the invention discloses compounds that are related to 1,4-benzothiazepines and are useful to treat cardiac and skeletal muscular disorders. The invention also discloses pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and articles of manufacture comprising the pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a structure in cells that functions, among other things, as a specialized intracellular calcium (Ca\n2+\n) store. Channels in the SR called ryanodine receptors (RyRs) open and close to regulate the release of Ca\n2+\n from the SR into the intracellular cytoplasm of the cell. Release of Ca\n2+\n into the cytoplasm from the SR increases cytoplasmic Ca\n2+\n concentration. Open probability (Po) of the RyR receptor refers to the likelihood that the RyR channel is open at any given moment, and therefore capable of releasing Ca\n2+\n into the cytoplasm from the SR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are three types of ryanodine receptors, all of which are highly-related Ca\n2+\n channels: RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3. RyR1 is found predominantly in skeletal muscle as well as other tissues, RyR2 is found predominantly in the heart as well as other tissues, and RyR3 is found in the brain as well as other tissues. The RyR channels are formed by four RyR polypeptides in association with four FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs), specifically FKBP12 (calstabin1) and FKBP12.6 (calstabin2). Calstabin1 binds to RyR1, calstabin2 binds to RyR2, and calstabin1 binds to RyR3. The FKBP proteins (calstabin1 and calstabin2) bind to the RyR channel (one molecule per RyR subunit), stabilize RyR-channel functioning, and facilitate coupled gating between neighboring RyR channels, thereby preventing abnormal activation of the channel during the channel's closed state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides the calstabin binding proteins, protein kinase A (PKA) also binds to the cytoplasmic surface of the RyR receptors. PKA phosphorylation of the RyR receptors causes partial dissociation of calstabins from RyRs. Dissociation of calstabin from RyR causes increased open probability of RyR, and therefore increased Ca\n2+\n release from the SR into the intracellular cytoplasm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCa\n2+\n release from the SR in skeletal muscle cells and heart cells is a key physiological mechanism that controls muscle performance, because increased concentration of Ca\n2+\n in the intracellular cytoplasm causes contraction of the muscle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExcitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscles involves electrical depolarization of the plasma membrane in the transverse tubule (T-tubule), which activates voltage-gated L-type Ca\n2+\n channels (LTCCs). LTCCs trigger Ca\n2+\n release from the SR through physical interaction with RyR1. The resulting increase in cytoplasmic Ca\n2+\n concentration induces actin-myosin interaction and muscle contraction. To enable relaxation, intracellular Ca\n2+\n is pumped back into the SR via SR Ca\n2+\n-ATPase pumps (SERCAs), which is regulated by phospholamban (PLB) depending on the muscle fiber type.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been shown that disease forms that result in sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased plasma catecholamine levels cause maladaptive activation of intracellular stress pathways resulting in destabilization of the RyR1 channel closed state and intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak. SR Ca\n2+\n leak via RyR1 channels was found to deplete intracellular SR calcium stores, to increase compensatory energy consumption, and to result in significant acceleration of muscle fatigue. The stress-induced muscle defect permanently reduces isolated muscle and \nin vivo\n performance particularly in situations of increased demand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt also has been shown that destabilization of the RyR1 closed state occurs under pathologic conditions of increased sympathetic activation and involves depletion of the stabilizing calstabin1 (FKBP12) channel subunit. Proof-of-principle experiments have shown that PKA activation as an end effector of the sympathetic nervous systems increases RyR1 PKA phosphorylation at Ser-2843 which decreases the binding affinity of calstabin1 to RyR1 and increases channel open probability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn cardiac striated muscle, RyR2 is the major Ca\n2+\n- release channel required for EC coupling and muscle contraction. During EC coupling, depolarization of the cardiac-muscle cell membrane during phase zero of the action potential activates voltage-gated Ca\n2+\n channels. Ca\n2+\n influx through the open voltage-gated channels in turn initiates Ca\n2+\n release from the SR via RyR2. This process is known as Ca\n2+\n-induced Ca\n2+\n release. The RyR2-mediated, Ca\n2+\n-induced Ca\n2+\n release then activates the contractile proteins in the cardiac cell, resulting in cardiac muscle contraction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhosphorylation of cardiac RyR2 by PKA is an important part of the \"fight or flight\" response that increases cardiac EC coupling gain by augmenting the amount of Ca\n2+\n released for a given trigger. This signaling pathway provides a mechanism by which activation of the sympathetic nervous system, in response to stress, results in increased cardiac output. PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 increases the open probability of the channel by dissociating calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) from the channel complex. This, in turn, increases the sensitivity of RyR2 to Ca\n2+\n-dependent activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite advances in treatment, heart failure remains an important cause of mortality in Western countries. An important hallmark of heart failure is reduced myocardial contractility. In heart failure, contractile abnormalities result, in part, from alterations in the signaling pathway that allows the cardiac action potential to trigger Ca\n2+\n release via RyR2 channels and muscle contraction. In particular, in failing hearts, the amplitude of the whole-cell Ca\n2+\n transient is decreased and the duration prolonged.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCardiac arrhythmia, a common feature of heart failure, results in many of the deaths associated with the disease. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in humans, and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Structural and electrical remodeling - including shortening of atrial refractoriness, loss of rate-related adaptation of refractoriness, and shortening of the wavelength of re-entrant wavelets - accompany sustained tachycardia. This remodeling is likely important in the development, maintenance and progression of atrial fibrillation. Studies suggest that calcium handling plays a role in electrical remodeling in atrial fibrillation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApproximately 50% of all patients with heart disease die from fatal cardiac arrhythmias. In some cases, a ventricular arrhythmia in the heart is rapidly fatal - a phenomenon referred to as \"sudden cardiac death\" (SCD). Fatal ventricular arrhythmias and SCD also occur in young, otherwise-healthy individuals who are not known to have structural heart disease. In fact, ventricular arrhythmia is the most common cause of sudden death in otherwise-healthy individuals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCatecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited disorder in individuals with structurally normal hearts. It is characterized by stress-induced ventricular tachycardia - a lethal arrhythmia that causes SCD. In subjects with CPVT, physical exertion and/or stress induce bidirectional and/or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias that lead to SCD even in the absence of detectable structural heart disease. CPVT is predominantly inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. Individuals with CPVT have ventricular arrhythmias when subjected to exercise, but do not develop arrhythmias at rest. Studies have identified mutations in the human RyR2 gene, on \nchromosome\n 1 q42-q43, in individuals with CPVT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFailing hearts (\ne.g.\n, in patients with heart failure and in animal models of heart failure) are characterized by a maladaptive response that includes chronic hyperadrenergic stimulation. In heart failure, chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation is associated with the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart, which, through coupling with G-proteins, activate adenylyl cyclase and thereby increase intracellular cAMP concentration. CAMP activates cAMP-dependent PKA, which has been shown to induce hyperphosphorylation of RyR2. Thus, chronic heart failure is a chronic hyperadrenergic state that results in several pathologic consequences, including PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 has been proposed as a factor contributing to depressed contractile function and arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. Consistent with this hypothesis, PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in failing hearts has been demonstrated, \nin vivo\n, both in animal models and in patients with heart failure undergoing cardiac transplantation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn failing hearts, the hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA induces the dissociation of FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) from the RyR2 channel. This causes marked changes in the biophysical properties of the RyR2 channel, including increased open probability (Po) due to an increased sensitivity to Ca\n2+\n-dependent activation; destabilization of the channel, resulting in subconductance states; and impaired coupled gating of the channels, resulting in defective EC coupling and cardiac dysfunction. Thus, PKA-hyperphosphorylated RyR2 is very sensitive to low-level Ca\n2+\n stimulation, and this.manifests itself as a diastolic SR Ca\n2+\n leak through the PKA hyperphosphorylated RyR2 channel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe maladaptive response to stress in heart failure results in depletion of FKBP12.6 from the channel macromolecular complex. This leads to a shift to the left in the sensitivity of RyR2 to Ca\n2+\n-induced Ca\n2+\n release, resulting in channels that are more active at low-to-moderate Ca\n2+\n concentrations. Over time, the increased \"leak\" through RyR2 results in resetting of the SR Ca\n2+\n content to a lower level, which in turn reduces EC coupling gain and contributes to impaired systolic contractility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, a subpopulation of RyR2 that are particularly \"leaky\" can release SR Ca\n2+\n during the resting phase of the cardiac cycle, diastole. This results in depolarizations of the cardiomyocyte membrane known as delayed after-depolarizations (DADs), which are known to trigger fatal ventricular cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn patients with CPVT mutations in their RyR2 and otherwise structurally-normal hearts, a similar phenomenon is at work. Specifically, it is known that exercise and stress induce the release of catecholamines that activate beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart. Activation of the beta-adrenergic receptors leads to PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 channels. Evidence also suggests that the PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 resulting from beta-adrenergic-receptor activation renders mutated RyR2 channels more likely to open in the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle, increasing the likelihood of arrhythmias.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCardiac arrhythmias are known to be associated with diastolic SR Ca\n2+\n leaks in patients with CPVT mutations in their RyR2 and otherwise structurally-normal hearts. In these cases, the most common mechanism for induction and maintenance of ventricular tachycardia is abnormal automaticity. One form of abnormal automaticity, known as triggered arrhythmia, is associated with aberrant release of SR Ca\n2+\n, which initiates DADs. DADs are abnormal depolarizations in cardiomyocytes that occur after repolarization of a cardiac action potential. The molecular basis for the abnormal SR Ca\n2+\n release that results in DADs has not been fully elucidated. However, DADs are known to be blocked by ryanodine, providing evidence that RyR2 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of this aberrant Ca\n2+\n release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,489,125\n \n discusses JTV-519 (4-[3-(4-benzylpiperidin-1-yl)propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine monohydrochloride; also known as k201 or ICP-Calstan 100), a 1,4-benzothiazepine, as a new modulator of RyR calcium-ion channels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCo-pending application \n \nU.S. Serial No. 10/763,498\n \n discusses RyR2 as a target for treating and preventing heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias that cause exercise-induced sudden cardiac death (SCD). RyR2 channels with 7 different CPVT mutations (\ne.g\n., S2246L, R2474S, N4104K, R4497C, P2328S, Q4201R, V4653F) were found to have functional defects that resulted in channels that became leaky (\ni.e\n., a calcium leak) when stimulated during exercise. The mechanism for the VT in CPVT has been demonstrated to be the same as the mechanism for VT in heart failure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been shown that exercise-induced arrhythmias and sudden death (in patients with CPVT) result from a reduced affinity of FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) for RyR2. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that exercise activates RyR2 as a result of phosphorylation by adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Mutant RyR2 channels, which had normal function in planar lipid bilayers under basal conditions, were more sensitive to activation by PKA phosphorylation - exhibiting increased activity (open probability) and prolonged open states, as compared with wild-type channels. In addition, PKA-phosphorylated mutant RyR2 channels were resistant to inhibition by Mg\n2+\n, a physiological inhibitor of the channel, and showed reduced binding to FKBP12.6 (aka calstabin2, which stabilizes the channel in the closed state). These findings indicate that, during exercise, when the RyR2 are PKA-phosphorylated, the mutant CPVT channels are more likely to open in the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle (diastole), increasing the likelihood of arrhythmias triggered by SR Ca\n2+\n leak.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, co-pending \n \nU.S. Patent Application No. 09/288,606\n \n discusses a method for regulating contraction of a subject's heart by administering a compound that regulates PKA phosphorylation of an RyR2 receptor and specifically decreases PKA phosphorylation. Co-pending \n \nU.S. Patent Application No. 10/608,723\n \n also discusses a method for treating and prophylaxis for atrial tachyarrhythmia and exercise and stress-induced arrhythmias by administration of an agent which inhibits PKA phosphorylation of RyR2.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn view of the foregoing, there is a need to identify new agents effective for treating or preventing disorders and diseases associated with the RyR receptors that regulate calcium channel functioning in cells, including skeletal muscular disorders and diseases and especially cardiac disorders and diseases. More particularly, a need remains to identify new compounds that can be used to treat RyR associated disorders by, for example, repairing the leak in RyR channels, and enhancing binding of FKBP proteins (calstabin1 and calstabin2) to PKA-phosphorylated RyR, and to mutant RyR that otherwise have reduced affinity for, or do not bind to, FKBP12 and FKBP12.6.

Moreover, the compounds of the invention normalize gating of mutant RyR channels, including CPVT-associated mutant RyR2 channels, by increasing FKBP12 (calstabin1) and FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) binding affinity. Therefore, the compounds of the invention revent disorders and conditions involving modulation of the RyR receptors, particularly the RyR1 and RyR2 receptors. Examples of such disorders and conditions include, without limitation, cardiac disorders and diseases, skeletal muscular disorders and diseases, cognitive disorders and diseases, malignant hyperthermia, diabetes, and sudden infant death syndrome. Cardiac disorder and diseases include, but are not limited to, irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases; exercise-induced irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases; sudden cardiac death; exercise-induced sudden cardiac death; congestive heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and high blood pressure. Irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases include and exercise-induced irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases include, but are not limited to, atrial and ventricular arrhythmia; atrial and ventricular fibrillation; atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmia; atrial and ventricular tachycardia; catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT); and exercise-induced variants thereof.

Cognitive disorders and diseases include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's Disease, forms of memory loss, and age-dependent memory loss. The compounds of the invention treat these disorders and conditions by increasing FKBP12 (calstabinl)-RyRl binding affinity and increasing FKBP12.6 (calstabin2)-RyR2 binding affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the foregoing, the present invention provides a method for limiting or preventing a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP (calstabin) in cells of a subject. As used herein, \"RyR\" includes RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3. Additionally, FKBP includes both FKBP12 (calstabin1) and FKBP12.6 (calstabin2). \"RyR-bound FKBP\" therefore refers to RyR1-bound FKBP12 (calstabin1), RyR2-bound FKBP12.6 (calstabin2), and RyR3-bound FKBP 12 (calstabin1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"RyR\" also includes a \"RyR protein\" and a \"RyR analogue.\" A\"RyR analogue\" is a functional variant of the RyR protein, having RyR biological activity, that has 60% or greater amino-acid-sequence homology with the RyR protein. The RyR of the present invention are unphosphorylated, phosphorylated \n(e.g.,\n by PKA), or hyperphosphorylated (\ne.g.,\n by PKA). As further used herein, the term \"RyR biological activity\" refers to the activity of a protein or peptide that demonstrates an ability to associate physically with, or bind with, FKBP12 (calstabin1) in the case of RyR1 and RyR3, and FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) in the case of RyR2 (\ni.e.,\n binding of approximately two fold or, approximately five fold, above the background binding of a negative control), under the conditions of the assays described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"FKBP\" includes both an \"FKBP protein\" and an \"FKBP analogue,\" whether it be FKBP12 (calstabin1) or FKBP12.6 (calstabin2). Unless otherwise indicated herein, \"protein\" shall include a protein, protein domain, polypeptide, or peptide, and any fragment thereof. An \"FKBP analogue\" is a functional variant of the FKBP protein, having FKBP biological activity, that has 60% or greater amino-acid-sequence homology with the FKBP protein, whether it be FKBP12 (calstabin1) or FKBP12.6 (calstabin2). As further used herein, the term \"FKBP biological activity\" refers to the activity of a protein or peptide that demonstrates an ability to associate physically with, or bind with, unphosphorylated or non-hyperphosphorylated RyR2 (\ni.e\n., binding of approximately two fold, or approximately five fold, above the background binding of a negative control), under the conditions of the assays described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFKBP binds to the RyR channel, one molecule per RyR subunit. Accordingly, as used herein, the term \"RyR-bound FKBP\" includes a molecule of an FKBP12 (calstabin1) protein that is bound to an RyR1 protein subunit or a tetramer of FKBP 12 that is in association with a tetramer of RyR1, a molecule of FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) protein that is bound to an RyR2 protein subunit or a tetramer of FKBP12.6 that is in association with a tetramer of RyR2, and a molecule of an FKBP12 (calstabinl) protein that is bound to an RyR3 protein subunit or a tetramer of FKBP12 that is in association with a tetramer of RyR3. Therefore, \"RyR-bound FKBP\" refers to \"RyR1-bound FKBP12\" \"RyR2-bound FKBP12.6,\" and \"RyR3-bound FKBP12.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the method of the present invention, a \"decrease\" or \"disorder\" in the level ofRyR-bound FKBP in cells of a subject refers to a detectable decrease, diminution or reduction in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of the subject. Such a decrease is limited or prevented in cells of a subject when the decrease is in any way halted, hindered, impeded, obstructed or reduced by the administration of compounds of the invention, such that the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of the subject is higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of the administered compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe level of RyR-bound FKBP in a subject is detected by standard assays and techniques, including those readily determined from the known art (e.g., immunological techniques, hybridization analysis, immunoprecipitation, Western.-blot analysis, fluorescence imaging techniques and/or radiation detection, etc.), as well as any assays and detection methods disclosed herein. For example, protein is isolated and purified from cells of a subject using standard methods known in the art, including, without limitation, extraction from the cells \n(e.g.,\n with a detergent that solubilizes the protein) where necessary, followed by affinity purification on a column, chromatography (e.g., FTLC and HPLC), immunoprecipitation (with an antibody), and precipitation (e.g., with isopropanol and a reagent such as Trizol). Isolation and purification of the protein is followed by electrophoresis (e.g., on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel). A decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in a subject, or the limiting or prevention thereof, is determined by comparing the amount of RyR-bound FKBP detected prior to the administration ofJTV-519 or a compound of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l or I-m, (in accordance with methods described below) with the amount detected a suitable time after administration of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of a subject is limited or prevented, for example, by inhibiting dissociation of FKBP and RyR in cells of the subject; by increasing binding between FKBP and RyR in cells of the subject; or by stabilizing the RyR-FKBP complex in cells of a subject. As used herein, the term \"inhibiting dissociation \" includes blocking, decreasing, inhibiting, limiting or preventing the physical dissociation or separation of an FKBP subunit from an RyR molecule in cells of the subject, and blocking, decreasing, inhibiting, limiting or preventing the physical dissociation or separation of an RyR molecule from an FKBP subunit in cells of the subject. As further used herein, the term \"increasing binding\" includes enhancing, increasing, or improving the ability of phosphorylated RyR to associate physically with FKBP (e.g., binding of approximately two fold or, approximately five fold, above the background binding of a negative control) in cells of the subject and enhancing, increasing or improving the ability of FKBP to associate physically with phosphorylated RyR (e.g., binding of approximately two fold, or, approximately five fold, above the background binding of a negative control) in cells of the subject. Additionally, a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of a subject is limited or prevented by directly decreasing the level of phosphorylated RyR in cells of the subject or by indirectly decreasing the level of phosphorylated RyR in the cells (\ne.g.,\n by targeting an enzyme (such as PKA) or another endogenous molecule that regulates or modulates the functions or levels of phosphorylated RyR in the cells). In one embodiment, the level of phosphorylated RyR in the cells is decreased by at least 10% in the method of the present invention. In another embodiment, the level of phosphorylated RyR is decreased by at least 20%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject of the present invention are \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n systems, including, without limitation, isolated or cultured cells or tissues, non-cell \nin vitro\n assay systems and an animal \n(e.g.,\n an amphibian, a bird, a fish, a mammal, a marsupial, a human, a domestic animal (such as a cat, dog, monkey, mouse or rat) or a commercial animal (such as a cow or pig)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells of a subject include striated muscle cells. A striated muscle is a muscle in which the repeating units (sarcomeres) of the contractile myofibrils are arranged in registry throughout the cell, resulting in transverse or oblique striations that are observed at the level of a light microscope. Examples of striated muscle cells include, without limitation, voluntary (skeletal) muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells. In one embodiment, the cell used in the method of the present invention is a human cardiac muscle cell. As used herein, the term \"cardiac muscle cell\" includes cardiac muscle fibers, such as those found in the myocardium of the heart. Cardiac muscle fibers are composed of chains of contiguous heart-muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, joined end to end at intercalated disks. These disks possess two kinds of cell junctions: expanded desmosomes extending along their transverse portions, and gap junctions, the largest of which lie along their longitudinal portions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP is limited or prevented in cells of a subject by administering the compounds of the invention to the subject; this would also permit contact between cells of the subject and the compounds of the invention. The compounds of the invention are modulators of calcium-ion channels. In addition to regulating Ca\n2+\n levels in myocardial cells, the compounds of the invention modulate the Na\n+\n current and the inward-rectifier K\n+\n current in cells, such as guinea pig ventricular cells, and inhibits the delayed-rectifier K\n+\n current in cells, such as guinea pig atrial cells.\n\n\n \n\n\nPharmaceutical Composition\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions for administration to human subjects in a biologically compatible form suitable for administration \nin vivo.\n According to another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l or I-m, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent and/or carrier. The pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier must be \"acceptable\" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier employed herein is selected from various organic or inorganic materials that are used as materials for pharmaceutical formulation and which are incorporated as analgesic agents, buffers, binders, disintegrants, diluents, emulsifiers, excipients, extenders, glidants, solubilizers, stabilizers, suspending agents, tonicity agents, vehicles and viscosity-increasing agents.

Examples of acceptable pharmaceutical carriers include carboxymethyl cellulose, crystalline cellulose, glycerin, gum arabic, lactose, magnesium stearate, methyl cellulose, powders, saline, sodium alginate, sucrose, starch, talc and water, among others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention are prepared by methods well-known in the pharmaceutical arts. For example, the compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l or I-m, are brought into association with a carrier and/or diluent, as a suspension or solution. Optionally, one or more accessory ingredients (\ne.g.\n, buffers, flavoring agents, surface active agents, and the like) also are added. The choice of carrier is determined by the solubility and chemical nature of the compounds, chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, 1-k, I-l or I-m, are administered to a subject by contacting target cells (e.g., cardiac muscle cells) \nin vivo\n in the subject with the compounds. The compounds are contacted with (\ne.g.,\n introduced into) cells of the subject using known techniques utilized for the introduction and administration of proteins, nucleic acids and other drugs. Examples of methods for contacting the cells with (\ni.e.,\n treating the cells with) the compounds of the invention include, without limitation, absorption, electroporation, immersion, injection, introduction, liposome delivery, transfection, transfusion, vectors and other drug-delivery vehicles and methods. When the target cells are localized to a particular portion of a subject, it is desirable to introduce the compounds of the invention directly to the cells, by injection or by some other means (e.g., by introducing the compounds into the blood or another body fluid). The target cells are contained in tissue of a subject and are detected by standard detection methods readily determined from the known art, examples of which include, without limitation, immunological techniques (\ne.g.,\n immunohistochemical staining), fluorescence imaging techniques, and microscopic techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the compounds of the present invention are administered to a human or animal subject by known procedures including, without limitation, oral administration, sublingual or buccal administration, parenteral administration, transdermal administration, via inhalation or intranasally, vaginally, rectally, and intramuscularly.

In one embodiment, the agent is adiminstered to the subject by way of delivery to the subject's muscles including, but not limited to, the subject's cardiac muscles. In an embodiment, the agent is administered to the subject by way of targeted delivery to cardiac muscle cells \nvia\n a catheter inserted into the subject's heart.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor oral administration, a formulation of the compounds of the invention may be presented as capsules, tablets, powders, granules, or as a suspension or solution.

Such a formulation is prepared by dissolving a solid active ingredient in water containing physiologically-compatible substances, such as sodium chloride, glycine and the like, and having a buffered pH compatible with physiological conditions, so as to produce an aqueous solution, then rendering said solution sterile. The formulation is presented in unit or multi-dose containers, such as sealed ampoules or vials. The formulation is delivered by any mode of injection, including, without limitation, epifascial, intracapsular, intracranial, intracutaneous, intrathecal, intramuscular, intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intraspinal, intrasternal, intravascular, intravenous, parenchymatous, subcutaneous, or sublingual or by way of catheter into the subject's heart.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor transdermal administration, the compounds of the invention are combined with skin penetration enhancers, such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, isopropanol, ethanol, oleic acid, \nN-\nmethylpyrrolidone and the like, which increase the permeability of the skin to the compounds of the invention and permit the compounds to penetrate through the skin and into the bloodstream. The compound/enhancer compositions also may be further combined with a polymeric substance, such as ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, ethylene/vinylacetate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the like, to provide the composition in gel form, which are dissolved in a solvent, such as methylene chloride, evaporated to the desired viscosity and then applied to backing material to provide a patch.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the composition is in unit dose form such as a tablet, capsule or single-dose vial. Suitable unit doses, \ni.e.,\n therapeutically effective amounts, can be determined during clinical trials designed appropriately for each of the conditions for which administration of a chosen compound is indicated and will, of course, vary depending on the desired clinical endpoint. The present invention also provides articles of manufacture for treating and preventing disorders, such as cardiac disorders, in a subject. The articles of manufacture comprise a pharmaceutical composition of one or more of the compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l or I-m, as described herein. The articles of manufacture are packaged with indications for various disorders that the pharmaceutical compositions are capable of treating and/or preventing. For example, the articles of manufacture comprise a unit dose of a compound disclosed herein that is capable of treating or preventing a muscular disorder, and an indication that the unit dose is capable of treating or preventing a certain disorder, for example an arrhythmia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with a method of the present invention, the compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, 1-f. I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l or I-m, are administered to the subject (or are contacted with cells of the subject) in an amount effective to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the subject, particularly in cells of the subject. This amount is readily determined by the skilled artisan, based upon known procedures, including analysis of titration curves established \nin vivo\n and methods and assays disclosed herein. In one embodiment, a suitable amount of the compounds of the invention effective to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the subject ranges from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day, and/or is an amount sufficient to achieve plasma levels ranging from about 300 ng/ml to about 1000 ng/ml. In an embodiment, the amount of compounds from the invention ranges from about 10 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day. In another embodiment, from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 10 mg/kg/day is administered. In another embodiment, from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 5 mg/kg/day is administered. In another embodiment, from about 0.05 mg/kg/day to about 5 mg/kg/day is administered. In another, preferred embodiment, from about 0.05 mg/kg/day to about 1 mg/kg/day is administered.\n\n\n \n\n\nUses\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a new range of therapeutic treatments for patients with various disorders involving modulation of the RyR receptors, particularly skeletal muscular disorders (RyR1), cardiac (RyR2) disorders, and cognitive (RyR3) disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the subject has not yet developed a disorder, such as cardiac disorders (\ne.g.\n, exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia.). In another embodiment of the present invention, the subject is in need of treatment for a disorder, including a cardiac disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious disorders that the compounds of the invention treat or prevent include, but are not limited to, cardiac disorders and diseases, skeletal muscular disorders and diseases, cognitive disorders and diseases, malignant hyperthermia, diabetes, and sudden infant death syndrome. Cardiac disorder and diseases include, but are not limited to, irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases; exercise-induced irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases; sudden cardiac death; exercise-induced sudden cardiac death; congestive heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and high blood pressure. Irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases include and exercise-induced irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases include, but are not limited to, atrial and ventricular arrhythmia; atrial and ventricular fibrillation; atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmia; atrial and ventricular tachycardia; catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT); and exercise-induced variants thereof. Skeletal muscular disorder and diseases include, but are not limited to, skeletal muscle fatigue, exercise-induced skeletal muscle fatigue, muscular dystrophy, bladder disorders, and incontinence. Cognitive disorders and diseases include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's Disease, forms of memory loss, and age-dependent memory loss, One skilled in the art will recognize still other diseases, including but not limited to muscular and cardiac disorders, that the compounds of the invention can be useful to treat, in accordance with the information provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of compounds of the invention effective to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR2-bound FKBP12.6 in the subject is an amount effective to prevent exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in the subject. Cardiac arrhythmia is a disturbance of the electrical activity of the heart that manifests as an abnormality in heart rate or heart rhythm. As used herein, an amount of compounds of the invention \"effective to prevent exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmias\" includes an amount of compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l and I-m, effective to prevent the development of the clinical impairment or symptoms of the exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., palpitations, fainting, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death). The amount of the compounds effective to prevent exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in a subject will vary depending upon the particular factors of each case, including the type of exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia, the subject's weight, the severity of the subject's condition, and the mode of administration of the compounds. This amount is readily determined by the skilled artisan, based upon known procedures, including clinical trials, and methods disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the amount of the compounds of the invention effective to prevent the exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia is an amount effective to prevent exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in the subject. In another embodiment, the compounds of the invention prevent exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia and exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of its ability to stabilize RyR-bound FKBP and maintain and restore balance in the context of dynamic PKA phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of RyR, the compounds of the invention are also useful in treating a subject who has already experienced clinical symptoms of these various disorders. For example, if the symptoms of the disorder are observed in the subject early enough, the compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, If, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l and I-m, are effective in limiting or preventing a further decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the subject of the present invention is a candidate for exercise-induced cardiac disorders, such as exercise-induced cardiac arrhthmia. Exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia is a heart condition (e.g., a ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, including any that leads to sudden cardiac death) that develops during/after a subject has undergone physical exercise. A \"candidate\" for an exercise-induced cardiac disorder is a subject who is known to be, or is believed to be, or is suspected of being, at risk for developing a cardiac disorder during/after physical exercise. Examples of candidates for exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia, include, without limitation, an animal/person known to have catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT); an animal/person suspected of having CPVT; and an animal/person who is known to be, or is believed to be, or is suspected of being at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmia during/after physical exercise, and who is about to exercise, is currently exercising or has just completed exercise. As discussed above, CPVT is an inherited disorder in individuals with structurally-normal hearts. It is characterized by stress-induced ventricular tachycardia - a lethal arrhythmia that causes sudden cardiac death. In subjects with CPVT, physical exertion and/or stress induce bidirectional and/or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias that lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the absence of detectable structural heart disease. Individuals with CPVT have ventricular arrhythmias when subjected to exercise, but do not develop arrhythmias at rest,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in still another embodiment of the present invention, the subject has been exercising, or is currently exercising, and has developed an exercise-induced disorder. In this case, the amount of the compounds of the invention effective to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the subject is an amount of compound effective to treat the exercise-induced disorder in the subject. As used herein, an amount of compounds of the invention \"effective to treat an exercise-induced disorder\" includes an amount of a compound of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, 1-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l or I-m, effective to alleviate or ameliorate the clinical impairment or symptoms of the exercise-induced disorder (e.g., in the case of cardiac arrhythmia, palpitations, fainting, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death). The amount of the compounds of the invention effective to treat an exercise-induced disorder in a subject will vary depending upon the particular factors of each case, including the type of exercise-induced disorder, the subject's weight, the severity of the subject's condition, and the mode of administration of the compounds. This amount is readily determined by the skilled artisan, based upon known procedures, including clinical trials, and methods disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-.i, I-j, I-k, I-l and I-m, treat exercise-induced disorders in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a method for treating exercise-induced disorders in a subject. The method comprises administering the compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l or I-m, to the subject in an amount effective to treat the exercise-induced disorder in the subject. A suitable amount of the compounds effective to treat, for example, exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in the subject ranges from about 5 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day, and/or is an amount sufficient to achieve plasma levels ranging from about 300 ng/ml to about 1000 ng/ml. The present invention also provides a method for preventing an exercise-induced disorder in a subject. The method comprises administering the compounds of the invention to the subject in an amount effective to prevent the exercise-induced disorder in the subject. A suitable amount of the compounds of the invention effective to prevent the exercise-induced disorder in the subject ranges from about 5 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day, and/or is an amount sufficient to achieve plasma levels ranging from about 300 ng/ml to about 1000 ng/ml. Additionally, the present invention provides a method for preventing exercise-induced disorders in a subject. The method comprises administering the compounds of the invention to the subject in an amount effective to prevent an exercise-induced disorder in the subject. A suitable amount of the compounds of the invention effective to prevent an exercise-induced disorder in the subject ranges from about 5 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day, and/or is an amount sufficient to achieve plasma levels ranging from about 300 ng/ml to about 1000 ng/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the compounds prevent irregular heartbeat disorders in subjects with heterozygous defects in the FKBP12.6 gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, 1-j, I-k, I-l and I-m, can be used alone, in combination with each other, or in combination with other agents that have cardiovascular activity including, but not limited to, diuretics, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, antiarrhythmics, inotropic agents, chronotropic agents, α and β blockers, angiotensin inhibitors and vasodilators. Further, such combinations of the compounds of the present invention and other cardiovascular agents are administered separately or in conjunction. In addition, the administration of one element of the combination is prior to, concurrent to or subsequent to the administration of other agent(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments of the above-described methods, the exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in the subject is associated with VT. In some embodiments, the VT is CPVT. In other embodiments of these methods, the subject is a candidate for exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia, including candidates for exercise-induced sudden cardiac death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the foregoing methods, the present invention also provides use of the compounds of the invention in a method for limiting or preventing a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in a subject who is a candidate for a disorder. The present invention also provides use of the compounds of the invention in a method for treating or preventing a muscular disorder in a subject. Furthermore, the present invention provides use of the compounds of the invention in a method for preventing treating or preventing exercise-induced muscular disorders in a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention further provides a method for assaying the effects of the compounds of the invention in preventing disorders and diseases associated with the RyR receptors. The method comprises the steps of: (a) obtaining or generating a culture of cells containing RyR; (b) contacting the cells with one or more of the compounds of the invention; (c) exposing the cells to one or more conditions known to increase phosphorylation of RyR in cells; and (d) determining if the one or more compounds of the invention limits or prevents a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the cells. As used herein, a cell \"containing RyR\" is a cell in which RyR, including RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3, or a derivative or homologue thereof, is naturally expressed or naturally occurs. Conditions known to increase phosphorylation of RyR in cells include, without limitation, PKA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the method of the present invention, cells are contacted with one or more of the compounds of the invention by any of the standard methods of effecting contact between drugs/agents and cells, including any modes of introduction and administration described herein. The level of RyR-bound FKBP in the cell is measured or detected by known procedures, including any of the methods, molecular procedures and assays known to one of skill in the art or described herein. In one embodiment of the present invention, the one or more compounds of the invention limits or prevents a decrease in the level of RyR-baund FKBP in the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRyR, including RyR1; RyR2, and RyR3, has been implicated in a number of biological events in cells. For example, it has been shown that RyR2 channels play an important role in EC coupling and contractility in cardiac muscle cells. Therefore, it is clear that preventive drugs designed to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells, particularly RyR2-bound FKPB12.6 in cardiac muscle cells, are useful in the regulation of a number of RyR-associated biological events, including EC coupling and contractility. Thus, the one or more compounds of the invention are evaluated for effect on EC coupling and contractility in cells, particularly cardiac muscle cells, and therefore, usefulness for preventing exercise-induced sudden cardiac death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the method of the present invention further comprises the steps of contacting one or more compounds of the invention with a culture of cells containing RyR; and determining if the one or more compounds has an effect on an RyR-associated biological event in the cells. As used herein, a \"RyR-associated biological event\" includes a biochemical or physiological process in which RyR levels or activity have been implicated. As disclosed herein, examples of RyR-associated biological events include, without limitation, EC coupling and contractility in cardiac muscle cells. According to this method of the present invention, the one or more compounds are contacted with one or more cells (such as cardiac muscle cells) \nin vitro.\n For example, a culture of the cells is incubated with a preparation containing the one or more compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l or 1-m. The compounds' effect on a RyR-associated biological event then is assessed by any biological assays or methods known in the art, including immunoblotting, single-channel recordings and any others disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is further directed to one or more compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l or I-m, identified by the above-described identification method, as well as a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or diluent. The compounds are useful for preventing exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in a subject, and for treating or preventing other RyR-associated conditions. As used herein, a \"RyR-associated condition\" is a condition, disease, or disorder in which RyR level or activity has been implicated, and includes an RyR-associated biological event. The RyR-associated condition is treated or prevented in the subject by administering to the subject an amount of the compound effective to treat or prevent the RyR-associated condition in the subject. This amount is readily determined by one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for preventing exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in a subject, by administering the one or more compounds of the invention to the subject in an amount effective to prevent the exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides an \nin vivo\n method for assaying the effectiveness of the compounds of the invention in preventing disorders and diseases associated with the RyR recpetors. The method comprises the steps of: (a) obtaining or generating an animal containing RyR; (b) administering one or more of the compounds of the invention to the animal; (c) exposing the animal to one or more conditions known to increase phosphorylation of RyR in cells; and (d) determining the extent the compound limits or prevents a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the animal. The method further comprises the steps of: (e) administering one or more of the compounds of the invention to an animal containing RyR; and (f) determining the extent of the effect of the compound on a RyR-associated biological event in the animal. Also provided is a pharmaceutical composition comprising this compound; and a method for preventing exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in a subject, by administering this compound to the subject in an amount effective to prevent the exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been demonstrated that compounds which block PKA activation would be expected to reduce the activation of the RyR channel, resulting in less release of calcium into the cell. Compounds that bind to the RyR channel at the FKBP binding site, but do not come off the channel when the channel is phosphorylated by PKA, would also be expected to decrease the activity of the channel in response to PKA activation or other triggers that activate the RyR channel. Such compounds would also result in less calcium release into the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, the diagnostic assays screen for the release of calcium into cells \nvia\n the RyR channel, using calcium-sensitive fluorescent dyes (\ne.g\n., Fluo-3, Fura-2, and the like). Cells are loaded with the fluorescent dye of choice, then stimulated with RyR activators to determine the reduction of the calcium-dependent fluorescent signal (\nBrillantes, et al., Stabilization of calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor) function by FK506-binding protein. Cell, 77:513-23, 1994\n; \nGillo, et al., Calcium entry during induced differentiation in murine erythroleukemia cells. Blood, 81:783-92,1993\n; \nJayaraman, et al., Regulation of the \n). Calcium-dependent fluorescent signals are monitored with a photomultiplier tube, and analyzed with appropriate software. This assay can easily be automated to screen the compounds of the invention using multiwell dishes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo demonstrate that the compounds of inhibit the PKA-dependent activation of RyR-mediated intracellular calcium release, an assay involves the expression of recombinant RyR channels in a heterologous expression system, such as Sf9, HEK293, or CHO cells. RyR could also be co-expressed with beta-adrenergic receptors. This would permit assessment of the effect of compounds of the invention on RyR activation, in response to addition of beta-adrenergic receptor agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe level of PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 which correlates with the degree of heart failure also is assayed and then used to determine the efficacy of the one or more compounds of the invention to block the PKA phosphorylation of the RyR2 channel. Such an assay is based on the use of antibodies that are specific for the RyR2 protein. For example, the RyR2-channel protein is immunoprecipitated and then back-phosphorylated with PKA and [gamma\n32\nP]-ATP. The amount of radioactive [\n32\nP] label that is transferred to the RyR2 protein then is measured using a phosphorimager (\nMarx, et al., PKA phosphorylation dissociates FKBP 12.6 from the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor): defective regulation in failing hearts. Cell, 101:365-76, 2000\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother assay of the compounds of the invention involves use of a phosphoepitope-specific antibody that detects RyR1 that is PICA phosphorylated on Ser 2843 or RyR2 that is PKA phosphorylated on Ser 2809. Immunoblotting with such an antibody can be used to assess efficacy of these compounds for therapy for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Additionally, RyR2 S2809A and RyR2 S2809D knock-in mice are used to assess efficacy of therapy for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Such mice further provide evidence that PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 is a contributing factor in heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias by showing that the RyR2 S2809A mutation inhibits heart failure and arrhythmias, and that the RyR2 S2809D mutation worsens heart failure and arrhythmias.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, in a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating heart failure, atrial fibrillation or exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound selected from the compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l and I-m.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntracellular Ca\n2+\n leak is proposed as a principal mediator of depressed muscle performance and dystrophic muscle remodeling. Muscular dystrophies are heterogeneous hereditary diseases characterized by weakness and progressive muscle wasting. Of all forms of muscular dystrophies involving the dystrophin-associated protein complex (referred to as dystrophinopathies), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most frequent genetic diseases (X-linked; 1 in 3,500 boys) with death usually occurring before \nage\n 30 by respiratory and/or Cardiac failure in high numbers of patients. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) represents a milder form of the disease associated with a reduction in the amount or expression of a truncated form of the dystrophin protein whereas Duchenne patients have been characterized by complete absence or very low levels of dystrophin. Duchenne and Becker's muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) are caused by mutations in the gene encoding the 427-kDa cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. However, with increasing age in BMD cardiac symptoms are more common than in DMD patients and do not correlate with skeletal muscle symptoms. Since genetic screening will not eliminative DMD due to a high incidence of sporadic cases, an effective therapy is highly desirable. DMD/BMD have been consistently associated with disturbed intracellular calcium metabolism. Because alterations of Intracellular Ca\n2+\n concentrations in DMD myofibers are believed to represent a central pathogenic mechanism, development of a therapeutic intervention that prevents intracellular Ca\n2+\n abnormalities as a cause of skeletal muscle degeneration is highly desirable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well established that lack of dystrophin expression is the primary genetic defect in DMD and BMD. However, the key mechanism leading to progressive muscle damage is largely unknown. It has been suggested that elevations of intracellular Ca\n2+\n concentrations ([Ca\n2+\n]\ni\n) under resting conditions directly contributed to toxic muscle cell (myofiber) damage and concurrent activation of Ca\n2+\n-dependent proteases. Since calpain activity is increased in necrotic muscle fibers of mdx mice and calpain dysfunction contributes to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, preventing activation of calcium-dependent proteases by inhibiting intracellular Ca\n2+\n elevations represents a strategy to prevent muscle wasting in DMD. Significant differences in [Ca\n2+\n]\ni\n between normal and dystrophic muscles have been repointed in myotubes and animal models including the dystroplain-deficient mdx mouse. Intracellular Ca\n2+\n elevations are prevented by administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l or I-m.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method of diagnosis of a disease or disorder in a subject, said method comprising: obtaining a cell or tissue sample from the subject; obtaining DNA from the cell or tissue; comparing the DNA from the cell or tissue with a control DNA encoding RyR to determine whether a mutation is present in the DNA from the cell or tissue, the presence of a mutation indicating a disease or disorder.

In embodiment A, PKA phosphorylated RyR2 is generated as follows: cardiac SR membrane preparations (5 µl, 50 µg) are added to a total of 100 µl of kinase buffer (8 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM EGTA, 50 mM Tris-PIPES, pH 6.8) containing 100 µM MgATP and 40 units of PKA, and incubated at room temperature. Samples are centrifuged at 95,000 g for 10 min and the pellets are washed three times in 0.2 ml imidazole buffer. The final pellets are pooled and resuspended in imidazole buffer (final concentration ≈ 10 µg /µl). To test for the FKBP12.6 rebinding efficiency of JTV-519, PKA phosphorylated cardiac SR (50 mg) is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with the test compounds and 250 nM FKBP12.6 in 10 mM imidizol buffer, pH 7.0. Samples then are centrifuged at 100,000 g for 10 minutes and pellets washed 3 times with imidizol buffer. After washing, proteins are size-fractionated on 15% PAGE. Immunoblots are developed using an anti-FKBP antibody (1:3,000 dilution). The amount of rebinding is quantified using densitometry of Western blots and is compared to the amount of FKBP associated with RyR in non-phosphorylated SR. EC\n50\n's for the compounds are determined by generating FKBP binding data using concentrations of compounds ranging from 0.5-1000 nM. In embodiment B, currents through L-type Ca\n2+\n channels in isolated mouse cardiomyocytes are recorded using whole-cell patch clamp recording conditions with Ba\n2+\n as the charge carrier. The extracellular solution contains (in mM): N-methyl-D-glucamine, 125; BaCl\n2\n, 20; CsCl, 5; MgCl\n2\n, 1; HEPES, 10; glucose, 5; pH 7.4 (HCl). The intracellular solution contains (in mM): CsCl, 60; CaCl\n2\n, 1; EGTA, 11; MgCl\n2\n, 1; K\n2\nATP, 5; HEPES, 10; aspartic acid, 50; pH 7.4 (CsOH). Under these conditions, it is expected that the measured current was carried by Ba\n2+\n primarily through L-type calcium channels which is referred to as I\nCa,L\n. Drugs are applied by a local solution changer and reach the cell membrane within 1 s. The effects of nifedipine and S36 are tested with 20 ms long voltage-clamp steps to +10 or +20 mV (peak of current-voltage relation for each individual cell) from holding potentials of -80 mV or -40 mV. In embodiment C, the voltage-dependence of L-type Ca\n2+\n current blocked by JTV-519 (1 µM) and S36 (1 µM) are measured and presented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated by \nFigure 2\n, embodiments A, B, C, and D, S36 prevents exercise-induced sudden cardiac death at lower plasma levels compared with JTV-519. In embodiment A are shown representative ECGs of an untreated FKBP12.6\n+/-\n mouse and JTV519-treated FKBP12.6\n+/-\n and FKBP12.6\n-/-\n mice. Mice are treated with 0.5 mg JTV-519/per kilogram of body weight per hour for 7 days with an implanted osmotic mini-pump. JTV-519 has no effect on resting heart rate or other ECG parameters such as heart rate (HR). In embodiment B are shown sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia recorded by telemetry in an untreated FKBP12.6\n+/-\n mouse (upper tracing) subjected to exercise testing, immediately followed by injection with 0.5 mg epinephrine per kilogram of body weight. Representative telemetry ECG recording of a JTV-519-treated FKBP12.6\n+/-\n mouse following the same protocol is shown in the bottom tracing. In embodiment C are shown numbers of mice with cardiac death (left), sustained VTs (> 10 beats, middle), and nonsustained VTs (3 to 10 arrhythmogenic beats, right) in experimental groups of mice subjected to exercise testing and injection with 0.5 mg/kg epinephrine. In embodiment D, the dose-dependence of pharmacological effects of JTV-519 and S36 is shown. Plasma levels of 1 µM JTV519 prevent cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in FKBPI2.6\n+/-\n mice. Plasma levels of 1 µM and 0.02 µM S36 also prevent cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in FKBP12.6\n+/-\n mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated by \nFigure 3\n, rycal prevents the development of acute heart failure post-myocardial infarction. Placebo-treated or rycal (100 nM or 200 nM plasma concentrations)-treated mice are subjected to permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery resulting in myocardial infarction. Rycal significantly improves fractional shortening assessed by M-\nmode echocardiography\n 2 weeks post-myocardial infarction, compared with placebo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated by \nFigure 4\n, S36 improves cardiac function in chronic heart failure post-myocardial infarction. Wild-type mice are subjected to permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery resulting in myocardial infarction. Seven days following myocardial infartion, mice are treated with S36 (\nplasma concentration\n 200 nM) or placebo. Heart weight to body weight (HW/BW) ratios and pressure-volume loops quantifications (dP/dt, slope of the maximum derivative of change in systolic pressure over time) show reverse remodeling and improved cardiac contractility in S36-treated mice compared with placebo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5\n is a summary graph of EC50 values of JTV-519 and compounds S1-S67 disclosed herein. The FKBP12.6 rebinding assay described above is used to determine the amount of FKBP12.6 binding to PKA-phosphorylated RyR2 at various concentrations (0.5 - 1000 nM) of the compounds shown. EC50 values are calculated using Michaelis-Menten curve fitting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated by \nFigure 6\n, embodiments A, B, and C, rycal normalizes CPVT- associated RyR2-P2328S channel function and structure. In embodiment A are shown representative single-channel current traces of unphosphorylated RyR2-P2328S and PKA-phosphorylated RyR2-WT treated with rycal showing no influence of JTV-519 on baseline channel function. However, in PKA phosphorylated RyR2-P2328S, as shown in embodiment B, rycal normalizes the single channel closed state to levels approaching those seen in embodiment A, reducing the open probability from 14.4% to 0.3% following administration of 0.1 µmol/L rycal. Insets in embodiments A and B show channel openings > 1 pA at a higher resolution. Embodiment C shows immunoblot analysis of calstabin-2 binding of RyR2-P2328S in the presence or absence of PKA and 0.1 µmol/L rycal, as indicated. RyR2-P2328S is immunoprecipitated and in vitro PKA was phosphorylated as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated by \nFigure 7\n, embodiments A and B, treatment with JTV-519 reduces PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in mice with heart failure. Equivalent amounts of RyR2 are immunoprecipitated with an antibody against RyR2 (top blot). Representative immunoblots (embodiment A) and bar graphs (embodiment B) show the amount of PKA phosphorylated RyR2 at Ser-2808 bound to RyR2 in wild-type and calstabin2(FKBP12.6)\n-/-\n mice. Treatment with JTV-519 (0.5 mg/kg/h) for 28 days post-myocardial infarction reduces PKA-phosphorylation of RyR2, presumably due to reverse cardiac remodeling, in wildtype but not calstabin-2 (FKBP12.6)\n-/-\n mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated by \nFigure 8\n, embodiments A and B, mice in which cardiac RyR2 cannot be PKA phosphorylated (RyR2-S2808A knockin mice) have improved cardiac function following myocardial infarction. Shown in embodiment A is the quantification of M-mode echocardiograms showing improved ejection fraction in RyR2-S2808A knockin mice compared with wildtype 28 days following permanent coronary artery ligation. Shown in embodiments B and C are pressure-volume loop quantifications showing (embodiment B) improved cardiac contractility and decreased cardiac dilation (embodiment C) in RyR2-S2808A knockin mice compared with wildtype following myocardial infarction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9\n, embodiments A, B, C, and D demonstrate the effect of JTV-519 on calstabin2 affinity to RyR2 in haploinsufficient calstabin2 (FKBP12.6)\n+/-\n mice after exercise. The average probability that RyR2 channels will be open in calstabin2\n+/-\n mice subjected to exercise were significantly increased compared to those of channels from exercised wild type (control; calstabin2\n+/+\n) mice, which are predominately closed under conditions that simulate diastole in the heart. As shown in embodiments C and D, treatment of exercised calstabin2\n+/-\n mice with JTV-519 significantly reduced the channel open probability (P\no\n) compared with that of channels from exercised mice that were not treated, consistent with increased amounts of calstabin2 in the RyR2 channel complex. Therefore, JTV-519 increases the binding affinity of calstabin2 to RyR2. In contrast, JTV-519 treatment of exercised Calstabin2\n-/-\n deficient mice did not result in channels with a low P\no\n, indicating that the presence of calstabin2 is necessary for JTV-519 effects which are documented as binding of calstabin2 to RyR2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10\n, embodiments A, B, C, D, E, and F demonstrate, respectively, normalized RyR2 channel gating and increased calstabin2 binding to RyR2 channels after treatment with JTV-519. The immunoblots in embodiments A and B show the amounts of RyR2 and calstabin2 associated with immunoprecipitated RyR2 after incubation with the indicated concentrations of JTV-519 for, respectively, wild-type RyR2 (RyR2-WT) channels and RyR2-S2809D. The binding curves in embodiment C demonstrate that JTV-519 significantly increases the affinity of calstabin2 for PKA-phosphorylated RyR2 channels. The results also show that depletion of calstabin2 from the RyR2 macromolecular complex which is associated with increased RyR2 open probability, ventricular tachycardias, and sudden cardiac death in haploinsufficient calstabin2\n+/-\n mice is reversed by treatment with JTV-519. Therefore, the JTV-519 and related compounds prevent disorders and conditions associated with the RyR2 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFigure 11\n, embodiments A, B, C, D, and E RyR1 channel functioning is increased and normalized in \nmdx\n (dystrophin deficient) mice treated with JTV-519. In \nFigure 11\n, channel openings are represented as upward deflections; 'c' indicates the closed state; and 4 pA current open amplitude is indicated by dash. Upper traces represent 5 secs and \nlower traces\n 500 ms; dotted lines indicate subconductance states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiment A of \nFigure 11\n shows a single channel current trace of RyR1 from soleus muscle of control (wild-type) mouse under resting conditions (\ncytoplasmic Ca\n \n \n \n2+\n 150 nM). As seen, RyR1 is predominantly closed. Embodiment C of \nFigure 11\n shows that RyR1 channel function in \nmdx\n mouse shows significantly increased open probability, increased average open, and decreased average closed dwell times, To and Tc, respectively. Increased Po in \nmdx\n mice is consistent with intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak. The amplitude histograms in embodiments B, D, and F show multiple subconductance states consistent with calstabinl (FKBP12) depletion in RyR1 from \nmdx\n soleus muscle. Embodiment E of \nFigure 11\n shows an \nmdx\n mouse treated with 1.0 µM JTV-519. As seen, the RyR1 channels JTV-519-treated mouse demonstrates normal activity that is not significantly different from untreated wild-type trace, thereby indicating that JTV-519 can normalize RyR1 channel function in \nmdx\n mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data of \nFigure 11\n are consistent with intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n leak via RyR1 channels as the cause of increased cytosolic Ca\n2+\n leak in skeletal muscles from \nmdx\n (dystrophin deficient) mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 12\n, embodiments A and B, demonstrate that \nmdx\n skeletal muscle has normal levels of RyR1 PKA phosphorylation, but depleted levels of calstabin1. The immunoblots in embodiment A show that \nmdx\n type mice have depeleted levels of calstabin1 compared to a control (wild-type) mouse. The summary bar graphs of embodiment B show that the \nmdx\n mouse, nevertheless, has an equivalent level of PKA-phosphorylation. Therefore, it is concluded that calstabin1 depletion is a defect that is consistent with the intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak observed in skeletal muscle cells from \nmdx\n mice and myofibers from human mutation carriers. Intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n leak is likely to contribute to myofiber death and wasting of muscle mass by toxic intracellular Ca\n2+\n overload and activation of proteases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 13\n, embodiments A, B, and C, demonstrates that SR Ca\n2+\n leak at the subcellular level in skeletal muscles of animals with heart failure is detectable. Life quality and prognosis in heart failure (HF) patients is severely decreased due to skeletal muscle dysfunction (e.g., shortness of breath due to diaphragmatic weakness, and exercise intolerance due to limb skeletal muscle fatigue) in addition to depressed cardiac function. Dysregulation of intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n release is a pathogenic mechanism underlying skeletal muscle dysfunction in HF. HF in animals causes significantly accelerates intrinsic skeletal muscle fatigue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiments A and B of \nFigure 13\n are ΔF/F fluorescence line scan images of representative examples of Ca\n2+\n sparks in myofibers from sham and postmyocardial infarction (PMI) rats and corresponding Ca\n2+\n spark time course. Embodiment C shows the relative distribution of the spatio-temporal properties of the Ca\n2+\n sparks. Charts indicate 25, 50, 75 percentiles, the horizontal lines indicate the range from 1-99% of the distribution. Sham, open symbols (n = 137, three animals); postmyocardial infarction (PMI), gray symbols (n = 82, two animals). *, P < 0.05. FDHM, full duration at 50% peak amplitude; FWHM, full width at 50% peak amplitude.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 14\n, embodiments A and B, demonstrate that treatment of wild-type mice with JTV-519 improved soleus muscle fatigue times compared with placebo. Soleus muscles from JTV519-treated wild-type mice or calstabin2\n-/-\n mice with heart failure from myocardial infarction are more resistant to fatigue (\nP\n < 0.05) compared to placebo-treated mice. After completion of treatment, soleus muscle was dissected and mounted in a tissue bath to assess isolated skeletal muscle function. Representative 50% of maximal tetanic force fatigue time tracings are shown for wild-type and \ncalstabin2\n \n \n-\n/\n-\n \n mice, treated with JTV519 or placebo, in embodiment A. In embodiment B are shown bar graph summarizing mean time to fatigue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, JTV-519 treatment improved skeletal muscle fatigability in heart failure animals \nin vivo.\n Interestingly, in \ncalstabin2\n \n \n-\n/\n-\n \n knockout mice, fatigue times were also significantly improved in JTV519 treated mice, suggesting that the beneficial effects on isolated skeletal muscle function depend on calstabin1 and not calstabin2 binding to RyR1. Indeed, calstabinl appears to be the only isoform of functional significance expressed in skeletal muscles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 15\n, embodiments A and B, demonstrates that in a mouse model of post-myocardial infarction heart failure, RyR1 in soleus muscle is also PKA-hyperphosphorylated. Both in wild-type and calstabin2\n-/-\n mice, JTV-519 increased binding of calstabin1 to RyR1 in soleus muscle, suggesting that JTV-519 improves skeletal muscle fatigability by normalizing calstabin1 rebinding to the channel complex. Equivalent amounts of RyR1 were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against RyR1. Embodiment A provides bar graphs show the amount of PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 at Ser-2844 in mice (corresponding to human Ser-2843). The significant decrease of RyR1 PKA phosphorylation in JTV519 treated wild-type animals is likely resulting from beneficial cardiac effects and secondary reduction of sympathetic nervous activity. Embodiment B are bar graphs showing the amount of calstabinl bound to RyR1 from wild-type or \ncalstabin2\n \n \n-\n/\n-\n \n mice treated with JTV519 or placebo. Mice were treated with JTV519 by implantable osmotic minipumps using a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day. In summary, JTV-519 treatment resulted in a highly significant increase of calstabin1 in the RyR1 complex in soleus muscles \nin vivo\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 16\n, embodiments A, B, C, and D demonstrates that calstabinl rebinding to RyR1 by JTV519 normalizes abnormal or leaky RyR1 channel function \nin vivo.\n In embodiments A and C are shown RyR1 single-channel tracings at 150 nM cytoplasmic Ca\n2+\n representing resting conditions in skeletal muscle for wild-type mice treated with placebo and JTV-519. JTV-519 treatment of mice with heart failure and increased muscle fatigue normalized RyR1 channel gating in skeletal muscle \nin vivo.\n Channel openings are upward, the dash indicates the full level of channel opening (4 pA), the dotted lines indicate subconductance levels, and 'c' indicates the closed state of the channels. For the amplitude histograms in embodiment B and D, amplitude is represented on the \nx\n axis, and events indicates the number of channel openings. Po, To and Tc values correspond to the representative traces. Treatment as indicated on top of traces. Inset shows higher resolution of open states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, the data shows that \nin vivo\n JTV519 treatment normalizes skeletal muscle function and RyR1 channel dysfunction consistent with preventing intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n leak as a cause of increased skeletal muscle fatigue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 17\n demonstrate that JTV-519 also increases the binding affinity of calstabin1 for RyR1 in skeletal muscle in vivo. This probably explains why JTV519 treated mice with heart failure have increased levels of calstabinl bound to RyR1 in soleus muscle. In embodiment A, equivalent amounts of skeletal RyR1 or cardiac RyR2 were immunoprecipitated, PKA phosphorylated and incubated with calstabin1 or calstabin2 at increasing concentrations of JTV519, respectively. Sediment represents only calstabin bound to RyR. Immunoblotting showed that ≥50 nM of JTV519 increased the binding affinity of calstabin for RyR. The graphs of embodiment B further demonstrate that PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 reduced the affinity of calstabin1 for RyR1 (open circles), whereas treatment with JTV519 (filled circles) restored the binding affinity of calstabin1 for RyR1 to that of non-PKA phosphorylated RyR1 (open squares).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 18\n, embodiment A, B, C, and D demonstrates that Ser-2843 is the unique PKA phosphorylation site in skeletal RyR1 channels. (A) Representative single channel traces of wild-type RyR1, (B) effect of exogenous PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 (wt RyR1-P), (C) PKA does not affect RyR1-S2843A that contains a non-functional PKA phosphorylation site. Since PKA does not increase RyR1-S2843A activity, Ser-2843 appears to constitute the unique PKA phosphorylation site in RyR1 channels in skeletal muscle. Accordingly, (D) constitutively phosphorylated RyR1-S2843D mimics exogenous PKA phosphorylation shown in (B) confirming that Ser-2843 is the unique PKA phosphorylation site in skeletal RyR1 channels. RyR1 single channel recordings in planar lipid bilayers show activity of the channels at 150 nM [Ca\n2+\n]\n \ncis\n \n (cytosolic side) with 1 mM ATP. Recordings were at 0 mV, closed state of the channels as indicated by 'c', and channel openings are upward deflections. All point amplitude histograms are shown on the right. Open probability (P\no\n) and mean closed (Tc) and open (To) dwell times are indicated above each channel tracing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 19\n, embodiments A and B, demonstrates the depletion of stabilizing calstabinl and PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 channels from sustained exercise. Aerobic exercise can be defined as a form of physical exercise that increases the heart rate and enhances oxygen intake to improve performance. Examples of aerobic exercise are running, cycling, and swimming. During the study of \nFigure 19\n, mice were challenged by aerobic exercise (forced swimming) for 90 mins twice daily. The animals were accustomed to swimming in preliminary training sessions: day -3 twice 30 mins, day -2 twice 45 mins, day ∼1 twice 60 mins, \nday\n 0 and following twice 90 mins. Mice were then exercised for 1, 7, or 21 additional, consecutive days for 90 mins twice daily. Between swimming sessions separated by a 4 hour rest period the mice are kept warm and given food and water. An adjustable-current water pool was used to exercise mice by swimming. An acrylic pool (90 cm long x 45 cm wide x 45 cm deep) filled with water to a depth of 25 cm was used. A current in the pool was generated with a pump. The current speed during the swimming session was at a constant speed of 1 l/min flow rate. The water temperature was maintained at 34°C with an electric heater. Age- and weight-matched mice were used to exclude differences in buoyancy from body fat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing forced swimming as an efficient protocol to increase skeletal muscle aerobic capacity in mice, the composition and phosphorylation status of the skeletal RyR1 channel complex have been investigated. Unexpectedly, after 3 weeks of 90 mins swimming twice daily, C57B16 wild-type mice showed significantly increased RyR1 phosphorylation by PKA while Ca\n2+\n-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation was not changed indicating specificity of the stress pathway RyR1 protein expression was stable, however, RyR1 channels were depleted of the stabilizing subunit calstabinl (FKBP12). It has been shown that RyR1 hyperphosphorylation and calstabin1 depletion are consistent with leaky RyR1 channels that cause intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n leak.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRyR1 channels are PKA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunit after 3 weeks of 90 mins swimming twice daily. As seen in Embodiment A, the immunoprecipitated RyR1 macromolecular channel complex shows increased PKA phosphorylation at Ser-2844 (corresponding to human RyR1-Ser-2843) whereas CaMKII phosphorylation at Ser-2849 (corresponding to human RyR1-Ser-2848) is unchanged. Concomitant with increased RyR1-Ser-2844 PKA hyperphosphorylation, calstabin1 is depleted from the channel complex. As seen in embodiment B, normalization of phosphorylation and calstabin1 content to four subunits of the tetrameric channel complex shows a significant in increase in PKA phosphorylation and depletion of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunit. Control, non-exercised mice; swim, mice exercised 90 mins twice daily for 3 weeks (preliminary data). \nP\n < 0.05.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 20\n, embodiments A and B, demonstrate that PKA phosphorylation increases for increasing durations of sustained exercise. To investigate the influence of the duration of sustained exercise on the RyR1 Ca\n2+\n release channel defect, mice were exposed to swimming for 1, 7, or 21 days followed by immediate sacrifice. Longer exposure to sustained exercise results in a significant increase of RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation beginning at 7 days and saturating at 21 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nFigure 20\n, embodiment A, the immunoprecipitated RyR1 channel complex shows significantly and above physiologic levels increased PKA phosphorylation at Ser-2844 (corresponding to human RyR1-Ser-2843) after 7 days of swimming exercise. In \nFigure 20\n, embodiment B, inormalization of RyR2-Ser-2844 phosphorylation within the tetrameric channel complex documents a significant increase in PKA phosphorylation. *, \nP\n < 0.05; **, \nP\n < 0.005.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, the data of \nFigure 20\n shows that sustained exercise results in significantly increased RyR1 phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) which contributes to depletion of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunit from the channel complex as the cause of a gain-of-function defect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 21\n provides data showing that showing that chronically increased sympathetic stimulation of skeletal muscles, results in RyR1-dependent intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak and significantly increased muscle fatigue. What is the functional consequence of chronically increased RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation? As shown in \nFigure 21\n for mice and rats with heart failure from myocardial infarction, chronic RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation results in increased muscle fatigue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn embodiment A, it can be seen that heart failure skeletal muscle fatigues earlier than control. Rat soleus muscle (\nn\n = 5 control, \nn\n = 8 HF) was mounted in a tissue bath to assess contractile function. Representative fatigue time tracing is shown for control and HF skeletal muscles. Bar graph shows mean (± S.D.) time to 40% fatigue. *, \nP\n < 0.05. In embodiment B, it can be seen that heart failure skeletal muscle achieved maximal tetanic force more slowly than control skeletal muscles. Tetanic force was induced by high-frequency field stimulation. Bar graph shows tetanic 50% contraction time. **, \nP\n < 0.01. Embodiment C demonstrates the correlation between time to fatigue and RyR1 PKA phosphorylation (r = 0.88) in rat skeletal muscle from sham and heart failure animals. Muscle function and RyR1 PKA phosphorylation were assessed using contralateral soleus muscles from each animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, \nFigure 21\n provides data showing that sustained exercise causes RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation and calstabin1 depletion, and \nFigure 21\n shows that the identical defect occurs in disease forms with increased sympathetic activity causing intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n leak and significantly accelerated skeletal muscle fatigue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional problem during sustained exercise and stress is skeletal muscle degeneration further contributing to decreased skeletal muscle performance. To assess structural changes during sustained exercise, histologic changes in the fast-twitch muscles of mice exposed to 3 weeks of exercise by swimming have been characterized. Results are shown in \nFigure 22\n. Cross-sections of the mouse \nM. extensor digitorum longus\n (EDL) showed histologic changes consistent with myofiber degeneration from intracellular Ca\n2+\n overload from defective RyR1 channels. Therefore sustained exercise for 90 mins twice daily triggers a dystrophic phenotype in EDL muscles of normal C57B16 mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTrichrome stain shows packed myofibers of similar cross-sectional dimension in non-exercised control (WT) mice (left). Three weeks swimming results in myofiber degeneration and interstitial collagen deposits with irregular fiber sizes. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stain indicates nuclear changes and myofiber death. These changes are consistent with dystrophic remodeling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rapid delayed rectifier potassium channel (I(Kr)) is important for repolarization of the cardiac action potential. HERG is the pore-forming subunit of the I(Kr) channel. Suppression of I(Kr) function, for example as a side-effect of a drug or the result of a mutation in hERG, can lead to long-QT (LQT) syndrome, which is associated with increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. The compounds of the present invention exhibit a lower level of hERG blocking activity than JTV-519, as demonstrated in \nFigures 23- 43\n. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be less toxic and/or exhibit fewer side effects than JTV-519.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigures 23 to 26\n illustrate the effect of the compound ARM036 (also referred to as S36) and ARM036-Na (a sodium salt of ARM036) on hERG current.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 23\n shows a typical hERG voltage-clamp current recording before (control) and after application of ARM036 at 100µM. The voltage pulse protocol used to activate the hERG currents is illustrated below the current trace. It can be seen that, following activation by the conditioning prepulse (to +20 mV), partial repolarization (-50 mV test pulse) of the membrane evoked a large, slowly decaying outward tail current. Application of ARM036 minimally reduced the outward tail current in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 24\n shows a typical time course of the effect of ARM036 at 100 mM on the amplitude of the hERG channel current.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 25\n is a graph showing the concentration-dependence of the effect of ARM036 on the hERG current. Table 1 provides the numerical data that is illustrated graphically in \nFigure 25\n. Because the highest concentration of ARM036 tested resulted in less than 50% current inhibition, it was not possible to determine an IC\n50\n value for ARM036.\n\n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \nConcentration (\nµ\nM)\n \n \n \nMean\n \n \n \n \nSD\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSD\n \n \n \nN\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10\n \n \n0.7%\n \n0.3%\n \n0.2%\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n100\n \n \n0.9%\n \n0.7%\n \n0.4%\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 26\n is a graph showing the concentration-dependence of the effect of ARM036-Na on the hERG current.

Provided herein is a highly-efficient assay for high-throughput screening of other compounds that are capable of modulating calcium ion channel activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, and as shown in Example 5 below, a highly-efficient assay for high-throughput screening for small molecules is developed by immobilizing FKBP, either FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 (\ne.g.\n, wild-type FKBP12.6 or a fusion protein, such as GST-FKBP12.6) onto a 96-well plate coated with glutathione, using standard procedures. PKA-phosphorylated ryanodine receptor (RyR), specifically RyR1 or RyR3 in the case of FKBP 12 and RyR2 in the case of FKBP12.6, is loaded onto the FKBP-coated plate, and incubated with compounds at various concentrations (10-100 nM) for 30 min. Thereafter, the plate is washed to remove the unbound RyR, and then incubated with anti-RyR antibody (\ne.g\n., for 30 min). The plate is washed again to remove unbound anti-RyR antibody, and then treated with florescent-labeled secondary antibody. The plate is read by an automatic fluorescent plate reader for binding activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, RyR is PKA-phosphorylated in the presence of \n32\nP-ATP. Radioactive PKA-phosphorylated RyR is loaded onto an FKBP-coatcd, 96-well plate, in the presence of JTV-519 analogues and other compounds at various concentrations (10-100 nM) for 30 main. The plate is washed to remove the unbound radio labeled RyR, and then read by an automatic plate reader. PKA-phosphorylated RyR also is coated to the plate, and incubated with \n32\nS-labeled FKBP in the presence of the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is described in the following Examples, which are set forth to aid in the understanding of the invention and should not be construed to limit in any way the scope of the invention as defined in the claims which follow thereafter.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1 - RyR2 PKA PHOSPHORYLATION AND FKBP 12.6 BINDING\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCardiac SR membranes are prepared, as previously described (\nMarx, et al., PKA phosphorylation dissociates FKBP12.6 from the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor): defective regulation in failing hearts.

[\n3\nH] ryanodine binding is used to quantify RyR2 levels. 100 µg of microsomes are diluted in 100 µl of 10-mM imidazole buffer (pH 6.8), incubated with 250-nM (final concentration) [\n35\nS]-FKBP12.6 at 37°C for 60 min, then quenched with 500 µl of ice-cold imidazole buffer.

Chem., 267:9474-77, 1992\n), or anti-phosphoRyR2-P2809 (1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature (\nReiken, et al., Beta-blockers restore calcium release channel function and improve cardiac muscle performance in human heart failure. Circulation, 107:2459-66, 2003\n). The P2809-phosphoepitope-specific anti-RyR2 antibody is an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody, custom-made by Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA) using the peptide, CRTRRI-(pS)-QTSQ, which corresponds to RyR2 PKA-phosphorylated at Ser\n2809\n. After incubation with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000 dilution; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), the blots are developed using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ).\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 3 - SINGLE-CHANNEL RECORDINGS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSingle-channel recordings of native RyR2 from mouse hearts, or recombinant RyR2, are acquired under voltage-clamp conditions at 0 mV, as previously described (\nMarx, et al., PKA phosphorylation dissociates FKBP12.6 from the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor): defective regulation in failing hearts. Cell, 101:365-76, 2000\n). Symmetric solutions used for channel recordings are: \ntrans\n compartment - HEPES, 250 mmol/L; Ba(OH)\n2\n, 53 mmol/L (in some experiments, Ba(OH)\n2\n is replaced by Ca(OH)\n2\n); pH 7.35; and \ncis\n compartment - HEPES, 250 mmol/L; Tris-base, 125 mmol/L; EGTA, 1.0 mmol/L; and CaCl\n2\n, 0.5 mmol/L; pH 7.35. Unless otherwise indicated, single-channels recordings are made in the presence of 150-nM [Ca\n2+\n] and 1.0-mM [Mg\n2+\n] in the \ncis\n compartment. Ryanodine (5 mM) is applied to the \ncis\n compartment to confirm identity of all channels. Data is analyzed from digitized current recordings using Fetchan software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). All data is expressed as mean ± SE. The unpaired Student's t-testis used for statistical comparison of mean values between experiments. A value of \np\n<0.05 is considered statistically significant.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 4 - COMPOUNDS AND METHODS FOR THEIR SYNTHESIS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthon \nS26\n was prepared according to methods described in \n \nU.S. Patent App. No. 10/680,988\n \n,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of S3\n (Scheme 1): To a stirred solution of vinylsulfonic acid (22 mg, 0.2 mmol) in anhydrous CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (5 ml) is added thionyl chloride (2M in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, 0.1 ml, 0.2 mmol).

HEK 293 cells do not express endogenous hERG. HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the hERG cDNA and a neomycin resistance gene. Stable transfectants were selected by culturing the cells in the presence of G418. The selection pressure was maintained by continued culture in the presence of G418. Cells were cultures in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Mediurn/Nutreint Mizture F-12 (D-MEM/F-12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovin serum, 199U/ml penicillin G sodium, 10µg/mL streptomycin sulfate and 500 µg/mL G418. Cells for use in electrophysiology were cultured in 3 5 mm dishes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElectrophysiological recordings (using the whole-cell patch clamp method) were performed at room temperature (18°C-24°C). Each cell acted as its own control. The effect of ARM0036 was evaluated at two concentrations: 10 and 100µM. Each concentration was tested in at least three cells (n ≥ 3). 90 nM Cisapride (commercially available from TOCRIS Bioscience) was used as a positive control for hERG blockade. For recording, cells were transferred to the recording chamber and superfused with vehicle control solution. The patch pipette solution for whole cell recording contained 130 mM potassium aspartate, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 4 mM ATP and 10 mM HEPES. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. The pipette solution was prepared in batches, aliquoted, and stored frozen. A fresh aliquot was thawed and used each day. Patch pipettes were made from glass capillary tubing using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). A commercial patch clamp amplifier was used for whole cell recordings. Before digitization, current records were low-pass filtered at one-fifth of the sampling frequency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnset and steady stae block of hERG current was measured using a pulse pattern with fixed amplitudes (conditioning prepulse: +20 mV for 2 seconds; test pulse: _50 mV for 2 seconds) repeated at 10 second intervals, from a holding potential of-80 mV. Peak tail current was measured during the 2 second step to _50 mV. A steady state was maintained for at least 30 seconds before applying the test compound or the positive control. Peak tail current was monitored until a new steady state was achieved. Test compound concentrations were applied cumulatively in ascending order without washout between applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData acquisition and analysis was performed using the suite of pCLAMP (Vre. 8.2) programs (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Steady state was defined by the limiting constant rate of change with time (linear time dependence). The steady state before and after application of the test or control compounds was used to calculate the percentage of current inhibited at each concentration. Concentratioon-response data were fit to an equation of the form: \n \n \n%\n \nBlock\n \n=\n \n \n1\n \n-\n \n1\n \n/\n \n \nTest\n \n \n \n \n/\n \n \nIC\n \n50\n \n \n)\n \n \nN\n \n]\n \n \n \n⁢\n \nx\n \n⁢\n \n100\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere [Test] is the concentration of the test compound, IC\n50\n (inhibitory concentration 50) is the concentration of the test compound producing half-maximal inhibition, N is the Hill coefficient, and % Block is the percentage of hERG current inhibited at each concentration of the test compound. Nonlinear squares fits were solved with the Solver add-in for Excel 2000 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). For some compounds it was not possible to determine the IC\n50\n because the highest concentration of the test compound used did not block the hERG channel by 50% or more.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 7 - EFFECT OF VARIOUS COMPOUNDS ON hERG CURRENTS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMultiple compounds of the invention were tested for their effects on hERG currents.

By way of comparison, the effect of JTV-519 (referred to in the figures as ARM0XX) on hERG currents was also tested. Electrophysiological recordings were made using the PatchXpress 7000A (Molecular Devices) automatic parallel patch clamp system. Each compound was tested at 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10mM, with each concentration tested in 2 cells (n > 2). The duration of exposure to each test concentration was 5 minutes. Other aspects of the experimental protocols were essentially similar to those described in Example 6. For some compounds it was not possible to determine the IC\n50\n because the highest concentration of the test compound used did not block the hERG channel by 50% or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll publications, references, patents and patent applications cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety to the same extent as if each individual application, patent or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the foregoing invention has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity and understanding, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, from a reading of the disclosure, that various changes in form and detail can be made without departing from the true scope of the invention in the appended claims.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the foregoing invention has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity and understanding, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, from a reading of the disclosure, the various changes in form and detail can be made without departing from the true scope of the invention in the appended claims.\n\nThe appendix that follows the claims of this application is the as-filed claims of the \"parent\" application from which this present application is divided.
