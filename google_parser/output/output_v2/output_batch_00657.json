Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates generally to the field of nucleic acids and more particularly to aptamers capable of binding to platelet derived growth factor (\"PDGF\") useful as therapeutics in oncology and/or other diseases or disorders in which PDGF has been implicated. The invention further relates to materials and methods for the administration of aptamers capable of binding to platelet derived growth factor.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAptamers are nucleic acid molecules having specific binding affinity to molecules through interactions other than classic Watson-Crick base pairing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAptamers, like peptides generated by phage display or monoclonal antibodies (\"mAbs\"), are capable of specifically binding to selected targets and modulating the target's activity or binding interactions, \ne.g\n., through binding aptamers may, block their target's ability to function. Discovered by an \nin vitro\n selection process from pools of random sequence oligonucleotides, aptamers have been generated for over 130 proteins including growth factors, transcription factors, enzymes, immunoglobulins, and receptors. A typical aptamer is 10-15 kDa in size (20-45 nucleotides), binds its target with nanomolar to sub-nanomolar affinity, and discriminates against closely related targets (\ne.g\n., aptamers will typically not bind other proteins from the same gene family). A series of structural studies have shown that aptamers are capable of using the same types of binding interactions (\ne.g\n., hydrogen bonding, electrostatic complementarities, hydrophobic contacts, steric exclusion) that drive affinity and specificity in antibody-antigen complexes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAptamers have a number of desirable characteristics for use as therapeutics (and diagnostics) including high specificity and affinity, biological efficacy, and excellent pharmacokinetic properties. In addition, they offer specific competitive advantages over antibodies and other protein biologics, for example:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1) Speed and control\n. Aptamers are produced by an entirely \nin vitro\n process, allowing for the rapid generation of initial leads, including therapeutic leads. \nIn vitro\n selection allows the specificity and affinity of the aptamer to be tightly controlled and allows the generation of leads, including leads against both toxic and non-immunogenic targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n2) Toxicity and Immunogenicity\n. Aptamers as a class have demonstrated therapeutically acceptable toxicity and lack of immunogenicity. Whereas the efficacy of many monoclonal antibodies can be severely limited by immune response to antibodies themselves, it is extremely difficult to elicit antibodies to aptamers most likely because aptamers cannot be presented by T-cells via the MHC and the immune response is generally trained not to recognize nucleic acid fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n3) Administration.\n Whereas most currently approved antibody therapeutics are administered by intravenous infusion (typically over 2-4 hours), aptamers can be administered by subcutaneous injection (aptamer bioavailability via subcutaneous administration is >80% in monkey studies (\nTucker et al., J. Chromatography B. 732: 203-212, 1999\n)). With good solubility (>150 mg/mL) and comparatively low molecular weight (aptamer: 10-50 kDa; antibody: 150 kDa), a weekly dose of aptamer may be delivered by injection in a volume of less than 0.5 mL. In addition, the small size of aptamers allows them to penetrate into areas of conformational constrictions that do not allow for antibodies or antibody fragments to penetrate, presenting yet another advantage of aptamer-based therapeutics or prophylaxis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n4) Scalability and cost.\n Therapeutic aptamers are chemically synthesized and consequently can be readily scaled as needed to meet production demand. Whereas difficulties in scaling production are currently limiting the availability of some biologics and the capital cost of a large-scale protein production plant is enormous, a single large-scale oligonucleotide synthesizer can produce upwards of 100 kg/year and requires a relatively modest initial investment. The current cost of goods for aptamer synthesis at the kilogram scale is estimated at $500/g, comparable to that for highly optimized antibodies. Continuing improvements in process development are expected to lower the cost of goods to < $100/g in five years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n5) Stability\n. Therapeutic aptamers are chemically robust. They are intrinsically adapted to regain activity following exposure to factors such as heat and, denaturants and can be stored for extended periods (>1 yr) at room temperature as lyophilized powders.\n\n\n \n\n\nInterstitial Fluid Pressure\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe three most common types of cancer treatment are surgical removal of cancerous tissue, radiotherapy to obliterate cancerous tissue, and chemotherapy. These treatments are aimed at removing the cancerous tissues or cells or destroying them in the body with therapeutics or other agents. Chemotherapy remains a major treatment modality for solid tumors. To potentially reduce toxic side effects and to achieve higher efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs, strategies to improve distribution of drugs between normal tissues and tumors are highly desirable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA major obstacle in the treatment of solid tumors is the limited uptake of therapeutic agents into tumor tissue. Elevated interstitial fluid pressure (\"IFP\") is one of the physiologically distinctive properties of solid tumors that differ from healthy connective tissue and is considered to be the main obstacle limiting free diffusion of therapeutics into solid tumors. PDGF receptors, particularly PDGF-Î², have been implicated in the regulation of IFP. As a tumor enters a hyperproliferative state, blood supplying oxygen and other nutrients cannot keep up with the tumor's demands and a state of hypoxia results. Hypoxia triggers an \"angiogenic switch\" which up-regulates the expression of several factors, including VEGF and PDGF, which in turn serve to initiate angiogenesis. However, the angiogenesis that results forms an abnormal tumor vasculature. The tumor vasculature becomes impaired to the point of being unable to adequately drain excess fluid from the interstitium and fluid accumulation distends the elastic interstitial matrix causing an increase in pressure. When pressure exceeds capillary wall resistance, compression occurs and blood flow resistance increases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis property of most solid tumors, tumor interstitial hypertension or increased IFP, has been suggested as a potential target for efforts to increase tumor drug uptake (\nJain et al., (1987) Cancer Res., 47:3039-3051\n). Increased IFP acts as a barrier for tumor transvascular transport (\nJain et al. (1997), Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 26:71-90\n). Lessening of tumor IFP, or modulation of microvascular pressure, has been shown to increase transvascular transport of tumor-targeting antibodies or low-molecular weight tracer compounds (\nPietras et al., (2001), Cancer Res., 61, 2929-2934\n). The etiology of interstitial hypertension in tumors is poorly understood. One proposed theory is that the lack of lymphatic vessels in tumors is a contributing factor to the increased tumor IFP (\nJain et al., (1987), Cancer Res., 47:3039-3051\n). Another proposed theory is that the microvasculature and the supporting stroma compartment are likely to be important determinants for tumor IFP (\nPietras et al., (2002) Cancer Res., 62: 5476-5484\n). Accumulating evidence points toward the transmembrane PDGF Î²-receptor tyrosine kinase as a potential target for pharmacological therapeutics to modulate tumor interstitial hypertension. Among other potential targets are growth factors that bind to the PDGF Î²-receptor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPDGF Mediated Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition to IFP and the difficulty of penetrating tumors with therapeutics, another obstacle in cancer treatment are mutations in certain forms of PDGF mediated cancer leading to constitutive expression of PDGF. These mutations drive abnormal proliferation of cells which results in the various forms of cancer as shown in \nFigure 1\n (\nPietras et al., (2001), Cancer Res., 61, 2929-2934\n). A gene mutation results in amplification of PDGF Î±-receptors in high grade glioblastomas. In chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), constitutive activation of PDGF-Î² receptors results from a mutation which causes the fusion of Î²-receptors with proteins other than PDGF (\nGolub et al., (1994) Cell 77, 307-316\n, \nMagnusson et al., (2001) Blood 100, 623-626\n). Constitutive activation of PDGF-Î± -receptor due to activating point mutations has also been identified in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) (\nHeinreich et al., (2003) Science 299, 708-710\n). Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is associated with constitutive production of fusion proteins which are processed to PDGF-BB (\nO'Brian et al., (1998) Gene Chrom. Cancer 23, 187-193\n; \nShimiziu et al. (1999) Cancer Res. 59. 3719-3723\n;\n Simon et al. (1997) Nat. Genet., 15, 95-98\n). In addition to the constitutive activation of PDGF ligand and/or receptor due to mutations, up regulation has been shown in soft tissue sarcomas and gliomas (\nOstman and Heldin, (2001), Adv. Cancer Res. 80, 1-38\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPDGF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGrowth factors are substances that have a cell-proliferative effect on cells or tissues. Any given growth factor may have more than one receptor or induce cell proliferation in more than one cell line or tissue. PDGF belongs to the cysteine-knot growth factor family and was originally isolated from platelets for promoting cellular mitogenic and migratory activity. PDGF is a strong mitogen and has a pivotal role in regulation of normal cell proliferation such as fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, neuroglial cells and connective-tissue cells. In addition, PDGF mediates pathological cell growth such as in proliferative disorders, and also plays a role in angiogenesis. Another growth factor involved in tumor angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour PDGF polypeptide chains have been identified which are currently known to make up five dimeric PDGF isoforms: PDGF-AA, -BB, -CC, -DD, and -AB. The most abundant species are PDGF AB and BB. PDGF isoforms bind to Î± and Î² tyrosine kinase receptors. PDGF receptors are expressed by many different cell types within tumors. The binding of PDGF isoforms to their cognate receptors induces the dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation of specific residues in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the receptors and activation of the signaling pathway. PDGF isoforms -AA, -BB, -CC, and -AB induce PDGF Î±-receptor dimerization. PDGF-BB and PDGF-DD activate PDGF Î² receptor dimerization. All isoforms of PDGF except PDGF-AA activate both Î± and Î² receptors in cells which co-express both receptor types (\nFigure 2\n). Because they are potent mitogens, PDGF isoforms have been targeted for proliferative disease therapeutics development, such as cancer, diabetic retinopathy, glomerulonephritis, and restenosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPDGF, which is secreted by endothelial cells, acts as direct mitogen for fibroblasts, recruits pericytes and stimulates vascular smooth muscle cells. Many solid tumors display paracrine signaling of PDGF in the tumor stroma. PDGF is known to up-regulate synthesis of collagen and to mediate interactions of anchor proteins such as integrins with extracellular matrix (ECM) components. PDGF interactions between connective tissue, ECM and intracellular actin filament systems cause increased tensile strength which contributes to high IFP. High IFP is localized to the site of tumor and is associated with poor prognosis in human cancers as it increases with tumor size and severity and the grade of malignancy. The role of PDGF signaling in control of IFP and the up-regulated expression in various solid tumors has prompted investigation into whether the inhibition of PDGF signaling can decrease IFP and thereby increase drug uptake into solid tumors. Previous work has demonstrated that inhibition of PDGF signaling with small molecule receptor antagonists and a PDGF specific aptamer decreases interstitial fluid pressure and increases the uptake of chemothecapeutics into solid tumors (\nPietras et al., (2001), Cancer Res., 61: 2929-2934\n). \n \nWO 01/87351\nA\n \n, describes a method for treating solid tumors comprising administering a composition of a PDGF aptamer and a cytotoxic agent. The PDGF aptamer was identified using the SELEX process. A method is described for reducing the interstitial fluid pressure of a solid tumor comprising administering a PDGF aptamer. A method is also described for increasing the uptake of cytotoxic agents into a tumor comprising administering a composition comprising a PDGF aptamer and a cytotoxic agent.\n\n\n \nUS-B1-6 229 002\n \n discloses a method for preparing a complex comprised of a PDGF nucleic acid ligand and a nonimmunogenic, high molecular weight compound or lipophilic compound by identifying a PDGF nucleic acid ligand by SELEX methodology and associating the PDGF nucleic acid ligand with a non-immunogenic, high molecular weight compound or lipophilic compound.\n\n\n \nWO 2004/064760\n \n describes nucleic acid therapeutic compositions which are reported to be capable of binding to cytokines, growth factors and cell surface proteins, individually or in combinations of two or more, and methods for delivering these nucleic acid therapeutics in the treatment of glaucoma and other proliferative diseases of the eye.\n\n\n \nWO2004/050899\n \n describes materials and methods for producing aptamer therapeutics having modified nucleotide triphosphates incorporated into their sequence. The aptamers produced by the methods of the invention are stated to have increased stability and half life.\n\n\nPietras, et al. (Inhibition of PDGF receptor signalling in tumor stroma enhances antitumor effect of chemotherapy; Cancer Research, US. Vol 62, no 19, 1 October 2002, pages 5476-5484\n), investigate the effects of PDGF antagonists on chemotherapy response in two tumor models that display PDGF receptor expression restricted to the tumor stroma, and in which PDGF antagonists relieve tumor hypertension. Inhibitory PDGF aptamers and the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 were found to enhance the antitumor effect of Taxol on s.c. KAT-4 tumors in SCID mice. Treatment with only PDGF antagonists had no effect on tumor growth. Taxol uptake in tumors was increased by treatment with PDGF antagonists. Cotreatment with PDGF antagonists and Taxol was not associated with antiangiogenic effects, and PDGF antagonists did not enhance the Taxol effect on in vitro growth of KAT-4 cells. STI571 also increased the antitumor effects of 5-fluorouracil on s.c. PROb tumors in syngeneic BDIX rats, without increasing the effect of 5-fluorouracil on cultured PROb cells.\n\n\nGreen, et al. (Inhibitory DNA ligands to platelet-derived growth factor B-chain. Biochemistry, vol 35, no 45, 1996, pages 14413-14424\n), identified DNA molecules that bind to PDGF-AB with subnanomolar affinity from a randomized DNA library using in vitro selection. Individual ligands cloned from the affinity-enriched pool were found to bind to PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB with comparably high affinity (\nK\n \nd\n â 10\n-10\n M) and to PDGF-AA with lower affinity (>10\n-8\n M), indicating specific recognition of the PDGF B-chain in the context of the hetero- or homodimer. Green et al state that these DNA ligands represent a novel class of specific and potent antagonists of PDGF-BB and, by inference, PDGF-AB.\n\n\nFang, et al. (Synthetic DNA aptamers to detect protein molecular variant in a high-throughput fluorescence quenching assay. Chembiochem- A European Journal of Chemical Biology. \n), describes the development of a fluorescence-based assay with synthetic DNA aptamers that can detect and distinguish molecular variants of proteins in biological samples in a high-throughput process. Fang et al. used an aptamer with high affinity for the B chain of PDGF, labeled it with a fluorophore and a quencher at the two termini, and measured fluorescence quenching by PDGF. Fang et al report that the specific quenching can be used to detect PDGF at picomolar concentrations even in the presence of serum and other cell-derived proteins in cell culture media. The authors also state that PDGF AA, AB, and BB dimers can be distinguished from one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, it would be beneficial to have novel materials and methods in oncology therapy to reduce tumor IFP, decrease tumor angiogenesis, and reduce the deleterious effects of mutation by the constitutive expression of PDGF. The present disclosure provides materials and methods to meet these and other needs.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFigure 1\n is a schematic of gene mutations that give rise to constitutive PDGF receptor signaling in cancer cells found in glioblastomas, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and other soft tissue sarcomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2\n is a schematic of isoforms AA, BB, CC, DD, and AB of PDGF and cognate receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3\n is a schematic representation of the \nin vitro\n aptamer selection (SELEX\nâ¢\n) process from pools of random sequence oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4\n is a schematic of the transport of cytotoxins across tumor vasculature with and without PDGF antagonists by the methods of the present disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5\n is an illustration of a branched PEG reagent for coupling to a biomolecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6\n is an illustration of a branched PEG conjugated to the 5'end of an aptamer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7\n is an illustration depicting various PEGylation strategies representing standard mono-PEGylation, multiple PEGylation, and dimerization via PEGylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8A\n is a plot of an ion-exchange HPLC analysis of ARC127 (5'-[40K PEG]-(SEQ ID NO: 1)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:2)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:3)-3'-dT-3') freshly synthesized and stored at -20 Â°C for two years;

The preferred methods and materials are now described. Other features, objects, and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description. In the specification, the singular forms also include the plural unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. In the case of conflict, the present Specification will control.\n\n\n \n\n\nTHE SELEXâ¢ METHOD\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA suitable method for generating an aptamer is with the process entitled \"Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment\" (\"SELEXâ¢\") generally depicted in \nFigure 3\n. The SELEXâ¢ process is a method for the \nin vitro\n evolution of nucleic acid molecules with highly specific binding to target molecules and is described in, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/536,428, filed Jun. 11, 1990\n \n, now abandoned, \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,475,096\n \n entitled \"Nucleic Acid Ligands\", and \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,270,163\n \n (\nsee\n also \n \nWO 91/19813\n \n) entitled \"Nucleic Acid Ligands\". Each SELEXâ¢-identified nucleic acid ligand, \ni.e\n., each aptamer, is a specific ligand of a given target compound or molecule. The SELEXâ¢ process is based on the unique insight that nucleic acids have sufficient capacity for forming a variety of two- and three-dimensional structures and sufficient chemical versatility available within their monomers to act as ligands (\ni.e\n., form specific binding pairs) with virtually any chemical compound, whether monomeric or polymeric. Molecules of any size or composition can serve as targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSELEXâ¢ relies as a starting point upon a large library or pool of single stranded oligonucleotides comprising randomized sequences. The oligonucleotides can be modified or unmodified DNA, RNA, or DNA/RNA hybrids. In some examples, the pool comprises 100% random or partially random oligonucleotides. In other examples, the pool comprises random or partially random oligonucleotides containing at least one fixed sequence and/or conserved sequence incorporated within randomized sequence. In other examples, the pool comprises random or partially random oligonucleotides containing at least one fixed and/or conserved sequence at its 5' and/or 3' end which may comprise a sequence shared by all the molecules of the oligonucleotide pool. Fixed sequences are sequences common to oligonucleotides in the pool which are incorporated for a preselected purpose, such as CpG motifs described further below, hybridization sites for PCR primers, promoter sequences for RNA polymerases (\ne.g.\n, T3, T4, T7, and SP6), restriction sites, or homopolymeric sequences, such as poly A or poly T tracts, catalytic cores, sites for selective binding to affinity columns, and other sequences to facilitate cloning and/or sequencing of an oligonucleotide of interest. Conserved sequences are sequences, other than the previously described fixed sequences, shared by a number of aptamers that bind to the same target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oligonucleotides of the pool preferably include a randomized sequence portion as well as fixed sequences necessary for efficient amplification. Typically the oligonucleotides of the starting pool contain fixed 5' and 3' terminal sequences which flank an internal region of 30-50 random nucleotides. The randomized nucleotides can be produced in a number of ways including chemical synthesis and size selection from randomly cleaved cellular nucleic acids. Sequence variation in test nucleic acids can also be introduced or increased by mutagenesis before or during the selection/amplification iterations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe random sequence portion of the oligonucleotide can be of any length and can comprise ribonucleotides and/or deoxyribonucleotides and can include modified or non-natural nucleotides or nucleotide analogs. \nSee\n, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,958,691\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,660,985\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,958,691\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,698,687\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,817,635\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,672,695\n \n, and \n \nPCT Publication WO 92/07065\n \n. Random oligonucleotides can be synthesized from phosphodiester-linked nucleotides using solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis techniques well known in the art. \nSee\n, \ne.g.\n, \nFroehler et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 14:5399-5467 (1986\n) and \nFroehler et al., Tet. Lett. 27:5575-5578 (1986\n). Random oligonucleotides can also be synthesized using solution phase methods such as triester synthesis methods. \nSee\n, \ne.g.\n, \nSood et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 4:2557 (1977\n) and \nHirose et al., Tet. Lett., 28:2449 (1978\n). Typical syntheses carried out on automated DNA synthesis equipment yield 10\n14\n-10\n16\n individual molecules, a number sufficient for most SELEXâ¢ experiments. Sufficiently large regions of random sequence in the sequence design increases the likelihood that each synthesized molecule is likely to represent a unique sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe starting library of oligonucleotides may be generated by automated chemical synthesis on a DNA synthesizer. To synthesize randomized sequences, mixtures of all four nucleotides are added at each nucleotide addition step during the synthesis process, allowing for random incorporation of nucleotides. As stated above, in one embodiment, random oligonucleotides comprise entirely random sequences; however, in other embodiments, random oligonucleotides can comprise stretches of nonrandom or partially random sequences. Partially random sequences can be created by adding the four nucleotides in different molar ratios at each addition step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe starting library of oligonucleotides may be either RNA or DNA, or substituted RNA or DNA. In those instances where an RNA library is to be used as the starting library it is typically generated by synthesizing a DNA library, optionally PCR amplifying, then transcribing the DNA library \nin vitro\n using T7 RNA polymerase or modified T7 RNA polymerases, and purifying the transcribed library. The RNA or DNA library is then mixed with the target under conditions favorable for binding and subjected to step-wise iterations of binding, partitioning and amplification, using the same general selection scheme, to achieve virtually any desired criterion of binding affinity and selectivity. More specifically, starting with a mixture containing the starting pool of nucleic acids, the SELEXâ¢ method includes steps of: (a) contacting the mixture with the target under conditions favorable for binding; (b) partitioning unbound nucleic acids from those nucleic acids which have bound specifically to target molecules; (c) dissociating the nucleic acid-target complexes; (d) amplifying the nucleic acids dissociated from the nucleic acid-target complexes to yield a ligand-enriched mixture of nucleic acids; and (e) reiterating the steps of binding, partitioning, dissociating and amplifying through as many cycles as desired to yield highly specific, high affinity nucleic acid ligands to the target molecule. In those instances where RNA aptamers are being selected, the SELEXâ¢ method further comprises the steps of: (i) reverse transcribing the nucleic acids dissociated from the nucleic acid-target complexes before amplification in step (d); and (ii) transcribing the amplified nucleic acids from step (d) before restarting the process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithin a nucleic acid mixture containing a large number of possible sequences and structures, there is a wide range of binding affinities for a given target. A nucleic acid mixture comprising, for example, a 20 nucleotide randomized segment can have 4\n20\n candidate possibilities. Those which have the higher affinity (lower dissociation constants) for the target are most likely to bind to the target. After partitioning, dissociation and amplification, a second nucleic acid mixture is generated, enriched for the higher binding affinity candidates. Additional rounds of selection progressively favor the best ligands until the resulting nucleic acid mixture is predominantly composed of only one or a few sequences. These can then be cloned, sequenced and individually tested for binding affinity as pure ligands or aptamers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCycles of selection and amplification are repeated until a desired goal is achieved. In the most general case, selection/amplification is continued until no significant improvement in binding strength is achieved on repetition of the cycle. The method is typically used to sample approximately 10\n14\n different nucleic acid species but may be used to sample as many as about 10\n18\n different nucleic acid species. Generally, nucleic acid aptamer molecules are selected in a 5 to 20 cycle procedure. In one embodiment, heterogeneity is introduced only in the initial selection stages and does not occur throughout the replicating process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of SELEXâ¢, the selection process is so efficient at isolating those nucleic acid ligands that bind most strongly to the selected target, that only one cycle of selection and amplification is required. Such an efficient selection may occur, for example, in a chromatographic-type process wherein the ability of nucleic acids to associate with targets bound on a column operates in such a manner that the column is sufficiently able to allow separation and isolation of the highest affinity nucleic acid ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn many cases, it is not necessarily desirable to perform the iterative steps of SELEXâ¢ until a single nucleic acid ligand is identified. The target-specific nucleic acid ligand solution may include a family of nucleic acid structures or motifs that have a number of conserved sequences and a number of sequences which can be substituted or added without significantly affecting the affinity of the nucleic acid ligands to the target. By terminating the SELEXâ¢ process prior to completion, it is possible to determine the sequence of a number of members of the nucleic acid ligand solution family.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of nucleic acid primary, secondary and tertiary structures are known to exist. The structures or motifs that have been shown most commonly to be involved in non-Watson-Crick type interactions are referred to as hairpin loops, symmetric and asymmetric bulges, pseudoknots and myriad combinations of the same. Almost all known cases of such motifs suggest that they can be formed in a nucleic acid sequence of no more than 30 nucleotides. For this reason, it is often preferred that SELEXâ¢ procedures with contiguous randomized segments be initiated with nucleic acid sequences containing a randomized segment of between about 20 to about 50 nucleotides, and of about 30 to about 40 nucleotides in some embodiments. In one example, the 5'-fixed:random:3'-fixed sequence comprises a random sequence of about 30 to about 50 nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe core SELEXâ¢ method has been modified to achieve a number of specific objectives. For example, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,707,796\n \n describes the use of SELEXâ¢ in conjunction with gel electrophoresis to select nucleic acid molecules with specific structural characteristics, such as bent DNA. \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5, 763, 177\n \n describes SELEXâ¢ based methods for selecting nucleic acid ligands containing photoreactive groups capable of binding and/or photocrosslinking to and/or photoinactivating a target molecule. \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,567,588\n \n and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,861,254\n \n describe SELEXâ¢ based methods which achieve highly efficient partitioning between oligonucleotides having high and low affinity for a target molecule. \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,496,938\n \n describes methods for obtaining improved nucleic acid ligands after the SELEXâ¢ process has been performed. \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,705,337\n \n describes methods for covalently linking a ligand to its target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSELEXâ¢ can also be used to obtain nucleic acid ligands that bind to more than one site on the target molecule, and to obtain nucleic acid ligands that include non-nucleic acid species that bind to specific sites on the target. SELEXâ¢ provides means for isolating and identifying nucleic acid ligands which bind to any envisionable target, including large and small biomolecules such as nucleic acid-binding proteins and proteins not known to bind nucleic acids as part of their biological function as well as cofactors and other small molecules. For example, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,580,737\n \n discloses nucleic acid sequences identified through SELEXâ¢ which are capable of binding with high affinity to caffeine and the closely related analog, theophylline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCounter-SELEXâ¢ is a method for improving the specificity of nucleic acid ligands to a target molecule by eliminating nucleic acid ligand sequences with cross-reactivity to one or more non-target molecules. Counter- SELEXâ¢ is comprised of the steps of: (a) preparing a candidate mixture of nucleic acids; (b) contacting the candidate mixture with the target, wherein nucleic acids having an increased affinity to the target relative to the candidate mixture may be partitioned from the remainder of the candidate mixture; (c) partitioning the increased affinity nucleic acids from the remainder of the candidate mixture; (d) dissociating the increased affinity nucleic acids from the target; (e) contacting the increased affinity nucleic acids with one or more non-target molecules such that nucleic acid ligands with specific affinity for the non-target molecule(s) are removed; and (f) amplifying the nucleic acids with specific affinity only to the target molecule to yield a mixture of nucleic acids enriched for nucleic acid sequences with a relatively higher affinity and specificity for binding to the target molecule. As described above for SELEXâ¢ cycles of selection and amplification are repeated as necessary until a desired goal is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne potential problem encountered in the use of nucleic acids as therapeutics and vaccines is that oligonucleotides in their phosphodiester form may be quickly degraded in body fluids by intracellular and extracellular enzymes such as endonucleases and exonucleases before the desired effect is manifest. The SELEXâ¢ method thus encompasses the identification of high-affinity nucleic acid ligands containing modified nucleotides conferring improved characteristics on the ligand, such as improved \nin vivo\n stability or improved delivery characteristics. Examples of such modifications include chemical substitutions at the sugar and/or phosphate and/or base positions. SELEXâ¢-identified nucleic acid ligands containing modified nucleotides are described, \ne.g.\n, in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,660,985\n \n, which describes oligonucleotides containing nucleotide derivatives chemically modified at the 2' position of ribose, 5 position of pyrimidines, and 8 position of purines, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,756,703\n \n which describes oligonucleotides containing various 2'-modified pyrimidines, and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,580,737\n \n which describes highly specific nucleic acid ligands containing one or more nucleotides modified with 2'-amino (2'-NH\n2\n), 2'-fluoro (2'-F), and/or 2'-OMe substituents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications of the nucleic acid ligands contemplated in this disclosure include, but are not limited to, those which provide other chemical groups that incorporate additional charge, polarizability, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and fluxionality to the nucleic acid ligand bases or to the nucleic acid ligand as a whole. Modifications to generate oligonucleotide populations which are resistant to nucleases can also include one or more substitute internucleotide linkages, altered sugars, altered bases, or combinations thereof. Such modifications include, but are not limited to, 2'-position sugar modifications, 5-position pyrimidine modifications, 8-position purine modifications, modifications at exocyclic amines, substitution of 4-thiouridine, substitution of 5-bromo or 5-iodo-uracil, backbone modifications, phosphorothioate or alkyl phosphate modifications, methylations, and unusual base-pairing combinations such as the isobases isocytidine and isoguanidine. Modifications can also include 3' and 5' modifications such as capping.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, oligonucleotides are provided in which the P(O)O group is replaced by P(O)S (\"thioate\"), P(S)S (\"dithioate\"), P(O)NR\n2\n (\"amidite\"), P(O)R, P(O)OR', CO or CH\n2\n (\"formacetal\") or 3'-amine (-NH-CH2-CH\n2\n-), wherein each R or R' is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl. Linkage groups can be attached to adjacent nucleotides through an -O-, -N-, or -S- linkage. Not all linkages in the oligonucleotide are required to be identical. As used herein, the term phosphorothioate encompasses one or more non-bridging oxygen atoms in a phosphodiester bond replaced by one or more sulfur atoms\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further embodiments, the oligonucleotides comprise modified sugar groups, for example, one or more of the hydroxyl groups is replaced with halogen, aliphatic groups, or functionalized as ethers or amines. In one embodiment, the 2'-position of the furanose residue is substituted by any of an O-methyl, O-alkyl, O-allyl, S-alkyl, S-allyl, or halo group. Methods of synthesis of 2'-modified sugars are described, \ne.g.\n, in \nSproat, et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 19:733-738 (1991\n); \nCotten, et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 19:2629-2635 (1991\n); and \nHobbs, et al., Biochemistry 12:5138-5145 (1973\n). Other modifications are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications may be pre-SELEXâ¢ process modifications or post-SELEXâ¢ process modifications (modification of previously identified unmodified ligands) or may be made by incorporation into the SELEXâ¢ process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPre-SELEXâ¢ process modifications or those made by incorporation into the SELEX process yield nucleic acid ligands with both specificity for their SELEXâ¢ target and improved stability, \ne.g.\n, \nin vivo\n stability. Post-SELEXâ¢ process modifications made to nucleic acid ligands may result in improved stability, \ne.g., in vivo\n stability without adversely affecting the binding capacity of the nucleic acid ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe SELEXâ¢ method encompasses combining selected oligonucleotides with other selected oligonucleotides and non-oligonucleotide functional units as described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,637,459\n \n and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,683,867\n \n. The SELEXâ¢ method further encompasses combining selected nucleic acid ligands with lipophilic or non-immunogenic high molecular weight compounds in a diagnostic or therapeutic complex, as described, \ne.g.\n, in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,011,020\n \n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,051,698\n \n, and \n \nPCT Publication No. WO 98/18480\n \n. These patents and applications teach the combination of a broad array of shapes and other properties, with the efficient amplification and replication properties of oligonucleotides, and with the desirable properties of other molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe identification of nucleic acid ligands to small, flexible peptides via the SELEXâ¢ method has also been explored. Small peptides have flexible structures and usually exist in solution in an equilibrium of multiple conformers, and thus it was initially thought that binding affinities may be limited by the conformational entropy lost upon binding a flexible peptide. However, the feasibility of identifying nucleic acid ligands to small peptides in solution was demonstrated in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,648,214\n \n in which high affinity RNA nucleic acid ligands to substance P, an 11 amino acid peptide, were identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer with specificity and binding affinity to the target(s) of the present disclosure are typically selected by the SELEXâ¢ process as described herein. As part of the SELEXâ¢ process, the sequences selected to bind to the target are then optionally minimized to determine the minimal sequence having the desired binding affinity. The selected aptamer sequences and/or the minimized aptamer sequences are optionally optimized by performing random or directed mutagenesis of the sequence to increase binding affinity or alternatively to determined which positions in the sequence are essential for binding activity. For example, a \"doped reselections\" may be used to explore the sequence requirements within an aptamer. During doped reselection, selections are carried out with a synthetic, degenerate pool that has been designed based on a single sequence. The level of degeneracy usually varies from 70% to 85% wild type nucleotide. In general, neutral mutations are observed following doped reselection but in some cases sequence changes can result in improvements in affinity. Additionally, selections can be performed with sequences incorporating modified sequences to stabilize the aptamer molecules against degradation \nin vivo.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2'MODIFIED SELEXâ¢\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order for an aptamer to be suitable for use as a therapeutic, it is preferably inexpensive to synthesize, safe and stable \nin vivo.\n Wild-type RNA and DNA aptamers are typically not stable \nin vivo\n because of their susceptibility to degradation by nucleases. Resistance to nuclease degradation can be greatly increased, if desired, by the incorporation of modifying groups at the 2'-position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2'-fluoro and 2'-amino groups have been successfully incorporated into oligonucleotide libraries from which aptamers have been subsequently selected. However, these modifications greatly increase the cost of synthesis of the resultant aptamer, and may introduce safety concerns in some cases because of the possibility that the modified nucleotides could be recycled into host DNA by degradation of the modified oligonucleotides and subsequent use of the nucleotides as substrates for DNA synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAptamers that contain 2'-O-methyl (\"2'-OMe\") nucleotides, as provided in some embodiments herein, overcome many of these drawbacks. Oligonucleotides containing 2'-OMe nucleotides are nuclease-resistant and inexpensive to synthesize. Although 2'-OMe nucleotides are ubiquitous in biological systems, natural polymerases do not accept 2'-OMe NTPs as substrates under physiological conditions, thus there are no safety concerns over the recycling of 2'-OMe nucleotides into host DNA. The SELEXâ¢ methods used to generate 2'-modified aptamers is described, \ne.g.\n, in \n \nU.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/430,761, filed December 3, 2002\n \n, \n \nU.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/487,474, filed July 15, 2003\n \n, \n \nU.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/517,039, filed November 4, 2003\n \n, \n \nU.S. Patent Application No. 10/729,581, filed December 3, 2003\n \n, \n \nU.S. Patent Application No. 10/873,856 filed June 21, 2004\n \n, entitled \"Method for \nin vitro\n Selection of2'-OMe Substituted Nucleic Acids\", and \n \nU.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/696,295, filed June 30, 2005\n \n, entitled \"Improved Materials and Methods for the Generation of Fully 2'-Modified Containing Nucleic Acid Transcripts\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure includes aptamers that bind to and modulate the function of PDGF which contain modified nucleotides (\ne.g.\n, nucleotides which have a modification at the 2'position) to make the oligonucleotide more stable than the unmodified oligonucleotide to enzymatic and chemical degradation as well as thermal and physical degadation. Although there are several examples of 2'-OMe containing aptamers in the literature (\nsee\n, \ne.g.\n, \nRuckman et al., J.Biol.Chem, (1998) 273, 20556-20567-695\n) these were generated by the \nin vitro\n selection of libraries of modified transcripts in which the C and U residues were 2'-fluoro (2'-F) substituted and the A and G residues were 2'-OH. Once functional sequences were identified then each A and G residue was tested for tolerance to 2'-OMe substitution, and the aptamer was re-synthesized having all A and G residues which tolerated 2'-OMe substitution as 2'-OMe residues. Most of the A and G residues of aptamers generated in this two-step fashion tolerate substitution with 2'-OMe residues, Although, on average, approximately 20% do not. Consequently, aptamers generated using this method tend to contain from two to four 2'-OH residues, and stability and cost of synthesis are compromised as a result. By incorporating modified nucleotides into the transcription reaction which generate stabilized oligonucleotides used in oligonucleotide libraries from which aptamers are selected and enriched by SELEXâ¢ (and/or any of its variations and improvements, including those described herein), the methods of the present disclosure eliminate the need for stabilizing the selected aptamer oligonucleotides (\ne.g.\n, by resynthesizing the aptamer oligonucleotides with modified nucleotides).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the present disclosure provides aptamers comprising combinations of 2'-OH, 2'-F, 2'-deoxy, and 2'-OMe modifications of the ATP, GTP, CTP, TTP, and UTP nucleotides. In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides aptamers comprising combinations of 2'-OH, 2'-F, 2'-deoxy, 2'-OMe, 2'-NH\n2\n, and 2'-methoxyethyl modifications of the ATP, GTP, CTP, TTP, and UTP nucleotides. In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides aptamers comprising 56 combinations of 2'-OH, 2'-F, 2'-deoxy, 2'-OMe, 2'-NH\n2\n, and 2'-methoxyethyl modifications of the ATP, GTP, CTP, TTP, and UTP nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2'- modified aptamers of some embodiments of the disclosure are created using modified polymerases, \ne.g.\n, a modified T7 polymerase, having a rate of incorporation of modified nucleotides having bulky substituents at the furanose 2' position that is higher than that of wild-type polymerases. For example, a mutant T7 polymerase (Y639F) in which the tyrosine residue at position 639 has been changed to phenylalamine readily utilizes 2'deoxy, 2'amino-, and 2'fluoro- nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) as substrates and has been widely used to synthesize modified RNAs for a variety of applications. However, this mutant T7 polymerase reportedly can not readily utilize (\ni.e\n.. incorporate) NTPs with bulky 2'-substituents such as 2'-OMe or 2'-azido (2'-N\n3\n) substituents. For incorporation of bulky 2' substituents, a T7 polymerase mutant (Y639F/H784A) having the histidine at position 784 changed to an alanine residue in addition to the Y639F mutation has been described and has been used in limited circumstances to incorporate modified pyrimidine NTPs. See \nPadilla, R. and Sousa, R., Nucleic Acids Res., 2002, 30(24): 138\n. A Y639F/H784A/K378R mutant T7 RNA polymerase has been used in limited circumstances to incorporate modified purine and pyrimidine NTPs, \ne.g\n., 2'-OMe NPTs, but requires a spike of 2'-OH GTP for transcription. See \nBurmeister et.al., Chemistry and Biology, 2005, 12: 25-33\n. A mutant T7 polymerase (H784A) having the histidine at position 784 changed to an alanine residue has also been described. \nPadilla et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2002, 30: 138\n. In both the Y639F/H784A mutant and H784A - mutant T7 polymerases, the change to a smaller amino acid residue such as alanine allows for the incorporation of bulkier nucleotide substrates, \ne.g\n., 2'-0 methyl substituted nucleotides. \nSee\n \nChelliserry, K. and Ellington, A.D., Nature Biotech, 2004, 9:1155-60\n. Additional T7 RNA polymerase have been described with mutations in the active site of the T7 RNA polymerase which more readily incorporate bulky 2'-modified substrates, \ne.g.\n a T7 mutant RNA polymerase having the tyrosine residue at position 639 changed to a leucine (Y639L). However activity is often sacrificed for increased substrate specificity conferred by such mutations, leading to low transcript yields. \nSee\n \nPadilla R and Sousa, R., Nucleic Acids Res., 1999, 27(6): 15G1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, it has been found that under the conditions disclosed herein, the Y693F mutant can be used for the incorporation of all 2'-OMe substituted NTPs except GTP and the Y639F/H784A, Y639F/H784A/K378R, Y639L/H784A, and Y639L/H784A/K378R mutant T7 RNA polymerases can be used for the incorporation of all 2'-OMe substituted NTPs including GTP. It is expected that the H784A mutant possesses properties similar to the Y639F and the Y639F/H784A mutants when used under the conditions disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2'-modified oligonucleotides may be synthesized entirely of modified nucleotides, or with a subset of modified nucleotides. All nucleotides may be modified, and all may contain the same modification. All nucleotides may be modified, but contain different modifications, \ne.g\n., all nucleotides containing the same base may have one type of modification, while nucleotides containing other bases may have different types of modification. All purine nucleotides may have one type of modification (or are unmodified), while all pyrimidine nucleotides have another, different type of modification (or are unmodified). In this way, transcripts, or libraries of transcripts are generated using any combination of modifications, including for example, ribonucleotides (2'-OH), deoxyribonucleotides (2'-doxy), 2'-F, and 2'-OMe nucleotides. A transcription mixture containing 2'-OMe C and U and 2'-OH A and G is referred to as a \"rRmY\" mixture and aptamers selected therefrom are referred to as \"rRmY\" aptamers. A transcription mixture containing deoxy A and G and 2'-OMe U and C is referred to as a \"dRmY\" mixture and aptamers selected therefrom are referred to as \"dRmY\" aptamers. A transcription mixture containing 2'-OMe A, C, and U, and 2'-OH G is referred to as a \"rGmH'' mixture and aptamers selected therefrom are referred to as \"rGmH\" aptamers. A transcription mixture alternately containing 2'-OMe A, C, U and G and 2'-OMe A, U and C and 2'-F G is referred to as a \"alternating mixture\" and aptamers selected therefrom are referred to as \"alternating mixture\" aptamers. A transcription mixture containing 2'-OMe A, U, C, and G, where up to 10% of the G's are ribonucleotides is referred to as a \"r/mGmH\" mixture and aptamers selected therefrom are referred to as \"r/mGmH\" aptamers. A transcription mixture containing 2'-OMe A, U, and C, and 2'-F G is referred to as a \"fGmH\" mixture and aptamers selected therefrom are referred to as \"fGmH\" aptamers. A transcription mixture containing 2'-OH A and G, and 2'-F C and U is referred to as an \"rRfY\" mixture and aptamers selected therefrom are referred to as \"rRfY\" aptamers. A transcription mixture containing 2'-OMe A, U, and C, and deoxy G is referred to as a \"dGmH\" mixture and aptamers selected therefrom are referred to as \"dGmH\" aptamers. A transcription mixture containing deoxy A, and 2'-OMe C, G and U is referred to as a \"dAmB\" mixture and aptamers selected therefrom are referred to as \"dAmB\" aptamers, and a transcription mixture containing all 2'-OH nucleotides is referred to as a \"rN\" mixture and aptamers selected therefrom are referred to as \"rN\", \"rRrY\", or \"RNA\" aptamers. A transcription mixture containing 2'-OH adenosine triphosphate and guanosine triphosphate and deoxy cytidine triphosphate and thymidine triphosphate is referred to as a rRdY mixture and aptamers selected therefrom are referred to as \"rRdY\" aptamers. A \"mRmY\" aptamer is one containing only 2'-OMe nucleotides except for the starting nucleotide which is 2'-hydroxy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred embodiment includes any combination of 2'-OH, 2'-deoxy and 2'-OMe nucleotides. Another embodiment includes any combination of 2'-deoxy and 2'-OMe nucleotides. Yet another embodiment includes any combination of 2'-deoxy and 2'-OMe nucleotides in which the pyrimidines are 2'-OMe (such as dRmY, mRmY or dGmH).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncorporation of modified nucleotides into the aptamers of the disclosure may be accomplished before (pre-) the selection process (\ne.g\n., a pre-SELEXâ¢ process modification). Optionally, aptamers of the disclosure in which modified nucleotides have been incorporated by pre-SELEXâ¢ process modification can be further modified by a post-SELEXâ¢ modification process (\ni.e\n., a post-SELEXâ¢ process modification after a pre-SELEXâ¢ modification). Pre-SELEXâ¢ process modifications yield modified nucleic acid ligands with specificity for the SELEXâ¢ target and also improved \nin vivo\n stability. Post-SELEXâ¢ process modifications, \ni.e\n., modification (\ne.g\n., truncation, deletion, substitution or additional nucleotide modifications of previously identified ligands having nucleotides incorporated by pre-SELEXâ¢ process modification) can result in a further improvement of \nin vivo\n stability without adversely affecting the binding capacity of the nucleic acid ligand having nucleotides incorporated by pre-SELEXâ¢ process modification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo generate pools of 2'-modified (\ne.g\n., 2'-OMe) RNA transcripts in conditions under which a polymerase accepts 2'-modified NTPs the Y693F, Y693F/ K378R, Y693F/H784A, Y693F/H784A/K378R, Y693L/H784A, Y693L/H784A/K378R, Y639L, or the Y639L/K378R mutant T7 RNA polymerases can be used. A preferred polymerase is the Y639L/H784A mutant T7 RNA polymerase. Another preferred polymerase is the Y639L/H784A/K378R mutant T7 RNA polymerase. Other T7 RNA polymerases, particularly those that exhibit a high tolerance for bulky 2'-substituents, may also be used in the present disclosure. When used in a template-directed polymerization using the conditions disclosed herein, the Y639L/H784A or the Y639L/H784A/K378R mutant T7 RNA polymerase can be used for the incorporation of all 2'-OMe NTPs, including GTP, with higher transcript yields than achieved by using the Y639F, Y639F/K378R, Y639F/H784A, Y639F/H784A/K378R, Y639L, or the Y639L/K378R mutant T7 RNA polymerases. When used under the 2'modified SELEXâ¢ transcription conditions disclosed herein, the Y639L/H784A and Y639L/H784A/K378R mutant T7 RNA polymerases do not require 2'-OH GTP to achieve high yields of 2'-modified, \ne.g\n., 2'-OMe containing oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of factors have been determined to be important for the transcription conditions useful in the methods disclosed herein. For example, increases in the yields of modified transcript are observed when a leader sequence is incorporated into the 5' end of the DNA transcription template. The leader sequence is typically 6-15 nucleotides long, and may be composed of all purines, or a mixture of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscription can be divided into two phases: the first phase is initiation, during which an NTP is added to the 3'-hydroxyl end of GTP (or another substituted guanosine) to yield a dinucleotide which is then extended by about 10-12 nucleotides; the second phase is elongation, during which transcription proceeds beyond the addition of the first about 10-12 nucleotides. It has been found that small amounts of 2'-OH GTP added to a transcription mixture containing an excess of 2'-OMe GTP are sufficient to enable the polymerase to initiate transcription using 2'-OH GTP, but once transcription enters the elongation phase the reduced discrimination between 2'-OMe and 2'-OH GTP, and the excess of 2'-OMe GTP over 2'-OH GTP allows the incorporation of principally the 2'-OMe GTP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother important factor in the incorporation of 2'-OMe substituted nucleotides into transcripts is the use of both divalent magnesium and manganese in the transcription mixture. Different combinations of concentrations of magnesium chloride and manganese chloride have been found to affect yields of 2'-O-methylated transcripts, the optimum concentration of the magnesium and manganese chloride being dependent on the concentration in the transcription reaction mixture of NTPs which complex divalent metal ions. To obtain the greatest yields of maximally 2'- O-methylated transcripts (\ni.e\n., all 2'-OMe A, C, and U and about 90% of G nucleotides), concentrations of approximately 5 mM magnesium chloride and 1.5 mM manganese chloride are preferred when each NTP is present at a concentration of 0.5 mM. When the concentration of each NTP is 1.0 mM, concentrations of approximately 6.5 mM magnesium chloride and 2.0 mM manganese chloride are preferred. When the concentration of each NTP is 2.0 mM, concentrations of approximately 9.5 mM magnesium chloride and 3.0 mM manganese chloride are preferred. In any case, departures from these concentrations of up to two-fold still give significant amounts of modified transcripts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPriming transcription with GMP or guanosine, or another non-2'-OMe non-triphosphate is also important. This effect results from the specificity of the polymerase for the initiating nucleotide. As a result, the 5'-terminal nucleotide of any transcript generated in this fashion is likely to be 2'-OH G. The preferred concentration of GMP (or guanosine) is 0.5 mM and even more preferably 1 mM. It has also been found that including PEG, preferably PEG-8000, in the-transcription reaction is useful to maximize incorporation of modified nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor maximum incorporation of 2'-OMe ATP (100%), UTP (100`%), CTP(100%)) and GTP (~90%) (\"r/mGmH\") into transcripts the following conditions are preferred: HEPES buffer 200 mM, \nDTT\n 40 mM, \nspermidine\n 2 mM, PEG-8000 10% (w/v), Triton X-100 0.0.1% (w/v), \nMgCl\n \n \n \n2\n 5 mM (6.5 mM where the concentration of each 2'-OMe NTP is 1.0 mM), MnCl\n2\n 1.5 mM (2.0 mM where the concentration of each 2'-OMe NTP is 1.0 mM), 2'-OMe NTP (each) 500 ÂµM (more preferably, 1.0 mM), 2'-\nOH GTP\n 30 ÂµM, 2'-\nOH GMP\n 500 ÂµM, pH 7.5, Y639F/H784A \nT7 RNA Polymerase\n 200 nM, inorganic pyrophosphatase units/ml, and an all-purine leader sequence of at least 8 nucleotides long.

The resulting sequences are already partially stabilized, eliminating this step from the post-SELEXâ¢ process to arrive at an optimized aptamer sequence and giving a more highly stabilized aptamer as a result. Another advantage of the 2'-OMe SELEXâ¢ process is that the resulting sequences are likely to have fewer 2'-OH nucleotides required in the sequence, possibly none. To the extent 2'OH nucleotides remain they may be removed by performing post-SELEXâ¢ modifcations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described below, lower but still useful yields of transcripts fully incorporating 2' substituted nucleotides can be obtained under conditions other than the optimized conditions described above.

In addition, the methods of the present disclosure provide for the optional use of chelating agents in the transcription reaction condition including, for example, EDTA, EGTA, and DTT.\n\n\n \n\n\nAPTAMER MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAptamer Medicinal Chemistry is an aptamer improvement technique in which sets of variant aptamers are chemically synthesized. These sets of variants typically differ from the parent aptamer by the introduction of a single substituent, and differ from each other by the location of this substituent. These variants are then compared to each other and to the parent. Improvements in characteristics may be profound enough that the inclusion of a single substituent may be all that is necessary to achieve a particular therapeutic criterion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively the information gleaned from the set of single variants may be used to design further sets of variants in which more than one substituent is introduced simultaneously. In one design strategy, all of the single substituent variants are ranked, the top 4 are chosen and all possible double (6), triple (4) and quadruple (I) combinations of these 4 single substituent variants are synthesized and assayed. In a second design strategy, the best single substituent variant is considered to be the new parent and all possible double substituent variants that include this highest-ranked single substituent variant are synthesized and assayed. Other strategies may be used, and these strategies may be applied repeatedly such that the number of substituents is gradually increased while continuing to identify further-improved variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAptamer Medicinal Chemistry may be used particularly as a method to explore the local, rather than the global, introduction of substituents. Because aptamers are discovered within libraries that are generated by transcription, any substituents that are introduced during the SELEXâ¢ process must be introduced globally. For example, if it is desired to introduce phosphorothioate linkages between nucleotides then they can only be introduced at every A (or every G, C, T, U etc.) (globally substituted). Aptamers which require phosphorothioates at some As (or some G, C, T, U etc.) (locally substituted) but cannot tolerate it at other As cannot be readily discovered by this process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kinds of substituent that can be utilized by the Aptamer Medicinal Chemistry process are only limited by the ability to generate them as solid-phase synthesis reagents and introduce them into an oligomer synthesis scheme. The process is certainly not limited to nucleotides alone. Aptamer Medicinal Chemistry schemes may include substituents that introduce steric bulk, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, lipophilicity, lipophobicity, positive charge, negative charge, neutral charge, zwitterions, polarizability, nuclease-resistance, conformational rigidity, conformational flexibility, protein-binding characteristics, mass etc. Aptamer Medicinal Chemistry schemes may include base-modifications, sugar-modifications or phosphodiester linkage-modifcations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen considering the kinds of substituents that are likely to be beneficial within the context of a therapeutic aptamer, it may be desirable to introduce substitutions that fall into one or more of the following categories:\n\n \n \n \n(1) Substituents already present in the body, \ne.g\n., 2'-deoxy, 2'-ribo, 2'-O-methyl purines or pyrimidines or 5-methyl cytosine.\n \n(2) Substituents already part of an approved therapeutic, \ne.g\n., phosphorothioate-linked oligonucleotides.\n \n(3) Substituents that hydrolyze or degrade to one of the above two categories, \ne.g\n., methylphosphonate-linked oligonucleotides.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe PDGF aptamers of the disclosure include aptamers developed through aptamer medicinal chemistry as described herein.\n\n\n \n\n\nPDGF AND PDGF-VEGF SPECIFIC BINDING APTAMERS AS ONCOLOGY THERAPEUTICS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAptamers specifically capable of binding and inhibiting different PDGF isoforms are set forth herein. These aptamers, which include aptamers that bind only to PDGF, aptamers that bind to both PDGF and VEGF, and either of the above aptamers having a CpG motif incorporated therein, provide a low-toxicity, safe, and effective modality of inhibiting most PDGF-mediated tumor progression, including without limitation, glioblastomas, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), gastrointestinal stromal tumors, (GIST), and other soft tissue sarcomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of PDGF and PDGF-VEGF specific binding aptamers for use as oncology therapeutics include the following sequences:\n\n\n \n\n\nPDGF-binding aptamers:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nARC126:\n 5'-(5'-NH\n2\n-dC-dA-dG-dG-dC-fU-dA-fC-mG- 3', SEQ ID NO. 1)-HEG-(5'-dC-dG-T-dA-mG-dA-mG-dC-dA-fU-fC-mA-3', SEQ ID NO.2)-HEG-(5'-T-dG-dA-T-fC-fC-fU-mG-3'dT-3', SEQ ID NO. 3)-3' , wherein HEG = hexaethylene glycol amidite.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nARC127:\n 5'-[40K PEG]-(5'-NH\n2\n-dC-dA-dG-dG-dC-fU-dA-fC-mG- 3', SEQ ID NO. 1)-HEG-(5'-dC-dG-T-dA-mG-dA-mG-dC-dA-fU-fC-mA-3', SEQ ID NO.2)-HEG-(5'-T-dG-dA-T-fC-fC-fU-mG-3'dT-3', SEQ ID NO. 3)-3', wherein HEG = hexaethylene glycol amidite.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nARC240:\n 5'-[20K PEG]-(5'-NH\n2\n-dC-dA-dG-dG-dC-fU-dA-fC-mG- 3', SEQ ID NO. 1)-HEG-(5'-dC-dG-T-dA-mG-dA-mG-dC-dA-fU-fC-mA-3', SEQ ID NO.2)-HEG-(5'-T-dG-dA-T-fC-fC-fU-mG-3'dT-3', SEQ ID NO. 3)-3', wherein HEG = hexaethylene glycol amidite.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nARC308 :\n 5'-[30K PEG]-(5'-NH\n2\n-dC-dA-dG-dG-dC-fU-dA-fC-mG- 3', SEQ ID NO. 1)-HEG-(5'-dC-dG-T-dA-mG-dA-mG-dC-dA-fU-fC-mA-3'.

Pietras et al. validated the hypothesis that PDGF-B is involved in IFP and that blocking PDGF-B function could lead to increased uptake of chemotherapeutics into tumors. (\nPietras et al., (2003), Cancer Cell vol. 3 p.439-443\n). Using the KAT-4 thyroid carcinoma model, which has known PDGF paracrine signaling properties, Pietras \net al.\n demonstrated that KAT-4 tumors expressed PDGF Î²-receptors in the stromal and that PDGF-B bound KAT-4 cells \nin vitro.\n Next, Pietras \net al\n. used the tyrosine kinase inhibiting drug STI571 (GLEEVEC\nâ¢\n) to block PDGF-B signaling in KAT-4 tumors and showed that this treatment significantly decreased tumor IFP \nin vivo\n leading to increased uptake of taxol. However, since STI571 targets both PDGF Î± and Î² receptors, as well as Kit, Abl, and Arg tyrosine kinases, it was impossible to know if the effect of STI571 was due to PDGF-B blockage alone. This ambiguity was solved by using a highly specific aptamer to block PDGF-B in similar experiments. The aptamer has an affinity of 100 pM for PDGF-B and no appreciable affinity for the PDGF-A sequence. As with STI571, treatment of KAT-4 xenograft mice with PEG-conjugated PDGF-B aptamer lowered IFP and dramatically increased tumor uptake of taxol. Most importantly, aptamer treatment strongly enhanced taxol's ability to inhibit tumor growth. In addition, a currently marketed cancer therapeutic, the PDGF-receptor antagonist GLEEVEC\nâ¢\n has been shown to be effective at reducing tumor IFP and increasing the tumor uptake of cytotoxins when used in combination with a cytotoxin such as taxol. The methods and materials of the present are used to inhibit the biological activity of PDGF-B and its etiology in tumor development and growth by enhancing the uptake and efficacy of chemotherapeutics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombination therapy methods of the present disclosure include combining PDGF-specific aptamers of the present disclosure with cytotoxic agents. Without wishing to be bound by theory, combining PDGF-specific aptamers with other known cytotoxins, may provide an effective method of delivering drug specifically at the site of tumors, for example, by the selective lowering of IFP in tumor vessels. Such, in turn allows the increased uptake of cytotoxins in tumors through the tumor vasculature. \nFigure 4\n shows a schematic of the transport to cytotoxins across tumor vasculature with and without PDGF antagonists by the methods of the present invention (\nPietras et al., (2003), Cancer Cell vol. 3 p.439-443\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PDGF aptamers of the present disclosure can be used in combination with a variety of known cytotoxic or cytostatic (collectively, \"cytotoxic\") agents to lower tumor IFP, and thereby increase delivery and tumor uptake of cytotoxic agents to all solid tumors. Suitable cytotoxic or cytostatic agents include tubulin stabilizers/destabilizers, anti-metabolites, purine synthesis inhibitors, nucleoside analogs, and DNA alkylating or other DNA modifying agents, including but not limited to paclitaxel (TAXOL\nâ¢\n), docetaxel, irinotecan, topotecan, gemcitabine, epothilone, cisplatinum, carboplatin, 5-fluoro-U, calicheamycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, AraC (cytarabine), vinblastin, daunorubicin, oxaliplatinum, cyclophosphamide, iflosamide, pharmarubicin, epirubicin, vinflunine, oblimersen sodium, permetrexed, kinase inhibitors, including but not limited to EGF receptor kinase, VEGF receptor kinase, aurora kinase, either alone or in any combination thereof. The PDGF aptamers of the present disclosure can be used in combination with a variety of known vascular targeting agents wherein \"vascular targeting agent\" means a small molecule therapeutic (\ne.g\n., irinotecan), a protein therapeutic (\ne.g\n., bevicizumab), and/or an oligonucleotide therapeutic (\ne.g\n., antisense molecules, siRNA molecules) which modifies the existing vasculature and neovasculature network that supports blood and lymphatic flow to the tumor. The PDGF aptamers of the present disclosure can be used in combination with a conjugate therapeutic comprising a binding or targeting moiety, and a cytotoxic moiety, wherein the binding or targeting moiety is, but is not limited to, an aptamer, antibody, including, but not limited to trastuzumab, rituximab, cetuximab, panitumumab, gemtuzumab, bevicizumab, and tositumomab, peptide, a vascular targeting agent or folate compound, and wherein the cytotoxic moiety belongs to a class of compounds including but not limited to, tubulin stabilizers/destabilizers, anti-metabolites, purine synthesis inhibitors, nucleoside analogs, and DNA alkylating agents, other DNA modifying agents, or vascular disruptive agents (\ne.g\n., flavonoids) alone or in any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe materials and methods of the present disclosure provide a more effective way of administering known chemotherapeutic agents to inhibit solid tumor formation which results in a variety of cancers including but not limited to colorectal, pancreatic, breast, lung, prostate, and ovarian cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, PDGF aptamer compositions of the present disclosure can be used as anti-angiogenic agents to inhibit the formation of tumor vasculature by targeting pericytes. In one example, a PDGF aptamer composition of the present disclosure can be used in combination with a VEGF/VEGFR antagonist, such as an aptamer specific for VEGF. Such combinations may provide a more effective way of inhibiting tumor angiogenesis than either a PDGF aptamer therapeutic or VEGF/VEGFR antagonist therapeutic alone. One advantage of the PDGF-B- and VEGF-targeting agents of the present disclosure is that the therapeutic compositions of the present disclosure are exquisitely specific to their target ligand and hence do not appear to exhibit any off-target tyrosine kinase activity; and are not designed to enter cells to elicit their biological function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrently marketed small molecule kinase inhibitor therapeutics, for example GLEEVEC\nâ¢\n, exhibit high off-target activity. GLEEVEC\nâ¢\n targets both the Î± and Î² tyrosine kinase receptors in addition to BCR-Abl, C-kit and Arg tyrosine kinases. Off-target activity is a major impediment to the development of small molecule kinase inhibitors in general. Additionally, small molecule kinase inhibitors, such as GLEEVEC\nâ¢\n, are administered at or near their maximum tolerated dose when used in the treatment of solid tumors. The toxicity of GLEEVEC\nâ¢\n and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is likely limited by both mechanism-related side-effects and non-mechanism (off-target) related side-effects. Based on \nin vivo\n experiments with ARC127 (5'-[40K PEG]-(SEQ ID NO.1)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:2)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:3)-3'-dT-3') and ARC308 (5'-[30K PEG]-(SEQ ID NO.1)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:2)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:3)-3'-dT-3') dose-limiting side effects are not evident. Additional advantages are that the aptamer therapeutic compositions of the present disclosure can be administered via intravenous, subcutaneous, or intra-peritoneal routes. Unlike monoclonal antibody cancer therapeutics, which are immunogenic, aptamers are non-immunogenic, thus reaction to the drug and/or resistance to the drug are not an issue.\n\n\n \n\n\nAPTAMERS TO PDGF AND PDGF ISOFORMS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe materials of the present disclosure comprise a series of nucleic acid aptamers of 31-35 nucleotides in length (SEQ ID NO:1 to SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:9 to SEQ ID NO:35, SEQ ID NO:36 to SEQ ID NO:73, SEQ ID NO:85, and SEQ ID NO:77 to SEQ ID NO:81, and SEQ ID NO: 86-89, 91, 93-95 and 102) which bind specifically to PDGF-B protein \nin vitro\n and which functionally block the activity of PDGF-BB in \nin vivo\n and cell-based assays. The anti-PDGF-B aptamers sequences of the present disclosure are derived from a parent molecule (ARC126 (5'-(SEQ ID NO.1)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:2)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:3)-3'-dT-3') which contains seven individual 2'F containing residues (\nFigure 9A\n). 2'F containing residues were incorporated into ARC126 to increase the \nin vitro\n serum and \nin vivo\n stability of the therapeutic aptamer by blocking its degradation by serum endonucleases and/or exonucleases. In an effort to replace potentially toxic 2'F containing nucleotide residues in the ARC126 anti-PDGF-B aptamer, a new series of fully 2'F-free aptamers has been identified. The new aptamers of the present disclosure retain potent \nin vitro\n binding and anti-proliferative activity, and contain naturally occurring 2'deoxy or 2'OMe substituted nucleotides. These new aptamers of the present disclosure also retain substantial serum stability as determined through resistance to nuclease degradation in an \nin vitro\n stability assay, with no degradation detected for up to 48 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer therapeutics of the present disclosure have great affinity and specificity to PDGF, PDGF isoforms, and/or PDGF receptor while reducing the deleterious side effects from non-naturally occurring nucleotide substitutions when the aptamer therapeutics break down in the body of patients or subjects. The therapeutic compositions containing the aptamer therapeutics of the present disclosure are free of or have a reduced amount of fluorinated nucleotides.\n\n\n \n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS TO INCREASE THE EFFICACY OF ANTI-TUMOR AGENTS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe materials and methods of the present disclosure further comprise methods to increase the efficacy of antitumor agents by dual therapy with the aptamers of the present disclosure, such as \nARC\n 127 and ARC308. In addition, the experiments described herein have demonstrated that PDGF-B specific aptamers, ARC 127 (\ni.e.,\n ARC126+40K PEG) and ARC308 (\ni.e\n., ARC 126+30K PEG) are active anti-tumor agents when co-administered with irinotecan to nude mice bearing the colorectal LS174t tumor xenograft. The cancer therapeutic compounds of the present disclosure (\ne.g\n., both \nARC\n 127 and ARC308) are safe non-cytotoxic agents when administered alone, but in combination with other cytotoxic agents, and that ARC127 and ARC308 potentiate their anti-tumor effects through a novel mechanism of action. Furthermore, the serum-derived \nARC\n 127 aptamer, when administered to mice parenterally, \ni.e\n., intravenously, subcutaneously, or by intraperitoneal injection, retains full biological activity.\n\n\n \n\n\nAPTAMER-CHIMERA SPECIFIC FOR PDGF-B AND VEGF\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe disclosure further provides a bi-functional aptamer-chimera that targets both PDGF-B and VEGF. The PDGF-B-VEGF aptamer chimera TK.131.12.A (SEQ ID NO:9) and TK.131.12.B (SEQ ID NO:10) of the present disclosure allow for the simultaneous targeting of PDGF-B and VEGF, \ne.g\n., for the treatment of cancer. The PDGF-B aptamer used in the chimeric molecule is derived from the ARC127 aptamer sequence. The VEGF aptamer that was used in the chimeric molecule is derived from the ARC245 (SEQ ID NO:7) aptamer sequence. The aptamer-chimera of the present disclosure can be constructed from any set of PDGF-B and VEGF binding aptamers. The PDGF-B-VEGF chimera of the present disclosure is useful in the treatment of VEGF-dependent solid tumors that also show a high degree of neovascularization as well as pericyte recruitment to support the nascent vasculature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent anti-tumor data from the RipTag pancreatic mouse tumor model suggests that there is a greater inhibition in tumor growth conferred when anti-VEGF and anti-PDGFR therapy are undertaken simultaneously, than when either the anti-VEGF agent or the anti-PDGFR agent is added alone (\nBergers et al., (2003), J. Clin. Invest., 111:9, p. 1287-1295\n). Since anti-PDGFR therapy blocks all receptor-mediated signaling events, the effects of this therapy can be expected to be non-specific and therefore suffer from side effects associated with non-specific treatments. In contrast, the PDGF-B-VEGF chimera in this disclosure provide for precise PDGF-B and VEGF targeting in tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer therapeutics of the present disclosure have great affinity and specificity to VEGF and/or VEGF receptor, while reducing the deleterious side effects from non-naturally occurring nucleotide substitutions which may result when the aptamer therapeutics break down in the body of a patient or subject. The therapeutic compositions of the aptamer therapeutics of the present disclosure are free of or have a reduced amount of fluorinated nucleotides.\n\n\n \n\n\nAPTAMERS HAVING IMMUNOSTIMULATORY MOTIFS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nRecognition of bacterial DNA by the vertebrate immune system is based on the recognition of unmethylated CG dinucleotides in particular sequence contexts (\"CpG motifs\"). One receptor that recognizes such a motif is Toll-like receptor 9 (\"TLR 9\"), a member of a family of Toll-like receptors (~10 members) that participate in the innate immune response by recognizing distinct microbial components. TLR 9 binds unmethylated oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) CpG sequences in a sequence-specific manner. The recognition of CpG motifs triggers defense mechanisms leading to innate and ultimately acquired immune responses. For example, activation of TLR 9 in mice induces activation of antigen presenting cells, up regulation of MHC class I and II molecules and expression of important costimulatory molecules and cytokines including IL-12 and IL-23. This activation both directly and indirectly enhances B and T cell responses, including robust up regulation of the TH1 cytokine IFN-gamma. Collectively, the response to CpG sequences leads to: protection against infectious diseases, improved immune response to vaccines, an effective response against asthma, and improved antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Thus, CpG ODN's can provide protection against infectious diseases, function as immuno-adjuvants or cancer therapeutics (monotherapy or in combination with mAb or other therapies), and can decrease asthma and allergic response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAptamers comprising one or more CpG motifs can be identified or generated by a variety of strategies using, \ne.g\n., the SELEXâ¢ process described herein. In general the strategies can be divided into two groups. In the first group, the strategies are directed to identifying or generating aptamers comprising both a binding site for targets other than those recognizing CpG motifs and a CpG motif. These strategies are as follows: (a) performing SELEXâ¢ to obtain an aptamer to a specific target (other than a target known to bind to CpG motifs and upon binding stimulate an immune response), preferably a target where a repressed immune response is relevant to disease development, using an oligonucleotide pool wherein a CpG motif has been incorporated into each member of the pool as, or as part of, a fixed region, \ne.g\n., in the randomized region of the pool members; (b) performing SELEX to obtain an aptamer to a specific target (other than a target known to bind to CpG motifs and upon binding stimulate an immune response), preferably a target where a repressed immune response is relevant to disease development, and then appending a CpG motif to the 5' and/or 3' end or engineering a CpG motif into a region, preferably a non-essential region, of the aptamer; (c) performing SELEXâ¢ to obtain an aptamer to a specific target (other than a target known to bind to CpG motifs and upon binding stimulate an immune response), preferably a target where a repressed immune response is relevant to disease development, wherein during synthesis of the pool the molar ratio of the various nucleotides is biased in one or more nucleotide addition steps so that the randomized region of each member of the pool is enriched in CpG motifs; and (d) performing SELEXâ¢ to obtain an aptamer to a specific target (other than a target known to bind to CpG motifs and upon binding stimulate an immune response), preferably a target where a repressed immune response is relevant to disease development, and identifying those aptamers comprising a CpG motif.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the second group, the strategies are directed to identifying or generating aptamers comprising a CpG motif and/or other sequences that are bound by the receptors for the CpG motifs (\ne.g\n., TLR9 or the other toll-like receptors) and upon binding stimulate an immune response. These strategies are as follows: (i) performing SELEXâ¢ to obtain an aptamer to a target known to bind to CpG motifs and upon binding stimulate an immune response using an oligonucleotide pool wherein a CpG motif has been incorporated into each member of the pool as, or as part of, a fixed region, \ne.g\n., in the randomized region of the pool members; (ii) performing SELEX to obtain an aptamer to a target known to bind to CpG motifs and upon binding stimulate an immune response and then appending a CpG motif to the 5' and/or 3' end or engineering a CpG motif into a region, preferably a non-essential region, of the aptamer; (iii) performing SELEX to obtain an aptamer to a target known to bind to CpG motifs and upon binding stimulate an immune response wherein during synthesis of the pool, the molar ratio of the various nucleotides is biased in one or more nucleotide addition steps so that the randomized region of each member of the pool is enriched in CpG motifs ; (iv) performing SELEX to obtain an aptamer to a target known to bind to CpG motifs and upon binding stimulate an immune response and identifying those aptamers comprising a CpG motif; and (v) performing SELEX to obtain an aptamer to a target known to bind to CpG motifs and identifying those aptamers which, upon binding, stimulate an immune response not comprising a CpG motif.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of different classes of CpG motifs have been identified, each resulting upon recognition in a different cascade of events, release of cytokines and other molecules, and activation of certain cell types. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nCpG Motifs in Bacterial DNA and Their Immune Effects, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002, 20:709-760\n . Additional immunostimulatory motifs are disclosed in the following \n \nU.S. Patents: 6,207,646\n \n; \n \n6,239,116\n \n; \n \n6,429,199\n \n; \n \n6,214,806\n \n; \n \n6,653,292\n \n; \n \n6,426,434\n \n; \n \n6,514,948\n \n and \n \n6,498,148\n \n. Any of these CpG or other immunostimulatory motifs can be incorporated into an aptamer. The choice of aptamers is dependent on the disease or disorder to be treated. Preferred immunostimulatory motifs are as follows (shown the 5' to 3' left to right) wherein \"r\" designates a purine, \"y\" designates a pyrimidine, and \"X\" designates any nucleotide:\n\n \n \n \nAACGTTCGAG (SEQ ID NO: 85); AACGTT (SEQ ID NO:90); ACGT (SEQ ID NO:92), rCGy (SEQ ID NO:96); rrCGyy (SEQ ID NO:98), XCGX (SEQ ID NO:99),\n \nXXCGXX (SEQ ID NO:100), and X\n1\nX\n2\nCGY\n1\nY\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:101) wherein X\n1\n is G or A, X\n2\n is not C, Y\n1\n is not G and Y\n2\n is preferably T.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn those instances where a CpG motif is incorporated into an aptamer that binds to a specific target other than a target known to bind to CpG motifs and upon binding stimulate an immune response (a \"non-CpG target\"), the CpG is preferably located in a non-essential region of the aptamer. Non-essential regions of aptamers can be identified by site-directed mutagenesis, deletion analyses and/or substitution analyses. However, any location that does not significantly interfere with the ability of the aptamer to bind to the non-CpG target may be used. In addition to being embedded within the aptamer sequence, the CpG motif may be appended to either or both of the 5' and 3' ends or otherwise attached to the aptamer. Any location or means of attachment may be used so long as the ability of the aptamer to bind to the non-CpG target is not significantly interfered with.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"stimulation of an immune response\" can mean either (1) the induction of a specifc response (\ne.g\n., induction of a Th1 response) or of the production of certain molecules or (2) the inhibition or suppression of a specific response (\ne.g\n., inhibition or suppression of the Th2 response) or of certain molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCpG motifs can be incorporated or appended to an aptamer against any target including, but not limited to: PDGF, IgE, IgE FcÎµ RI, TNFa, PSMA, CTLA4, PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, FcRIIB, BTLA, TIM-3, CD11b, CD-11c, BAFF, B7-X, CD19, CD20, CD25 and/or CD33.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy incorporating CpG motifs into aptamers specifically targeting solid tumors these aptamers can be used to activate the immune system through the recruitment of antigen presenting cells that have taken up tumor derived material, enhance their maturation and migration to local lymph nodes and increase priming of tumor specific T-cells. This is especially relevant where aptamers deliver cytotoxic payload and result in cell death (such as a PSMA aptamer containing a CpG motif). Such CpG motif containing aptamers can also induce tumor-specific memory response (\ne.g\n., a prophylactic use). In addition, the IFP lowering and pericyte recruitment blocking effects of a PDGF-B aptamer combined with the increased immune response observed upon CpG administration represents a potent therapeutic for cancer. Thus, aptamers with incorporated, appended or embedded CpG motifs represent a novel class of anti-cancer compounds. When administered these compounds can lead to a significant de-bulking of the tumor through two mechanisms: first, through activation of tumor specific T-cells within the tumor bed and second, through the intended mechanism-based action of the aptamer pharmacophore.\n\n\n \n\n\nPHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe disclosure also includes pharmaceutical compositions containing aptamer molecules. In some embodiments, the compositions are suitable for internal use and include an effective amount of a pharmacologically active compound of the disclosure, alone or in combination, with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The compounds are especially useful in that they have very low, if any toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the disclosure can be used to treat or prevent a pathology, such as a disease or disorder, or alleviate the symptoms of such disease or disorder in a patient. Compositions of the disclosure are useful for administration to a subject suffering from, or predisposed to, a disease or disorder which is related to or derived from a target to which the aptamers of the disclosure specifically bind. For example, the target is a protein involved with a pathology, for example, the target protein causes the pathology. For example, the target is PDGF involvement in the development and progression of solid tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the disclosure can be used in a method for treating a patient or subject having a pathology. The method involves administering to the patient or subject a composition comprising aptamers that bind a target (\ne.g\n., a protein) involved with the pathology, so that binding of the composition to the target alters the biological function of the target, thereby treating the pathology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe patient or subject having a pathology, \ne.g\n. the patient or subject treated by the methods of this disclosure can be a mammal, or more particularly, a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn practice, the aptamers or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are administered in amounts which will be sufficient to exert their desired biological activity, e.g., inhibiting the binding of a cytokine to its receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the disclosure comprises an aptamer composition of the disclosure in combination with other treatments for cancer or cancer related disorders. The aptamer composition of the disclosure may contain, for example, more than one aptamer. In some examples, an aptamer composition of the disclosure, containing one or more compounds of the disclosure, is administered in combination with another useful composition such as an anti-intlammatory agent, an immunosuppressant, an antiviral agent, or the like. Furthermore, the compounds of the disclosure may be administered in combination with a cytotoxic, cytostatic, or chemotherapeutic agent such as an alkylating agent, antimetabolite, mitotic inhibitor or cytotoxic antibiotic, as described above. In general, the currently available dosage forms of the known therapeutic agents for use in such combinations will be suitable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Combination therapy\" (or \"co-therapy\") includes the administration of an aptamer composition of the disclosure and at least a second agent as part of a specific treatment regimen intended to provide the beneficial effect from the co-action of these therapeutic agents. The beneficial effect of the combination includes, but is not limited to, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic co-action resulting from the combination of therapeutic agents. Administration of these therapeutic agents in combination typically is carried out over a defined time period (usually minutes, hours, days or weeks depending upon the combination selected).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Combination therapy\" may, but generally is not, intended to encompass the administration of two or more of these therapeutic agents as part of separate monotherapy regimens that incidentally and arbitrarily result in the combinations of the present disclosure. \"Combination therapy\" is intended to embrace administration of these therapeutic agents in a sequential manner, that is, wherein each therapeutic agent is administered at a different time, as well as administration of these therapeutic agents, or at least two of the therapeutic agents, in a substantially simultaneous manner. Substantially simultaneous administration can be accomplished, for example, by administering to the subject a single capsule having a fixed ratio of each therapeutic agent or in multiple, single capsules tor each of the therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequential or substantially simultaneous administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any appropriate route including, but not limited to, topical routes, oral routes, intravenous routes, intramuscular routes, and direct absorption through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same route or by different routes. For example, a first therapeutic agent of the combination selected may be administered by injection while the other therapeutic agents of the combination may be administered topically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, for example, all therapeutic agents may be administered topically or all therapeutic agents may be administered by injection. The sequence in which the therapeutic agents are administered is not narrowly critical. \"Combination therapy\" also can embrace the administration of the therapeutic agents as described above in further combination with other biologically active ingredients. Where the combination therapy further comprises a non-drug treatment, the non-drug treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and non-drug treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the non-drug treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by days or even weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the disclosure and the other pharmacologically active agent may be administered to a patient simultaneously, sequentially or in combination. It will be appreciated that when using a combination of the disclosure, the compound of the disclosure and the other pharmacologically active agent may be in the same pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and therefore administered simultaneously. They may be in separate pharmaceutical carriers such as conventional oral dosage forms which are taken simultaneously. The term \"combination\" further refers to the case where the compounds are provided in separate dosage forms and are administered sequentially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic or pharmacological compositions of the present disclosure will generally comprise an effective amount of the active component(s) of the therapy, dissolved or dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable medium. Pharmaceutically acceptable media or carriers include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the therapeutic compositions of the present disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of pharmaceutical or pharmacological compositions will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. Typically, such compositions may be prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions; solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid prior to injection; as tablets or other solids for oral administration; as time release capsules; or in any other form currently used, including eye drops, creams, lotions, salves, inhalants and the like. The use of sterile formulations, such as saline-based washes, by surgeons, physicians or health care workers to treat a particular area in the operating field may also be particularly useful. Compositions may also be delivered via microdevice, microparticle or sponge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon formulation, therapeutics will be administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and in such amount as is pharmacologically effective. The formulations are easily administered in a variety of dosage forms. In a preferred embodiment the aptamer of the disclosure is formulated as an injectable solution described above, but drug release capsules and the like can also be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this context, the quantity of active ingredient and volume of composition to be administered depends on the host animal to be treated. Precise amounts of active compound required for administration depend on the judgment of the practitioner and are peculiar to each individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA minimal volume of a composition required to disperse the active compounds is typically utilized. Suitable regimes for administration are also variable, but would be typified by initially administering the compound and monitoring the results and then giving further controlled doses at further intervals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule (\ne.g\n., a gelatin capsule), the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, magnesium aluminum silicate, starch paste, gelatin, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, silica, talcum, stearic acid, its magnesium or calcium salt and/or polyethyleneglycol and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum starches, agar, alginic acid or its sodium salt, or effervescent mixtures, and the like. Diluents, include, \ne.g\n., lactose, dextrose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, cellulose and/or glycine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjectable compositions are preferably aqueous isotonic solutions or suspensions, and suppositories are advantageously prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions. The compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances. The compositions are prepared according to conventional mixing, granulating or coating methods, respectively, and contain about 0.1 to 75%, preferably about 1 to 50%, of the active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the disclosure can also be administered in such oral dosage forms as timed release and sustained release tablets or capsules, pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups and emulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid, particularly injectable compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc. The active compound is dissolved in or mixed with a pharmaceutically pure solvent such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form the injectable solution or suspension. Additionally, solid forms suitable for dissolving in liquid prior to injection can be formulated. Injectable compositions are preferably aqueous isotonic solutions or suspensions. The compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present disclosure can be administered in intravenous (both bolus and infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intramuscular form, all using forms well known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral injectable administration is generally used for subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injections and infusions. Additionally, one approach for parenteral administration employs the implantation of a slow-release or sustained-released systems, which assures that a constant level of dosage is maintained, according to \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 3,710,795\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, preferred compounds for the present disclosure can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. Other preferred topical preparations include creams, ointments, lotions, aerosol sprays and gels, wherein the concentration of active ingredient would range from 0.01% to 15%, w/w or w/v.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor solid compositions, excipients include pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like may be used. The active compound defined above, may be also formulated as suppositories using for example, polyalkylene glycols, for example, propylene glycol, as the carrier. In some embodiments, suppositories are advantageously prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present disclosure can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, containing cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines. In some embodiments, a film of lipid components is hydrated with an aqueous solution of drug to a form lipid layer encapsulating the drug, as described in \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,262,564\n \n. For example, the aptamer molecules described herein can be provided as a complex with a lipophilic compound or non-immunogenic, high molecular weight compound constructed using methods known in the art. An example of nuclcic-acid associated complexes is provided in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,011,020\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present disclosure may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropyl-methacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethylaspanamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds of the present disclosure may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, and other substances such as for example, sodium acetate, and triethanolamine oleate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage regimen utilizing the aptamers is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular aptamer or salt thereof employed. An ordinarily skilled physician or veterinarian can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOral dosages of the present disclosure, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.05 to 7500 mg/day orally. The compositions are preferably provided in the form of scored tablets containing 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100.0, 250.0, 500.0 and 1000.0 mg of active ingredient. Infused dosages, intranasal dosages and transdermal dosages will range between 0.05 to 7500 mg/day. Subcutaneous, intravenous and intraperitoneal dosages will range between 0.05 to 3800 mg/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present disclosure may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffective plasma levels of the compounds of the present disclosure range from 0.002 mg/mL to 50 mg/mL. In the dosages of the present disclosure, mass refers only to the molecular weight of the oligonucleotide portion of the aptamer, irrespective of the mass conferred by PEG conjugation.\n\n\n \n\n\nMODULATION OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND BIODISTRIBUTION OF APTAMER THERAPEUTICS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is important that the pharmacokinetic properties for all oligonucleotide-based therapeutics, including aptamers, be tailored to match the desired pharmaceutical application. While aptamers directed against extracellular targets do not suffer from difficulties associated with intracellular delivery (as is the case with antisense and RNAi-based therapeutics), such aptamers must still be able to be distributed to target organs and tissues, and remain in the body (unmodified) for a period of time consistent with the desired dosing regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present disclosure provides materials and methods to affect the pharmacokinetics of aptamer compositions, and, in particular, the ability to tune aptamer pharmacokinetics. The tunability of (\ni.e\n., the ability to modulate) aptamer pharmacokinetics is achieved through conjugation of modifying moieties (\ne.g\n., PEG polymers) to the aptamer and/or the incorporation of modified nucleotides (\ne.g\n., 2'-fluoro or 2'-O-methyl) to alter the chemical composition of the nucleic acid. The ability to tune aptamer pharmacokinetics is used in the improvement of existing therapeutic applications, or alternatively, in the development of new therapeutic applications. For example, in some therapeutic applications, \ne.g\n., in anti-neoplastic or acute care settings where rapid drug clearance or turn-off may be desired, it is desirable to decrease the residence times of aptamers in the circulation. Alternatively, in other therapeutic applications, \ne.g\n., maintenance therapies where systemic circulation of a therapeutic is desired, it may be desirable to increase the residence times of aptamers in circulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the tunability of aptamer pharmacokinetics is used to modify the biodistribution of an aptamer therapeutic in a subject. For example, in some therapeutic applications, it may be desirable to alter the biodistribution of an aptamer therapeutic in an effort to target a particular type of tissue or a specific organ (or set of organs). In these applications, the aptamer therapeutic preferentially accumulates in a specific tissue or organ(s). In other therapeutic applications, it may be desirable to target tissues displaying a cellular marker or a symptom associated with a given disease, cellular injury or other abnormal pathology, such that the aptamer therapeutic preferentially accumulates in the affected tissue. For example, as described in provisional application United States Serial No. \n \n60/550790, filed on March 5, 2004\n \n, and entitled \"Controlled Modulation of the Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution of Aptamer Therapeutics), PEGylation of an aptamer therapeutic (\ne.g\n., PEGylation with a 20 kDa PEG polymer) is used to target inflamed tissues, such that the PEGylated aptamer therapeutic preferentially accumulates in inflamed tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution profiles of aptamer therapeutics (\ne.g\n., aptamer conjugates or aptamers having altered chemistries, such as modified nucleotides) a variety of parameters are Such parameters include, for example, the half-life (t\n1/2\n), the plasma clearance (CL), the volume of distribution (Vss), the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum observed serum or plasma concentration (C\nmax\n), and the mean residence time (MRT) of an aptamer composition. As used herein, the term \"AUC\" refers to the area under the plot of the plasma concentration of an aptamer therapeutic versus the time after aptamer administration. The AUC value is used to estimate the bioavailability (\ni.e\n., the percentage of administered aptamer therapeutic in the circulation after aptamer administration) and/or total clearance (CL) (\ni.e.,\n the rate at which the aptamer therapeutic is removed from circulation) of a given aptamer therapeutic. The volume of distribution relates the plasma concentration of an aptamer therapeutic to the amount of aptamer present in the body. The larger the Vss, the more an aptamer is found outside of the plasma (\ni.e\n., the more extravasation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure provides materials and methods to modulate, in a controlled manner, the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of stabilized aptamer compositions \nin vivo\n by conjugating an aptamer to a modulating moiety such as a small molecule, peptide, or polymer terminal group, or by incorporating modified nucleotides into an aptamer. As described herein, conjugation of a modifying moiety and/or altering nucleotide(s) chemical composition alter fundamental aspects of aptamer residence time in circulation and distribution to tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to clearance by nucleases, oligonucleotide therapeutics are subject to elimination via renal filtration. As such, a nuclease-resistant oligonucleotide administered intravenously typically exhibits an \nin vivo\n half-life of <10 min, unless filtration can be blocked. This can be accomplished by either facilitating rapid distribution out of the blood stream into tissues or by increasing the apparent molecular weight of the oligonucleotide above the effective size cut-off for the glomerulus. Conjugation of small therapeutics to a PEG polymer (PEGylation), described below, can dramatically lengthen residence times of aptamers in circulation, thereby decreasing dosing frequency and enhancing effectiveness against vascular targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAptamers can be conjugated to a variety of modifying moieties, such as high molecular weight polymers, \ne.g\n., PEG; peptides, \ne.g\n., Tat (a 13-amino acid fragment of the HIV Tat protein (\nVives, et al., (1997), J. Biol. Chem. 272(25): 16010-7\n)), Ant (a 16-amino acid sequence derived from the third helix of the Drosophila antennapedia homeotic protein (\nPietersz, et al., (2001), Vaccine 19(11-12): 1397-405\n)) and Arg\n7\n (a short, positively charged cell-permeating peptides composed of polyarginine (Arg\n7\n) (\nRothbard, et al., (2000), Nat. Med. 6(11): 1253-7\n; \nRothbard, J et al., (2002), J. Med. Chem. 45(17): 3612-8\n)); and small molecules, \ne.g\n., lipophilic compounds such as cholesterol. Among the various conjugates described herein, \nin vivo\n properties of aptamers are altered most profoundly by complexation with PEG groups. For example, complexation of a mixed 2'F and 2'-OMe modified aptamer therapeutic with a 20 kDa PEG polymer hinders renal filtration and promotes aptamer distribution to both healthy and inflamed tissues. Furthermore, the 20 kDa PEG polymer-aptamer conjugate proves nearly as effective as a 40 kDa PEG polymer in preventing renal filtration of aptamers. While one effect of PEGylation is on aptamer clearance, the prolonged systemic exposure afforded by presence of the 20 kDa moiety also facilitates distribution of aptamer to tissues, particularly those of highly perfused organs and those at the site of inflammation. The aptamer-20 kDa PEG polymer conjugate directs aptamer distribution to the site of inflammation, such that the PEGylated aptamer preferentially accumulates in inflamed tissue. In some instances, the 20 kDa PEGylated aptamer conjugate is able to access the interior of cells, such as, for example, kidney cells. Modified nucleotides can also be used to modulate the plasma clearance of aptamers. For example, an unconjugated aptamer which incorporates both 2'-F and 2'-OMe stabilizing chemistries, which is typical of current generation aptamers as it exhibits a high degree of nuclease stability \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n, displays rapid loss from plasma (\ni.e\n., rapid plasma clearance) and a rapid distribution into tissues, primarily into the kidney, when compared to unmodified aptamer.\n\n\n \n\n\nPEG-DERIVATIZED NUCLEIC ACIDS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described above, derivatization of nucleic acids with high molecular weight non-immunogenic polymers has the potential to alter the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of nucleic acids making them more effective therapeutic agents. Favorable changes in activity can include increased resistance to degradation by nucleases, decreased filtration through the kidneys, decreased exposure to the immune system, and altered distribution of the therapeutic through the body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer compositions of the disclosure may be derivatized with polyalkylene glycol (PAG) moieties. Examples of PAG-derivatized nucleic acids are found in United States Patent Application Ser. No. \n \n10/718,833, filed on November 21, 2003\n \n. Typical polymers used in the disclosure include poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), also known as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and polypropylene glycol (including poly isopropylene glycol). Additionally, random or block copolymers of different alkylene oxides (\ne.g\n., ethylene oxide and propylene oxide) can be used in many applications. In its most common form, a polyalkylene glycol, such as PEG, is a linear polymer terminated at each end with hydroxyl groups: HO-CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO-(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-OH. This polymer, alpha-, omega-dihydroxylpoly (ethylene glycol), can also be represented as HO-PEG-OH, where it is understood that the-PEG- symbol represents the following structural unit: - CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO-(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n-CH\n2\nCH\n2-\n where n typically ranges from about 4 to about 10,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown, the PEG molecule is di-functional and is sometimes referred to as \"PEG diol.\" The terminal portions of the PEG molecule are relatively non-reactive hydroxyl moieties, the -OH groups, that can be activated, or converted to functional moieties, for attachment of the PEG to other compounds at reactive sites on the compound. Such activated PEG diols are referred to herein as bi-activated PEGs. For example, the terminal moieties of PEG diol have been functionalized as active carbonate ester for selective reaction with amino moieties by substitution of the relatively nonreactive hydroxyl moieties, -OH, with succinimidyl active ester moieties from N-hydroxy succinimide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn many applications, it is desirable to cap the PEG molecule on one end with an essentially non-reactive moiety so that the PEG molecule is mono-functional (or mono-activated). In the case of protein therapeutics which generally display multiple reaction sites for activated PEGs, bi-functional activated PEGs lead to extensive cross-linking, yielding poorly functional aggregates. To generate mono-activated PEGs, one hydroxyl moiety on the terminus of the PEG diol molecule typically is substituted with non-reactive methoxy end moiety, -OCH\n3\n. The other, un-capped terminus of the PEG molecule typically is converted to a reactive end moiety that can be activated for attachment at a reactive site on a surface or a molecule such as a protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPAGs are polymers which typically have the properties of solubility in water and in many organic solvents, lack of toxicity, and lack of immunogenicity. One use of PAGs is to covalently attach the polymer to insoluble molecules to make the resulting PAG-molecule \"conjugate\" soluble. For example, it has been shown that the water-insoluble drug paclitaxel, when coupled to PEG, becomes water-soluble. \nGreenwald, et al., J. Org. Chem., 60:331-336 (1995\n). PAG conjugates are often used not only to enhance solubility and stability but also to prolong the blood circulation half-life of molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolyalkylated compounds of the disclosure are typically between 5 and 80 kDa in size however any size can be used, the choice dependent on the aptamer and application. Other PAG compounds of the disclosure are between 10 and 80 kDa in size. Still other PAG compounds of the disclosure are between 10 and 60 kDa in size. For example, a PAG polymer may be at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 80 kDa in size. Such polymers can be linear or branched. In some embodiments the polymers are PEG. In some embodiment the polymers are branched PEG. In still other embodiments the polymers are 40kDa branched PEG as depicted in \nFigure 5\n. In some embodiments the 40 kDa branched PEG is attached to the 5' end of the aptamer as depicted in \nFigure 6\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast to biologically-expressed protein therapeutics, nucleic acid therapeutics are typically chemically synthesized from activated monomer nucleotides. PEG-nucleic acid conjugates may be prepared by incorporating the PEG using the same iterative monomer synthesis. For example, PEGs activated by conversion to a phosphoramidite form can be incorporated into solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis. Alternatively, oligonucleotide synthesis can be completed with site-specific incorporation of a reactive PEG attachment site. Most commonly this has been accomplished by addition of a free primary amine at the 5'-terminus (incorporated using a modifier phosphoramidite in the last coupling step of solid phase synthesis). Using this approach, a reactive PEG (\ne.g\n., one which is activated so that it will react and form a bond with an amine) is combined with the purified oligonucleotide and the coupling reaction is carried out in solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of PEG conjugation to alter the biodistribution of a therapeutic is related to a number of factors including the apparent size (\ne.g\n., as measured in terms of hydrodynamic radius) of the conjugate. Larger conjugates (>10kDa) are known to more effectively block filtration via the kidney and to consequently increase the serum half-life of small macromolecules (\ne.g\n., peptides, antisense oligonucleotides). The ability of PEG conjugates to block filtration has been shown to increase with PEG size up to approximately 50 kDa (further increases have minimal beneficial effect as half life becomes defined by macrophagc-mediated metabolism rather than elimination via the kidneys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProduction of high molecular weight PEGs (>10 kDa) can be difficult, inefficient, and expensive. As a route towards the synthesis of high molecular weight PEG-nucleic acid conjugates, previous work has been focused towards the generation of higher molecular weight activated PEGs. One method for generating such molecules involves the formation of a branched activated PEG in which two or more PEGs are attached to a central core carrying the activated group. The terminal portions of these higher molecular weight PEG molecules, \ni.e\n., the relatively non-reactive hydroxyl (-OH) moieties, can be activated, or converted to functional moieties, for attachment of one or more of the PEGs to other compounds at reactive sites on the compound. Branched activated PEGs will have more than two termini, and in cases where two or more termini have been activated, such activated higher molecular weight PEG molecules are referred to herein as, multi-activated PEGs. In some cases, not all termini in a branch PEG molecule are activated. In cases where any two termini of a branch PEG molecule are activated, such PEG molecules are referred to as bi-activated PEGs. In some cases where only one terminus in a branch PEG molecule is activated, such PEG molecules are referred to as mono-activated. As an example of this approach, activated PEG prepared by the attachment of two monomethoxy PEGs to a lysine core which is subsequently activated for reaction has been described (\nHarris et al., Nature, vol.2: 214-221, 2003\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure provides another cost effective route to the synthesis of high molecular weight PEG-nucleic acid (preferably, aptamer) conjugates including multiply PEGylated nucleic acids. The present disclosure also encompasses PEG-linked multimeric oligonucleotides, \ne.g\n., dimerized aptamers. The present disclosure also relates to high molecular weight compositions where a PEG stabilizing moiety is a linker which separates different portions of an aptamer, \ne.g\n., the PEG is conjugated within a single aptamer sequence, such that the linear arrangement of the high molecular weight aptamer composition is, \ne.g\n., nucleic acid nucleic acid - PEG - nucleic acid (- PEG - nucleic acid)\nn\n where n is greater than or equal to 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh molecular weight compositions of the disclosure include those having a molecular weight of at least 10 kDa. Compositions typically have a molecular weight between 10 and 80 kDa in size. High molecular weight compositions of the disclosure are at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 80 kDa in size.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA stabilizing moiety is a molecule, or portion of a molecule, which improves pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the high molecular weight aptamer compositions of the disclosure. In some cases, a stabilizing moiety is a molecule or portion of a molecule which brings two or more aptamers, or aptamer domains, into proximity, or provides decreased overall rotational freedom of the high molecular weight aptamer compositions of the disclosure. A stabilizing moiety can be a polyalkylene glycol, such a polyethylene glycol, which can be linear or branched, a homopolymer or a heteropolymer. Other stabilizing moieties include polymers such as peptide nucleic acids (PNA). Oligonucleotides can also be stabilizing moieties; such oligonucleotides can include modified nucleotides, and/or modified linkages, such as phosphorothioates. A stabilizing moiety can be an integral part of an aptamer composition, \ni.e\n., it is covalently bonded to the aptamer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the disclosure include high molecular weight aptamer compositions in which two or more nucleic acid moieties are covalently conjugated to at least one polyalkylene glycol moiety. The polyalkylene glycol moieties serve as stabilizing moieties. In compositions where a polyalkylene glycol moiety is covalently bound at either end to an aptamer, such that the polyalkylene glycol joins the nucleic acid moieties together in one molecule, the polyalkylene glycol is said to be a linking moiety. In such compositions, the primary structure of the covalent molecule includes the linear arrangement nucleic acid-PAG-nucleic acid. One example is a composition having the primary structure nucleic acid-PEG-nucleic acid. Another example is a linear arrangement of: nucleic acid - PEG - nucleic acid - PEG - nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo produce the nucleic acid-PEG-nucleic acid conjugate, the nucleic acid is originally synthesized such that it bears a single reactive site (\ne.g\n., it is mono-activated). In a preferred embodiment, this reactive site is an amino group introduced at the 5'-terminus by addition of a modifier phosphoramidite as the last step in solid phase synthesis of the oligonucleotide. Following deprotection and purification of the modified oligonucleotide, it is reconstituted at high concentration in a solution that minimizes spontaneous hydrolysis of the activated PEG. In a preferred embodiment, the concentration of oligonucleotide is 1 mM and the reconstituted solution contains 200 mM NaHCO\n3\n-buffer, pH 8.3. Synthesis of the conjugate is initiated by slow, step-wise addition of highly purified bi-functional PEG. In a preferred embodiment, the PEG diol is activated at both ends (bi-activated) by derivatization with succinimidyl propionate. Following reaction, the PEG-nucleic acid conjugate is purified by gel electrophoresis or liquid chromatography to separate fully-, partially-, and un-conjugated species. Multiple PAG molecules concatenated (\ne.g\n., as random or block copolymers) or smaller PAG chains can be linked to achieve various lengths (or molecular weights). Non-PAG linkers can be used between PAG chains of varying lengths.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 2'-O-methyl, 2'-fluoro and other modified nucleotide modifications stabilize the aptamer against nucleases and increase its half life \nin vivo\n. The 3'-3'-dT cap also increases exonuclease resistance. \nSee, e.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Patents 5,674,685\n \n; \n \n5,668,264\n \n; \n \n6,207,816\n \n; and \n \n6,229,002\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\nPAG-DERIVATIZATION OF A REACTIVE NUCLEIC ACID\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHigh molecular weight PAG-nucleic acid-PAG conjugates can be prepared by reaction of a mono-functional activated PEG with a nucleic acid containing more than one reactive site. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid is bi-reactive, or bi-activated, and contains two reactive sites: a 5'-amino group and a 3'-amino group introduced into the oligonucleotide through conventional phosphoramidite synthesis, for example: 3'-5'-di-PEGylation as illustrated in \nFigure 7\n. In alternative embodiments, reactive sites can be introduce at internal positions, using for example, the 5-position of pyrimidines, the 8-position of purines, or the 2'-position of ribose as sites for attachment of primary amines. In such embodiments, the nucleic acid can have several activated or reactive sites and is said to be multiply activated. Following synthesis and purification, the modified oligonucleotide is combined with the mono-activated PEG under conditions that promote selective reaction with the oligonucleotide reactive sites while minimizing spontaneous hydrolysis. In the preferred embodiment, monomethoxy-PEG is activated with succinimidyl propionate and the coupled reaction is carried out at pH 8.3. To drive synthesis of the bi-substituted PEG, stoichiometric excess PEG is provided relative to the oligonucleotide. Following reaction, the PEG-nucleic acid conjugate is purified by gel electrophoresis or liquid chromatography to separate fully-, partially-, and un-conjugated species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linking domains can also have one or more polyalkylene glycol moieties attached thereto. Such PAGs can be of varying lengths and may be used in appropriate combinations to achieve the desired molecular weight of the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of a particular linker can be influenced by both its chemical composition and length. A linker that is too long, too short, or forms unfavorable steric and/or ionic interactions with the target will preclude the formation of complex between aptamer and target. A linker, which is longer than necessary to span the distance between nucleic acids, may reduce binding stability by diminishing the effective concentration of the ligand. Thus, it is often necessary to optimize linker compositions and lengths in order to maximize the affinity of an aptamer to a target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCitation of publications and patent documents is not intended as an admission that any is pertinent prior art, nor does it constitute any admission as to the contents or date of the same.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1: Large Scale Aptamer Synthesis and Conjugation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nARC 126 (5'-(SEQ ID NO:1)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:2)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:3)-3'-dT-3') is a 29 nucleotide aptamer (excluding an inverted T at the 3' end) specific for PDGF which contains a 3' inverted-dT cap for enhanced stability against nuclease attack. PEG moieties can be conjugated to ARC126 by using a 5'-amino terminus modifier for subsequent conjugation reactions. Syntheses were performed using standard solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry. The oligonucleotide was deprotected with ammonium hydroxide/methylamine (1:1) at room temperature for 12 hours and purified by ion exchange HPLC. ARC 128 (5'-(SEQ ID NO.4)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:5)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:6)-3'), an inactive variant which no longer binds PDGF, was synthesized using the same method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nARC126 was conjugated to several different PEG moieties: 20 kDa PEG (ARC240, (5'-[20K PEG]-(SEQ ID NO:1)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:2)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:3)-3'-dT-3')); 30 kDa PEG (ARC308, (3'-[30K PEG]-(SEQ ID NO:1)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:2)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:3)-3' -dT-3')); 40 kDa PEG (\nARC\n 127, (5'-[40K PEG]-(SEQ ID NO:1)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:2)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:3)-3'-dT-3')). ARC126 was dissolved to 2 mM in 100 mM sodium carbonate buffer, pH 8.5, and was reacted for 1 hour with a 2.5 molar excess of mPEG-SPA (\nMW\n 20 kDa) or mPEG\n2\n-NHS ester (\nMW\n 40 kDa) (Shearwater Corp., Huntsville, AL), and 3.5 molar excess (for 24 hours) of mPEG-nPNC (MW 30kDa) (NOF Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) in equal volumes of acetonitrile. The resulting products were then purified by ion exchange HPLC on a 50 ml Super Q 5PW column (Tosoh Bioscience, Montgomeryville, PA) using aqueous NaCl as eluent. The conjugated oligonucleotides were then desalted on a 100 ml Amberchrom CG300S (Tosoh) column using a water/acetonitrile gradient. Aptamer conjugates were lyophilized for storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to use ARC127 in animal models, the quality of the material synthesized was tested for endotoxin levels. Endotoxin content of synthesized ARC127 was determined using the LAL test (performer by Nelson Labs, AZ). Results for endotoxin testing are shown in Table 1 below. The detected quantities of endotoxin were below the ISO standard for sterile irrigation solutions (0.5 EU/mL), \ni.e\n. lower than levels allowed for IV administration. This indicated that ARC126 and ARC127 preparations were sterile and that it was possible to proceed to animal efficacy models.\n\n \nTable 1.

The aptamers were cleaved and deprotected by adding 250 ÂµL ammonium hydroxide/40 % aqueous methylamine (1:1) to column support and placed in a 65Â°C heating block for 30 minutes. Aptamers were dried down in a Speed Vac (Savant), then resuspended in 200ÂµL diH\n2\nO. HPLC purification was performed on a Transgenomic WAVE HPLC (Omaha, NE). The columns used for ion- exchange are the DNAPAC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) and Resource (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Buffer A: 25mM sodium phosphate/25% acetonitrile; Buffer B: 25mM sodium phosphate/400mM sodium perchlorate/25% acetonitrile, a gradient from 0-80% B was used. Purified fractions were then pooled and dried down in a Speed Vac and resuspended in 200 ÂµL diH\n2\nO.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 2: Stability Studies with Fluorinated Aptamers\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nARC126 and ARC127 freshly synthesized in house were compared to legacy ARC126 and ARC127 that were synthesized by Proligo (Boulder, CO), and had been stored lyophilized for 2 years at -20 Â°C. The freshly synthesized aptamers are referred to as \"ARC126 (Archemix)\" and \"ARC 127 (Archemix)\", while the legacy aptamers are referred to as \"ARC126 (Proligo)\" and \"ARC127 (Proligo)\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nARC127 synthesized in house and legacy ARC127 were passed over an ion-exchange HPLC column for analysis. \nFigure 8A\n is a trace of an ion-exchange HPLC analysis of freshly synthesized (bottom trace) and legacy ARC 127 (top trace) showing that after 2 years storage lyophilized at-20 Â°C, relatively no degradation of the legacy ARC127 was detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe legacy ARC126 and ARC127 aptamers stored at -20 Â°C for two years were also tested for potency, and compared to freshly synthesized ARC126 and ARC127 synthesized in house using the 3T3 cell proliferation assay (Example 3). \nFigure 8B\n shows cell-based assay results for potency demonstrating that even after lyophilization and storage at -20 degrees celsius for 2 years, the legacy aptamers were just as potent as ARC126 and ARC127 newly synthesized in house.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 3A: Composition and Sequence Optimization of ARC126 Variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe sequence and secondary structure of the anti-PDGF aptamer designated ARC126 is shown in \nFigure 9A\n. The sequence and secondary structure of derivatives of ARC 126 in which the nucleotides with 2'-fluoro-substituents have been replaced are shown in \nFigure 9B\n. The loops shown at the termini of the two internal stems are polyethylene glycol-6 (PEG-6) spacers and modified nucleotides are represented by dA = deoxy adenosine; dG = deoxy guanosine; mA = 2'-O-methyl adenosine; dT = deoxy thymidine; dC = deoxy cytosine; mG = 2'-O-methyl guanosine; mC = 2'-O-methyl cytosine; [3'T] = inverted deoxy thymidine; fC = 2'-fluoro cytosine; and fU = 2'-fluoro uridine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFigure 9A\n (left panel), the 29-nucleotide composition of ARC126 contains seven 2'-fluoro residues (three 2'-fluoro uridines and four 2'-fluoro cytosines). Due to considerations including genotoxicity of breakdown products, ARC 126 was optimized to modify the sequence composition by removing all or most of 2'-fluoro residues without compromising the potency or stability of the existing molecule. One avenue for removal of 2'-fluoro residues consisted of simple substitution of all seven 2'-fluoro residues with deoxy residues. Such an all-DNA variant of ARC126, designated ARC299 (SEQ ID NO: 42-PEG-SEQ ID NO: 43-PEG-SEQ ID NO: 44, wherein PEG = PEG-6 spacer), was synthesized and tested in \nin vitro\n biochemical binding and cell-based proliferation assays. These experiments showed that simple substitution of all 2'-fluoro residues for deoxy residues in the 29-mer composition of ARC126 induced instability in the central and upper stems, leading to significantly reduced activity/potency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second approach taken to effect removal of 2'-fluoro residues from ARC126 was the substitution, either singly or in blocks, of 2'-O-methyl residues for 2'-fluoro residues to ameliorate the relative base-pairing instability in the central and upper stems observed with the all-deoxy composition. A number of composition variants were synthesized, representing single point-substitutions of 2'-O-methyl or deoxy residues for 2'-fluoro residues (ARC277, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 39)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 40)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 41)-[3'T]-3'), as well as block substitutions of 2'-O-methyl residues for 2'-fluoro residues (ARC337, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 42)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 43)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 41)-[3'T]-3'; ARC338, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 52)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 43)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 44)-[3'T]-3'; ARC339, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 48)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 43)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 53)-[3'T]-3'; ARC340, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 50)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 43)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 54)-[3'T]-3'; combinations of single and block substitutions (ARC341, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 36)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 37)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 41)-[3'T]-3'; ARC342, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 55)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 37)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 41)-[3'T]-3'; ARC344, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 56)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 37)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 41)-[3'T]-3'; ARC345, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 36)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 57)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 41)-[3'T]-3'; (ARC346, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 36)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 58)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 41)-[3'T]-3'; ARC347, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 59)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 60)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 61)-[3'T]-3'; ARC362, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 36)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 37)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 62)-[3'T]-3'; ARC363, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 63)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 37)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 64)-[3'T]-3'; ARC364, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 50)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 43)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 65)-[3'T]-3'; ARC365, 5'-NH\n2\n-(SEQ ID NO: 39)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 40)-PEG-(SEQ I D NO: 41)-[3'T]-3'; ARC366, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 66)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 40)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 65)-[3'T]-3'; ARC404, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 55)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 40)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 41)-[3'T]-3'; ARC405, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 56)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 40)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 41)-[3'T]-3'; ARC406, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 39)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 57)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 41)-[3'T]-3'; ARC407, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 39)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 58)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 41)-[3'T]-3'; ARC408, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 39)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 40)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 62)-[3'T]-3'; ARC409, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 39)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 40)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 67)-[3'T]-3'; ARC410, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 39)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 40)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 68)-[3'T]-3'; ARC513 (5'-(SEQ ID NO: 69)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 40)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 70)-[3'T]-3'), ARC514 (5'-(SEQ ID NO:69)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 40)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 71)-[3'T]-3'), ARC515 (5'-(SEQ ID NO: 69)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 40)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 72)-[3'T]-3'), and ARC516 (5'-(SEQ ID NO: 69)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 40)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 73)-[3'T]-3'), and finally an all-2'-O-methyl composition (ARC300 (or 300B), 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 45)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 46)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 47)-[3'T]-3'). Other composition variants include: ARC276, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 36)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 37)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 38)-[3'T]-3'; ARC335, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 48)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 43)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 49)-[3'T]-3'; ARC336, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 50)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 43)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 51)-[3'T]-3'; ARC343, 5'-(SEQ ID NO: 52)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 43)-PEG-(SEQ ID NO: 41)-[3'T]-3'.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 2 below summarizes the sequence and composition of all ARC126 variants synthesized and tested. Sequences shown are listed 5'â 3' from left to right in the table. Table 2 also summarizes the composition identity, mean affinity, and activity of all ARC 126 variants synthesized and tested in \nin vitro\n assays (competitive binding assay and 3T3 proliferation assay) described below in Example 5. In the table, d= deoxy residue; f = 2'-fluoro residue; m = 2'-O-methyl residue; PEG = polyethylene glycol (PEG-6) spacer; 3T = inverted deoxythymidine.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing synthesis, these composition variants were tested in \nin vitro\n biochemical binding and cell-based proliferation assays described herein. These experiments showed a wide range of affinities in \nin vitro\n competition binding assays and a similarly wide range of activities in cell-based proliferation assays (results are described below). The composition variants that showed the highest levels of binding affinity and cell-based assay activity are exemplified by the series ARC513-516, shown in \nFigure 9B. Figure 9B\n shows the optimal composition variants of ARC 126: ARC513 (5'-(SEQ ID NO: 69)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 40)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 70)-[3'T]-3'), ARC514 (5'-(SEQ ID NO: 69)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 40)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 71)-[3'T]-3'), ARC515 (5'-(SEQ ID NO: 69)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 40)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 72)-[3'T]-3'), and ARC516 (5'-(SEQ ID NO: 69)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 40)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 73)-[3'T]-3'). From \nFigure 9B\n, all of the optimal composition variants are comprised of an extended stem, relative to ARC126, by two base pairs, and in the upper stems, a common set of point substitutions of 2'-O-methyl for 2'-fluoro residues as well as the pre-existing 2'-O-methyl residues from ARC126. The composition variants ARC513-516 differ only in two aspects: (1) the deoxy or 2'-fluoro identity of the three 3' terminal guanosine residues in the central stem; and (2) the deoxy or 2'-O-methyl identity of the cytosine residue at the top of the central stem on the 3' side.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nin vitro\n binding affinity of the optimal composition variants for PDGF is shown in \nFigure 10A\n. The data shown in the figure was derived from a competitive binding assay in which the indicated concentration of unlabeled, competitor aptamer was titrated in separate reactions against a fixed (<0.1 nM) amount of \n32\nP-radiolabeled ARC 126 aptamer in buffer containing a fixed amount (0.1 nM) of the aptamer's cognate target (PDGF-BB; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). ARC 126 was radiolabeled at the 5' terminus by incubation with Î³-\n32\nP-ATP (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) and polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs (\"NEB\"), Beverly, MA). Binding reactions were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) containing 0.2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (NEB) and 0.02 mg/mL tRNA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The reactions were equilibrated for a period of 15 - 30 minutes at room temperature, then filtered through a sandwich of nitrocellulose (Protran membrane, Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA) and nylon (Hybond membrane, Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) membranes to separate target bound aptamer from free aptamer. Subsequent auto-radiographic analysis of the filter membranes corresponding to each concentration of unlabeled aptamer revealed the extent of competitive displacement of \n32\nP-ARC126 by unlabeled aptamer. The data is shown in \nFigure 10A\n wherein ARC128 ((5'-(SEQ ID NO:4)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:5)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:6) -3')) represents a sequence-scrambled and therefore inactive variant of ARC126.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10B\n shows \nin vitro\n 3T3 cell-based proliferation assay data showing the activity of some composition variants of ARC126. 3T3 cells, a rat fibroblast cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA), were plated 3,000 cells/well in a 96 well plate one day prior to the start of the assay in 100ul DMEM/ 10%FCS. The following day, cells were washed once with straight DMEM and then 75ul DMEM/ 0.8% FCS was added to each well. Then 25ul of PDGF-BB (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml +/- ARC126 variants (6 points, final concentration 0-200 nM) were added to each well. Cells were incubated for 3 days. Following incubation 10ul MTT (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 1.5 hours. Media was then removed, 200ul Isopropanol (2-propanol) was added to each well, cells were re-suspended thoroughly and absorbance at 570nm was read on a 96 well plate reader. As shown in \nFigure 10B\n, it is clear that (1) all composition variants shown are active; and (2) the relative activity ranking of ARC513 (5'-(SEQ ID NO: 69)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 40)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 70)-[3'T]-3'), ARC514 (5'-(SEQ ID NO: 69)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 40)-PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 71)-[3'T]-3'), ARC515 (5'-(SEQ ID NO: 69)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 40)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 72)-[3'T]-3'), and ARC516 (5'-(SEQ ID NO: 69)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 40)- PEG -(SEQ ID NO: 73)-[3'T]-3') is similar.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 3B: ARC513 Modifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmU substitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nARC513 was further modifed to replace the 3' or 5' PEG spacers with 2'-OMe tri or 2'-OMe tetra loops, resulting in the following aptamers:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3T3 Proliferation Assay with Modified ARC513 Aptamers\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n3T3 cells, which are derived from a rat fibroblast cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA), were used in a proliferation assay to test potency of modified ARC513 aptamers. 3T3 fibroblast cells have PDGF receptors on their cell-surface and respond to mitogen, \ne.g\n., PDGF stimulation by proliferation. The assay was performed as follows: 3T3 cells were plated 3,000 cells/well in a 96 well plate one day prior to the start of the assay in 100ul DMEM/ 10%FCS. The following day, cells were washed once with straight DMEM and then 75ul DMEM/ 0.8% FCS was added to each well. Then 25ul of PDGF-BB (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) at a 50 ng/ml final concentration was added to each well +/- aptamer condition to be tested. Each plate included the following conditions in triplicate: no PDGF which corresponds to growth without mitogen (negative control), a scrambled aptamer control (ARC128) where no effect on growth rate is observed (negative control), a positive control where maximal growth is observed in the absence of PDGF aptamer, and a series of functional PDGF aptamer dilutions from which a good IC50 curve could be calculated. The functional PDGF aptamer dilutions usually consisted of 6 points in 2-fold serial dilutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells were incubated for 3 days.

This modulation of the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties of an aptamer composition can be accomplished (see \n \nU.S. Ser No. 10/718,833, filed November 21, 2003\n \n, and \n \nU.S. Ser. No. 60/550,790, filed March 5, 2004\n \n) via conjugation of the 3' or 5' terminus, or an internal site or sites, of the molecule with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain or chains, \ni.e\n., PEGylation (range is ~2 kDa to 100 kDa, with typical PEGs having molecular weights of 2 kDa, 10 kDa, 20 kDa, 30 kDa, 40 kDa, 50 kDa). Note that for each pharmokinetic study described herein, all mass based concentration data refers only to the molecular weight of the oligonucleotide portion of the aptamer, irrespective of the mass conferred by PEG conjugation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to establish the feasibility of using a given PEGylated aptamer sequence composition, it was necessary to confirm that the putative PEGylation does not significantly interfere with the activity of the aptamer in \nin vitro\n binding and cell-based proliferation assays. Competitive binding assays were performed and analyzed as described herein except that 3'-\n32\nP-labeled NH\n2\n-ARC126 was used rather than 5'-\n32\nP-ARC126 (the ARC 126 nucleotide sequence incorporates a reverse thymidine at the 3'-terminus, which is a substrate for the radiolabeling reaction catalyzed by polynucleotide kinase).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 11A\n is a plot of competition binding assay data for ARC 126 and two variants that are 5' conjugated to 30 kDa (ARC308) and 40 kDa (ARC127) PEG groups. \nFigure 11B\n shows \nin vitro\n 3T3 cell-based proliferation assay data for ARC126 as a function of 5' PEG group conjugation (ARC126+30 kDa = ARC308, and (ARC126+40 kDa PEG = ARC 127). The data shown in \nFigure 11B\n demonstrate the 5' conjugation of ARC126 to 30kDa and 40 kDa PEG groups appears to lead to a slight decrease in the \nin vitro\n activity of the aptamer, the effect of the presence of the PEG groups is less than two-fold relative to the unPEGylated aptamer, ARC126. The data shown in \nFigure 11B\n also demonstrate that the 5' conjugation of ARC126 to 30 kDa and 40 kDa PEG groups does not significantly reduce the \nin vitro\n activity in the 3T3 proliferation assay of the aptamer relative to the composition of ARC 126.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 12A\n shows the \nin vivo\n pharmacokinetic profile of ARC126 as a function of 5' PEG group conjugation. Studies were done in CD-1 mice as described in Example 10 (Charles River Labs, Wilmington, MA). From the figure, it is clear that the terminal clearance half-life, t\n1/2\n, is strongly affected by the size of the 5' PEG group conjugated to the aptamer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacokinetic (PK) data shown in \nFigure 12A\n was subjected to noncompartmental analysis (NCA) using the industry-standard software package WinNonLinâ¢ v.4.0 (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA). Table 4 below lists the primary NCA-derived \nin vivo\n pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for ARC126 + 20 kDa (ARC240), +30 kDa (ARC308), and +40 kDa (ARC127) PEG groups after intravenous (IV) administration at 10 mg/kg in mice. The data shown in Table 4 demonstrate that the \nin vivo\n pharmacokinetic clearance half-life, t\n1/2\n, of ARC 126 is modulated â¥ 4-fold by changing the size of the 5' PEG group conjugated to the aptamer affected by the size of the 5' PEG group conjugated to the aptamer from 20 kDa to 40 kDa. \nFigure 12B\n shows the \nin vivo\n pharmacokinetic profile of ARC 127 (ARC126 + 40 kDa PEG) after intravenous (IV), intraperitoneal (IP), and subcutaneous (SC) administration at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in mice. The pharmacokinetic (PK) data shown in \nFigure 12B\n was subjected to noncompartmental analysis (NCA) using the industry-standard software package WinNonLinâ¢ v.4.0 (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA).\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 5 below lists the primary NCA-derived \nin vivo\n pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for ARC 126 + 40kDa PEG as a function of the route of administration at 10 mg/kg in mice. The pharmacokinetic (PK) data shown in \nFigure 12B\n was subjected to noncompartmental analysis (NCA) using the industry-standard software package WinNonLinâ¢ v.4.0 (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA).\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom data shown in \nFigure 12B\n, two primary points are clear: (1) the pharmacokinetics of ARC127 (ARC126 + 40 kD PEG) after intravenous (IV), intraperitoneal (IP), or subcutaneous (SC) administration at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in mice a plasma concentration of ~1ÂµM is present at 24 hrs post-dose; and (2) the systemic bioavailability, F, of ARC127 after intraperitoneal (IP) administration is quite high (~63%), while for subcutaneous (SC) administration the bioavailability is still high enough (~24%) to warrant consideration for clinical applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a secondary test of both the plasma pharmacokinetics and the \nin vivo\n bioactivity of ARC127 (ARC126 + 40 kD PEG), the competition binding assay described above in reference to \nFigure 10A\n was used to assay the same plasma samples used to generate the data shown in \nFigure 12B\n. Serial 1:10 dilutions of plasma sample were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (1X PBS) and mixed with a fixed concentration of \n32\nP-ARC126, then added to human PDGF-BB. The final concentration of PDGF in each assay was 0.1 nM, and the final concentration of \n32\nP-ARC126 < 0.1 nM. In this experiment, the plasma samples were analyzed by comparison with a standard curve generated with samples of known ARC127 concentrations in 1X PBS. By comparison with the reference standards, the effective concentration of active aptamer in each plasma sample could be calculated. The effective concentration of active aptamer, as calculated using the results of the competition binding assay analysis of the plasma PK samples, is shown in \nFigure 12C. Figure 12C\n shows the bioactivity profile of ARC126+40 kD PEG after intravenous (IV) administration at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in mice. This \nex vivo\n analysis thus provides verification that (1) the aptamer was present and active in the plasma of the mouse model at t=48 hrs post-dose; and (2) the plasma concentrations calculated from the fluorescence-based pharmacokinetic assay are accurate.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 4: Species Cross Reactivity of ARC126 and ARC127\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nStudies were performed to determine which isoforms of PDGF ARC126 would bind to. Competition binding assays were set up using the dot blot analysis previously described, to test ARC126 for binding to human PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB (all from PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). The results of the competition binding assay show that ARC126 (SEQ ID NO. 1-HEG-SEQ ID NO:2-HEG-SEQ ID NO:3-3T) binds to PDGF-BB with a K\nd\n of approximately 100 pM, and PDGF-AB with a K\nd\n of approximately 100 pM, but does not bind to PDGF-AA (\nFigure 13A\n). Next, a study was done to determine whether ARC126 cross reacted with PDGF-BB of species other than human. Competition binding assays were set up by dot blot analysis, as previously described, using human, rat, and mouse PDGF-BB (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). The results of the competition binding assay show that ARC126 binds to human, rat and mouse PDGF-BB with equal affinity (\nFigure 13B\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 5: 3T3 Cell Proliferation Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSince ARC126 was shown to cross react with human, rat and mouse PDGF-BB, 3T3 cells, which are derived from a rat fibroblast cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA), could be used in a proliferation assay to test potency of all PDGF aptamers, including aptamers that were obtained as part of the de-fluorination efforts described in Example 3A. 3T3 fibroblast cells have PDGF receptors on their cell-surface and respond to mitogen, \ne.g\n., PDGF stimulation by proliferation. The assay was performed as follows: 3T3 cells were plated 3,000 cells/well in a 96 well plate one day prior to the start of the assay in 100ul DMEM/ 10%FCS. The following day, cells were washed once with straight DMEM and then 75ul DMEM/ 0.8% FCS was added to each well. Then 25ul of PDGF-BB (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) at a 50 ng/ml final concentration was added to each well +/- aptamer condition to be tested. Each plate included the following conditions in triplicate: no PDGF which corresponds to growth without mitogen (negative control), a scrambled aptamer control (ARC128) where no effect on growth rate is observed (negative control), a positive control where maximal growth is observed in the absence of PDGF aptamer, and a series of functional PDGF aptamer dilutions from which a good IC50 curve could be calculated. The functional PDGF aptamer dilutions usually consisted of 6 points in 2-fold serial dilutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells were incubated for 3 days. Following incubation 10ul MTT (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 1.5 hours. Media was removed, 200 Âµl Isopropanol (2-propanol) was added to each well, cells were resuspended thoroughly and absorbance at 570nm was read on a 96 well plate reader. The present example depicts the potency comparison of PDGF aptamer ARC127 to that of a PDGF neutralizing polyclonal antibody as shown in \nFigure 14A\n (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The data shown in \nFigure 14A\n demonstrate that the aptamer displays better potency than the polyclonal antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 3T3 cell proliferation assay was performed with ARC126, ARC127, ARC128 and with all the other PDGF aptamer derivatives that were obtained as described in Example 3A above. (ARC126 and ARC127 routinely display IC\n50\n values <20 nM where scrambled control ARC128 never displays an effect of 3T3 cell proliferation. Table 6 below shows the IC\n50\ns of ARC126 variants in 3T3 proliferation assay.\n\n \n \nTable 6.\n IC\n50\n's of defluorinated ARC126 variants in 3T3 proliferation assay.\n \n \n \n \nARC#\n \n \n \nMean IC\n50\n \n \n \n \n \n \n124\n \n20.67\n \n \n \n126\n \n3.40\n \n \n \n127\n \n3.45\n \n \n \n276\n \n18.00\n \n \n \n277\n \n8.67\n \n \n \n299\n \n1000.00\n \n \n \n300\n \n900.00\n \n \n \n335\n \n90.00\n \n \n \n336\n \n196.67\n \n \n \n337\n \n1000.00\n \n \n \n338\n \n1000.00\n \n \n \n339\n \n766.67\n \n \n \n340\n \n866.67\n \n \n \n341\n \n1000.00\n \n \n \n343\n \n \n \n \n \n342\n \n1000.00\n \n \n \n344\n \n200.00\n \n \n \n345\n \n13.00\n \n \n \n346\n \n15.00\n \n \n \n347\n \n1000.00\n \n \n \n362\n \n315.00\n \n \n \n363\n \n3.92\n \n \n \n364\n \n1719.00\n \n \n \n365\n \n6.79\n \n \n \n366\n \n5.54\n \n \n \n404\n \n3.89\n \n \n \n405\n \n8.65\n \n \n \n406\n \n17.15\n \n \n \n407\n \n16.36\n \n \n \n408\n \n28.40\n \n \n \n409\n \n7.31\n \n \n \n410\n \n6.79\n \n \n \n513\n \n2.07\n \n \n \n514\n \n3.16\n \n \n \n515\n \n4.66\n \n \n \n516\n \n3.05\n \n \n \n127\n \n3.45\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ARC127 PDGF aptamer also blocks proliferation of 3T3 cells better than known tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as AG 1295 and AG 1433 compounds (Sigma Aldrich Biochemicals, St Louis, MO). The assay conditions were exactly the same as described above. ARC127 reduced the PDGF driven increase in proliferation to background levels at a concentration as low as 30 nM. Both of the AG compounds displayed much worse potencies compared to ARC127. AG-1433 seemed to have unspecific toxic effects at micromolar levels. This effect is visible starting from 300 nM where signal levels are lower than no treatment alone samples corresponding to loss of signal due to lethality of cells only in the presence of AG compound (\nFigure 14B\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 6: 3T3 Cell Viability Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe reduction of growth in 3T3 cells observed in the cell proliferation assay described in Example 5 upon addition of ARC126, ARC127 and other active PDGF aptamer derivatives might potentially be due to toxic effects of aptamer. To test this possibility a Calcein AM cell viability assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was performed. 3T3 cells were plated 3,000 cells/well were treated with various concentrations of PDGF aptamer up to 40 ÂµM were tested for 24 and 48 hours. TNF-Î± (100 pg/ml) was provided and used as a positive control to induce apoptosis. Following incubation cells were washed with 1X PBS. Calcein AM was prepared according to manufacturer's recommended instructions, incubated for 30 minutes and fluorescence signal intensity was determined on a 96-well plate reader. No increase in the apoptosis rate of 3T3 cells due to ARC127 was observed (\nFigure 15\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 7: 3T3 or RPE Cell Migration Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPDGF is a strong mitogen as well as a chemoattractant. A migration assay performed both in 24 and 96-well format was chosen as an additional functional assay to test the potency of \nARC\n 127. In the cell migration assay 80,000 cells 3T3 rat fibroblasts (ATCC, Manassas, VA) or RPE (retinal pigmented epithelial) cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were plated per well into a 24 well plate with 8 micron filters (BD Biosciences, Discovery Labware, Bedford, MA). 0.5ml DMEM/0.2% FCS was added to the top chamber and 0.8ml DMEM/0.2% FCS was added to the bottom chamber. The system was equilibrated by incubating for 4 hours at 37 degrees celsius. Human PDGF-BB (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) (for RPE cells) or rat PDGF-BB (PeproTech) (for 3T3 cells) was added to the bottom chamber (0 ng/ml - 100ng/ml final concentration). The system was incubated 4 hours to 12 hours. Cells were scraped off on the top of filter with a Q-tip. The cells that migrated to the bottom of the filter were fixed with a mixture of cold 50% Methanol/ 50% Acetone for 3 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing incubation filters were washed with 1X PBS and stained with Giemsa Stain (Matheson Coleman and Bell) for 1-2 hours and migration was visualized by taking pictures on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope. Specifically, migration under four different conditions was visualized: (1) background migration observed in the absence of PDGF; (2) migration observed in the presence of 5 nM PDGF BB; (3) migration observed in the presence of 5 nM PDGF BB and 100 nM functional aptamer ARC127; and (4) migration observed in the presence of 5 nM of PDGF BB and 100 nM ARC128 scrambled control aptamer. The visualized migration results show that the presence of 100 nM ARC127 inhibits the effects of 5 nM PDGF-BB, shown by the migration of 3T3 or RPE cells at background levels. ARC 128 scrambled control displays no activity and the migration observed at this condition is equal to the one observed with 5 nM PDGF BB alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 16A\n shows the results of a cell migration experiment performed in 96 well format using \nQCM Chemotaxis\n 96 Well Migration Assay (#ECM 510) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The 96 well format allowed for a more quantitative analysis of cell migration than the 24 well format, which was more qualitative. The 96 well assay starts by bringing plates and reagents to room temperature. 150ul of DMEM/ 0.2% FBS was added with or without chemoattractant to the wells of the feeder tray. 200,000 cells RPE cells in 100ul media DMEM/0.2 FBS were added into migration chamber and incubated for 1-24 hours at 37 degrees celsius.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing incubation, the migration chamber plate was removed and the non-migratory cells were discarded. The number of migratory cells was quantitated according to manufacturer's recommended instructions. In brief, media from the top side was removed by flipping out the remaining cell suspension, and was placed onto a new feeder tray that contains 150ul of pre-warmed Cell Detachment Solution. This mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees celsius. CyQuant GR Dye 1:75 was diluted with 4X Lysis Buffer and 50ul of the Lysis Buffer/Dye Solution was added to each well containing 150ul of the solution containing migratory cells. This mixture was further incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature then transferred to a fresh 96 well plate and read at 480/520nm absorbance on a 96 well plate reader.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results obtained in this 96 well format cell migration experiment (\nFigure 16A\n) confirmed the cell migration experiments done in 24 well format. ARC127 reduced migration levels to background and ARC128 scrambled aptamer did not affect migration. \nFigure 16B\n shows that the migration observed increases linearly as a function of cell number or concentration of mitogen added.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 8: Clonogenic Growth Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nU87 glioblastoma cells (ATCC) were grown in the presence or absence of mitogen as well as aptamer as shown in the panels. U87 cells were plated in DMEM/10% FBS to 50% confluency in 100 mm dishes. Cells were incubated with PDGF-BB (PeproTech) +/- ARC127 until cells appeared confluent (1-2 days). The addition of a final concentration of 50ng/ml PDGF BB alone caused the appearance of highly connected three dimensional cell clusters. Addition of 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB plus 10 nM to 100 nM functional aptamer ARC127 reduced the occurrence of clusters to background level. The presence of aptamer had no effect on proliferation rate of the cells determined by MTT assay. Thus, the aptamer blocks cell to cell adhesion of U87 cells which are known to have PDGF driven autocrine loops. \nARC\n 127 seems to be blocking the cell surface displayed ligand binding to another cell's receptor as displayed by cell to cell adhesion.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 9: PDGF-drive ELK Luciferase Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo further prove the activity of \nARC\n 127 PDGF aptamer, a mechanistic Elk Luciferase reporter gene assays was set up. 10,000 3T3 cells/well were plated in DMEM/10% FBS in a 96 well plate. They were transfected using FuGene (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at 3:1 ratio with 5 ng of ELK-1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and 20 ng of pFR-Luciferase plasmids (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). When PDGF is added at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml to 3T3 cells, an increase in the Luciferase signal can be observed which corresponds to the effect of the mitogen on the reporter gene. Steady Glo Luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to detect luciferase. The results indicate that a concentration of \nARC\n 127 as low as 3 nM reduces the Luciferase signal to no mitogen levels. IC50 of ARC127 deduced from this analysis is < 2 nM. (\nFigure 17\n.)\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE \n10: In vivo\n Data in HT-29,LS174T and HCT-116 Colon Cancer Xenograft\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModels\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo\n efficacy studies were established to test the hypothesis that inhibition of PDGF-BB and/or its receptor with ARC127 and ARC308 increase the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs.\n\n\n \n\n\nHT-29 and LS147T Studies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperimental overview.\n Human HT-29 or LS174T colon cancer xenotransplants were established in athymic nude mice (Nu/Nu mice, Charles River Labs, Wilmington, MA) by injecting mice with 1x10\n7\n HT29 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), or 2x10\n6\n LS174T cells (ATCC Manassas, VA) sub-cutaneously and allowing the tumors to grow for 5 days. On \nday\n 5, two dimensional measurements of the established tumors were taken using a digital caliper. Once tumor measurements were taken, the mice were randomized into groups such that the average tumor size was the same in each group. Once randomized, the mice were treated with irinotecan (Pfizer, NY, NY) which is a cytotoxic drug shown to have efficacy against colon cancer in the presence or absence of PDGF blockade using a PDGF specific aptamer or other small molecule inhibitor, to determine if PDGF blockade increases the efficacy of the cytotoxic drug.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods.\n An experiment (Experiment 1) was designed to test a combination of known chemotherapeutic agents GLEEVEC\nâ¢\n and irinotecan in a dose optimization study in an HT29 colon cancer xenograft model. Table 7 below summarizes the experimental design of \nExperiment\n 1 using a human colon carcinoma cell line HT29 (ATCC, Manassas, VA), with a cytotoxic drug, irinotecan (Pfizer, NY, NY) administered at 150 mg/kg via intra-peritoneal injection once weekly, as well as a drug to block PDGF signaling, GLEEVEC\nâ¢\n (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) dosed orally at 50 mg/kg twice daily (Monday through Friday). Though the mode of action of GLEEVEC\nâ¢\n is known to block the PDGF receptor function as well as other receptors for other growth factors, the effect is not necessarily PDGF specific. The results of this experiment are shown in \nFigure 18A\n showing a plot of group mean average tumor diameter in mm as a function of time for each of the treatment regimens irinotecan 150 mg/kg weekly, \nGLEEVEC\n \n \n \nâ¢\n 50 mg/kg orally BID Qd5, and irinotecan 150 mg/GLEEVEC\nâ¢\n 50mg/kg BID Qd5 combination therapies. These data show that GLEEVEC\nâ¢\n increases the efficacy of irinotecan alone in HT29 colon cancer xenotransplant model. GLEEVEC\nâ¢\n-mediated PDGF blockade enhanced the efficacy of irinotecan treatment as demonstrated by the decreased rate of tumor growth as compared to animals treated with irinotecan alone. The results are statistically significant (two tailed students T-test).\n\n \n \nTable 7:\n Experiment 1: HT29 irinotecan/GLEEVEC Dose Optimization Study\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTumor Inoculation\n \n \n \nTest Article Administration\n \n \n \nCombination Therapy Administration (PLEASE DOSE AFTER TEST ARTICLE)\n \n \n \nDay of Euthanasia\n \n \n \n \nGroup\n \nNo. of Animals\n \nTest Material\n \nDose\n \nRoute\n \nDay\n \nTest Material\n \nDose (mg/kg)\n \nRoute\n \nDay\n \nTest Material\n \nDose (mg/k g)\n \n \nRoute\n \n \nDay\n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n10\n \nHT-29\n \n1x10\n7\n \ncells\n \n \nSC\n \nDay\n \n 0\n \nDiluent\n \n \n \n \nDVE\n \n \n \n \nIP\n \nDays\n \n \n \n \n \n 7, 14, 21\n \nNA\n \nNA\n \nIP\n \nStD Days 4 - 21\n \n \nTBD\n \n \n \n \n2\n \n10\n \n \nDiluent\n \n \nDVE\n \nARC\n \n 127\n \n50\n \n \n \n3\n \n10\n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n \n150\n \n \nNA\n \n \nNA\n \n \n \n \n \n4\n \n10\n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n \n50\n \n \nNA\n \n \nNA\n \n \n \n \n \n5\n \n10\n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n \n150\n \n \nARC\n 127\n \n50\n \n \n \n6\n \n10\n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n \n50\n \n \nARC\n 127\n \n50\n \n \n \n7\n \n10\n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n \n150\n \n \nGleevec\n \n \n100\n \n \nPO\n \n \n \n \n8\n \n10\n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n \n50\n \n \nGleevec\n \n \n100\n \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n \nDiluent\n \n \nDVE\n \nGleevec\n \n \n \n100\n \n \n \n \n \n1.

ARC127 prevents PDGF-BB from binding the PDGF receptor; and has a 40K PEG attached. Table 8 below summarizes the experimental design for \nExperiment\n 2. The results from \nExperiment\n 2 are shown in \nFigure 18B\n and \nFigure 18C\n demonstrating that \nARC\n 127 enhanced the efficacy of irinotecan treatment as demonstrated by the decreased rate of tumor growth as compared to animals treated with irinotecan alone.

Table 9 summarizes the experimental design for \nExperiment\n 3. Cytotoxic drug irinotecan (Pfizer, NY, NY) was dosed via intraperitoneal delivery at 150 mg/kg once weekly.

ARC308 prevents PDGF-BB from binding the PDGF receptor; this molecule has a 30K PEG attached. The results from \nExperiment\n 3 are shown in \nFigures 19A and 19B\n which show that ARC308 enhanced the efficacy of irinotecan treatment as demonstrated by the decreased rate of tumor growth as compared to animals treated with irinotecan alone.

Log cell kill is the log (base 10) of the number of tumor cells before treatment divided by the number of cells after treatment. Log cell kill is calculated as (T-C)/(3.32 x D), where T = the time in days for the treated group to reach a certain volume size tumor, C = the time in days for the control group to reach the same volume size tumor, and D = the time for the tumor, treated with control, to double in volume. A log cell kill less than 0.7 indicates no activity, while a value greater than 2.8 indicates high activity. Log cell kill net takes into account the treatment duration (R), which was 18 days, using the formula [(T-C)-R]/(3.32 x D). A log cell kill net less than 0 indicates no activity of the treatment compared with control, while a value greater or equal to 0 indicates activity. The target size was 1000 mm\n3\n, the doubling time was 3.25 days, and the control group was the group to which vehicle (0.9% sodium chloride in water) was administered. ARC308 alone showed no activity. While Irinotecan showed activity, addition of concomitant treatment with ARC308 (50 mg/kg) increased the activity determined by log cell kill and log cell kill net by 1.62 and 5.29 fold. The log cell kill and log cell kill net values for combined treatment with Irinotecan and ARC308 (50 mg/kg) were obtained by extrapolating the tumor size for this group to the target size, using a growth curve with the same slope as the Irinotecan-treated alone group, since the average volume of the combination treatment group never reached 1000 mm\n3\n in the time period of the experiment.\n\n \n \nTable 10:\n Efficacy Analysis of ARC308.\n \n \n \n \nTreatment\n \n \n \nLog cell kill\n \n \n \nLog cell kill\n \n \n \nActivity Assessment\n \n \n \n \n \n \nARC308\n \n \n \n0\n \n \n \n-1.67\n \n \n \nInactive\n \n \n \n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n \n \n1.95\n \n \n \n0.28\n \n \n \nActive\n \n \n \n \n \nIrinotecan + ARC308\n \n \n \n3.15\n \n \n \n1.48\n \n \n \nActive\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, these \nin vivo\n studies in HT-29 and LS 174T colon cancer xenograft models confirm that PDGF blockade affected by the therapeutic aptamers of the present disclosure can increase the efficacy of irinotecan treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fourth experiment (Experiment 4) was designed to further test ARC308/irinotecan dosing regimens in a colon cancer xenotransplant model using human colon carcinoma cell line LS174T (ATCC). Table 11 summarizes the experimental design for \nExperiment\n 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese studies again showed that ARC308 prevents PDGF-BB from binding the PDGF receptor and enhanced the efficacy of Irinotecan treatment as demonstrated by the decreased rate of tumor growth as compared to animals treated with Irinotecan alone in a dose dependent manner. As shown in \nFigure 28\n ARC308 showed a dose dependent enhancement of the efficacy of Irinotecan treatment as demonstrated by the decreased rate of tumor growth in the group treated with Irinotecan plus ARC308 (25 mg/kg) as compared to animals treated with Irinotecan plus ARC308 (1 mg/kg). This was particularly evident in the post-dosing period (days 23-53) when the mice were not administered either Irinotecan or ARC308. \nFigure 29\n is a Kaplan-Meier representation of the data shown in \nFigure 28\n wherein the percentage of mice in a treatment group exhibiting tumors less than 500 mm\n3\n [as calculated from digital caliper measurements of length and width of the tumors, using the following formula: volume = (length x width\n2\n)/2] is depicted. Once again a statistically significant difference is noted between the group treated with Irinotecan plus ARC308 (25 mg/kg) as compared to animals treated with Irinotecan plus ARC308 (1 mg/kg), supporting an \nARC\n 308 dose dependent enhancement of the efficacy of Irinotecan. By \nday\n 38 all mice in the Irinotecan plus ARC308 (1 mg/kg) group had developed tumors greater than or equal to 500 mm\n3\n while 56% the mice in the group treated with Irinotecan plus ARC308 at 25 mg/kg still exhibited tumors less than 500 mm\n3\n.\n\n \n \nTable 11 : Experiment 4\n: ARC308/irinotecan study LS 174T colon cancer xenograft model.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTumor Inoculation\n \n \n \nTest Article Administration\n \n \n \nCombination Therapy Administration (PLEASE DOSE AFTER TEST ARTICLE)\n \n \n \nDay of Euthanasia\n \n \n \n \nGroup\n \nNo. of Animals\n \nTest Material\n \nDose\n \nRoute\n \nDay\n \nTest Material\n \nDose (mg/kg)\n \nRoute\n \nDay\n \nTest Material\n \nDose (mg/k g)\n \n \nRoute\n \n \nDay\n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n10\n \nLS174T\n \n2 x 10\n6\n \ncells\n \n \nSC\n \nDay\n \n 0\n \nDiluent\n \n \n \n \nDVE\n \n \n \n \nIP\n \nDays\n \n \n \n \n \n 8,15,22\n \nDiluent\n \nDVE\n \nIP\n \nSID Days 5- 22\n \n \nTBD\n \n \n \n \n2\n \n10\n \n \nDiluent\n \n \nDVE\n \nARC\n \n 308\n \n50\n \n \n \n3\n \n10\n \nDiluent\n \nDVE\n \nscrambled 50\n \n50\n \n \n \n4\n \n10\n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n \n150\n \nDiluent\n \n \nDVE\n \n \n \n \n5\n \n10\n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n \n150\n \n \nARC\n 308\n \n50\n \n \n \n6\n \n10\n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n \n150\n \n \nARC\n 308\n \n25\n \n \n \n7\n \n10\n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n \n150\n \n \nARC\n 308\n \n10\n \n \n \n8\n \n10\n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n \n150\n \n \nARC\n 308\n \n1\n \n \n \n9\n \n10\n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n \n150\n \n \nARC\n 308\n \n50\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSID days\n \n \n \n \n \n 7,8,14, 15,21,22\n \n \n \n \n \n1.

On \nday\n 0 LS 174t tumor cells from a human colorectal cancer cell line were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank of 8-9 week old female outbred athymic nude mice from Harlan (Indianapolis, Indiana). The resultant subcutaneous tumors were measured on \nday\n 6 with calipers to determine their length and width and the mice were weighed; tumor sizes were calculated using the formula (length x width\n2\n)/2 and expressed as cubic millimeters. Mice with tumors smaller than 7.2 mm\n3\n and larger than 26.95 mm\n3\n were excluded from the following group formation. Two groups of mice, 12 mice per group, were formed by randomization such that the group mean tumor sizes were essentially equal (mean of groups Â± standard deviation of groups = 17.16Â±0.16 mm\n3\n), with similar group standard deviations (mean of group standard deviations Â± standard deviation of group standard deviations = 6.20 Â± 1.0 mm\n3\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach group was assigned to a treatment regimen as follows. All mice were dosed once per day beginning on \nday\n 6 with ARC593 or vehicle with the last dose administered on \nday\n 23. Doses were adjusted for changing body weight twice per week and all mice were dosed with vehicle or aptamer at 10 ml of dosing solution per kg body weight given intraperitoneally. \nGroup\n 1 received normal saline as vehicle control; \nGroup\n 2 received ARC593, 50 mg/kg of mouse body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nARC593 dosing solutions were prepared by dissolving lyophilized aptamer into normal saline, adjusting the concentration of the dosing solution with normal saline until the correct concentration as determined by spectophotometric analysis was achieved, and sterile filtering the resultant solutions through a 0.22 Âµm filter into sterile sample vials which were then kept, frozen at -20Â°C and defrosted overnight for use the next day at 4Â°C. The aptamer was allowed to come to room temperature for an hour before dosing. Unused material was stored at 4Â°C for use the next day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring and after the dosing period the mice were weighed and tumors measured twice per week. All results in terms of tumor volume are shown in \nFigure 30\n. \nGroup\n 1 showed the expected tumor growth rate, with a doubling time of approximately 5 days. One mouse in \nGroup\n 1 treated with vehicle was found dead on \nday\n 12. Death was due to intraperititoneal bleeding resulting from mechanical injury during Intraperitoneal dosing the previous day. That mouse was excluded from further data analysis. The group tumor volumes were analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank sum test for independent groups, with p<0.05 considered to be significant. On \nday\n 20, the last day that all mice were still alive in the aptamer-treated groups, the tumor volumes in \nGroup\n 2 were significantly greater than those in \nGroup\n 1. After \nday\n 20 three mice from \nGroup\n 2 were sacrificed as their tumors exceeded IACUC mandated maximum volumes. The tumor volume enhancing effect of treatment with ARC593 was evident in a majority of the ARC593-treated mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an indication of the toxicity of treatments, the change during the study in group mean corrected body weights were examined. Corrected body weight is the body weight of a mouse minus the approximate weight of the subcutaneous tumor. The approximate weight of the tumor is determined from the formula \"weight (g) = volume (mm\n3\n)\", with the volume determined as above. Corrected body weights thus determined reflect changes in the non-tumor body weight and are thus better indicators of toxicity-derived weight loss. All groups showed some decrease in corrected body weight as expected with the growth of this xenograft tumor. There was no significant difference between the vehicle or aptamer treated groups (\nGroup\n 1, 2). Thus treatment with aptamer did not increase toxicity as measured by body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA sixth xenograft study was performed to examine the effect of treating human tumors in athymic mice with ARC594 in comparison with vehicle. On \nday\n 0 LS 174t tumor cells from a human colorectal cancer cell line were implanted subcutaneously on the left shoulder of 8-9 week old female outbred athymic nude mice from Harlan (Indianapolis, Indiana). The resultant subcutaneous tumors were measured on \nday\n 12 with calipers to determine their length and width and the mice were weighed; tumor sizes were calculated using the formula (length x width\n2\n)/2 and expressed as cubic millimeters. Mice with tumors smaller than 49.69 mm\n3\n and larger than 233.44 mm\n3\n were excluded from the following group formation. Two groups of mice, 12 mice per group, were formed by randomization such that the group mean tumor sizes were essentially equal (mean of groups Â± standard deviation of groups = 136.83 Â± 1.2 mm\n3\n), with similar group standard deviations (mean of group standard deviations Â± standard deviation of group standard deviations = 62.38 Â± 5.03 mm\n3\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach group was assigned to a treatment regimen as follows. All mice were dosed once per day beginning on \nday\n 12 with ARC594 or vehicle with the last dose administered on day 27. Doses were adjusted for changing body weight twice per week and all mice were dosed with vehicle or aptamer at 10 ml of dosing solution per kg body weight given intraperitoneally. \nGroup\n 1 received normal saline as vehicle control; \nGroup\n 2 received ARC594, 50 mg/kg of mouse body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nARC594 dosing solutions were prepared by dissolving lyophilized aptamer into normal saline, adjusting the concentration of the dosing solution with normal saline until the correct concentration as determined by spectophotometric analysis was achieved, and sterile filtering the resultant solutions through a 0.22 Âµm filter into sterile sample vials which were then kept, frozen at -20Â°C and defrosted overnight for use the next day at 4Â°C. The aptamer was allowed to come to room temperature for an hour before dosing. Unused material was stored at 4Â°C for use the next day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring and after the dosing period the mice were weighed and tumors measured twice per week. \nGroup\n 1 showed the expected tumor growth rate, with a doubling time of approximately 7 days. The group tumor volumes were analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank sum test for independent groups, with p<0.05 considered to be significant. There was no significant difference between the mean tumor volumes of Group I and 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon further analysis of the data, it was noted that 2 mice (2-8 and 2-9) in \nGroup\n 2 exhibited tumors with very fast growth rates and had to be sacrificed on \nday\n 24 as their tumors exceeded IACUC mandated maximum volumes. Their tumor doubling times were 2.3 and 1.6 days (for mouse 2-8 and 2-9, respectively), in comparison with the mean doubling time of \nGroup\n 1 of 7 days and of all other members of \nGroup\n 2 of 6 days. The tumors of two mice of \nGroup\n 2 treated with ARC594 grew much faster than either the other members of \nGroup\n 2 or \nGroup\n 1.\n\n\n \n\n\nHCT-116 Study\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA seventh xenograft study (Experiment 7) was performed to confirm the efficacy of ARC308 and ARC594 in inhibiting human tumor growth in athymic mice. On \nday\n 0 HCT-116 tumor cells from a human colorectal cancer cell line were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank of 8-9 week old female outbred athymic nude mice from Harlan (Indianapolis, Indiana) The resultant subcutaneous tumors were measured on \nday\n 8 with calipers to determine their length and width and the mice were weighed; tumor sizes were calculated using the formula (length x width\n2\n)/2 and expressed as cubic millimeters. Mice with tumors smaller than 62.65 mm\n3\n and larger than 126.0 mm\n3\n were excluded from the following group formation. Ten groups of mice, 12 mice per group, were formed by randomization such that the group mean tumor sizes were essentially equal (mean of groups Â± standard deviation of groups = 82.67 Â± 0.00 mm\n3\n), with similar group standard deviations (mean of group standard deviations Â± standard deviation of group standard deviations = 21.34 Â± 0.00 mm\n3\n). An additional group of 10 mice was also formed (mean Â± standard deviation = 81.45Â± 24.87 mm\n3\n) as a group that received no treatment but was monitored for body eight and tumor volume (Group 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach group was assigned to a treatment regimen as follows. All mice were dosed once per day beginning on \nday\n 8 with ARC308, \nARC\n 594 or vehicle at 10 ml/kg, with the last dose administered on \nday\n 25. Doses were adjusted for changing body weight twice per week and all mice were dosed with vehicle or aptamer at 10 ml of dosing solution per kg body weight given intraperitoneally. \nGroup\n 2 received normal saline as vehicle control; \n \nGroups\n \n 4 and 5 received ARC308, 50 mg/kg of mouse body weight; \n \nGroups\n \n 6 and 7 received ARC594, 50 mg/kg of mouse body weight; \nGroup\n 8 received ARC594, 10 mg/kg of mouse body weight; and Group 9 received ARC594, 1 mg/kg of mouse body weight. \n \n \nGroups\n \n \n 3, 10 and 11 were dosed with vehicle intraperitinoneally once per day from days 8-25. \n \n \n \nGroups\n \n \n \n 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9 were dosed on \n \n \nday\n \n \n 11, 18 and 25 with irintoecan (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). \nGroup\n 10 was dosed with imatinib (a small molecule drug which inhibits PDGFR as well as other tyrosine kinases) at 50 mg/kg orally twice a day at 12 hour intervals, beginning on \nday\n 8. \nGroup\n 11 was dosed on \n \nday\n \n 11 and 25 with irintoecan (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and twice a day with imatinib at 50 mg/kg given orally on days 8-12 and 23-25.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nARC308 and ARC594 dosing solutions were prepared by dissolving lyophilized aptamer into normal saline, adjusting the concentration of the dosing solution with normal saline until the correct concentration as determined by spectophotometric analysis was achieved, and sterile filtering the resultant solutions through a 0.22 Âµm filter into sterile sample vials which was then kept at 4Â°C for shipment, frozen at -20Â°C upon receipt by Piedmont, and defrosted overnight for use the next day at 4Â°C. The aptamer was allowed to come to room temperature for an hour before dosing. Unused material was stored at 4Â°C for use the next day. Normal saline for the vehicle control was sterile filtered into sample vials and stored in the same manner as the aptamer dosing solutions. Aptamer and vehicle dosing solutions were coded so that the personnel dosing were blinded from their identity. Irintoecan (Camptosar, NDC 009-7529) was prepared fresh for each dosing by dissolving the compound in 5% dextrose in water (pH 4.8). Gleevec (imantinib mesylate, NDC 0078-0373-866) was prepared fresh for each dosing by dissolving in 5% dextrose in water (pH 4.8).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring and after the dosing period the mice were weighed and tumors measured twice per week. \nGroup\n 1 showed the expected tumor growth rate, with a doubling time of approximately 7 days. The group tumor volumes were analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank sum test for independent groups, with p<0.05 considered to be significant. There was no significant difference in tumor volumes between the no treatment (Group1) and either vehicle (Group 2), ARC308 (50 mg/kg, Group 4) groups or ARC594 (50 mg/kg, Group 6). By day 17 the tumor volumes of the groups given irintoecan alone or with aptamer (\n \n \n \nGroups\n \n \n \n 3,5, 7, 8, 9) were significantly smaller than the vehicle-treated group, and they remained so throughout the remainder of the study. The tumor volumes of the irintoecan plus ARC308 (50 mg/kg, Group 5) group were significantly smaller from those of the group treated only with irinotecan on \nday\n 21 and days 28-38, after which sufficiently few mice remained in the groups to allow comparison. The tumor volumes of the irintoecan plus ARC594 (50 mg/kg, Group 7) group were significantly smaller from those of the group treated only with irinotecan from days 28-52, after which sufficiently few mice remained in the groups to allow comparison. The tumor volumes of the irintoecan plus ARC594 (10 mg/kg, Group 8) group were significantly smaller from those of the group treated only with irinotecan from days 17-42. The tumor volumes of the irintoecan plus ARC594 (1 mg/kg, Group 9) group were not significantly smaller from those of the group treated only with irinotecan during this study. There was no significant tumor volume difference between the groups treated with irinotecan plus ARC308 (50 mg/kg, Group 5), irinotecan plus ARC594 (50 mg/kg, Group 7) or irinotecan plus ARC594 (10 mg/kg, Group 8). There was a significant difference in tumor volumes between irintoecan plus ARC594 (1 mg/kg. Group 9) and the group treated with irinotecan plus ARC594 (50 mg/kg, Group 7) on days 38-56. Thus the addition of \nARC\n 308 or ARC594 to treatment with irinotecan did produce an increase in irinotecan efficacy as measured by reduced tumor volume in this xenpgraft study, and there was a dose response to treatment with ARC594.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere was no significant difference in tumor volumes between the vehicle (Group2) and Gleevec (Group 10) treated group. Addition of irinotecan to the Gleevec treatment produced unacceptable toxicity causing 4 of 12 mice to die by day 17. As a result treatment with both drugs was stopped for this group until \nday\n 23. The irintoecan plus Gleevec group actually showed significantly less efficacy as measured by tumor volumes form days 28-45.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an indication of the toxicity of treatments, the change during the study in group mean corrected body weights were examined. Corrected body weight is the body weight of a mouse minus the approximate weight of the subcutaneous tumor. The approximate weight of the tumor is determined from the formula \"weight (g) = volume (mm\n3\n)\", with the volume determined as above. Corrected body weights thus determined reflect changes in the non-tumor body weight and are thus better indicators of toxicity-derived weight loss. All groups showed some decrease in corrected body weight as expected with the growth of this xenograft tumor. There was no significant difference between the no treatment, vehicle, either aptamer alone, or Gleevec alone treated groups (Group1, 2, 4, 5, 10). There was a significant difference with the addition of irintoecan to the treatment protocol noted during some timepoints in the study, but there was no difference between the groups receiving aptamer and irintoecan versus irinotecan alone, with the exception of day 17, when there was a significant decrease in body weight between the irinotecan plus ARC594 (50 mg/kg, Group 7) group that was no apparent at any other time. Thus addition of aptamer to irintoecan treatment did not increase toxicity, as measured by body weight.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 11: PDGF/VEGF Bi-Functional Aptamers as Oncology Therapeutics\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCombination therapies have advantages over single-agent therapies in the treatment of solid tumors as shown in the colon cancer xenograft models with the aptamers of the present disclosure (Example 10). Similarly, aptamers that are able to bind to more than one of the targets that are implicated in solid tumor cancers are effective in potentiating the therapeutic effects of individual therapeutic agents. Aptamers such as these can inhibit multiple proteins (or other targets) and therefore provide a single compound that acts in a manner that is substantially equivalent to a combination of compounds. Multi-functional aptamers can be engineered, e.g., from combinations of known aptamers. These multifunctional aptamers can be shown to bind to multiple targets, and can be generated either directly by solid-phase chemical synthesis, or by transcription from a corresponding DNA template. Examples of such multi-functional aptamers include aptamers capable of binding to VEGF and PDGF for cancer indications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to design multifunctional aptamers from previously identified aptamers (or regions of aptamers) it is important to conjoin the individual aptamers via regions of the individual aptamer that do not make contact with the target. This can typically be accomplished by identifying regions of the secondary structure which tolerate substitution of individual nucleotides at most or all positions. If structural units are required, such as a stem, then these can be preserved in the final design. Additionally, it is important that the structural integrity of each of the individual aptamers is preserved in the final folded structure. This can most easily be achieved by predicting the secondary structures of the original aptamer sequences using an algorithm such as infold, and then ensuring that these predicted secondary structures are preserved, according to the same algorithm, when they are part of the conjoined structure. The general mfold algorithm for determining multiple optimal and suboptimal secondary structures is described by the author of the program, \nDr. Michael Zuker (Science 244, 48-52 (1989\n)). A description of the folding parameters used in the algorithm is presented in \nJaeger, Turner, and Zuker , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, (1989) 86, 7706-7710\n \n(see\n also \nM. Zuker, et al., Algorithms and Thermodynamics for RNA Secondary Structure Prediction: A Practical Guide in RNA Biochemistry and Biotechnology, J. Barciszewski and B.F.C. Clark, eds., NATO ASI Series, Kluwer Academic Publishers, (1999\n)). Other programs that can be used according to the methods of the present disclosure to obtain secondary structures of nucleic acid sequences include, without limitation, RNAStructure (\nMathews, D.H.; Sabina, J.; Zuker, M.; and Turner, D.H., \"\nExpanded Sequence Dependence of Thermodynamic Parameters Improves Prediction of RNA Secondary Structure,\n\" Journal of Molecular Biology, 288, 911-940(1999\n), and \nRnaViz (Nucleic Acids Res., Nov. 15; 25(22):4679-84 (1997\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHaving determined the secondary structural motifs and units of the component aptamers, these are combined into a single oligonucleotide that folds in a manner that preserves the functionalities of each of the constituent aptamers. As a result, multifunctional aptamers are capable of binding to multiple targets, and can be generated either directly by solid phase chemical synthesis, or by transcription from a corresponding DNA template.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nVEGF and PDGF Bifunctional Aptamers.\n The methods of the present disclosure were applied to generate an aptamer having binding specificity to PDGF BB and to VEGF. This multi-functional aptamer was generated by joining two aptamers individually identified using SELEX - one (ARC 245, SEQ ID NO. 7) which recognized VEGF but not PDGF \n(see\n \nFigure 20A\n) and one (ARC126, 5'-(SEQ ID NO:1)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:2)-HEG-(SEQ ID NO:3)-3'-dT-3') which recognized PDGF but not VEGF \n(see\n \nFigure 20B\n). ARC245 (SEQ ID NO. 7) is a fully 2'O methylated (2'-OMe) aptamer with binding specificity to VEGF with a K\nD\n of about 2 nM. The ARC126 used in the multivalent aptamer is entirely DNA with binding specificity to PDGF with a K\nD\n of about 100 pM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA schematic of the structure and sequence of the multivalent aptamer capable of binding to PDGF and VEGF resulting from this combination, sequence TK.131.012.A (SEQ ID NO.9), is shown in \nFigure 21A\n. A second multivalent aptamer capable of binding to VEGF and PDGF, sequence TK.131.012.B (SEQ ID NO. 10), was also formed by combining ARC245 (SEQ ID NO.7) and ARC 126 (\nFigure 21 B)\n. As shown in \nFigure 21B\n, in this VEGF-PDGF multivalent aptamer the first mA-mU pair of the stem of ARC245 was removed before joining ARC245 and all deoxy-ARC126. In each case, as shown in \nFigure 21\n, one of the ARC126 PEG linkers was removed for the addition of the VEGF specific aptamer and the other was substituted with an oligonucleotide linker having the sequence dGdAdAdA (SEQ ID NO:97).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding data for the constituent aptamers and the multivalent aptamers were collected by dot-blot assays in which radio-labeled aptamer is incubated with protein target and then forced through a sandwich of nitrocellulose over nylon and the results shown in \nFigure 22\n. Protein-associated radio-label is captured on the nitrocellulose membrane while the balance of the radio-label is captured on the nylon membrane. The radio-label data is collected on a phosphorimaging plate. This data is then used to calculate the binding coefficients. The multivalent aptamers TK.131.012.A (SEQ ID NO. 9) and TK.131.012.B (SEQ ID NO. 10) were made synthetically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe multivalent aptamers with the sequence TK.1 31.012.A (SEQ ID NO.9) shows a K\nD\n of about 10 nM for PDGF and about 10 nM for VEGF. The multivalent aptamer with the sequence TK.131.012.B (SEQ ID NO. 10) shows a K\nD\n of about 10 nM for PDGF and about 5 nM for VEGF.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 12: PDGF and VEGF Aptamers Containing Immunostimulatory Motifs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo test the ability of aptamers comprising CpG motif(s) to stimulate the innate immune response, a murine CpG motif was engineered into an aptamer specific for PDGF-B. These aptamers were then used in \nin vitro\n mouse cell-based assays to confirm functionality of the CpG motifs (\ne.g\n., stimulation of the release of IL-6 and TNF-Î±. These aptamers were also used in aptamer mechanism-based biological activity assays (PDGF-B signaling through the MAPK pathway as measured by the effect of the CpG-PDGF-B-aptamer on PDGF-B activation of ERK Phosphorylation) to confirm functionality of the CpG motif comprising aptamer upon binding of the aptamer to its target, in this case PDGF-B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo generate the aptamers disclosed herein with an embedded or appended CpG motif, the sequence of previously identified immunostimulatory oligonucleotides comprising CpG motifs (\"ISS-ODN\" or \"ODN\") or fragments thereof were engineered into ARC124, an aptamer identified through the SELEX process that binds to PDGF AB and BB with a K\nd\n of approximately 100pm.

Truncated versions of these oligonucleotides were designed by shortening them from both their 5' and 3' ends. The resulting constructs are ISS-ODN2 through 5 and ODN 2006.2 through 3. Each of the newly designed constructs was tested in IL-6 release assay to assess the effect on immunostimulatory ability. The shortest construct that still retained the ability to induce IL-6 release was picked for the sequence appended either to the 5' or 3' end of ARC 124. Constructs that are labeled as GpGARC124short a.k.a. shortARC124, LongCpGARC124 a.k.a. longARC124, and FullCpGARC124 a.k.a. fullARC124 correspond to constructs where ISS-ODN4 is appended to the 5'-end of ARC 124. These constructs carry phosphorothioated bonds at their 5' and 3' ends in addition to inverted T at their 3'-end to assure the adequate stability in the cell-based assay but the core middle part corresponding to ARC 124 is free of phosphorothioate bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nARC124 at position 8-9 and 13-14 has two naturally occurring CpG islands. Constructs with the nomenclature of TransARC 124.1 through TransARC124.11 correspond to constructs that made use of these two naturally occurring CpG sequences to create an immunostimulatory sequence that would maximize the CpG response based on reports in the literature that CpG motifs that are embedded in varying lengths of Ts create maximal immunostimulatory effect. Thus, the changes that were performer on ARC 124 consisted of substituting the non-essential GCA bulge at position 10-12 with various T residues. The effect of varying the T bulge on the immunostimulatory effect as well as addition of phosphorothioated bonds on the stability of the construct are assessed with IL-6 release assay and phosphorylation of ERK as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor negative controls, ARC124 was engineered to remove the CpG motifs. These control sequences are shown below.\n\n \n \n \n \nTransARC124.3control (CpG-Scrambled Aptamer)\n (SEQ ID NO:34)\n\nC*A*G*GCAAG*C*T*T*T*G*CTTGAGCATCACCATGATC*C*T*G*/3InvdT/\n \n \nTransARC124.5control (CpG-Scrambled Aptamer)\n (SEQ ID NO:35)\n\nC*A*G*GCAAG*C*T*T*T*T*G*CTTGAGCATCACCATGATC*C*T*G*/3InvdT/\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe activity of PDGF aptamers containing CpG islands of the present disclosure were tested in cell based assays. Supernatants of J774A.1 cells (TIB cells), a mouse macrophage cell line (ATCC #TIB-67) in the presence of CpG motifs will contain more IL-6 and TNF-alpha than cells not in the presence of CpG islands. Thus, an IL-6 and TNF-alpha solid phase ELISA was used to quantify the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha released into the supernatants (both from R&D System, Minneapolis, MN) upon exposure to various oligonucleotides comprising CpG sequences. For the IL-6 ELISA, a monoclonal antibody specific for mouse IL-6 was pre-coated onto a 96 well microplate. An enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for mouse IL-6 was used to detect any bound IL-6 from the cell supernatants. For the TNF-alpha ELISA, an affinity purified polyclonal antibody specific for mouse TNT-alpha was pre-coated onto a 96 well microplate. An enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for mouse TNF-alpha was used to detect any bound TNF-alpha from the cell supernatants. Both ELISAs used a colorimetric readout quantified by spectrophotometry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nJ774A.1 cells (TIB cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37 Â°C, 5%CO\n2\n. 100,000 cells were plated into an appropriate number of wells on a 24 well plate one day prior to the experiment. The CpG embedded PDGF aptamers were incubated with the cells for 24 and 48 hours at 37 Â°C, 5% COY. Final aptamer concentrations were 1 uM and 10uM. Supernatants were collected at the indicated time-points and centrifuged for 8 minutes at 5,000 rpm at 4 Â°C. Centrifuged supernatants were frozen at -20 Â°C until use in the IL-6 or TNF-alpha ELISA. Both ELISAs were used according to manufacturer's recommendations. CpG motif containing oligonucleotides previously reported to be immunostimulatory, (ISS ODN and ODN2006) and LPS (Sigma), were used as positive controls and non-CpG containing aptamers were used as negative controls. \nFigure 24A\n shows the results of an IL-6 ELISA measuring IL-6 release in TIB cells using only the standard ODN's as positive controls, and aptamers which contain no CpG islands as negative controls in the assay. Positive and negative controls only were used in this experiment to establish whether this assay was robust enough to measure CpG induced IL-6 release. The data shown in \nFigure 24B\n demonstrate that the ISS ODN and shortened versions of the ISS ODN induce IL-6 release in TIB cells better than ODN2006 and shortened versions thereof. \nFigure 24C\n shows the short, long, and full versions of ARC 124 embedded with CpG motifs induces IL-6 release in TIB cells as well as the ISS ODN. The data shown in \nFigure 24D\n shows that TransARC124.1-TransARC124.7 (SEQ ID NO:23 - SEQ ID NO:29) induce IL-6 release in TIB cells. The data shown in \nFigure 24E\n shows TransARC124.1-TransARC124.7 induce TNF-alpha release in TIB cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the IL-6 release and TNF-alpha release assays show that when CpG motifs are incorporated into existing aptamers, in this case ARC124 (SEQ ID NO:11), the aptamer is capable of eliciting a CpG response.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 13 : CpG island Containing PDGF Aptamers in ERK phosphorylation Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nERK phosphorylation was used to test whether ARC124 (SEQ ID NO:11) retained its functionality after the incorporation of CpG motifs into the aptamer sequence. One hundred and fifty thousand 3T3 cells (a mouse fibroblast cell line which contains PDGF-R) were plated into an appropriate number of wells on a 12 well plate one day prior to the experiment and serum starved in 0.5% FBS overnight. Cells were treated with 10ng/m) PDGF-BB (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in the presence or absence of CpG-island containing PDGF aptamers for 30 minutes. Cells were collected and lysed with lysis buffer containing 10mM Tris pH 7.5, 100mM NaCl, 0.125% NP-40, 0.875% Brij 97, 1.5mM sodium vanadate, and 1 mini-EDTA free protease inhibitor tablet. Protein concentration in cell lysates was determined using BIO-RAD protein assay reagent according to manufacturer's recommendations (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Lysates were prepared by adding NuPage LDS Sample Buffer 4X with 0.1M DTT to a final concentration of 1X (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and incubated at 70Â°C for 7 minutes. Forty micrograms of total protein was loaded into each well of a NuPage 10% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The gel was run at 100 mAmp for 1 hour. Gel was then transferred to a HyBond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) at 250 mAmp for 3 hours. After transfer, the nitrocellulose was blocked with 5% BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in PBS for one hour at room temperature. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with a p44/42 MAP Kinase antibody overnight at 4Â°C (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). The nitrocellulose membrane was washed 3X with PBS containing 1\n% Tween\n 20 and then incubated with an anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-conjugated antibody for 1 hour (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). After the one hour incubation, the nitrocellulose membrane was washed 3X with PBS containing Tween-20. Membrane was developed using an ECL + Western Blotting Detection System according to manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) and scanned using a STORM 860 (Amersham). 3T3 cells in the presence of PDGF-BB without aptamer was used as a positive control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results show that shortARC124 and longARC124, both PDGF aptamers carrying known CpG motifs, are still functionally active and can block phosphorylation of ERK upon binding to PDGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCollectively, the data show that when CpG motifs are incorporated into existing aptamers, the aptamer is capable of eliciting a CpG response and still maintain the ability to block non-CpG target (\ne.g\n., PDGF) driven effects (\ne.g\n., ERK-MAPK phosphorylation) with the same potency as native aptamers.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 14: PDGF-AA Selection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDGF-AA SELECTION SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOne selection for the short form of PDGF-AA (Roche Biomedical) was completed using a 2-fluoro pyrimidine containing pool. Round 1 of the selection began with incubation of 2x10\n14\n molecules of 2'F pyrimidine modified ARC 212 pool (5' GGGAAAAGCGAAUCAUACACAAGA-N40-GCUCCGCCAGAGACCAACCGAGAA 3') (SEQ ID NO: 74), including a spike of Î±\n32\n P ATP body labeled pool, with 50 pmoles of PDGF-AA protein in a final volume of 100 ÂµL for 1 hr at room temperature. The selection was performed in 1X SHMCK buffer, pH 7.4 (20mM Hepes pH 7.4, 120mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 1mM MgCl\n2\n, 1mM CaCl\n2\n). RNA:PDGF-AA complexes and free RNA molecules were separated using 0.45um nitrocellulose spin columns from Schleicher & Schuell (Keene, NH). The column was pre-washed with 1 ml 1X SHMCK, and then the RNA:protein-containing solution was added to the column and spun in a centrifuge at 1500g for 2 min. Buffer washes were performed to remove nonspecific binders from the filters (\nRound\n 1, 2 x 500 ÂµL 1X SHMCK; in later rounds, more stringent washes (increased number of washes and volume) were used to enrich for specific binders, then the RNA:protein complexes attached to the filters were eluted with 2x200ul washes (2 x100 ÂµL washes in later rounds) of elution buffer (7M urea, 100 mM sodium acetate, 3mM EDTA, pre-heated to 95 Â°C). The eluted RNA was phenol:chloroform extracted, then precipitated (40 Âµg glycogen, 1 volume isopropanol). The RNA was reverse transcribed with the ThermoScript RT-PCRâ¢ system according to their instructions, using the primers KMT.108.38.C (5' TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAAAAGCGAATCATACACAAGA 3') (SEQ ID NO: 75) and KMT.108.38.D (5' TTCTCGGTTGGTCTCTGGCGGAGC 3') (SEQ ID NO: 76), followed by amplification by PCR (20mM Tris pH 8.4, 50mM KCl, 2mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.5ÂµM KMT.108.38.C, 0.5ÂµM KMT.108.38.D, 0.5mM each dNTP, 0.05 units/ÂµL Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs)). The PCR template was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Templates were transcribed using Î±\n32\nP ATP body labeling overnight at 37Â°C (4% PEG-8000, 40 mM Tris pH 8.0, 12 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM spermidine, 0.002 % Triton x-100, 3 mM 2'OH purines, 3mM 2'F pyrimidines, 25mM DTT, inorganic pyrophosphatase, T7 Y639F single mutant RNA polymerase, 5uCi Î±\n32\nP ATP). The reactions were desalted using Bio Spin columns (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubsequent rounds were repeated using the same method as for \nround\n 1, but with the addition of a negative selection step. Prior to incubation with protein target, the pool RNA was passed through 0.45 micron nitrocellulose to remove filter binding sequences, then the filtrate was carried on into the positive selection step. In alternating rounds, the pool RNA was gel purified. Transcription reactions were quenched with 50 mM EDTA and ethanol precipitated then purified on a 1.5 mm denaturing polyacrylamide gels (8 M urea, 10% acrylamide; 19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). Pool RNA was removed from the gel by electroelution in an ElutrapÂ® apparatus (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) at 225V for 1 hour in 1X TBE (90 mM Tris, 90 mM boric acid, 0.2 mM EDTA). The eluted material was precipitated by the addition of 300mM sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe RNA remained in excess of the protein throughout the selection (~1 ÂµM RNA). The protein concentration was 500 nM for the first 4 rounds, and then was dropped gradually over the successive rounds. Competitor tRNA was added to the binding reactions at 0.1 mg/mL starting at \nRound\n 2. A total of 11 rounds were completed, with binding assays performed at select rounds. Table 12 contains the selection details including pool RNA concentration, protein concentration, and tRNA concentration used for each round. Elution values (ratio of CPM values of protein-bound RNA versus total RNA flowing through the filter column) along with binding assays were used to monitor selection progress.\n\n \n \nTable 12.\n Conditions used for PDGF-AA (human short form) selection\n \n \n \n \nsfh-PDGFAA\n \n \n \n \n \nRound #\n \n \n \nRNA pool conc (uM)\n \n \n \nprotein type\n \n \n \nprotein conc (uM)\n \n \n \ntRNA conc (mg/mL)\n \n \n \nneg\n \n \n \n%elution\n \n \n \n \nPCR cycle #\n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n3.3\n \nsfhPDGFAA\n \n0.5\n \n0\n \nnone\n \n0.92\n \n8\n \n \n \n2\n \n-1\n \nsfhPDGFAA\n \n0.5\n \n0.1\n \nNC\n \n0.24\n \n15\n \n \n \n3\n \n-1\n \nsfhPDGFAA\n \n0.5\n \n0.1\n \nNC\n \n0.46\n \n12\n \n \n \n4\n \n-1\n \nsfhPDGFAA\n \n0.5\n \n0.1\n \nNC\n \n0.1\n \n15\n \n \n \n5\n \n1\n \nsfhPDGFAA\n \n0.4\n \n0.1\n \nNC\n \n1.39\n \n10\n \n \n \n6\n \n-1\n \nsfhPDGFAA\n \n0.4\n \n0.1\n \nNC\n \n0.5\n \n8\n \n \n \n7\n \n1\n \nsfhPDGFAA\n \n0.3\n \n0.1\n \nNC\n \n1.23\n \n8\n \n \n \n8\n \n-1\n \nsfhPDGFAA\n \n0.3\n \n0.1\n \nNC\n \n0.44\n \n10\n \n \n \n9\n \n1\n \nsfhPDGFAA\n \n0.3\n \n0.1\n \nNC\n \n5.05\n \n8\n \n \n \n10\n \n-1\n \nsfhPDGFAA\n \n0.2\n \n0.1\n \nNC\n \n0.83\n \n10\n \n \n \n11\n \n1\n \nsfhPDGFAA\n \n0.2\n \n0.1\n \nNC\n \n4.32\n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nProtein Binding Analysis\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDot blot binding assays were performed throughout the selection to monitor the protein binding affinity of the pool. Trace \n32\nP-labeled RNA was combined with PDGF-AA and incubated at room temperature for 30min in 1X SHMCK plus 0.1mg/ml tRNA for a final volume of 20 Âµl. The reaction was added to a dot blot apparatus (Schleicher and Schuell Minifold-1 Dot Blot, Acrylic), assembled (from top to bottom) with nitrocellulose, nylon, and gel blot membranes. RNA that is bound to protein is captured on the nitrocellulose filter, whereas the non-protein bound RNA is captured on the nylon filter. When a significant positive ratio of binding ofRNA in the presence of PDGF-AA versus in the absence of PDGF-AA was seen, the pool was cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The \nRound\n 10 pool template was cloned, and 17 sequences were obtained. Only five different sequences were seen, with two major families and one unique sequence (not of the two families). For K\nd\n determination, the clone RNA transcripts were 5'end labeled with Î³-\n32\nP ATP. K\nd\n values were determined using the dot blot assay and fitting an equation describing a 1:1 RNA:protein complex to the resulting data (Kaleidagraph, \nFigures 25A and 25B\n). Results of protein binding characterization are tabulated in Table 13.

Beginning on day five after implantation, five mice were treated for seven days, intraperitoneally, as follows: five mice were treated with vehicle (saline) once daily, five mice were treated with the aptamer ARC308 at 50 mg/kg, once daily, and five mice were treated with the aptamer ARC594 at 50mg/kg, once daily. ARC308 is also referred to herein as AX101 and ARC594 is also referred to herein as AX102. At the end of the seven day period, the mice were anesthetized, and the following tissues were fixed by vascular perfusion with 1% paraformaldehyde, removed and frozen for cryotstat sectioning: tumor (Lewis lung carcinoma), pancreas, liver, kidney, trachea, spleen, jejunum, and thyroid tissue.

However, when the tumors were treated for 7 days with ARC594, the number of tumor vessels was reduced by ~ 60%, and the pericyte coverage of the surviving tumor vessels was reduced to 5-19%. These findings indicate that most tumors vessels surviving PDGF-B aptamer treatment lack pericytes. However, a certain fraction of tumor vessels were lined with pericytes exhibiting a \"normalized\" phenotype with respect to pericyte-endothelial cell interactions. Of the surviving tumor vessels enveloped by pericytes were normalized in the sense that the pericytes are more closely associated with endothelial cells than in untreated tumors. This effect of ARC594 is very different from the effect of VEGF signaling inhibitors, where most surviving tumor vessels are covered by pericytes. The data presented herein indicate that treatment of solid tumors with anti-PDGF-B agents such as ARC594 results in the survival of at least two types of tumor vessels, 1) those with little to no pericytes attached to or lining the vessel wall, and 2) those that exhibit a more normalized phenotype with more tightly associated pericytes. These results suggest that the use of anti-PDGF-B agents, such as ARC594, may alter the tumor vasculature thereby rendering the remaining vessels more susceptible to treatment with a combination of agents such as anti-VEGF, anti-vascular agents, other anti-angiogenic agents or cytotoxic agents. Thus, combination therapy a PDGF aptamer (\ne.g\n., PDGF-B) in combination with known cancer therapies is an effective method for treating a variety of solid tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImages of aptamer treated Lewis Lung Carcinoma suggest that pericytes are not uniformly distributed on surviving tumor vessels. The remaining vessels appear to lack pericyte coverage (most common) or appear to have heavy pericyte coverage (less common).\n\n\n \n\n\nCD31 and NG2 colocalization on individual tumor vessels\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n20-Âµm sections of Lewis lung carcinomas treated with either vehicle or ARC594 were stained with anti-CD31 and anti-NG2 antibodies. The extent of pericyte colocalization with endothelial cells was measured on digital CoolCam images. Individual vessels were examined in the images to determine the distribution of vessels covered in pericytes or void of pericytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA threshold value of 40-50 was determined to most accurately represent the area densities of CD31 and NG2 in Lewis lung carcinoma (the sections were 20 Âµm thick). The results are depicted in the graph of \nFigure 35\n and summarized in Table 24 below.

At the end of the seven day period, each of the mice was anesthetized, and the following tissues were fixed by vascular perfusion, removed and frozen for cryotstat sectioning: tumor (Lewis lung carcinoma), pancreas, liver, kidney, trachea, spleen, jejunum, heart, brain and thyroid.

After treatment with 10mg/kg of ARC594, the number of tumor vessels was reduced by â¼ 40% and the pericyte coverage was reduced to 12-16%. While not wishing to be bound by any theory, these findings indicate that ARC594 first reduces the number of pericytes leaving the remaining blood vessels either bare or with reduced pericyte coverage and secondarily reduces the number of blood vessels, likely through the reduction of supporting pericytes and basement membrane cells stroma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the lowest dose, surviving tumor vessels enveloped by pericytes were normalized in the sense that the pericytes were more closely associated with endothelial cells than in untreated tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe findings from the dose-response study confirm that ARC594 acts at multiple levels. While not wishing to be bound by any theory, these results provide strong evidence that the primary action of ARC594 results in reduction in number of pericytes, (whose function is to support the capillary network supplied blood and nutrients to the tumor). Again, while not wishing to be bound by any theory, the reduction in blood vessels could be indirect through the PDGF-B aptamer dependent blockade of tumor pericyte-derived and tumor stroma-derived growth factors such as VEGF.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 17A: ARC:594 Short Time-Course in Lewis Lung Carcinoma Model\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA 1-mm\n3\n piece of Lewis lung carcinoma was implanted under the dorsal skin of wild-type C57BL/6 mice, and then beginning on \nday\n 6, treated for 7 days with vehicle or 50mg/kg of ARC594, according to the following protocol:\n\n \n \n \nn= 4 mice treated with vehicle (saline i.p., once daily) for 7 days,\n \nn= 4 mice treated with ARC594 (50 mg/kg, i.p., once daily) for 1 day,\n \nn= 4 mice treated with ARC594 (50 mg/kg, i.p., once daily) for 2 days,\n \nn= 4 mice treated with ARC594 (50 mg/kg, i.p., once daily) for 4 days,\n \nn= 4 mice treated with ARC594 (50 mg/kg, i.p., once daily) for 7 days.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAt the end of each treatment, each group of mice was perfused and Lewis lung carcinoma and different organs were collected. 80 Âµm sections of Lewis lung carcinomas were cut and stained with antibodies to various markers as described below. Finally, the blood vessel and pericyte area density was determined using the Cool Cam.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA threshold value of 30-50 was determined to most accurately represent the area density of CD31, Î±-SMA, and NG2 immunoreactivities in 80-Âµm sections of Lewis lung carcinoma. The results are presented in the graph of \nFigure 39\n and are summarized in Table 31 below. Values are mean area densities Â± S.E. (n = 3-5 mice per group) expressed as % of mean value for vehicle. The significance of differences between groups was assessed using ANOVA followed by Fisher's post-hoc test for multiple comparisons.\n\n \n \nTable 31:\n \n \n \n \n \nTreatment\n \n \n \nCD31 Mean\n \n \n \nCD31 SE\n \n \n \nSMA Mean\n \n \n \nSMA SE\n \n \n \nNG2 Mean\n \n \n \nNG2 SE\n \n \n \nCount\n \n \n \n \n \n \nVehicle\n \n \n100.00\n \n3.85\n \n100.00\n \n5.34\n \n100.00\n \n6.86\n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \nARC594\n 1 day\n \n \n102.77\n \n5.39\n \n63.83\n \n9.14\n \n34.83\n \n4.72\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \nARC594\n 2 days\n \n \n100.41\n \n7.36\n \n40.64\n \n1.96\n \n29.92\n \n0.83\n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \nARC594\n 4 days\n \n \n79.75\n \n4.02\n \n39.80\n \n5.96\n \n17.73\n \n1.83\n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \nARC594\n 7 days\n \n \n55.17\n \n3.55\n \n13.64\n \n3.90\n \n11.64\n \n0.27\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese data indicate that after one day of treatment with ARC594 (50mg/kg), pericytes were reduced by 36% for Î±-SMA-positive and by 66% for NG2. After 7 days of treatment they are reduced even farther (86%-89% total decrease). In contrast, CD31 area density is not significantly unchanged until after 4 days of treatment with ARC594. While not wishing to be bound by any theory these results provide strong evidence that the primary effect of ARC594 is on the pericytes while secondary effects reduce endothelial cells through a reduction in pericyte-derived VEGF. Hence, under these conditions of PDGF-B treatment the net effect is to reduce the abundance of pericytes thereby directly reducing the source of host-derived VEGF which in turn causes a net reduction in the abundance of tumor endothelial cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a similar study, Lewis lung carcinomas treated with vehicle or ARC594 for seven days were also stained for detection of a total of 4 pericyte markers: Î±-SMA, NG2 , PDGFR-Î², and desmin. Under baseline conditions, pericytes expressed all 4 markers. Specifically, Î±-SMA area density was 10.0%, NG2 was 14.9%, PDGFR-Î² was 14.0%, and desmin was 9.0%. Compared to the vehicle-treated Lewis lung carcinoma, ARC594 treatment for 1 day caused a reduction in all 4 pericyte markers (\nFigure 40\n). Although there was a significant reduction in all 4 markers after one day of ARC564 treatment, reductions in Î±-SMA (45.4 Â± 7.8%) and NG2 (69.8 Â± 4.2%) were greater than PDGF-Î² (31.3 Â± 2.8%) and desmin (25.7 Â± 16.0%: \nFigure 40\n). While not wishing to be bound by any theory, this unequal reduction in pericyte markers may indicate that while some pericytes are lost, the remaining pericytes have changed their phenotype by changing their expression markers. After 7 days of ARC594 treatment, however, all 4 pericyte markers were reduced by 70-80% (\nFigure 40\n), thus leaving tumor blood vessels bare of pericytes by 7 days. Confocal imaging confirmed these results.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 17B:ARC594 Long Time-Course in Lewis Lung Carcinoma Model\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA 1-mm\n3\n piece of Lewis lung carcinoma was implanted under the dorsal skin of wild-type C57BL/6 mice (day 0). Beginning on \nday\n 6, mice were treated for 7-14-28 days with vehicle or 50mg/kg of ARC594, according to the following protocol:\n\n \n \n \nn= 5 mice treated with vehicle (saline i.p., once daily) for 7 days,\n \nn= 5 mice treated with ARC594 (50 mg/kg, i.p., once daily) for 7 days,\n \nn= 6 mice treated with vehicle (saline i.p., once daily) for 14 days,\n \nn= 6 mice treated with ARC594 (50 mg/kg, i.p., once daily) for 14 days,\n \nn= 6 mice treated with vehicle (saline i.p., once daily) for 28 days,\n \nn= 6 mice treated with ARC594 (50 mg/kg, i.p., once daily) for 28 days.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nDuring the treatment, the mice were weighed daily and the tumor size was monitored. Tumor size was measured with calipers every other day during treatment. Tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: Tumor Volume = (0.52*Width^2)*Length. Tumors were also weighed at the end of the experiment.\n\n\n \n\n\nTumor and Mouse Growth\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTumor growth (as represented by tumor volume) during treatment is depicted in \nFigure 41\n. Tumor weight during treatment is depicted in \nFigure 42\n. Mouse growth during treatment is shown in \nFigure 43\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment with ARC594 did not affect the tumor size of Lewis lung carcinoma: the growth curves for the tumors treated with ARC594 (50mg/kg) and vehicle are the same. In addition, there was no significant difference in the tumor weights measured at the end of the experiment. Mice treated with ARC594, however, appeared to gain more weight in the third and fourth week of treatment.\n\n\n \n\n\nAnti-CD31 and anti-NG2 antibody staining\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA threshold value of 40-50 was determined to most accurately represent the area density of CD31 and NG2 immunoreactivities in 80 Âµm sections of Lewis lung carcinoma.

The NG2 area density of Lewis lung carcinoma treated with vehicle remained about the same after \n \n \nweeks\n \n \n 1, 2 and 3 of treatment while it increased somewhat after \nweek\n 4 treatment. This difference was only statistically significant when compared to \nweek\n 2 and \nweek\n 4 time points.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Lewis lung carcinoma treated with ARC594 (50mg/kg), CD31 area density decreased 40% compared to vehicle after one week, 60% after two weeks, stayed the same after three weeks and decreased 85% after four weeks. In Lewis lung carcinoma treated with ARC594, NG2 area density decreased 80% after one week and thereafter remained almost the same. These data show that ARC594 treatment reduces NG2 area density faster than CD31 area density.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a similar study, sections of Lewis lung carcinoma that had been treated with ARC594 for 28 days was stained with anti-CD31 and anit-PDGFR-beta antibodies. While ARC594 treatment caused an immediate reduction of pericytes after 1 day of treatment, tumor vessel area density was unchanged. Additional treatment, however, revealed that there was an observed reduction in tumor vessels at 7 days - a trend that continued for the 28 days of treatment. Quantification of the CD31 area density revealed that after 4 days of treatment, tumor blood vessels were significantly reduced by 31.3 % compared to the vehicle-treated mice (\nFigure 45\n). The tumor vessels were progressively reduced by 46.5% after 7 days of treatment and 79.9% after 28 days of treatment (\nFigure 45\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 45\n illustrates further reduction in tumor vessels, but not in PDGFR-beta-positive pericytes with additional ARC594 treatment for 28 days. Tumor vessels of vehicle treated mice were 48.6% covered by pericytes, while the remaining vessels after ARC594 treatment for 7 days were only 19.1% covered by pericytes (\nFigure 46\n). After ARC594 treatment for 28 days, which further reduces the tumor vessels, the remaining tumor blood vessels were 40.1% covered by pericytes (\nFigure 46\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrevious results indicated that bare blood vessels were the ones affected by treatment with ARC594 for 28 days. To determine whether the vessels affected were the ones lacking pericytes, the distribution of CD31 and PDGFR-beta on individual vessels was examined. In the vehicle treated LLC, most of the vessels are covered by pericytes with the majority of the vessels falling between 40% and 90% coverage (\nFigure 47\n). After 7 days of treatment, fewer vessels survived and the remaining vessels were covered by few or no pericytes (<40% coverage; \nFigure 47\n). Additional ARC594 treatment for 28 days led to even further reductions in tumor vessels. These remaining vessels, however, lost the population of bare vessels seen after 7 days of treatment and in fact had an equal distribution of pericyte coverage (\nFigure 47\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhether the reduction in pericytes caused by ARC594 had an effect on vessel diameter was investigated. Vehicle-treated LLC had tumor blood vessels with a diameter of 12.8Âµm. Treatment with ARC594, however, increased the diameter at 4 days (\nFigure 48\n) and was further increased at 14 days (\nFigure 48\n). Additional treatment after 14 days, however, caused tumor vessels to decrease in diameter as shown on \n \ndays\n \n 21 and 28. (\nFigure 48\n)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a similar experiment, whether ARC594 treatment affected the basement membrane was investigated. In vehicle treated Lewis lung carcinoma, CD31-positive vessels were enveloped by type IV collagen. ARC594 did not change the total amount of collagen IV after 1 day of treatment, when pericyte number began to decrease; or after 4 days of treatment, when blood vessel number started to decrease. However after 7 days of treatment, the vascular basement membrane gradually started to decrease, reaching the greatest reduction after 28 days Indeed, type IV collagen area density was reduced by 20% at \nday\n 7, and by 50% at day 28 (\nFigure 49\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a similar experiment, changes in vascular basement membrane were also analyzed by using two other markers for basement membrane components: nidogen and laminin. Double staining with type IV collagen, or laminin, and nidogen showed that these markers have the same immunoreactivity and the vascular basement membrane was positive for all the three of them. Analysis of the area density showed that nidogen and laminin were reduced in the same manner as type IV collagen (\nFigure 50\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 18: ARC594 Dose-Response Long Time Course in Lewis Lung Carcinoma\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA 1 mm\n3\n piece of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) was implanted under the dorsal skin of 9 to 10-week old C57BL/6 mice. Treatment began 4-6 days thereafter. The aptamer ARC594 (2, 10, or 50 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline) was injected ip daily for up to 28 days. In addition, the scrambled aptamer ARC128 (also referred to herein is AX 104) (50 mg/kg), which contains the same nucleotides as ARC594 but in a random order, was used to determine the specificity of ARC594. At the end of the treatment mice were anesthetized, prefused with fixative and tissue was collected from each mouse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor staining the endothelial cells of tumor vessels, 80-Âµm thick cryostat sections of Lewis lung carcinoma were stained with anti-CD31 antibody (clone 2H8 Chemicon). For pericytes, sections were stained with one or more of four antibodies: Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA, \nclone\n 1 A4, Sigma Chemical Co.), NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (AB5320, Chemicon), PDGFR-Î² (clone APB5, from Akiyoshi Uemura, Kyoto University, Japan), and desmin (DAKO).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCD31 and pericyte marker area densities (proportion of sectional area) were measured by fluorescence microscopy in images acquired at 10X. Transmission electron microscopy of 50-100 nm sections were stained with lead citrate and examined with a Zeiss EM-10 electron microscope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPericyte coverage was measured on 20 Âµm sections stained with CD31 and a pericyte marker (Î±-SMA, NG2, PDGFR-Î², and desmin). Images of each marker were captured separately and analyzed by Image J: After determining the threshold of each channel, the images were merged and the colocalized pixels were measured. The area density was determined as the proportion of colocalized pixels to CD31 positive pixels.\n\n\n \n\n\nAnti-Î±-SMA\n\n\nantibody staining\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTumors treated with ARC594 (50mg/kg), scrambled aptamer (50 mg/kg) or vehicle for up to 7 days were sectioned and stained with anti-Î±-SMA antibodies. As shown in \nFigure 51\n, A RC594, descreased the Î±-SMA immunoreactive pericytes in a dose-response fashion. \nFigure 52\n shows that ARC594 (50 mg/kg) reduced pericytes after only one day of treatment. Confocal images show that scrambled aptamer did not affect the tumor vasculature.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 19: Dose-Response of ARC594 in RIP Tag2 Model\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n9 week old RIP-Tag2 positive mice were treated for 7 days with vehicle, or 2mg/kg, 10mg/kg or 50mg/kg of ARC594, according to the following protocol:\n\n \n \n \nn= 4 mice treated with vehicle (saline i.p., once daily)\n \nn= 5 mice treated with ARC594 (2 mg/kg, i.p., once daily)\n \nn= 5 mice treated with ARC594 (10 mg/kg, i.p., once daily)\n \nn= 5 mice treated with ARC594 (50 mg/kg, i.p., once daily)\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAt the end of this treatment, the mice were perfused and the liver, spleen, thyroid, trachea, kidney, jejunum, heart, brain, and pancreas were collected for each mouse. Finally, 80 Âµm sections were cut and stained for CD31, type IV collagen, PDGFR-beta, Î±-SMA, and NG2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA threshold value of 40 was determined to most accurately represent the area density of CD31, and NG2 immunoreactivities in 80-Âµm sections of RIP-Tag2 tumor. The results are depicted in \nFigure 53\n and summarized in Table 33 below. Values are mean area densities Â± S.E.

At 10mg/kg dose the reduction was higher (28%). The 50mg/kg dose had the same effect than 10mg/kg dose. ARC594 at 10mg/kg and 50 mg/kg dose induced 10% reduction in RIP-Tag2 tumor vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another study, treatment of RIPTag2 tumor with ARC594 for 7 days led to a reduction in pericytes and this reduction was greater after 28 days. The untreated RIP-Tag2 tumors are highly vascularized. ARC594 treatment caused a regression of blood vessels (CD31 area density) and this decrease was time-dependent; the blood vessels started to regress after 7 days of treatment. Prolongation of treatment to 28 days resulted in a greater reduction in blood vessels. Measurements showed that 7-day treatment with ARC594 decreased, Î±-SMA and CD31 immunoreactivity by 27.2% and 12.3%, respectively. After 14 days Î±-SMA and CD31 immunoreactivity were reduced by 45.8% and by 26.6%, respectively. After 28 days Î±-SMA and CD31 immunoreactivity were reduced by 45.5% and by 38.1%, respectively (\nFigure 54\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPericytes in RIP-Tag2 tumors were loosely associated with the endothelium. As seen in the Lewis lung carcinoma model, after ARC594 treatment the surviving pericytes were tightly associated with the blood vessels, indicating that in this tumor model PDGF-B inhibition induced phenotypic changes of pericytes.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 20: Pharmacokinetic Analysis of ARC594 in Mice.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the pharmakokinetic studies described herein,\n all mass based concentration data refers only to the molecular weight of the oligonucleotide portion of the aptamer, irrespective of the mass conferred by PEG conjugation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach dose group consisted of 3 mice that were terminally sacrificed at each time point for collection of plasma. The aptamer was formulated for injection from a lyophilized powder to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL (oligonucleotide weight) in standard 0.9% saline and sterile-filtered (0.2 Âµm) prior to dosing. The route of administration used was a single intravenous bolus injection via the tail vein at a dose of 10 mg/kg. At specified time points, t=pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 48 hours, blood samples were obtained from the jugular vein catheters, transferred directly to EDTA-coated tubes, mixed by inversion, and placed on wet ice. Plasma was harvested by centrifugation of blood-EDTA tubes at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes. Plasma samples were stored at -80Â° C until the time of analysis. Analysis of plasma samples for aptamer concentration was accomplished using a homogeneous assay format utilizing the direct addition of plasma aliquots to assay wells containing the commercially available fluorescent nucleic acid detection reagent Oligreenâ¢. After a brief incubation period (5 min) at room temperature, protected from light, the assay plates were read by a fluorescence plate reader.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fluorescence signal from each well was proportional to the concentration of aptamer in the well, and sample concentrations were calculated by interpolation of fluorescence values from a fluorescence-concentration standard curve (mean values from duplicate curves). Mean plasma concentrations were obtained at each time point from the three animals in each group. Plasma concentration versus time data appeared was subjected to noncompartmental analysis (NCA) using the industry standard pharmacokinetic modeling software WinNonLinâ¢ v.4.0. Estimates were obtained for the following primary pharmacokinetic parameters: maximum plasma concentration, C\nmax\n; area under the concentration-time curve, AUC; terminal half-life, t\n1/2\n; terminal clearance, Cl; and volume of distribution at steady state, V\nss\n. Mean plasma concentration versus time data appeared to be monophasic over the entire timecourse studied (0-48 hrs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe competitive binding assay previously described was used to determine the \nin vitro\n binding affinity and selectivity of ARC594 for different PDGF isoforms. Different concentrations of unlabeled, competitor aptamer were titrated in separate reactions against a fixed (<0.1 nM) amount of \n32\nP-radiolabeled ARC594 in buffer containing a fixed amount (0.1 nM) of the aptamer's cognate target (PDGF-BB; PeproTech): UnPEGylated version of ARC594 was radiolabeled at the 5' terminus by incubation with Î³-\n32\nP-ATP (ICN) and polynucleotide kinase (NEB). Binding reactions were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline (Cellgro) containing 0.2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (NEB) and 0.02 mg/mL tRNA (Sigma). The reactions were equilibrated for a period of 15-30 minutes at room temperature, then filtered through a sandwich of nitrocellulose (Protran membrane, Perkin-Elmer) and nylon (Hybond membrane, Amersham) membranes to separate target bound aptamer from free aptamer. Subsequent autoradiographic analysis of the filter membranes corresponding to each concentration of unlabeled aptamer revealed the extent of competitive displacement of \n32\nP-ARC594 by unlabeled aptamer. The data was expressed as the ratio of the counts per minute (CPM) of radioactivity due to \n32\nP-ARC594 bound to PDGF BB on the nitrocellulose membrane (CPM\nnitrocellulose\n or CPM\nnc\n) over the total CPM (CPM\ntotal\n= CPM\nnitrocellulose\n + CPM\nnylon\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf the different PDGF ligands, ARC594 had the highest affinity for PDGF-BB (K\nd\n = 0.09 Â± 0.02 nM) and PDGF-AB (K\nd\n = 0.10 Â± 0.01 nM), but not PDGF-AA (K\nd\n = 2.6 Â± 0.2 nM (\nFigure 55\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a secondary test of both the plasma pharmacokinetics and the \nin vivo\n bioactivity of ARC594 the competition binding assay was used to assay the same plasma samples used to generate the pharmacokinetic data. Serial 1:10 dilutions of plasma sample were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (1X PBS) and mixed with a fixed concentration of \n32\nP-ARC594, then added to human PDGF-BB. The final concentration of PDGF in each assay was 0.1 nM, and the final concentration of \n32\nP-ARC594 < 0.1 nM. In this experiment, the plasma samples were analyzed by comparison with a standard curve generated with samples of known ARC594 concentrations in 1X PBS. By comparison with the reference standards, the effective concentration of active aptamer in each plasma sample could be calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of this study indicate that at 10 mg/kg-dose of ARC594 has a half-life of approximately 4 hours (\nFigures 56A and 56B\n), and the pharmacodynamic profile is in accordance with its pharmacokinetic data (\nFigure 57\n). The bioactivity profile of this \nex vivo\n analysis, shown in \nFigure 57\n, provides verification that (1) the aptamer was present and active in the plasma of the mouse model at t=48 hrs post-dose; and (2) the plasma concentrations calculated from the fluorescence-based pharmacokinetic assay were correct.\n\n\n \nSEQUENCE LISTING\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n<110> Archemix Corp., et

Description\n\n\n\n\n INHIBITORS OF CATECHOL O-METHYL TRANSFERASE AND THEIR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The symptoms of schizophrenia are generally divided into three categories; \n\n\npositive, negative and cognitive. Positive symptoms include hallucinations, delusions and disorganized behavior while negative symptoms are characterized by a lack of pleasure and/or interest in life. Cognitive deficit includes difficulties in the organization of thoughts and prioritization of tasks. Patients with bipolar disorder generally display circular mood changes ranging from severe depression to severe mania with or without psychotic features. \n\n\nSchizophrenia and bipolar disorder are among the most severe forms of psychiatric disorders that elicit overlapping cognitive deficits (Tasman et al., Psychiatry, West Sussex, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Second Edition, Volume 1, 2003, pp254-272; and Sadock and Sadock, Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 7 ed., Vol. 1, 2005, Philadelphia, Pa.; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, pp 236-272 and 1330-1395) and they tend to be chronic/progressive. In contrast to positive symptoms, the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are thought to have a greater impact on long-term disability, treatment outcome and functional recovery (Addington and Addington, 1993; Green, 1996). Dissatisfaction with therapy is attributed to lack of efficacy or intolerable and unacceptable side affects. The side effects have been associated with significant metabolic, extrapyramidal, prolactic and cardiac adverse events. See, Lieberman et al. N. Engl. J. Med. (2005) 353:1209-1223. \n\n\n While multiple pathways are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia leading to negative and cognitive symptoms, much attention has focused on reduced dopamine neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (Weinberger, 1987; Weinberger et al., 1988; Akil et al., 1999). Evidence for reduced dopamine neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex is supported by reduced regional cerebral blood flow or hypoactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia patients (Weinberger et al., 1988; Daniel et al., 1991; Okubo et al., 1997; Abi-Dargham et al., 2002). Schizophrenia related prefrontal deficits, independent from treatment or psychotic state, have been correlated with poor performance in tasks of executive function (e.g. n-back or Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) that evaluate prefrontal engagement (Weinberger et al., 1986, 1988; Carter et al., 1998; Callicott et al., 2000; Barch et al., 2001). In addition to deficits in executive function, reduced dopamine neurotransmission in the prefrontal \n\n cortex is involved in several brain activities including; attention, hedonic activities, natural rewards, and biologic activities such as cell signaling. Therefore, a compound which selectively enhances dopamine neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of cognitive and negative symptoms. \n\n\n Dopamine levels in the brain are determined by biosynthesis and release, as well as its rate of diffusion, reuptake, and degradation. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), is an important enzyme involved in the breakdown of dopamine in the cortex. COMT converts dopamine to 3-methoxytyramine and the dopamine metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) to homovanillic acid (HVA) (Boulton and Eisenhofer, 1998). In fact, COMT acts on a variety of biogenic catecholamines as well as catecholestrogens, dietary phytochemicals and ascorbic acid. In subcortical structures (e.g. striatum), dopaminergic signalling is primarily regulated by removal of dopamine from the synaptic cleft via rapid uptake by the dopamine transporter (DAT) and/or norepinephrine transporter (NET). Regulation of dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex is markedly different. DAT is less densely expressed in synapses within the prefrontal cortex where dopamine is eliminated by uptake through the NET, diffusion, or metabolism by COMT and monoamine oxidase (Mazei et al., 2002; Moron et al, 2002; Lewis et al, 2001 ; Sesack et al, 1998; Smiley et al., 1994). COMT inhibitors would therefore be predicted to selectively increase cortical dopaminergic signaling and thereby improve cognitive function. \n\n\n The COMT gene is located in the chromosome 22ql 1.21 region which has been linked to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, ADHD and substance dependency (Williams, et al. 2003 and Takahashi et al, 2003). There are two major isoforms of COMT, membrane-bound COMT (MB-COMT) is the predominant form involved in the degradation of synaptic frontal lobe dopamine in human brain (Lachman et al., Pharmacogenetics (1996). 6(3):243-250). The other form is soluble COMT (S-COMT) which is transcribed from a different promoter than MB-COMT and is otherwise identical to human MB-COMT minus 50 amino acids at the N- terminus of the protein. In humans, COMT activity is modulated by a single nucleotide polymorphism at Vall58Met (MB-COMT). Due to differences in enzyme thermostability, homozygous Met carriers have lower COMT activity, heterozygotes exhibit intermediate activity and homozygous Val carriers have greater enzyme activity (Chen et al., 2004). Despite the differences observed in activity based on genotype, only a modest relationship between \n\n Vall58Met genotype and cognitive performance has been demonstrated by meta-analysis in normal individuals, while no effect was observed in schizophrenia. Based on an inverted-U relationship thought to exist between dopamine receptor activation and prefrontal cortical functioning, these findings might be reconciled with the fact that disease state, along with multiple environmental and genetic factors, contribute to prefrontal efficiency and dopamine levels (reviewed in Tunbridge et al., Biol Psych, 2006). \n\n\n Although clozapine, Zyprexa, Risperdal and other anti-psychotic drugs have been useful for the treatment of positive and arguably the negative symptoms of schizoplirenia and bipolar disorder, they have not been free from side effects such as agranulocytosis, sedation, weight gain, hyper-lipidemia and hyperglycemia, all of which limit their applications (Tasman et at, 2003; Sadock and Sadock 2005). Thus, there remains a need for medications that effectively treat negative symptoms and cognitive deficit, have no major side effects, and are effective in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, substance dependency, and \n\n\nADD/ADHD, etc. Such medications might also be used to reduce such symptoms when they occur as part of another psychiatric syndrome or when they are incidental to a neurological disorder. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention relates to 2-pyridinone compounds which are inhibitors of catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme, and are useful in the treatment and prevention of neurological and psychiatric disorders and diseases in which COMT is involved. \n\n\nThe present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and the use of these compounds and compositions in the prevention or treatment of such diseases in which COMT enzyme is involved. The present invention further relates to a method of treating symptoms associated with a psychiatric disorder, comprising administration of a pharmacologically effective dose of a composition comprising a 2-pyridinone COMT inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a patient. \n\n\nStill, the present invention relates to improving negative symptoms and cognitive deficit associated with schizophrenia, augmentation of the effects of anti-psychotics in treatment of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, in treatment of major depression, the depressive phase of \n\n bipolar disorder, DA deficiency-related diseases such as ADD/ADHD, and substance dependency (combat cravings associated with and/or addictions to abuse of alcohol, opiates, cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines, tobacco). The present invention also relates to a method for the treatment of tobacco addiction and the weight gain/food cravings associated with quitting smoking or the use of antipsychotics. \n\n\nThe present invention also relates to a method of enhancing cognition in head injuries and dementias. \n\n\n These and other aspects of the invention will be realized upon closer inspection of the specification as a whole. \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention relates to novel COMT inhibitors of formula I \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I \n\n\nincluding tautomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts and individual enantiomers and diastereomers thereof wherein: \n\n\nY represents hydrogen, CN, C2-6 alkynyl, (CH2)\nn\nC5-10 heterocyclyl, (CH2)\nn\nC6-10 aryl, said alkynyl, heterocyclyl and aryl optionally substituted with 1 to 3 groups of R\na\n; \n\n\nX, Î§Ï, and R independently represent hydrogen, halo, CN, Ci_6 alkyl, C2-6 alkynyl, (CH2)\nn\nC6- 10 aryl, (CH2)n s-i0 heterocyclyl, said alkyl, heterocyclyl, and aryl optionally substituted with 1 to 3 groups of R\na\n; R2 represents H, OH, Ci_6 alkyl, N(CH\n3\n)2, (CH2)\nn\nC3-10 cycloalkyl, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nC5-10 \n\n\nheterocyclyl, (CH2)nC6_io aryl, said aryl and heterocyclyl optionally substituted with 1 to 3 groups of R\na\n; \n\n Ra represents Ci-6 alkyl, halogen, hydroxyl, C2-4alkynyl, (CH2)nCF3, OCHF2, OCF3, C3-6 cycloalkyl, NR2C(0)R2, C(0)N(R2)2, C(R2)\n2\n0R2, C(0)R2, NO2, CN, N(R2)\n2\n, \n\n\n(CH\n2\n)nC(0)OR2\n?\n S0\n2\nR2, NHS0\n2\nR2, OR2, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nC5-10 heterocyclyl, C(O)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nC\n5\n-10 heterocyclyl, (CH2)nC6-10 a yl? \nor\n C(O)(CH2)nC6-10 sty said alkyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl and aryl optionally substituted with 1 to 3 groups of Rb; \n\n\nRb represents Ci-6 alkyl, halogen, CHF2, OCHF2, -0-, N(R2)2, CH2OH, (CH2)nC6-10 aryl, (CH2)n 5-10 heterocyclyl, OR\n2\n, C3_6cycloalkyl, (CH2)nCF3,or CN; and n represents 0 to 5. \n\n\n An embodiment of the present invention is realized when Y is (CH2)nC6-10 aryk and all other variables are as origmally described.

In addition to the treatment of warm- blooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, cats, monkeys, etc., the compounds of the invention are effective for use in humans. The terms \"administration of and or \"administering a\" compound should be understood to mean providing a compound of the invention or a prodrug of a compound of the invention to the individual in need of treatment. \n\n\n Further, it is understood that compounds of this invention can be administered at prophylactically effective dosage levels to prevent the above-recited conditions and disorders, as well as to prevent other conditions and disorders associated with calcium channel activity. \n\n\n The term \"composition\" as used herein is intended to encompass a product comprising specified ingredients in predetermined amounts or proportions, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. Such term in relation to pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the mgredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. In general, pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active object compound is included in an amount sufficient to \n\n produce the desired effect upon the process or condition of diseases. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by mixing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide \n\n\npharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. Compositions for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients are mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions, oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, oil-in-water emulsions, and sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension may be prepared by standard methods known in the art. By \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. \n\n\n The subject compounds are further useful in a method for the prevention, treatment, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of the diseases, disorders and conditions noted herein. The dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be varied, however, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The active ingredient may be administered to patients (animals and human) in need of such treatment in dosages that will provide optimal pharmaceutical efficacy. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment. The dose will vary from patient to patient depending upon the nature and severity of disease, the patient's weight, special diets then being followed by a patient, concurrent medication, and other factors which those skilled in the art will recognize. Generally, dosage levels of between 0.001 to 10 mg/kg. of body weight daily are administered to the patient, e.g., humans and elderly humans. The dosage range will generally be about 0.5 mg to 1.0 g. per patient per day which may be administered in single or multiple doses. In one embodiment, the dosage range will be about 0.5 mg to 500 mg per patient per day; in another embodiment about 0.5 mg to 200 mg per patient per day; and in yet another embodiment about 5 \n\n mg to 50 nag per patient per day. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be provided in a solid dosage formulation such as comprising about 0.5 mg to 500 mg active ingredient, or comprising about 1 mg to 250 mg active ingredient. The pharmaceutical composition may be provided in a solid dosage formulation comprising about 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg or 250 mg active ingredient. For oral administration, the compositions may be provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, such as 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 750, 800, 900, and 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, such as once or twice per day. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration may be prepared as solutions or suspensions of the active compounds in water. A suitable surfactant can be included such as, for example, hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof in oils. \n\n\nFurther, a preservative can be included to prevent the detrimental growth of microorganisms. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions. Furthermore, the compositions can be in the form of sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of such sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the fmal injectable form must be sterile and must be effectively fluid for easy syringability. The pharmaceutical compositions must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage, and thus should be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), vegetable oils, and suitable mixtures thereof. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be in a form suitable for topical use such as, for example, an aerosol, cream, ointment, lotion, and dusting powder. \n\n\nFurther, the compositions can be in a form suitable for use in transdermal devices. These formulations may be prepared, utilizing a compound represented of the invention, or \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, via conventional processing methods. As an example, a cream or ointment is prepared by mixing hydrophilic material and water, together with about 5 wt% to about 10 wt% of the compound, to produce a cream or ointment having a desired consistency. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be in a form suitable for rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid, such as, for example, where the mixture forms unit dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used in \n\n the art. The suppositories may be conveniently formed by first admixing the composition with the softened or melted carrier(s) followed by chilling and shaping in moulds. \n\n\n In addition to the aforementioned carrier ingredients, the pharmaceutical formulations described above may include, as appropriate, one or more additional carrier ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavoring agents, binders, surface-active agents, thickeners, lubricants, and preservatives (including anti-oxidants). Furthermore, other adjuvants can be included to render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. \n\n\nCompositions containing a compound of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can also be prepared in powder or liquid concentrate form.

Assays utilized purified human COMT enzyme of the Vail 58 variant (membrane-bound MB-COMT or soluble S-COMT) containing a C-terminal 6 or 10-histidine tag. Compounds of the following examples had activity in reference assays by exhibiting the ability to inhibit the methylation of esculetin and/or inhibit the production of S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH). Any compound exhibiting an IC\n5\no below 1 Î¼Î would be considered a COMT inhibitor as defined herein. \n\n\n In a typical experiment the COMT inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present invention was determined in accordance with the following experimental methods detailed below. The fluorescence assay was based on methylation of a substrate (6,7- dihydroxycoumarin or 'esculetin') by COMT to produce a highly fluorescent product (7- hydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin or 'scopoietin'). The reaction requires the presence of magnesium ions and a methyl donor, in this case S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). A 10 mM compound stock in DMSO was used to prepare 10 point 3 -fold dilution series and 1 uL of appropriate dilution was plated into assay wells (black 96 well round bottom polystyrene plates from Costar; catalog # 3792). Recombinant enzyme was diluted in assay buffer (100 mM Na\n2\nHP0\n4\n pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT, 0.005% Tween-20) and 35 was added to assay wells containing 1 Î¼Î, of compound. Preincubation of COMT enzyme and compound proceeded for 2 hours at room temperature. Enzyme assays were initiated with 5 uL of a mixture containing 40 Î¼Î SAM (USB catalog # US 10601), 4 Î¼Î esculetin (substrate) and 40 mM MgCl\n2\n. The formation of product (scopoietin) was monitored over time by fluorescence (excitation 340 ran, emission 460 ran, no lag, ÎÎÎ Îµ integration time, 5 flashes, top read) using a Tecan Safire\n2\n plate reader. Assays were monitored over time until a signal to background of 4 to 1 was achieved. Titration curves and IC50 values were calculated using standard procedures. Briefly, data were calculated as (mean of test wells) ~ (mean of no-enzyme controls)/(mean of total enzyme controls) - (mean of no-enzyme controls), then expressed as a percentage and subtracted from 100 to give percent inl ibition of COMT \n\n activity. In some cases, compounds were not preincubated with MB-COMT for 2 hours at room temperature prior to starting the enzyme assays. \n\n\n To determine ICso values in the fluorescence polarization assay, solutions of test compounds were prepared and preincubated with COMT enzyme as stated above. Enzyme reactions were initiated upon the addition of 5 Î¼Î, of an 8X mix prepared in assay buffer containing 8 Î¼Î SAM (USB catalog # US 10601), 16 Î¼Î dopamine (Sigma catalog # H8502) and 40 mM MgCl\n2\n. After 25 minutes incubation at room temperature, reactions were quenched with 5 Î¼Î 250 mM EDTA, pH 8.2. To quenched reactions, 20 xL of a preformed complex containing S-adenosyl-L-cysteine (SAC) TAMRA tracer (2 mM from Anaspec diluted 1 :80,000) and a 1 :20 dilution of anti-S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine antibody (mouse monoclonal from Abbott Homocysteine detection kit, catalog # 7D2 -20) was prepared in assay buffer II (Na\n2\nHP0\n4\n pH 7.2). Prior to combining with quenched enzyme assays, the SAH antibody/ SAC TAMRA tracer complex was preformed at room temperature for 30 minutes while protected from light. \n\n\nTherefore, the final concentration of the SAH antibody/ SAC TAMRA mix was 1 :60 and \n\n\n1 :240,000\n5\n respectively. After a 2.5 hour incubation at room temperature, protected from light, fluorescence polarization was measured using a Tecan Safire\n2\n plate reader (excitation 530 nm, emission 595 nm). Titration curves and IC\n5\no values were calculated using standard protocols. \n\n\n The compounds of formula I have an IC\n50\n activity of 100 Î¼Î or less for COMT. Many of the compounds of formula I have an ICSO of less than 200 nM. For example, the compounds below have IC50 < 400 nM in the \"Esculetin or Fluorescence Polarization assay\".

Description\n\n\n\n\n TITLE OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n INHIBITORS OF CATECHOL O-METHYL TRANSFERASE AND THEIR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The symptoms of schizophrenia are generally divided into three categories; \n\n\npositive, negative and cognitive. Positive symptoms include hallucinations, delusions and disorganized behavior while negative symptoms are characterized by a lack of pleasure and/or interest in life. Cognitive deficit includes difficulties in the organization of thoughts and prioritization of tasks, Patients with bipolar disorder generally display circular mood changes ranging from severe depression to severe mania with or without psychotic features. \n\n\nSchizophrenia and bipolar disorder are among the most severe forms of psychiatric disorders that elicit overlapping cognitive deficits (Tasman et al., Psychiatry, West Sussex, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Second Edition, Volume 1, 2003, pp254-272; and Sadock and Sadock, Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 7 ed., Vol. 1, 2005, Philadelphia, Pa.; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, pp 236-272 and 1330-1395) and they tend to be chronic/progressive. In contrast to positive symptoms, the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are thought to have a greater impact on long-term disability, treatment outcome and functional recovery (Addington and Addington, 1993; Green, 1996). Dissatisfaction with therapy is attributed to lack of efficacy or intolerable and unacceptable side affects. The side effects have been associated with significant metabolic, extrapyramidal, prolactic and cardiac adverse events. See, Lieberman et al., N. Engl. J. Med. (2005) 353:1209-1223. \n\n\n While multiple pathways are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia leading to negative and cognitive symptoms, much attention has focused on reduced dopamine neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (Weinberger, 1987; Weinberger et al., 1988; Akil et al., 1999). Evidence for reduced dopamine neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex is supported by reduced regional cerebral blood flow or hypoactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia patients (Weinberger et al., 1988; Daniel et al., 1991 ; Okubo et al., 1997; Abi-Dargham et al., 2002). Schizophrenia related prefrontal deficits, independent from treatment or psychotic state, have been correlated with poor performance in tasks of executive function (e.g. n-back or Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) that evaluate prefrontal engagement (Weinberger et al., 1986, 1988; Carter et al, 1998; Callicott et al., 2000; Barch et al., 2001). In addition to deficits in executive function, reduced dopamine neurotransmission in the prefrontal \n\n cortex is involved in several brain activities including; attention, hedonic activities, natural rewards, and biologic activities such as cell signaling. Therefore, a compound which selectively enhances dopamine neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of cognitive and negative symptoms. \n\n\n Dopamine levels in the brain are determined by biosynthesis and release, as well as its rate of diffusion, reuptake, and degradation. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), is an important enzyme involved in the breakdown of dopamine in the cortex. COMT converts dopamine to 3-methoxytyramine and the dopamine metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) to homovanillic acid (HVA) (Boulton and Eisenhofer, 1998). In fact, COMT acts on a variety of biogenic catecholamines as well as catecholestrogens, dietary phytochemicals and ascorbic acid. In subcortical structures (e.g. striatum),, dopaminergic signalling is primarily regulated by removal of dopamine from the synaptic cleft via rapid uptake by the dopamine transporter (DAT) and/or norepinephrine transporter (NET). Regulation of dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex is markedly different. DAT is less densely expressed in synapses within the prefrontal cortex where dopamine is eliminated by uptake through the NET, diffusion, or metabolism by COMT and monoamine oxidase (Mazei et al., 2002; Moron et al, 2002; Lewis et al., 2001 ; Sesack et alâ 1998; Smiley et al, 1994). COMT inhibitors would therefore be predicted to selectively increase cortical dopaminergic signaling and thereby improve cognitive function. \n\n\n The COMT gene is located in the chromosome 22ql 1.21 region which has been linked to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, ADHD and substance dependency (Williams, et al. 2003 and Takahashi et al, 2003). There are two major isoforms of COMT, membrane-bound COMT (MB-COMT) is the predominant form involved in the degradation of synaptic frontal lobe dopamine in human brain (Lachman et al., Pharmacogenetics (1996). 6(3):243-250). The other form is soluble COMT (S-COMT) which is transcribed from a different promoter than MB-COMT and is otherwise identical to human MB-COMT minus 50 amino acids at the N- terminus of the protein. In humans, COMT activity is modulated by a single nucleotide polymorphism at Vall58Met (MB-COMT). Due to differences in enzyme thermostability, homozygous Met carriers have lower COMT activity, heterozygotes exhibit intermediate activity and homozygous Val carriers have greater enzyme activity (Chen et al., 2004). Despite the differences observed in activity based on genotype, only a modest relationship between \n\n Vall58Met genotype and cognitive performance has been demonstrated by meta-analysis in normal individuals, while no effect was observed in schizophrenia. Based on an inverted-U relationship thought to exist between dopamine receptor activation and prefrontal cortical functioning, these findings might be reconciled with the fact that disease state, along with multiple environmental and genetic factors, contribute to prefrontal efficiency and dopamine levels (reviewed in Tunbridge et al, Biol Psych, 2006). \n\n\n Although clozapine, Zyprexa, Risperdal and other anti-psychotic drugs have been useful for the treatment of positive and arguably the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, they have not been free from side effects such as agranulocytosis, sedation, weight gain, hyper-lipidemia and hyperglycemia, all of which limit their applications (Tasman et al., 2003; Sadock and Sadock 2005). Thus, there remains a need for medications that effectively treat negative symptoms and cognitive deficit, have no major side effects, and are effective in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, substance dependency, and \n\n\nADD/ADHD, etc. Such medications might also be used to reduce such symptoms when they occur as part of another psychiatric syndrome or when they are incidental to a neurological disorder. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention relates to pyrimidinone compounds which are inhibitors of catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme, and are useful in the treatment and prevention of neurological and psychiatric disorders and diseases in which COMT is involved. \n\n\nThe present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and the use of these compounds and compositions in the prevention or treatment of such diseases in which COMT enzyme is involved. The present invention further relates to a method of treating symptoms associated with a psychiatric disorder, comprising administration of a pharmacologically effective dose of a composition comprising a pyrimidinone COMT inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a patient. \n\n\nStill, the present invention relates to improving negative symptoms and cognitive deficit associated with schizophrenia, augmentation of the effects of anti-psychotics in treatment of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, in treatment of major depression, the depressive phase of \n\n bipolar disorder, DA deficiency-related diseases such as ADD/ADHD, and substance \n\n\ndependency (combat cravings associated with and/or addictions to abuse of alcohol, opiates, cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines, tobacco). The present invention also relates to a method for the treatment of tobacco addiction and the weight gain/food cravings associated with quitting smoking or the use of antipsychotics. \n\n\nThe present invention also relates to a method of enhancing cognition in head injuries and dementias. \n\n\n These and other aspects of the invention will be realized upon closer inspection of the specification as a whole. \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention relates to novel COMT inhibitors of formula I \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I II \n\n\nincluding tautomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts and individual enantiomers and diastereomers thereof wherein: \n\n\n A represents hydrogen, or Ci_6 alkyl, said alkyl optionally substituted with 1 to 3 groups of halo, OH, or Oalkyl; X represents hydrogen, OH, halo, Ci-6 alkyl, OCi-6 alkyl, NR2R3\ns\n (CH2)nC6-10 aryl, \n\n\n (CH2)n 5-10 heterocyclyl, said alkyl, aryl, and heterocyclyl optionally substituted with 1 to 3 groups of R\na\n; 1 represents (CH2)nC6-10 aryl, or (CH2)nC5-lO heterocyclyl, said aryl and heterocyclyl optionally substituted with 1 to 3 groups of R\na\n; \n\n\nR2 and R3 independently represent H, OH, Ci_6 alkyl, N(CH3)2, (CH2)nC5~iO heterocyclyl, (CH2)nC6-10 aryl, said aryl and heterocyclyl optionally substituted with 1 to 3 groups of R\na\n; \n\n R2 and R3 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a 5-10 membered ring that is optionally substituted with 1 to 3 groups of halo, OH, C2-6 alkenyl, (CH2)nC5- 0 heterocyclyl or (CH2)nC6-10 aryl; Ra represents Ci-6 alkyl, halogen, hydroxyl, C2-4alk nyl, (CH2)\nn\nCF3, OCHF2, OCF3, C3-6 cycloalkyl, 0(CH2)\nn\nC3-6 cycloalkyl, NR2C(0)R2, C(0)N(R2)\n2j\n C(R2)\n2\n0R2 C(0)R2, N0\n2\n, CN\nS\n N(R2)2, (CH\n2\n)\nN\nC(0)OR2, S0\n2\nR2, NHS0\n2\nR2\ns\n OR2, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nC5- 10 heterocyclyl, \n\n\nNH(CH\n2\n)\nn\nC5-10 heterocyclyl, (CH\n2\n)nC6-10 aryl, O(CH\n2\n)\nN\nC6-10 a y or O(CH\n2\n)\nn\nC5-10 heterocyclyl, said alkyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl and aryl optionally substituted with 1 to 3 groups of Rb; \n\n\nRb represents Ci-6 alkyl, OCi_6 alkyl, halogen, CHF\n2\n, OCHF\n2\n, -0-, N(R2)2, CH\n2\nOH\n5\n \n\n\nS(0)\n2\nNR2R3\n?\n (CH2)\nN\nC6-10 aryl, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nC\n5\n-10 heterocyclyl, C(O)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nC5-10 heterocyclyl, NH(CH\n2\n)\nn\nC5-10 heterocyclyl, C(0)NHC\n3\n-6cycloalkyl, OR\n2\n, C\n3\n_6cycloalkyl, (CH\n2\n)nCF\n3\n,or CN, said heterocyclyl optionally substituted with 1 or more of C\\-(, alkyl; and n represents 0 to 5. \n\n\n An embodiment of the present invention is realized when A is hydrogen or methyl and all other variables are as originally described.

Such term in relation to pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. In general, pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active object compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the process or condition of diseases. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by mixing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n Pharmaceutical compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide \n\n\npharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. Compositions for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients are mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions, oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, oil-in-water emulsions, and sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension may be prepared by standard methods known in the art. By \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. \n\n\n The subject compounds are further useful in a method for the prevention, treatment, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of the diseases, disorders and conditions noted herein, The dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be varied, however, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The active ingredient may be administered to patients (animals and human) in need of such treatment in dosages that will provide optimal pharmaceutical efficacy. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment. The dose will vary from patient to patient depending upon the nature and severity of disease, the patient's weight, special diets then being followed by a patient, concurrent medication, and other factors which those skilled in the art will recognize. Generally, dosage levels of between 0.001 to 10 mg/kg, of body weight daily are administered to the patient, e.g., humans and elderly humans. The dosage range will generally be about 0.5 mg to 1.0 g. per patient per day which may be administered in single or multiple doses. In one embodiment, the dosage range will be about 0.5 mg to 500 mg per patient per day; in another embodiment about 0.5 mg to 200 mg per patient per day; and in yet another embodiment about 5 mg to 50 mg per patient per day. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be provided in a solid dosage formulation such as comprising about 0.5 mg to 500 mg active ingredient, or comprising about 1 mg to 250 mg active ingredient. The pharmaceutical \n\n composition may be provided in a solid dosage formulation comprising about 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg or 250 mg active ingredient. For oral administration, the compositions may be provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, such as 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 750, 800, 900, and 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, such as once or twice per day. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration may be prepared as solutions or suspensions of the active compounds in water. A suitable surfactant can be included such as, for example, hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof in oils. \n\n\nFurther, a preservative can be included to prevent the detrimental growth of microorganisms. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions. Furthermore, the compositions can be in the form of sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of such sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the final injectable form must be sterile and must be effectively fluid for easy syringability. The pharmaceutical compositions must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage, and thus should be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), vegetable oils, and suitable mixtures thereof. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be in a form suitable for topical use such as, for example, an aerosol, cream, ointment, lotion, and dusting powder. \n\n\nFurther, the compositions can be in a form suitable for use in transdermal devices. These formulations may be prepared, utilizing a compound represented of the invention, or \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, via conventional processing methods. As an example, a cream or ointment is prepared by mixing hydrophilic material and water, together with about 5 wt% to about 10 wt% of the compound, to produce a cream or ointment having a desired consistency. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be in a form suitable for rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid, such as, for example, where the mixture forms unit dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used in the art. The suppositories may be conveniently formed by first admixing the composition with the softened or melted carrier(s) followed by chilling and shaping in moulds. \n\n In addition to the aforementioned carrier ingredients, the pharmaceutical formulations described above may include, as appropriate, one or more additional carrier ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavoring agents, binders, surface-active agents, thickeners, lubricants, and preservatives (including anti -oxidants). Furthermore, other adjuvants can be included to render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. \n\n\n Compositions containing a compound of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can also be prepared in powder or liquid concentrate form. \n\n\nThe abbreviations used herein have the following meanings (abbreviations not shown here have their meanings as commonly used unless specifically stated otherwise): Ac (acetyl), Bn (benzyl), Boc (tertiary-butoxy carbonyl), Bop reagent (benzotriazol-1 - yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosonium hexafluorophosphate, DBU (l ,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec- 7-ene), LHMDS (lithium hexamethyldisilyl amide), DMSO (methyl sulfoxide), PPTS \n\n\n(pridinium p-toluenesulfonate), PD/C (palladium on carbon), HRMS high resolution mass spectrometry, DCM (dichloromethane), LDA (lithium diisopropylamide), HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) DIPEA (diisopropylethyl amine), DMAP (4-\n\n\n(dimethylamino)pyridine), NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance); DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide), EDC (l-(3-diraethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride), Et\n3\nN (triethylamine), GST (glutathione transferase), HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), LAH (lithium aluminum hydride), Ms (methanesulfonyl; mesyl; or S0\n2\nMe), MsO (methanesulfonate or mesylate), NaHMDS (sodium hexamethyldisilazane), NBS (N-bromosuccinimide), NCS (N- chlorosuccinimide), NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), PDE (Phosphodiesterase), Ph (Phenyl), r.t, or RT (room temperature), Rac (Racemic), SAM (aminosulfonyl; sulfonamide or SO\n2\nNH\n2\n), SPA (scintillation proximity assay), Th (2- or 3-thienyl), TFA (trifluoroacetic acid), THF (Tetrahydrofuran), TLC (thin layer chromatography), Tr or trityl (N-triphenylmethyl), C\n3\nH\n5\n (Ally!), Me (methyl), Et (ethyl), n-Pr (normal propyl), i-Pr (isopropyl), n-Bu (normal butyl), i- Butyl (isobutyl), s-Bu (secondary butyl), t-Bu (tertiary butyl), c-Pr (cyclopropyl), c-Bu \n\n\n(cyclobutyl), c-Pen (cyclopentyl), c-Hex (cyclohexyl). \n\n\n The present compounds can be prepared according to the procedures provided in the Examples.

Alternatively, compounds 4, after a protecting group switch, are cross coupled to incorporate substituted aromatics groups bearing a hydroxyl substituent as in compounds 8. These phenols are elaborated to biaryl ethers upon treatment with halogenated aromatics and Cu catalysts. Acidic cleavage of the PMB protecting group generates target compounds 9. Alternatively, compound 1 is converted to methyl ether 10 prior to cross coupling with incorporation of aryl and heteroaryl groups and methyl ether cleavage to furnish target \n\n compounds 11.

Anal Biochem (373) 2008, 296-306). Assays utilized purified human COMT enzyme of the Val 158 variant (membrane-bound MB-COMT or soluble S-COMT) containing a C-terminal 6 or 10-histidine tag. Compounds of the following examples had activity in reference assays by exhibiting the ability to inhibit the methylation of esculetin and/or inhibit the production of S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH). Any compound exhibiting an IC50 below 1 Î¼Î would be considered a COMT inhibitor as defined herein. \n\n\n In a typical experiment the COMT inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present invention was determined in accordance with the following experimental methods detailed below. The fluorescence assay was based on methylation of a substrate (6,7- dihydroxycoumarin or 'esculetin') by COMT to produce a highly fluorescent product (7- hydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin or 'scopoletin'). The reaction requires the presence of magnesium \n\n ions and a methyl donor, in this case S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). A 10 mM compound stock in DMSO was used to prepare 10 point 3-fold dilution series and 1 uL of appropriate dilution was plated into assay wells (black 96 well round bottom polystyrene plates from Costar; catalog # 3792). Recombinant enzyme was diluted in assay buffer (100 mM Na\n2\nHP0\n4\n pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT, 0.005% Tween-20) and 35 was added to assay wells containing 1 Î¼Î, of compound. Preincubation of COMT enzyme and compound proceeded for 2 hours at room temperature. Enzyme assays were initiated with 5 uL of a mixture containing 40 Î¼Î SAM (USB catalog # US 10601), 4 Î¼Î esculetin (substrate) and 40 mM MgCl\n2\n. The formation of product (scopoletin) was monitored over time by fluorescence (excitation 340 nm, emission 460 nm, no lag, 100Î¼8 integration time, 5 flashes, top read) using a Tecan Safire\n2\n plate reader. Assays were monitored over time until a signal to background of 4 to 1 was achieved. Titration curves and IC50 values were calculated using standard procedures. Briefly, data were calculated as (mean of test wells) - (mean of no-enzyme controls)/(mean of total enzyme controls) - (mean of no-enzyme controls), then expressed as a percentage and subtracted from 100 to give percent inhibition of COMT activity. In some cases, compounds were not preincubated with MB-COMT for 2 hours at room temperature prior to starting the enzyme assays. \n\n\n To determine IC50 values in the fluorescence polarization assay, solutions of test compounds were prepared and preincubated with COMT enzyme as stated above. Enzyme reactions were initiated upon the addition of 5 Î¼Ï of an 8X mix prepared in assay buffer containing 8 Î¼Î SAM (USB catalog # US10601), 16 Î¼Î dopamine (Sigma catalog # H8502) and 40 mM MgCl\n2\n. After 25 minutes incubation at room temperature, reactions were quenched with 5 Î, 250 mM EDTA, pH 8,2. To quenched reactions, 20 Î¼Î, of a preformed complex containing S-adenosyl-L-cysteine (SAC) TAMRA tracer (2 mM from Anaspec diluted 1 :80,000) and a 1 :20 dilution of anti-S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine antibody (mouse monoclonal from Abbott Homocysteine detection kit, catalog # 7D29-20) was prepared in assay buffer II (Na\n2\nHP0\n4\n pH 7.2). Prior to combining with quenched enzyme assays, the SAH antibody/ SAC TAMRA tracer complex was preformed at room temperature for 30 minutes while protected from light. \n\n\nTherefore, the final concentration of the SAH antibody/ SAC TAMRA mix was 1 :60 and 1 : 240, 000, respectively. After a 2.5 hour incubation at room temperature, protected from light, fluorescence polarization was measured using a Tecan Safire plate reader (excitation 530 nm, emission 595 nm). Titration curves and IC50 values were calculated using standard protocols. \n\n\n The compounds of formula I have an IC50 activity of 100 Î¼Î or less for COMT. Many of the compounds of formula Î¯ have an IC50 of less than 200 nM, For example, the compounds below have ICso < 600 nM in the \"Esculetin or Fluorescence Polarization assay\". In \n\n particular, the compounds of the Examples beginning on page 38 of the specification, Exampli 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8 exhibited the following IC50 (nM) values: \n\n\nExample^ MB-COMT IC50-(nM) \n\n\n 180 \n\n\n 170 \n\n\n 93 \n\n\n 210 \n\n\n 590"
