Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to recombinantly produced human monoclonal antibodies which are specifically binding to nicotine and which are capable of preventing the passage of nicotine from the blood into the brain. The invention further relates to the use of such antibodies for passive immunization, preferably of humans, and to the use of such antibodies for the treatment of nicotine addiction in humans.\n\n\n \n\n\nRELATED ART\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBjercke et al. 1986 (J Immunol Methods, Vol. 90(2) pp. 203-13\n) disclose stereospecific monoclonal antibodies angainst (\nS\n)-(-)-nicotine. The monoclonal anti-nicotine antibodies of Bjercke et al. 1986 were produced by the hybridoma technology and were, thus, derived from mouse cells. Bjercke et al. 1986 further describe the use of such monoclonal antibodies in the development of ELISA based assays for nicotine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIsomura et al. 2001 (J. Org. Chem. Vol. 66 pp. 4115-4121\n) describe the preparation of haptens for the generation of antibodies specific for naturally occurring (S)-nicotine, (S)-and (R)-nomicotine, and the metabolite (S)-cotinine with high optical purity. The authors report preliminary data for antinicotine antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies of Isomura et al. 2001 were obtained from mice and exhibit Kd values for nicotine binding of 1.6 x 10\n-7\n M to 3.4 x 10\n-7\n M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nKeyler et al. 2005 (Drug Metab Dispos, Vol. 33(7) pp. 1056-61\n) describe the passive immunization of rats with monoclonal antibodies against nicotine. The authors found, inter alia, a reduced distribution of nicotine to the brain upon passive immunization. Also the monoclonal antibodies of Keyler et al. 2005 were produced by hybridoma technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPentel et al. 2006 (J Pharmacol Exp Ther, Vol. 317(2) pp. 660-6\n) studied inter alia the passive immunization of rats with the monoclonal antibody Nic311, an antibody described by Kepler et al. 2005, and hereby in particular the differential effects of passive immunization with this antibody on the acute and chronic distribution of nicotine to the brain. It has been suggested in the prior art that passive immunization of humans with nicotine specific antibodies may be useful in the treatment of nicotine addiction and may be supportive during smoking cessation. However, with respect to Nic311 Pentel et al. 2006 further conclude that a therapeutic monoclonal antibody would need to be humanized to reduce its own immunogenicity for clinical use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies against nicotine which are known from the prior art are derived from non-human sources and are therefore therapeutically not useful due to their strong immunogenicity in humans and due to safety concerns resulting thereof.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides human monoclonal antibodies that are specifically binding nicotine, wherein preferably said monoclonal antibodies are fully human antibodies. Typically and preferably, the monoclonal antibodies disclosed herein are not immunogenic in humans and are therefore suitable for the passive immunization of humans. Furthermore, it has surprisingly been found that monoclonal antibodies of the invention are specifically binding (S)-(-)-nicotine and (R)-(+)-nicotine. Like (S)-(-)-nicotine also the (R)-(+)-stereoisomer of nicotine is present in the tobacco plant. In addition, it can be formed by the combustion process during smoking and has qualitatively similar activities on the central nervous system as (S)-(-)-nicotine (\nHukkanen J. et al., 2005, Pharmacol. Rev. 57, 79-115\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies of the invention were cloned following a procedure disclosed in \n \nPCT/EP2007/061570\n \n: (1) nicotine-specific B-cells of a human subject were selected; (2) VH and VL regions of these cells were cloned into an alphaviral library; (3) a cells surface display of scFv antibodies was performed on mammalian cells; (4) cells displaying nicotine specific scFv antibodies were selected; (5) VH and VL regions of these scFv antibodies were cloned; and (6) monoclonal antibodies specifically binding nicotine were expressed in different formats, e.g. as scFv-Fc-fusion or as human IgG2, preferably as fully human IgG2. Applying this procedure, seven independent antibody clones were obtained which, when expressed as scFv-Fc fusion or IgG2, bound nicotine with a Kd value in the nanomolar or low nanomolar range.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one aspect, the invention relates to a monoclonal antibody specifically binding nicotine, wherein said monoclonal antibody is a human monoclonal antibody and wherein preferably said human monoclonal antibody is a fully human monoclonal antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese clones were sequenced and human CDRs conferring specificity to nicotine were identified. It has surprisingly been found that several of these antibodies share the same CDRs in different combinations (see Table 1).\n\n \n \nTable 1\n.

After staining, cells were washed and filtered, and 443 Nicotine-specific B cells (FL1-positive, FL2-negative, FL3-positive, FL4-negative) were sorted on a FACSVantage SE flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen-specific B cells were used for the construction of a Sindbis-based scFv cell surface display library essentially as described (see \n \nWO1999/025876A1\n \n for Sindbis-based screening in general and \n \nPCT/EP2007/061570\n \n for its application in antibody screening). Cells displaying Nicotine-specific scFv antibodies were isolated using RNase-Nicotine in combination with an RNase-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody (2.5µg/ml; Abcam) and a FITC-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1.5 µg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Each cell was sorted into a well of a 24-well plate containing 50 % confluent BHK feeder cells. Upon virus spread (2 days post sorting), the infected cells were tested by FACS analysis for Nicotine-binding to identify virus clones encoding Nicotine-specific scFv antibodies.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n\n\nGene rescue, ELISA screening and sequencing of Nicotine-specific antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe supernatants of BHK cells encoding putative Nicotine-specific antibodies, each containing a monoclonal recombinant Sindbis virus, were subjected to RT-PCR as described (see application \n \nPCT/EP2007/061570\n \n). The resulting PCR products, each comprising a scFv coding region, were digested with the restriction endonuclease Sfi1 and cloned into the expression vector pCEP-SP-Sfi-Fc (disclosed as SEQ ID NO:37 in application \n \nPCT/EP2007/061570\n \n), allowing for expression of scFv proteins fused to a C-terminal human Fc-γl domain under the control of a CMV promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor ELISA analysis, each of the clones was transfected into HEK-293T cells in a 24-well plate format, using Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 2-3 days post transfection, supernatants containing transiently expressed scFv-Fc fusion proteins were harvested. To check for Nicotine-specific binding, ELISA plates were coated with Nicotine-conjugated RNAse at a concentration of 4 µg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) over night at 4°C. In parallel, scFv-Fc expression levels were monitored in by sandwich ELISA. For this, an identical set of plates was coated with Fcγ-specific, goat anti-human F(ab')2 antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories 109-006-098) at a concentration of 2.5 µg/ml. The plates were then washed with wash buffer (PBS/0.05 % Tween) and blocked for 2h at room temperature with 3 % BSA in wash buffer. The plates were then washed again and incubated with 3-fold serial dilutions of the cell culture supernatants, starting at a dilution of 1/10. All dilutions were done in wash buffer. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h and then extensively washed with wash buffer. Bound scFv-Fc fusion proteins were then detected by a 1 h incubation with a HRPO-labeled, Fcγ-specific, goat anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories 109-035-098). After extensive washing with wash buffer, plates were developed with OPD solution (1 OPD tablet, 25 ml OPD buffer and 8 µl 30 % H\n2\nO\n2\n) for 5 to 10 minutes and the reaction was stopped with 5 % H\n2\nSO\n4\n solution. Plates were then read at OD 450 nm on an ELISA reader (Biorad Benchmark).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELISA-positive clones encoding Nicotine-specific scFv antibodies were sequenced as described (see application \n \nPCT/EP2007/061570\n \n), including clones F018, F063, J004, J042, N049, I022 and N038 (see Table 2).\n\n \n \nTable 2.\n SEQ ID NOs of nucleic acid sequences and amino acid sequences of nicotine specific scFv antibodies.\n \n \n \n \nscFv\n \n \n \nNucleic Acid Sequence\n \n \n \nAmino Acid Sequence\n \n \n \n \n \n \nF018\n \n \n59\n \n60\n \n \n \n \nF063\n \n \n61\n \n62\n \n \n \n \nJ004\n \n \n63\n \n64\n \n \n \n \nJ042\n \n \n65\n \n66\n \n \n \n \nN049\n \n \n67\n \n68\n \n \n \n \n1022\n \n \n69\n \n70\n \n \n \n \nN038\n \n \n71\n \n72\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong these, all heavy chain variable regions comprised VH4 family sequences (SEQ ID NOs 24, 28, 33, 39, 43, and 47).

Significantly, heavy and light chain variable regions of antibodies F018, F063, J004, J042 and N049 were very closely related to one another and differed only at few amino acid positions. The heavy chain variable regions of clones F063 and J042 were identical (SEQ ID NO:28).

One day before transfection, 5 x 10\n6\n 293T cells were plated onto a 10 cm tissue culture plate for each protein to be expressed. Cells were then transfected with the respective scFv-Fc fusion construct using Lipofectamin Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, incubated one day, and replated on one 14 cm dish in the presence of 1 µg/ml puromycin. After 3 days of selection, puromycin-resistant cells were transferred to three Poly-L-Lysine coated 14 cm plates and grown to confluency. Medium was then replaced by serum-free medium and supernatants containing the respective scFv-Fc fusion protein was collected every 3 days and filtered through a 0.22 µM Millex GV sterile filter (Millipore).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor each of the scFv-Fc fusion proteins, the consecutive harvests were pooled and applied to a protein A-sepharose column. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and bound protein eluted with 0.1 M Glycine pH 3.6. 1 ml fractions were collected in tubes containing 0.1 ml of 1 M Tris pH 7.5 for neutralization. Protein-containing fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pooled. The buffer was exchanged with PBS by dialysis using 10'000 MWCO Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (Pierce). The purified proteins in PBS were then filtered through 0.22 µM Millex GV sterile filters (Millipore) and aliquotted. Working stocks were kept at 4°C, whereas aliquots for long-term storage were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept -80°C.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\n\n\nVerification of Nicotine-specific binding by inhibition ELISA\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo exclude possible linker specificity of the antibodies, binding to free Nicotine was verified by inhibition ELISA. Thus, ELISA plates were coated with Nicotine-conjugated RNAse at a concentration of 4 µg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), over night at 4°C. The plates were then washed with wash buffer (PBS/0.05 % Tween) and blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 3 % BSA in wash buffer. The plates were then washed again and incubated with purified scFv-F018, scFv-F063, scFv-1022, scFv-J004, scFv-N038 and scFv-N049 at a concentration of 100ng/ml in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of free nicotine (0.1 to 100 µM). Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h and then extensively washed with wash buffer. Bound scFv-Fc fusion proteins were then detected by a 1 h incubation with a HRPO-labeled, Fcγ-specific, goat anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories 109-035-098). After extensive washing with wash buffer, plates were developed with OPD solution (1 OPD tablet, 25 ml OPD buffer and 8 µl 30% H\n2\nO\n2\n) for 5 to 10 minutes and the reaction was stopped with 5 % H\n2\nSO\n4\n solution. Plates were then read at OD 450 nm on an ELISA reader (Biorad Benchmark). Binding of each of the antibodies to immobilized nicotine was efficiently inhibited by free nicotine, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\n\n\nConstruction, expression, and purification of human Nicotine-specific IgG2\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe heavy and light chain variable region coding segments of scFv-F018, scFv-F063, scFv-1022, scFv-J004, scFv-J042, scFv-N038 and scFv-N049 were amplified by PCR using variable region-specific transfer primers (disclosed as SEQ ID NOs 92 to 103 of application \n \nPCT/EP2007/061570\n \n). For example, the DNA encoding the light chain variable region of antibody F018 was amplified using the primers VL-Sacl-F4 (5'-CAG GCG GCC GAG ATC GAG CTC ACT CAG C-3') and VL-EcoR5-B (5'-ACC GCC GAG GAT ATC CAG CTG GGT-3'). The DNA encoding the heavy chain variable region was amplified with the primers VH-Xhol-F (5'-SAG GTG CAG CTG CTC GAG TCK GG-3') and VH-Apal-B (5'-GCC ACT AGT GAC CGA TGG GCC-3'). The DNAs encoding the other light and heavy chain variable regions were amplified accordingly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting λ or κ light chain variable region PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes SacI and EcoR5, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligated into SacI-EcoR5 digested pCMV-LC-7λ or pCMV-LC-κ, respectively (disclosed as SEQ ID NOs 110 and 71 of application \n \nPCT/EP2007/061570\n \n). The resulting vectors allow for expression of complete human light chains, including the signal peptide, e.g. the F018 λ X light chain (SEQ ID NO:56). Similarly, the heavy chain variable region PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes XhoI and ApaI, gel purified, and ligated into XhoI-ApaI digested pCMV-HC-y2 (disclosed as SEQ ID NO:78 of application \n \nPCT/EP2007/061570\n \n). The resulting vectors allow for expression of complete human γ2 heavy chains, including the signal peptide, e.g. the F018 γ2 heavy chain (SEQ ID NO:55).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCo-expression of each of the pCMV-LC-7λ or -κ expression constructs with the corresponding pCMV-HC-γ2 expression construct in principle allows for the production of whole IgG2. However, to increase yields and facilitate large-scale production of antibodies, heavy and light chain coding regions were first combined into a single, EBNA-based expression vector, pCB15 (disclosed as SEQ ID NO:104 of application \n \nPCT/EP2007/061570\n \n). For instance, for expression of antibody F018 as a whole IgG2, the γ2 heavy chain coding region was excised from pCMV-F018-HC-γ2 by digestion with the restriction enzymes AscI and PacI, the resulting 1403 bp fragment purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and then ligated into Asc1-Pac1 digested pub15, yielding pCB15-F018-HC-γ2. The F018 λ light chain coding region was then excised from pCMV-F018-LC-λ by digestion with Nhe1 and Pme1, the resulting 723 bp fragment gel-purified, and then ligated into Nhe1-Pme1 digested pCB15-F018-HC-γ2, yielding the whole IgG expression vector pCB15-F018-IgG2λ. Expression of whole IgG was done in HEK-293T cells, exactly as described for the scFv-Fc fusion proteins (Example 2).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\n\n\nConstruction, expression, and purification of fully human Nicotine-specific IgG2\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pCB15 expression vectors constructed as described in Example 4 direct the synthesis of whole IgG2 molecules that are largely human. However, compared to a fully human antibody, there are still two minor differences. First, the sequence of the heavy or light chain signal peptide is encoded by the expression vector and typically does not correspond to the native signal peptide of the variable region in question. Second, amino acid positions flanking the heavy or light chain variable region are predetermined by the vector, e.g. due to the presence of restriction sites. Thus, in order to generate fully human mAbs, these differences need to be corrected for each of the heavy and light chain expression vectors.\n\nFor example, a vector directing expression of a fully human F018 γ2 heavy chain, including the native signal peptide (SEQ ID NO:57) was generated as follows. The F018 heavy chain variable region was first amplified by PCR from the plasmid pCMV-F018-HC-γ2 using the primers F018-HC-fh-F1 (5'-TTC CTC CTG TTG GTG GCA GCA CCC AGG TGG GTG CTG TCC CAG CTG CAA CTG CAG GAG TC-3') and F018-HC-fh-B1 (5'-GAC CGA TGG GCC CTT GGT GGA AGC-3'). The resulating PCR product was then further amplified using the primers F018-HC-fh-F2 (5'-GAG GGC GCG CCA CCA TGA AGC ACC TGT GGT TCT TCC TCC TGT TGG TGG CAG C-3') and F018-HC-fh-B1. The final PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes Asc1 and Apa1, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligated into Asc1-Apa1 digested pCMV-HC-γ2, yielding the plasmid pCMV-fhF018-HC-γ2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, a vector directing expression of a fully human F018 λ light chain including the native signal peptide (SEQ ID NO:58) was generated as follows. First, the F018 light chain variable region was amplified by PCR from pCMV-F018-LC-λ using the primers F018-LC-fh-F1 (5'-CCT CCT CAC CCT CCT CAC TCA CTG CGC CGG GTC CTG GGC CCA GTC TGT GCT CAC-3') and F018-LC-fh-B1 (5'-GGG CTG ACC TAG CAC GGT CAG CTG GGT GCC-3'). In parallel, the λ light chain was amplified using the primers F018-LC-fh-F3 (5'-GGC ACC CAG CTG ACC GTG CTA GGT CAG CCC-3') and T7 (5'-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3'). Second, the resulting PCR products were assembled by PCR using the primers F018-LC-fh-F2 (5'-GAG GCT AGC GCC ACC ATG GCC GGC TTC CCC CTC CTC CTC ACC CTC CTC ACT C-3') and T7. The final PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes Nhe1 and Pme1, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligated into Nhe1-Pme1 digested pCMV-LC-κ, yielding the plasmid pCMV-fhF018-LC-λ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe vector pCB15-fhF018-IgG2λ, directing the expression of a fully human mAb F018, was constructed by sequential cloning of heavy and light chain coding regions into pCB 15, using the cloning strategy set forth in Example 4. Expression vectors directing expression of fully human mAbs F063, I022, J004, J042, N038 and N049 are constructed in a similar manner.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\n\n\nDetermination of Affinities by Equilibrium Dialysis.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAffinity of antibodies for (S)-(-)-nicotine was determined by equilibrium dialysis using a DispoEquilibriumDialyzer (Harvard Biosciences). Two chambers of the dialyzer were separated by a membrane (10'000 Da cut-off). One chamber was filled with purified scFv-Fc or IgG2 at a concentration of 5.4 µg/ml or 7.5 µg/ml in PBS/2% BSA, respectively, whereas the other chamber did not contain antibody. Concentrations of tritium-labeled (S)-(-)-nicotine (Amersham) ranging from 3 to 444 nM were used. Equilibrium dialysis was allowed to proceed for 48-72 h. Aliquots from both sides of the chamber were taken and radioactivity measured in a scintillation counter. Radioactivity corresponding to antibody-bound (S)-(-)-nicotine was calculated by subtracting the radioactivity measured for the chamber containing no antibody from the one containing the antibody. The free (S)-(-)-nicotine concentration was determined from the radioactivity measured for the chamber containing no antibody. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was derived from the fit of a one-site binding model to the measured bound radioactivity as a function of the free (S)-(-)-nicotine concentration. Most nicotine-specific antibodies bound free (S)-(-)-nicotine with Kd values in the low nanomolar range (Table 4). The IgG2 antibodies had affinities comparable to the scFv-Fc, with Kd values that differed by no more than approximately 2-fold. The IgG2-F018 had a dissociation constant of 7 nM, almost 2-fold lower than the one measured for scFv-Fc-F018 and at least 4 times lower than the Kd of the other IgG2. It is noteworthy that the affinity of polyclonal antibodies against (S)-(-)-nicotine is in the range of 30-70 nM, i.e. considerably lower than the affinity of clone F018 (\nMaurer P. et al., 2005, Eur. J. Immunol. 35, 2031-2040\n).\n\n \n \nTable 4.\n Dissociation constants Kd values (nM) measured by equilibrium dialysis.

As expected, unlabeled (-)-nicotine readily displaced tritium-labeled (S)-(-)-nicotine. In contrast, acetylcholine, which is structurally unrelated to nicotine but binds to the same binding pocket of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\nCelie P.H. et al., 2004, Neuron 41, 907-914\n), did not interfere with (S)-(-)-nicotine binding even at a 4000 fold molar excess. Similarly, (-)-cotinine, which is the major metabolic product of (S)-(-)-nicotine and present in a 10-20 fold molar excess over nicotine in the blood of smokers (\nBenowitz N.L., 1997, Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 43, 259-267\n), did not effectively compete with (S)-(-)-nicotine for binding to IgG2-F018. Based on the IC50 observed, it can be estimated that IgG2-F018 binds (-)-cotinine about 1000 fold less strongly than (S)-(-)-nicotine. Therefore, the presence of a molar excess of (-)-cotinine in the blood of a smoker is unlikely to interfere with the therapeutic efficacy of IgG2-F018.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe next determined the affinities of mAbs IgG2-F018, -F063, -J004, -J042 and - N049 for the (R)-(+)-isomer of nicotine. This stereoisomer is present in the tobacco plant. In addition, it can be formed by the combustion process during smoking and has qualitatively similar activities on the central nervous system as (S)-(-)-nicotine (\nHukkanen J. et al., 2005, Pharmacol. Rev. 57, 79-115\n). Thus, the binding of a fixed concentration of tritium-labeled (S)-(-)-nicotine (F018: 56 nM; F063, J004, J042, N049: 111 nM) to each of the antibodies was measured by equilibrium dialysis in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled (R)-(+)-nicotine (1 nM to 100 µM). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was derived from the fit of a one-site competition model to the measured bound radioactivity as a function of the (R)-(+)-nicotine concentration. Surprisingly, (R)-(+)-nicotine was highly efficient in competing with (S)-(-)-nicotine for binding to each of the antibodies, with Kd values that were about 2 to 5 fold lower than those of (S)-(-)-nicotine (Table 5).\n\n \n \nTable 5.\n Dissociation constants Kd (nM) of antibody-(R)-(+)-nicotine interactions measured by equilibrium dialysis.\n \n \n \n \nformat\n \n \n \nF018\n \n \n \nF063\n \n \n \nJ004\n \n \n \nJ042\n \n \n \nN049\n \n \n \n \n \nIgG2\n \n3.1\n \n6.6\n \n12.6\n \n7.7\n \n10.5\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of Nicotine distribution in Plasma and Brain in Mice.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGroups of 5 to 6 female Balb/c mice were injected i.p. with 0.1 to 3 mg of each of the recombinant human IgG2 monoclonal antibodies. One day later, inhibition of nicotine entry into the brain was analyzed by intravenous injection of tritium-labelled (S)-(-)-nicotine (Amersham) (375, 750 or 1500 ng) into the tail vein. Mice were sacrificed 5 min later by CO\n2\n asphyxiation and blood and brain were collected. Nicotine concentrations in serum and brain were calculated from the radioactivity present. Brain nicotine concentration was corrected for the blood content of brain (3 µl/100 mg). The percent reduction of nicotine uptake into the brain was calculated relative to the nicotine concentrations found in brains of mice injected with control IgG. With all nicotine-specific antibodies tested, a reduction in the distribution of nicotine to the brain was observed. With most antibodies, the reduction observed at a dose of 0.5 mg per mouse was typically 40 % or more. The most potent mAb under these experimental conditions was F018, which consistently reduced entry of nicotine to the brain by more than 60 % (Tables 6 and 7).\n\n \n \nTable 6.\n Inhibition of nicotine entry into brain of mice by nicotine-specific antibodies (passive immunization with 0.5 mg IgG2; challenge with 750 ng nicotine).\n \n \n \n \nantibody\n \n \n \nbrain nicotine (cpm/g)\n \n \n \n% reduction\n \n \n \n \n \ncontrol IgG\n \n131559 ± 14650\n \n-\n \n \n \nF018\n \n46717 ± 3550\n \n64\n \n \n \nJ004\n \n77002 ± 9293\n \n41\n \n \n \nJ042\n \n72678 ± 7423\n \n45\n \n \n \nN049\n \n68395 ± 2885\n \n48\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nTable 7.\n Inhibition of nicotine entry into brain of mice by nicotine-specific antibodies (passive immunization with 0.5 mg IgG2; challenge with 750 ng nicotine).\n \n \n \n \nantibody\n \n \n \nbrain nicotine (cpm/g)\n \n \n \n% reduction\n \n \n \n \n \ncontrol IgG\n \n114048 ± 13786\n \n-\n \n \n \nF018\n \n42803 ± 3751\n \n62\n \n \n \nF063\n \n54783 ± 3909\n \n52\n \n \n \nI022\n \n68687 ± 5498\n \n40\n \n \n \nN038\n \n91823 ± 14311\n \n19\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\n\n\nUse of the heavy chain variable region of anti-Nicotine antibody F018 to identify a complementary light chain variable region (\"chain shuffling\").\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe nucleotide sequence of all primers used in the present example, and for which no sequence is provided herein can be found under the identical designation in: \nPhage Display - A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001, Protocol 9.2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA sequence encoding the heavy chain variable region of antibody F018 is amplified by PCR from a DNA molecule comprising the scFv-F018 sequence (SEQ ID NO:59) using the primers HSCVH35-FL and HSC-F018-B (5'-CCT GGC CGG CCT GGC CAC TAG TGA CCG ATG GGC CCT TGG TGG AAG C-3', SEQ ID NO:86). A library of DNA sequences encoding human κ light chain variable regions is amplified by PCR from the cDNA of B cells from a human subject immunized with a Nicotine-carrier conjugate, using an equimolar mix of the 4 sense primers HSCK1-F, HSCK24-F, HSCK3-F and HSCK5-F, plus an equimolar mix of the 4 antisense primers HSCJK14o-B, HSCJK2o-B, HSCJK3o-B and HSCJK5o-B. A library of DNA sequences encoding human λ light chain variable regions is amplified by PCR from the cDNA of B cells from a human subject immunized with a Nicotine-carrier conjugate, using an equimolar mix of the 9 sense primers HSCLam1 a, HSCLam1b, HSCLam2, HSCLam3, HSCLam4, HSCLam6, HSCLam78, HSCLam9 and HSCLam10, plus an equimolar mix of 3 antisense primers HSCJLam1236, HSCJLam4 and HSCJLam57.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor selection of complementary light chain variable regions, scFv coding regions are assembled by PCR overlap extension of the F018 VH PCR product with either the the Vκ library PCR product or the Vλ library PCR product using the primers RSC-F and RSC-B. The resulting -750-800 bp PCR products encode a 5' light chain variable region library (either κ or λ) and the 3' heavy chain variable region of Nicotine-specific antibody F018, linked by an 18 amino acid flexible linker, and flanked by two SfiI restriction sites. The scFv-κ and -λ library fragments are pooled in equimolar ratio, digested with the restriction endonuclease SfiI, and cloned into the vector pDel-SP-TM for screening by Sindbis-based scFv cell surface display essentially as described in Example 1. Alternatively, the SfiI-digested scFv library fragments are cloned into Sfil-digested pComb3H (\nRader C, Barbas CF 3rd., 1997, Curr Opin Biotechnol. 8, 503-508\n). Antibodies are then expressed and selected for binding to immobilized RNAse-Nicotine conjugate by phage display using procedures described (\nPhage Display: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001\n)."
