Description\n\n\n\n\n CYCLODEPSIPEPTIDE ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS \n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention relates to the use of cyclodepsipeptide compounds, specifically didemnin and tamandarin compounds, as antiretroviral agents, and in particular as anti-HIV agents. Additionally, the present invention relates to new cyclodepsipeptide compounds which are closely related to didemnin and tamandarin compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as antiretroviral agents, and in particular as anti-HIV agents. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n Infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can lead to the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a disease characterized by the destruction of the immune system, and its precursor AIDS-related complex (ARC), a syndrome characterized by symptoms such as persistent generalised lymphadenopathy, fever and weight loss. It is estimated that thirty- three million people are currently infected with HIV worldwide, and as of 2007, 26 million people worldwide have died of AIDS. HIV is a lentivirus belonging to the Retroviridae family. Two species of this retrovirus infect human beings: HIV- I and HIV-2. HIV sustains itself through release of viral RNA and multiple viral enzymes into host CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells. Its life cycle consists of six steps: binding/ fusion, reverse transcription, integration, transcription, translation, and viral assembly and mutation (Halligan et al. Dent. Clin. North Am. 2009, 53(2), 31 1-322). \n\n\nVarious classes of anti-HIV medications have been developed to combat the virus at different stages of its lifecycle. The targets that have been envisaged most intensively are: reverse transcription, catalysed by \n\n reverse transcriptase (RT) (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase), a specific viral enzyme that retrotranscribes the viral single-stranded RNA genome to double-stranded proviral DNA; and proteolytic processing by the viral protease, which cleaves the precursor viral polyprotein into smaller mature (both structural and functional) viral proteins. Other targets that have been recognised more recently as sites for therapeutic intervention are viral entry, particularly virus-cell fusion and interaction of the virus with its (co-)receptors, and integration of the proviral DNA into the host cell genome, a process carried out by a specific viral enzyme (integrase) which determines whether the HIV-infected cell and all daughter cells stemming thereof will permanently carry the pro virus. Therefore, among the antiretroviral therapies currently approved in US and Europe there are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) such as zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine; non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) such as nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, and etravirine; protease inhibitors such as saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, atazanavir, fosamprenavir, tipranavir, and darunavir; entry inhibitors such as maraviroc; integrase inhibitors such as raltegravir; fusion inhibitors such as enfuvirtide; and combination therapies such as lamivudine + zidovudine, abacavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, abacavir + lamivudine, tenofovir + emtricitabine, efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir, and lopinavir + ritonavir (De Clercq, Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents, 2009, 33(4), 307-320; Wainberg et al. BMC Medicine, 2008, 6:31). \n\n\nCyclodepsipeptides, together with natural cyclic peptides, emerge as a broad family of natural products characterized by the occurrence of at least one ester linkage. The great interest that this class of natural compounds has elicited in the scientific community is explained by the diverse range of biological activities that they can exhibit, including \n\n antitumoral, antibiotic, antifungi, immunosuppressant, and antiinflammatory activities, in conjunction with intriguing mechanisms of action and attractive molecular architectures (Sarabia et al. Curr. Med. Chem.2004, 11, 1309-1332; Lemmens-Gruber et al. Curr. Med. Chem. 2009, 16, 1122-1137). Didemnin and tamandarin compounds are members of this class of compounds which have showed a broad spectrum of biological activity such as antitumoral, immunosuppressant, and antiviral activity. Natural didemnins were first isolated from marine tunicates, specifically from Trididemnum solidum, and tamandarin A and B were first isolated from a Brazilian ascidian of the family Didemnidae. Additional didemnin and tamandarin congeners have been subsequently obtained by synthesis (Vera et al. Med. Res. Rev. 2002, 22(2), 102-145; WO 02/02596; WO 01/76616; WO 2004/084812). \n\n\nRinehart et al. reported that didemnin A and B and some derivatives thereof were able to inhibit several DNA and RNA viruses, specifically HSV-I, HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, types 1 and 2), vaccinia virus, PR8 (influenza virus), HA-I (parainfluenza-3 virus), COE (Coxsackie A-21 virus), and ER (equine rhinovirus) (Rinehart et al. Science, 1981, 212, 933-935; US 4,493,796; US 4,548,814). In addition, didemnin A and B were both found to exhibit significant activity against the Rift Valley fever virus (RVF), Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, and yellow fever virus. As compared with these three test viruses, Pichinde virus, a representative arenavirus, was less sensitive to the in vitro antiviral effect of both didemnins. In vivo, didemnin B at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg daily in mice infected with RVF gave a 90% survival rate and didemnin A at a dose of 1.25 to 5 mg/kg daily gave a 50% survival rate (Canonico et al. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982, 22(4), 696-697). Maldonado et al. reported the inhibitory effect of didemnin A against the replication of three types of \n\n Dengue viruses in vitro (Maldonado et al. P. R. Health Sci. J. 1982, 1 , 22-25). Weed et al. reported the activity of didemnin A and B in mice infected cutaneously with type 1 herpes simplex virus and the lack of activity against a Semliki Forest virus (SMV) infection. In addition, although both didemnin A and B were ineffective in protecting mice from HSV- I encephalitis when both virus and drug were injected intracranially, both compounds protected female mice from genital HSV-2 infection (Weed et al. Antiviral Res. 1983, 3, 269-274; Rinehart et al. Pure & Appl. Chem. 1982, 54(12), 2409-2424). Didemnin B was also found to be ineffective against the rabies virus in mice and foxes (Bussereau et al. Acta Virol. 1988, 32, 33-49) and the AIDS virus HTLV- 3 (Rinehart KL. Peptides, Chemistry and Biology, 1988, Ed. GR Marshall, pages 626-631). Finally, the antiviral activity of 21 didemnin congeners was examined against the RNA virus vesicular stomatitis virus and the DNA virus HSV- I , and some congeners were effective at inhibiting the replication of said viruses, but none of them inhibited proliferation of HIV (Sakai et al. J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 2819-2834). \n\n\nDespite recent progress in the development of anti-HIV therapeutic options, there remains a need for drugs having different or enhanced anti-HIV properties. The problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide compounds that are useful in the treatment of\n\n\nHIV infections, AIDS and ARC.

It will be appreciated that non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts also fall within the scope of the invention since those may be useful in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The preparation of salts can be carried out by methods known in the art. For instance, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds provided herein are synthesized from the parent compound, which contains a basic or acidic moiety, by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts are, for example, prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent or in a mixture of the two. Generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol or acetonitrile are preferred. Examples of the acid addition salts include mineral acid addition salts such as, for example, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, and organic acid addition salts such as, for example, acetate, trifluoroacetate, maleate, fumarate, citrate, oxalate, succinate, tartrate, malate, mandelate, methanesulfonate and p-toluenesulfonate. Examples of the alkali addition salts include inorganic salts such as, for example, sodium, potassium, calcium and ammonium salts, and organic alkali salts such as, for example, ethylenediamine, \n\n ethanolamine, N,N-dialkylenethanolamine, triethanolamine and basic aminoacids salts. \n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be in crystalline form either as free compounds or as solvates (e.g. hydrates, alcoholates, particularly methanolates) and it is intended that both forms are within the scope of the present invention. Methods of solvation are generally known within the art. The compounds of the invention may present different polymorphic forms, and it is intended that the invention encompasses all such forms. \n\n\nAny compound referred to herein is intended to represent such specific compound as well as certain variations or forms. In particular, compounds referred to herein may have asymmetric centres and therefore exist in different enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms. Thus any given compound referred to herein is intended to represent any one of a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms, and mixtures thereof. Likewise, stereoisomerism or geometric isomerism about the double bond is also possible, therefore in some cases the molecule could exist as (£)-isomer or (Z)- isomer (trans and cis isomers). If the molecule contains several double bonds, each double bond will have its own stereoisomerism, that could be the same or different than the stereoisomerism of the other double bonds of the molecule. Furthermore, compounds referred to herein may exist as atropisomers. All the stereoisomers including enantiomers, diastereoisomers, geometric isomers and atropisomers of the compounds referred to herein, and mixtures thereof, are considered within the scope of the present invention.

EXAMPLE 4 \n\n\n Following the procedures described in WO 02/02596 and in the specification, and further disclosed in the previous examples, the following compounds are obtainable: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5 \n\n\nFollowing the procedures described in WO 02 / 02596 and in the specification, and further disclosed in the previous examples, the following compounds are obtainable: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6: BIOASSAYS FOR THE DETECTION O F ANTI-HIV ACTIVITY The aim of these assays was to evaluate the anti-HIV activity and the mechanism of action of the compounds of the invention. a. MTT and gag-p24 detection assays \n\n\n MTT assay was performed as described by Pauwels et al. (J. Virol. Methods. 1988, 20, 309-321). Briefly, 10\n4\n MT-2 cells infected with 100\n\n\nTCID50 of HIV- I NL4.3 wild type were seeded in 96 microwell plates with 1 00 μl of culture medium (RPMI+ 10%FCS) and different \n\n concentrations of the compounds to be tested were added. After 7 days, cell viability was measured by adding the MTT reagent. Briefly, 20 μl of MTT solution (7.5 mg/ml in PBS) were added to each well and left in culture for 1 hour (37°C, 5% C O\n2\n) . Afterwards, 150 μl of culture supernatant were carefully removed avoiding cell disturbance. Formazan crystals were produced and dissolved by adding 100 μl Triton X- 100 al 10% (V/ V) in acidified isopropanol (0.04 M HCl isopropanol). The viability was then measured in a UV spectrometer microplate reader. \n\n\nThe antiviral assay based in the p24-gag protein determination lead us to evaluate the exact amount of viral proteins in the supernatants produced by the infection. To that end, the assay was performed as MTT assay, but measurement of p24-gag protein in the culture infected supernantants was performed following the manufacturer instructions (InnotestTM HIVAg mAb, Innogenetics). b. Recombinant virus assay (antiviral activity) \n\n\n The recombinant virus assay was performed in both, MT-2 cells and PBMCs previously activated with PHA + IL-2. Cells were infected with supernatants obtained from 293t cells transfected with full-length infectious HIV- I plasmids pNL4.3-Luc (X4 tropic virus), pNL4.3-Renilla (X4 tropic virus able to develop more than one round of replication), pNL4.3-Δenv-Luc plus pVSV-env (HIV pseudotyped with the G protein of VSV) or pJR-Renilla (R5 tropic virus able to develop more than one round of replication). Resistant viruses were obtained cloning in NL4.3- Renilla the pol gene of viruses from different infected donors. Virus 9D carry the following mutations:\n\n\n41L,67N,70R,98G, 1 18I, 184V,215F,219Q,74I and virus 4D: K65R, K70R, V75I, F77L, F1 16Y, Q 151 M, M 1841, Ll OI. The assay was then performed in 96 well microplates seeded with 100 μl containing 250.000 \n\n (PBMCs) or 100.000 (MT-2) cells/ well. The compounds to be tested were added to the culture in concentrations ranging from 50 to 0.0016 μg/ml (100 μl/well) . Finally, cell culture was infected with supernatants obtained form transfection of the different plasmids described above. After 48 hours, cell culture supernatant was removed and cells were lysed with Luciferase assay system or Renilla assay system (both from Promega) following the specifications of the manufacturer, and the luciferase-renilla activity was measured in a luminometre (Berthold Detection systems). All the experiments were controlled with cells treated with the vehicle (DMSO) and non-treated cells. \n\n\n HIV- I replication inhibition was evaluated by measuring the reduction of luciferase-renilla activity or RLUs (Relative light units) in a luminometre, being the 100% the infection of non-treated cells. c. Toxicity evaluation \n\n\n MTT assay is per se a toxicity evaluation method. Thus, for recombinant virus assay an alternative method must be used. Therefore, toxicity was measured by treating non infected cells with the tested compounds in the same concentrations and conditions described above for antiviral assays. To that end, MT-2 and PBMCs were treated with the compounds, and 48 hours later culture supernatant was removed and cells were subjected to two different methods: \n\n\n 1. Propidium iodide addition ( 1 μg/ml) and analysis by flow cytometry. \n\n\n 2. CellTiter GIo reagent addition and RLUs quantification in a luminometre. \n\n\n In both methods, cells treated with the vehicle (DMSO) and non-treated cells (100% viability) were used as controls. \n\n\nInhibitory Concentration 50 (IC50), Cytotoxic Concentration 50 (CC50) and specificity index (SI) were calculated for each compound using \n\n GraphPad software, non linear regression fit and sigmoidal dose- response curves. d. Retrotranscriptase activity \n\n\nRetrotranscriptase (RT) activity is a potential target for compounds with antiviral activity, since this enzyme is characteristic for the Retroviridae family. To evaluate the activity on RT of the compounds of the invention, thymidine incorporation method was used. To that end, 10 μl/well of mix 1 (Triton X- 100 0.5%, KCl 0.5 M and DTT 125 mM) were added to a 96 microplate. Afterwards, 50 μl of viral supernatants, the compounds to be tested at active concentrations and 40 μl of mix 2 (EGTA 5 mM in Tris HCl 0.5M pH 7.8, MgCl\n2\n 0.5M, Metil \n3\nH Thymidine 5' triphosphate and Poly(rA).p(dT)) were added to the microplate and left in culture for 1 hour at 37°C. Afterwards, reaction was stopped with 20 μl of Na\n2\nP\n2\nO? 120 mM in TCA 60% and the mixture was incubated at 4°C for 15 minutes. Then, the mixture was filtered with TCA 5% and results were obtained in a β-counter. e. Viral DNA quantification \n\n\nOne way to evaluate the first steps of the infectious cycle is the quantification of viral DNA by real time PCR. Thus, preactivated PBMCs were infected with a wild type HIV (NL4.3) in the presence or absence of the compounds to be tested (at a concentration of 100 nM) or zidovudine (at a concentration of 1 μM) for 24 hours. Afterwards, cells were lysed and genomic DNA was extracted with Qiagen DNA Blood minikit (Qiagen). Real time PCR was then performed with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystem) following the recommendations of the manufacturer in an ABI Prism7000 (Applied Biosystem). DNA amplification was performed with specific primers for a LTR-gag fragment of the viral genome: R/U5 (forward), 5\n'\n-GGC TAA CTA GGG \n\n AAC CCA CTG-3\n'\n and LTR/gag (reverse), 5\n'\n-CCT GCC TCG AGA GAG CTG CTC TGG-3\n'\n. β-actin amplification was used as control. f . Transcriptional activity \n\n\nTranscription should be one of the more important targets for antiretroviral therapy, since viral latency is a crucial fact that lead to the establishment of the chronic infection. Thus, PBMCs resting were transfected in an Equibio electroporator with a luciferase construct under the control of the complete HIV proviral genome (NL4.3-Luc). Briefly, 5O 10\n6\n of PBMCs were transfected with 50 μg of pNL4.3-Luc, and left in culture in the presence or absence of the compounds to be tested during different times (at a concentration of 100 nM). Afterwards, luciferase activity was measured in lysed cells. \n\n\n CD69 expression was measured in PBMCs resting treated with the compounds for 18 hours. Afterwards, cells were subjected to single- colour immunophenotyping and analyzed with a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Belgium). Background staining was assessed with the appropriate isotype- and fluorochrome-matched control mAb and subtracted. Results are shown as percentage of cells expressing the receptor. g. Results \n\n\n The recombinant virus assay was performed by measuring luciferase activity in infected cells. To rule out non specific inhibition of luciferase activity, a previous assay in HeLa-Tet-On-Luc cell line was performed with all compounds to be tested. In this cell line, luciferase activity was expressed by treating the culture with doxicyclin, switching on the Tet On system (Table 1). \n\n\n Table 1. Luciferase specificity assay on HeLa-Tet-On-Luc cells \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n ND: Not determined \n\n\nSix compounds showed non specific inhibition of luciferase activity at 50 μM. However, when lower concentrations were used, three of them (compounds 3, 7 and 8) were specific at 10 μM and compounds 9, 10 and 1 1 were specific at 1 μM. \n\n\n All of them were subjected to antiviral evaluation in MT-2 cells with increasing concentrations ranking from 0 to 50 μM. Results are shown in Table 2. \n\n\nTable 2. Antiviral activity of the compounds in MT-2 cells infected with NL4.3-LUC. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the compounds were active in the recombinant virus assay. Eight compounds (compounds 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 1 1) showed a specificity index greater than 10, and thus were selected for further research. \n\n Compounds 9, 10 and 1 1 were the most potent as antiviral agents, and, although toxicity values were also high, specificity index was greater than 10. \n\n\n When tested in PBMCs, as shown in Table 3, the profile of antiviral activity was very positive. Indeed, five compounds (compounds 3, 8, 9, 10, and 1 1) displayed stronger antiviral activity (nanomolar range) on HIV-infected PBMCs than in MT-2 cells. Compound 1 did not show antiviral activity in PBMCs infections while in MT-2 cells infections it did. Compounds 5 and 6 were active in MT-2 cells infections, but they were less potent in PBMCs. Compounds 3 and 8 inhibited viral replication in both MT-2 cells and PBMCs, although specificity index was lower in PBMCs. In addition, compounds 9 and 10 were less potent in MT-2 cells (IC50 values higher) and, which is more interesting, less toxic in PBMCs. In fact, these two compounds have better profiles in PBMCs, with specificity index of 6907 (compound 10) and 31825 (compound 9). \n\n\nTable 3. Anti-HIV activity of the compounds in PBMCs infected with NL4.3-LUC. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NR: Not reached \n\n\nIn conclusion, these compounds display strong potency as inhibitors of the viral cycle. Eight compounds in MT-2 cells and six compounds in PBMCs were active with SI greater than 10. \n\n Five compounds (compounds 3, 8, 9, 10 and 1 1) were selected for further investigations. \n\n\nCompound 3 (Figure IA and IB) showed antiviral activity in both MT-2 cells and PBMCs (ICso 1.39 μM and 0. 16 μM, respectively). This compound was more toxic in PBMCs, as shown in Figure 1. Toxic concentrations were not reached at 57.3 μM in MT-2 cells, while in PBMCS CC50 value was about 27 μM. \n\n\nCompound 8 (Figure 2A and 2B) showed also antiviral activity in both MT-2 cells and PBMCs. Although at concentrations of 50 μM it was nonspecific, at 10 μM it was specific, with an IC50 value 100 fold lower. \n\n\nCompounds 9 (Figure 3A and 3B), 10 (Figure 4A and 4B), and 1 1 (Figure 5A and 5B) were the most potent compounds of all tested compounds. Compounds 9, 10, and 1 1 showed IC50S values in the nanomolar range in PBMCs (0.63, 0.86, and 69.4 nM, respectively), and they are among the most potent of the antiviral compounds in vitro existing in the literature. Compound 9 is specially interesting, with a specificity index greater than 31800. \n\n\nTo corroborate the antiviral activity showed in the recombinant virus assay, MT-2 cells were infected with a wild type HIV (NL4.3) in the presence or absence of compounds 9, 10 and 1 1. After 7 days, MTT was added to the culture and viability evaluated in a microplate UV- Vis reader or by p24-gag viral protein measurement in culture supernants. In Figure 6, it is represented the inhibition of p24-gag protein in culture supernatants. \n\n\nAntiviral activity of these compounds was confirmed with active concentrations ranging the nanomolar scale. \n\n In Figure 7 it is represented the MTT classic assay. In MTT assay, the antiviral activity of the compounds was not showed as clear as in the other assays. This fact could be explained since the potential toxicity of the compounds would be greater after 7 days of treatment. Moreover, HIV in the MTT assay could escape from the antiviral activity, since degradation of compounds is more probable when cultures are treated for such long periods of time. However, an incipient antiviral activity is showed with the treatment at concentrations of 1 or 10 nM. \n\n\nOnce it was clearly established that the compounds of the invention were potent inhibitors of HIV infection, it was important to determine exactly the step of the viral cycle interfered by these compounds. With this aim, the antiviral activity of the compounds was also tested in infections performed with recombinant viruses displaying different tropism. Therefore, active concentrations of compounds were tested against infection produced by X4, R5 or VSV pseudotyped HIV that enters host cells by a receptor independent mechanism. The results of this assay are shown in Table 4 and Figure 8. \n\n\nTable 4. Results of antiviral assays in MT-2 cells or PBMCs infected with X4 (NL4.3-Renilla), R5 (JR Renilla) or VSV pseudotyped HIV (NL4.3Delta-env-VSV-Luc). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results show the degree of inhibition of the replication of X4, R5 and VSV pseudotyped in both MT-2 cells and PBMCs exerted by the three compounds, which is of similar potency, suggesting that the target of the compounds of the invention is not the viral entry. Note that \n\n MT-2 cells lack of CCR5 receptor so it cannot became infected with an R 5 tropic virus. \n\n\nThe next step was to evaluate the activity of compounds on the viral retro transcription. For this purpose, an enzimatic assay was performed wherein the supernatants containing HIV retrotranscriptase were treated with the compounds of the invention and triphosphate thymidine incorporation was measured. As shown in Figure 9, none of the tested compounds was able to inhibit the retrotranscriptase activity.\n\n\nTo corroborate these results, viral DNA was directly quantified in cell lysates by real time PCR. To that end, wild type HIV (NL4.3) infected PBMCs were treated with active concentrations of the compounds of the invention for 18 hours. Afterwards, cells were lysed and genomic DNA extracted and subjected to a real time PCR. Surprisingly, the three tested compounds were able to decrease the amount of viral DNA (Figure 10), suggesting that the activity of these compounds could be related to a target subsequent to the viral entry but previous to the retro transcription and/ or integration, without having any direct effect on the reverse transcriptase. \n\n\n Although the main target of the compounds of the invention seems to be prior to integration, the activity on retrotranscription was studied by transfection of a luciferase construct under the control of the complete\n\n\nHIV genome (NL4.3-Luc) and treating the cultures at different times post- transfection. As shown in Figure 11, there were no important modifications of transcripcional activity when treated with the compounds of the invention, while with PMA a 5 fold increase on luciferase activity was obtained. Moreover, aplidine used as control showed a surprising inhibitory effect. \n\n\n Since the effect of the compounds of the invention could be related to the time of exposure to the treatment, transcriptional activity was evaluated at different times. The data shown in Figure 12 seem to \n\n corroborate the lack of activity of the compounds of the invention on viral transcription. Aplidine was able to inhibit HIV transcription at 16 hours of treatment. These effects were corroborated when expression of a typical marker of activation in lymphocytes (CD69) was measured after treatment with the compounds (Figure 13). \n\n\n Lastly, the activity of these compounds was also evaluated in HIV carrying different patterns of resistances. Recombinant viruses carrying resistances to NRTIs or with multiresistance complex were used to infect PBMCs as compared to a standard (NL4.3-Renilla). As shown in Table 5 and Figure 14, the activity of the compounds was similar in all the viruses tested. In addition, it was confirmed that the compounds of the invention do not target HIV RT. Protease activity can also be discarded, since potency of the three compounds on resistant viruses to nelfinavir (4D) was also similar. Moreover, the activity of these compounds in infections with viruses able to develop one single round of replication (NL4.3-Luc) suggests that their target should be previous to transcription. \n\n\n Table 5. Antiviral activity (IC50 (nM)) of the compounds in PBMCs infected with recombinant viruses carrying NRTIs resistances (9D) or multiresistance complex (4D) or wild type (NL4.3-Renilla)"
