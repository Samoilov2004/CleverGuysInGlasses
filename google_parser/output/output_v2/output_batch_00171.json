Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates generally to recombinant antibodies. More particulary, the invention relates to recombinant antibodies that specifically bind human Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule, and to their use as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThere has been significant progress in the development of antibody-based therapies over the years. For example, investigators have identified not only a variety of cancer-specific markers but also a variety of antibodies that bind specifically to those markers. Antibodies can be used to deliver certain molecules, for example, a toxin or an immune stimulatory moiety, for example, a cytokine, to a cancer cell expressing the marker so as to selectively kill the cancer cell (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,541,087\n \n; and \n \n5,650,150\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe KS-1/4 antibody is a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody directed against human epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). EpCAM is expressed at very low levels on the apical surface of certain epithelial cells. For example, EpCAM is expressed on intestinal cells on the cell surface facing toward ingested food and away from the circulation, where it would not be accessible to most proteins and cells of the immune system (\nBalzar et al. [1999] J. Mol. Med. 77:699-712\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nEP 0338 767 (Beavers et al.\n \n) discloses different versions of chimeric and \nmurine KS\n 1/4 antibodies. \nBeiboer et al. (J. Mol. Biol, (2000) 296, 833-849\n) discloses a human antibody directed to EpCAM obtained by phage display using \"guided selection\" to improve affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnder certain circumstances, however, EpCAM is highly expressed on certain cells, for example, tumor cells of epithelial origin. Typically, these tumor cells have lose their polarity with the result that EpCAM is expressed over the entire surface of the cell. Thus, EpCAM is a convenient tumor-specific marker for directing antibody-based immune-stimulatory moieties to tumor cells (\nSimon et al. [1990] Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 78:2755-2759\n; \nPerez et al. [1989] J Immunol. 142:3662-3667\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, antibodies can have an associated immunogenicity in the host mammal. This is more likely to occur when the antibodies are not autologous. Consequently, the effectiveness of antibody-based therapies often is by an immunogenic response directed against the antibody. The immunogenic response typically is increased when the antibody is derived in whole or in part from a mammal different than the host mammal, e.g., when the antibody is derived from a mouse and the recipient is a human. Accordingly, it may be helpful to modify mouse-derived antibodies to more closely resemble human antibodies, so as to reduce or minimize the immunogenicity of the mouse-derived antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough a variety of approaches have been developed, including, for example, chimeric antibodies, antibody humanization and antibody veneering,Accordingly, there is a need in the art for antibodies that bind to cancer specific markers and that have reduced immunogenicity when administered to a human. Further, there is a need in the art for antibodies that deliver toxins or immune stimulatory moieties, for example, as fusion proteins or immune conjugates to a cancer specific marker to selectively kill the tumor cell.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is based in part upon the identification of a recombinant antibody that specifically binds human E/pCAM but is less immunogenic in humans than the template murine anti-EpCAM antibody. In particular, the invention relates to an immunocytokine fusion protein comprising such an antibody as stated which is fused to an IL2 molecule. Thus, in particular, the invention provides a recombinant KS antibody with a modified variable light chain as specified by SEQ ID NO: 9 and a modified variable heavy chain as specified by SEQ ID NO: 18, and a recombinant KS-IL2 fusion protein having a light chain as specified by SEQ ID NO: 42 and a heavy chain as specified by SEQ ID NO: 41.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"antibody\" and \"immunoglobulin\" are understood to mean (i) an intact antibody (for example, a monoclonal antibody or polyclonal antibody), (ii) antigen binding portions thereof, including, for example, an Fab fragment, an Fab' fragment, an (Fab')\n2\n fragment, an Fv fragment, a single chain antibody binding site, an sFv, (iii) bi-specific antibodies and antigen binding portions thereof, and (iv) multi-specific antibodies and antigen binding portions thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"bind specifically,\" \"specifically bind\" and \"specific binding\" are understood to mean that the antibody has a binding affinity for a particular antigen of at least about 10\n6\n M\n-1\n, more preferably, at least about 10\n7\n M\n-1\n, more preferably at least about 10\n8\n M\n-1\n, and most preferably at least about 10\n10\n M\n-1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"Complementarity-Determining Regions\" and \"CDRs\" are understood to mean the hypervariable regions or loops of an immunoglobulin variable region that interact primarily with an antigen.

The immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (V\nH\n) and immunoglobulin light chain variable region (V\nL\n) both contain four FRs, as shown in \nFigure 1\n. For example, with reference to the amino acid sequence defining the immunoglobulin light chain variable of the of the KS-1/4 antibody as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, the FRs are defined by the amino acid sequences from Gln1 to Cys23 (FR1), from Trp34 to Phe 48 (FR2), from Gly56 to Cys87 (FR3), and from Phe97 to Lys106 (FR4). With reference to the amino acid sequence defining the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region of the KS-1/4 antibody as shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, the FRs are defined by the amino acid sequences from Gln1 to Ser25 (FR1), from Trp36 to Gly49 (FR2), from Arg67 to Arg98 (FR3), and from Trp106 to Ser116 (FR4). The FRs of the other antibodies described herein are shown in Figures X and Y after alignment with the corresponding KS-1/4 heavy or light chain sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"KS antibody\" is understood to mean an antibody that binds specifically to the same human EpCAM antigen bound by murine antibody KS-1/4 expressed by a hybridoma (see, for example, Cancer Res. 1984, 44 ((2):681-7). The KS antibody preferably comprises (i) an amino acid sequence of SASSSVSY (amino acids 24-31 of SEQ ID NO: 1) defining at least a portion of an immunoglobulin light chain CDR1 sequence, (ii) an amino acid sequence of DTSNLAS (amino acids 49-55 of SEQ ID NO: 1) defining at least a portion of an immunoglobulin light chain CDR2 sequence, (iii) an amino acid sequence of HQRSGYPYT (amino acids 88-96 of SEQ ID NO: 1) defining at least a portion of an immunoglobulin light chain CDR3 sequence, (iv) an amino acid sequence of GYTFTNYGMN (amino acids 26-35 of SEQ ID NO: 2) defining at least a portion of an immunoglobulin heavy chain CDR1 sequence, (v) an amino acid sequence of WINTYTGEPTYAD (amino acids 50-62 of SEQ ID NO: 2) defining at least a portion of an immunoglobulin heavy chain CDR2 sequence, or (vi) an amino acid sequence of SKGDY (amino acids 101-105 of SEQ ID NO: 2) defining at least a portion of an immunoglobulin heavy chain CDR3 sequence, or any combination of the foregoing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the immunoglobulin V\nL\n domain comprises an FR1 sequence selected from the group consisting of: (i) amino acid residues 1-23 of SEQ ID NO: 9; and (ii) amino acid residues 1-23 of SEQ ID NO: 8. In another embodiment, the immonoglobulin V\nH\n domains comprises an FR sequence defined by amino acid residues 1-25 of SEQ ID NO: 18 and or an FR sequence defined by amino acid residues 67-98 of SEQ ID NO: 18. More preferably, the V\nL\n domain comprises an amino acid sequence defined by amino acids 1-106 of SEQ ID NO: 9 and/or the V\nH\n domain comprises an amino acid sequence defined by amino acids 1-116 of SEQ ID NO: 18.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the antibody optionally may include an amino acid sequence defining at least a portion of a CDR sequence including, for example, (i) amino acid residues 24-31 of SEQ ID NO: 1; (ii) amino acid residues 49-55 of SEQ ID NO: 1; and/or (iii) amino acid residues 88-96 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Similarly, the antibody optionally may include an amino acid sequence defining at least a portion of a CDR sequence including, for example, (i) amino acid residues 26-35 of SEQ ID NO: 2; (ii) amino acid residues 50-62 of SEQ ID NO: 2; and/or iii) amino acid residues 101-105 of SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the antibody comprises the antigen targeting portion of an antibody-cytokine fusion protein.

Preferred antibodies of the invention have altered variable regions that result in reduced immunogenicity in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preferred antibody of the invention has altered variable regions that result in reduced immunogenicity in humans, and is fused to JL\n-\n2\n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody variable regions of the invention are particularly useful to target antibodies and antibody fusion proteins to tumor tissues that over-express EpCAM in human patients.\n\n\n \n\n\nProtein sequences of the invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention discloses a family of antibody variable region or V region sequences that, when appropriately heterodimerized, bind to human epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) also known as KS antigen or KSA. Preferred proteins of the invention are useful for treating human patients as described herein. Accordingly, preferred KS antibody variants are humanized, deimmunized, or both, in order to reduce their immunogenicity when administered to a human. According to the invention, murine KS antibodies can be deimmunized or humanized, for example, by using deimmunization methods in which potential T cell epitopes are eliminated or weakened by introduction of mutations that reduce binding of a peptide epitope to an MHC Class \nII\n molecule (see, for example \n \nWO98/52976\n \n, and \n \nWO00/34317\n \n), or by using methods in which non-human T cell epitopes are mutated so that they correspond to human self epitopes that are present in human antibodies (see, for example, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,712,120\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant anti-EpCAM antibody according to the invention has an immunoglobulin variable light chain sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant anti-EpCAM antibody according to the invention has an immunoglobulin variable heavy chain sequence of SEQ ID NO: 18.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also discloses methods for assaying the expression of KS antibodies from cells such as mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, yeast cells, other eukaryotic cells or prokaryotic cells (see Example 1). In a preferred method, KS antibody V regions are expressed as components of an intact human antibody, and the expression of the antibody from a eukaryotic cell line assayed by an ELISA that detects the human Fc region. To precisely quantify binding of a KS antibody to EpCAM, a Biacore assay may be used.\n\n\n \n\n\nTreatment of human disease with KS antibody fusion proteins\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also discloses the sequences of KS antibody-IL2 fusion proteins that are useful in treating human disease, such as cancer. Certain KS antibody-IL2 fusion proteins, such as KS-1/4-IL2 (see, for example, Construct 3 in Example X), may be used to treat human patients with cancer, with surprisingly little immune response against the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is found that, during treatment of human cancers with KS-1/4(VH2/VK1)-IL2, even less immunogenicity is seen than with KS-1/4(Construct 3)-IL2. Specifically, during a clinical trial, patients with anti-idiotypic antibodies and antibody directed against the antibody-IL2 junction or against the IL-2 moiety are seen at an even lower frequency than with KS-1/4(onstant 3)-IL2.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1. Methods and reagents for expressing KS antibodies and assaying their antigen-binding \nactivity\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 A. Cell culture and transfection\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following general techniques were used in the subsequent Examples. For transient transfection, plasmid DNA was introduced into human kidney 293 cells by coprecipitation of plasmid DNA with calcium phosphate [\nSambrook et al. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,Cold Spring Harbor, NY\n].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to obtain stably transfected clones, plasmid DNA was introduced into the mouse myeloma NS/0 cells by electroporation. NS/0 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. About 5x10\n6\n cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Ten µg of linearized plasmid DNA was then incubated with the cells in a Gene Pulser Cuvette (0.4 cm electrode gap, BioRad) for 10 minutes on ice. Electroporation was performed using a Gene Pulser (BioRad) with settings at 0.25 V and 500 µF. Cells were allowed to recover for 10 minutes on ice, after which they were resuspended in growth medium and then plated onto two 96-well plates. Stably transfected clones were selected by growth in the presence of 100 nM methotrexate (MTX), which was introduced two days post-transfection. The cells were fed every 3 days for two to three more times, and MTX-resistant clones appeared in 2 to 3 weeks. Supernatants from clones were assayed by anti-human Fc ELISA to identify high producers [\nGillies et al. (1989) J. Immunol. Methods 125:191\n]. High producing clones were isolated and propagated in growth medium containing 100 nM MTX.\n\n\n \n\n\n1B. ELISAs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThree different ELISAs were used to determine the concentrations of protein products in the supernatants of MTX-resistant clones and other test samples. The anti-huFc ELISA was used to measure the amount of human Fc-containing proteins, e.g., chimeric antibodies. The anti-hu kappa ELISA was used to measure the amount of kappa light chain (of chimeric or human immunoglobulins). The anti-muFc ELISA was used to measure the amount ofmuFc-containing proteins in test samples (see Example 1C below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-huFc ELISA is described in detail below.\n\n\n \n\n\nA. Coating plates\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nELISA plates were coated with AffiniPure goat anti-human IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immuno Research) at 5 µg/ml in PBS, and 100 µl/well in 96-well plates (Nunc-Immuno plate Maxisorp). Coated plates were covered and incubated at 4°C overnight. Plates were then washed 4 times with 0.05% Tween (Tween 20) in PBS, and blocked with 1% BSA/1% goat serum in PBS, 200 µl/well. After incubation with the blocking buffer at 37°C for 2 hours, the plates were washed 4 times with 0.05% Tween in PBS and tapped dry on paper towels.\n\n\n \n\n\nB. Incubation with test samples and secondary antibody\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTest samples were diluted to the proper concentrations in sample buffer, which contained 1% BSA/1% goat serum/0.05% Tween in PBS. A standard curve was prepared with a chimeric antibody (with a human Fc), the concentration of which was known. To prepare a standard curve, serial dilutions are made in the sample buffer to give a standard curve ranging from 125 ng/ml to 3.9 ng/ml. The diluted samples and standards were added to the plate, 100 µl/well, and the plate incubated at 37°C for 2 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter incubation, the plate was washed 8 times with 0.05% Tween in PBS. To each well was then added 100 µl of the secondary antibody, the horse radish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated anti-human IgG (Jackson Immuno Research), diluted around 1:120,000 in the sample buffer. The exact dilution of the secondary antibody had to be determined for each lot of the HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG. After incubation at 37°C for 2 hours, the plate was washed 8 times with 0.05% Tween in PBS.\n\n\n \n\n\nC. Development\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe substrate solution was added to the plate at 100 µl/well. The substrate solution was prepared by dissolving 30 mg of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) (1 tablet) into 15 ml of 0.025 M citric acid/0.05M Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n buffer, pH 5, which contained 0.03% of freshly added H\n2\nO\n2\n. The color was allowed to develop for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The developing time was subject to change, depending on lot to lot variability of the coated plates, the secondary antibody, etc. The color development in the standard curve was observed to determine when to stop the reaction. The reaction was stopped by adding 4NH\n2\nSO\n4\n, 100 µl/well. The plate was read by a plate reader, which was set at both 490 nm and 650 nm and programmed to subtract off the background OD at 650 nm from the OD at 490 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-hu kappa ELISA followed the same procedure as described above, except that the secondary antibody used was horse radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-hu kappa (Southern Biotechnology Assoc. Inc., Birmingham, AL), used at 1:4000 dilution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe procedure for the anti-muFc ELISA was also similar, except that ELISA plates were coated with AffiniPure goat anti-murine IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immuno Research) at 5 µg/ml in PBS, and 100 µl/well; and the secondary antibody was horse radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-muIgG, Fcγ (Jackson ImmunoResearch), used at 1:5000 dilution.\n\n\n \n\n\n1C. Cloning of the KS antigen (KSA, EpCAM) and expression of the soluble form as human EpCAM-murine Fc\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMessenger RNA (MRNA) was prepared from LnCAP cells using Dynabeads mRNA Direct Kit (Dynal, Inc., Lake Success, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After first strand cDNA synthesis with oligo(dT) and reverse transcriptase, full length cDNA encoding epithelial cell adhesion molecule (also known as KS antigen or KSA), was cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The sequences of the PCR primers were based on the published sequence described in \nPerez and Walker (1989) J. Immunol. 142:3662-3667\n. The sequence of the sense primer is \nTCTAGA\nGCAGC\nATG\nGCGCCCCCGCA (SEQ ID NO: 27), and the sequence of the nonsense primer is \nCTCGAG\n \nTTA\nTGCATTGAGTTCCCT (SEQ ID NO: 28), where the translation initiation codon and the anti-codon of the translation stop codon are denoted in bold, and the restriction sites XbaI (TCTAGA) and XhoI (CTCGAG) are underlined. The PCR product was cloned and the correct KSA sequence was confirmed by sequencing several independent clones. The cDNA sequence of the KSA from LnCAP was essentially identical to the published sequence of KSA from UCLA-P3 cells (Perez and Walker, 1989). However, at amino acid residue number 115, the nucleotide sequence from LnCAP was ATG rather than ACG (Met instead of Thr), and at amino acid residue number 277, the nucleotide sequence from LnCAP was ATA rather than ATG (Ile instead of Met).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding of KS-1/4 antibody to recombinant KSA was demonstrated by immunostaining. Surface expression of KSA was obtained by transfecting cells, e.g., CT26, B16, etc., with full length KSA in a suitable mammalian expression vector (pdCs, as described in \n \nU.S. Patent Number 5,541,087\n \n), followed by immunostaining with the KS-1/4 antibody. For the expression of KSA as a soluble antigen, the portion of the cDNA encoding the transmembrane domain of the KSA was deleted. To facilitate expression, detection, and purification, the soluble KSA was expressed as a KSA-muFc, the construction of which is described as follows. The 780 bp XbaI-EcoRI restriction fragment encoding the soluble KSA was ligated to the AflII-XhoI fragment encoding the muFc (\n \nU.S. Patent Number 5,726,044\n \n) via a linker-adaptor:\n\n \n \n \n5' AA TTC TCA ATG CAG GGC 3' (SEQ ID NO: 29)\n \n3' G AGT TAC GTC CCG AAT T 5' (SEQ ID NO: 30)\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe XbaI-XhoI fragment encoding soluble KSA-muFc was ligated to the pdCs vector. The resultant expression vector, pdCs-KSA-muFc, was used to transfect cells and stable clones expressing KSA-muFc were identified by anti-muFc ELISA.\n\n\n \n1D. Measurement of Antigen Binding\n\n\n \n \n \nKSA-muFc in conditioned medium was first purified by Protein A chromatography according to supplier's protocol (Repligen, Cambridge, MA). Purified KSA-muFc was used to coat 96-well plates (Nunc-Immuno plate, Maxisorp) at 5 µg/ml in PBS, and 100 µl/well. The assay was similar to the ELISA procedure described in Example 1B. Briefly, coated plates were covered and incubated at 4°C overnight. Plates then were washed and blocked. Test samples were diluted to the proper concentrations in the sample buffer, added to the plate at 100 µl/well, and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After incubation, the plate was washed 8 times with 0.05% Tween in PBS. To each well was then added 100 µl of the secondary antibody, the horse radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG (Jackson Immuno Research), diluted around 1:120,000 in the sample buffer. The plate was then developed and read as described in Example 1B.\n\n\n \n\n\n1E. Measurement of on-rates and off-rates of KS-1/4 antibodies from EpCAM using a Biacore assay.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe affinity of KS-1/4 and KS-IL2 molecules for the antigen EpCAM were measured by surface plasmon resonance analysis of the antibody-antigen interaction, using a Biacore machine (Biacore International AB, Uppsala, Sweden). EpCAM-murineFc was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip using an amine coupling protocol supplied by the manufacturer. KS-1/4 and KS-IL2 at concentrations varying between 25 nm and 200 nM were then passed over the chip, whereby binding to the chip was observed. Using the built-in curve-fitting routines of the Biacore software, the on-rate, off-rate, association and dissociation constants were calculated.\n\n\n \n\n\n1F. Measurement of binding affinities of KS-1/4 antibodies using cell lines expressing EpCAM\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPurified KS-1/4 antibodies were iodinated with \n125\nI using standard techniques, and increasing concentrations of labeled protein were incubated with the EpCAM-positive cell line PC-3. Saturation binding curves were generated and the dissociation constants were determined by Scatchard analysis.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2. Cloning of cDNAs encoding_V\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n\nand V\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\n\nof mouse KS-1/4 and construction of vector for the expression of KS-1/4 hybridoma-derived antibody\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMessenger RNA prepared from the mouse KS-1/4-expressing hybridoma (obtained from R. Reisfeld, Scripps Research Institute) was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) and then used as templates for PCR to amplify the sequences encoding the variable region of the heavy chain (V\nH\n) and the variable region of the light chain (V\nK\n). The PCR primers were designed based on published sequences (Beavers \net al.,\n \nibid.\n). The PCR primers for V\nH\n had the following sequences:\n\n \n \n \nV\nH\n forward primer (5') GACTCGAGCCCAAGTCTTAGACATC (3') (SEQ ID NO: 31)\n \nV\nH\n reverse primer (5') CAAGCT\nTAC\nCTGAGGAGACGGTGACTGACGTTC (3'), (SEQ ID NO: 32)\n \n\nwhere the CTCGAG and AAGCTT sequences represent the XhoI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, used for ligating the V\nH\n into the expression vector (see below); and the \nTAC\n in the reverse primer would introduce GTA, the splice donor consensus sequence, in the sense strand of the PCR product.\n    \n \n \n \nThe PCR primers for V\nK\n had the following sequences:\n\n \n \n \nV\nK\n forward primer (5') GATCTAGACAAGATGGATTTTCAAGTG (3') (SEQ ID NO: 33)\n \nV\nK\n reverse primer (5') GAAGATCT\nTAC\nGTTTTATTTCCAGCTTGG (3') (SEQ ID NO: 34)\n \n\nwhere the TCTAGA and AGATCT sequences represent the XbaI and BglII restriction sites, respectively, used for ligating the V\nK\n into the expression vector (see below); ATG is the translation initiation codon of the light chain; and the \nTAC\n in the reverse primer would introduce GTA, the splice donor consensus sequence, in the sense strand of the PCR product.\n    \n \n \n \nThe PCR products encoding the V\nH\n and V\nK\n of the mouse KS-1/4 antibody were cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Several V\nH\n and V\nK\n clones were sequenced and the consensus sequence of each determined. The V\nH\n and V\nK\n sequences were inserted in a stepwise fashion into the expression vector pdHL7. The ligations took advantage of the unique XhoI and HindIII sites for the V\nH\n, and the unique XbaI and BglII/BamHI sites for the V\nK\n (the unique BglII in the V\nK\n insert and the unique BamHI in the vector have compatible overhangs). The resultant construct is called pdHL7-hybridoma chKS-1/4, which already contained transcription regulatory elements and human Ig constant region sequences for the expression of chimeric antibodies (\nGillies et al. (1989) J. Immunol. Methods 125:191\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression vector pdHL7 was derived from pdHL2 [\nGillies et al. (1991) Hybridoma 10:347-356\n], with the following modifications: in the expression vector pdHL2, the transcriptional units for the light chain and the heavy chain-cytokine consisted of the enhancer of the heavy chain immunoglobulin gene and the metallothionein promoter. In pdHL7, these two transcriptional units consisted of the CMV enhancer-promoter [\nBoshart et al. (1985) Cell 41:521-530\n]. The DNA encoding the CMV enhancer-promoter was derived from the AflIII-HindIII fragment of the commercially available pcDNAI (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 3. Expression studies of murine KS-1/4 antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example discusses expression studies performed using an antibody expression plasmid encoding the V region sequences disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,975,369\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\n3A. Plasmid Construction\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo directly compare the chimeric antibodies encoded by the Hybridoma KS-1/4 sequence and those sequences described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,975,369\n \n, the cDNA encoding the VH sequence described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,975,369\n \n was synthesized. This was then ligated into the pdHL7 expression vector already containing the V\nK\n of KS-1/4. In order to construct the V\nH\n sequence described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,975,369\n \n, an NdeI-HindIII fragment encoding part of the V\nH\n sequence was obtained by total chemical synthesis. Overlapping oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and ligated. The ligated duplex was then subcloned into a XbaI-Hindlll pBluescript vector (Stratagene, LaJolla, CA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis DNA encodes the protein sequence IQQPQNMRTM of \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,975,369\n \n. Immediately 3' to the coding sequence is the splice donor site beginning with gta. The ctag at the 5' end of the top strand is the overhang for the XbaI cloning site. The XbaI site was created only for cloning into the polylinker of the pBluescript vector. It was followed immediately by the NdeI restriction site (CATATG). The agct at the 5' end of the bottom strand is the overhang of the HindIII cloning site. This HindIII sticky end is later ligated to the HindIII site in the intron preceding the Cγ1 gene [\nGillies et al. (1991) Hybridoma 10:347-356\n].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter sequence verification, the NdeI-HindIII restriction fragment was isolated. This, together with the XhoI-NdeI fragment encoding the N-terminal half of V\nH\n, was then ligated to the XhoI-HindIII digested pdHL7 expression vector containing the V\nK\n of KS-1/4. The resultant construct, pdHL7-'369 chKS-1/4, contained the V\nK\n and V\nH\n described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,975,369\n \n (referred to as \n \nUS4,975,369\n \n chKS-1/4).\n\n\n \n\n\n3B. Comparison of hybridoma chKS-1/4 and US4,975,369 chKS-1/4 antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe plasmid DNAs pdHL7-hybridoma chKS-1/4 and pdHL7-'369 chKS-1/4 were introduced in parallel into human kidney 293 cells by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure mentioned above. Five days post-transfection, the conditioned media were assayed by anti-huFc ELISA and kappa ELISA (see Example 1 for ELISA procedures) and the results are summarized in Table 1.\n\n \n \n \nTable 1.\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody\n \nhuFc ELISA\n \nKappa ELISA\n \n \n \n \nHybridoma chKS-1/4\n \n254 ng/mL\n \n200 ng/mL\n \n \n \n \n \n US4,975,369\n \n chKS-1/4\n \n14 ng/mL\n \n0 ng/mL\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results indicated that hybridoma chKS-1/4 was expressed and secreted normally, and that the secreted antibody consisted of roughly equimolar amounts of heavy and light chains, within the accuracies of the two different ELISAs. On the other hand, only a low level of heavy chain was detected in the conditioned medium for the \n \nUS4,975,369\n \n chKS-1/4 antibody, and no kappa light chain was associated with it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWestern blot analysis was performed on the total cell lysates and the conditioned media of the two transiently transfected cell lines. The procedures for Western blot analysis were as described in (Sambrook \net al.\n (1989), \nsupra\n)\n.\n In order to analyze the total cell lysates, the transfected cells were lysed, centrifuged to remove the debris, and the lysate from the equivalent of 5x10\n \n5\n \n cells applied per lane. To analyze the conditioned media, the protein product from 300 µL of the conditioned medium was first purified by Protein A Sepharose chromatography prior to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After Western blot transfer, the blot was hybridized with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, Fcγ (Jackson ImmunoResearch), used at 1:2000 dilution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Western blot transfer showed that under the conditions used, the heavy chain was detected in both the conditioned media and the lysed cells of the transfection with pdHL7-hybridoma chKS-1/4. This result indicates that the heavy chain of the chKS-1/4 antibody was produced in the cells and secreted efficiently (together with the light chain). On the other hand, the heavy chain from the transfection with pdHL7-'369 chKS-1/4 was detected only in the cell lysate but not in the conditioned media. This result indicated that although a comparable level of heavy chain was produced inside the cell, it was not secreted. This finding was consistent with the ELISA data, which showed that there was no kappa light chain associated with the small amount of secreted heavy chain in the \n \nUS4,975,369\n \n chKS-1/4 antibody. It is understood that immunoglobulin heavy chains typically are not normally secreted in the absence of immunoglobulin light chains [Hendershot \net al.\n (1987) Immunology Today 8:111].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the foregoing, NS/0 cells were transfected by electroporation with the plasmids pdHL7-Hybridoma chKS-1/4 and pdHL7-\n \nUS4,975,369\n \n chKS-1/4 in parallel. Stable clones were selected in the presence of 100 nM MTX, as described in Example 1, and the conditioned media of the MTX-resistant clones in 96-well plates was assayed by anti-huFc ELISA, as described in Example 1. The results are summarized in Table 2.\n\n \n \n \nTable 2\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody\n \nTotal number of clones screened\n \nMode*\n \nHighest level of expression*\n \n \n \n \nHybridoma chKS-1/4\n \n80\n \n0.1-0.5 µg/mL (41)\n \n10-50 µg/mL (4)\n \n \n \n \n \n US4,975,369\n \n chKS-1/4\n \n47\n \n0-10 ng/mL (36)\n \n0.1-0.4 µg/mL (4)\n \n \n \n \n \n(*The numbers in parentheses denote the number of clones in the mode or the number expressing the highest levels of product, as determined by anti-Fc ELISA.)\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen screened at the 96-well stage, the majority of the clones obtained with the pdHL7-hybridoma chKS-1/4 construct produced about 100 ng/mL to 500 ng/mL of antibody, with the best clones producing about 10-50 µ/mL. On the other hand, the majority of the clones obtained with the pdHL7-'369 chKS-1/4 construct produced about 0 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL of antibody, with the best producing about 300-400 ng/mL. To examine the composition and binding properties of the \n \nUS4,975,369\n \n chKS-1/4 antibody, it was necessary to grow up the clones that produced at 300-400 ng/mL. Two of these clones were chosen for expansion. However, their expression levels were found to be very unstable. By the time the cultures were grown up to 200 mL, the expression levels of both clones had dropped to about 20 ng/mL, as assayed by anti-Fc ELISA. When the same conditioned media were assayed by the anti-kappa ELISA, no kappa light chain was detected, as was the case in transient expression in 293 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following experiment indicated that no detectable kappa light chain was associated with the \n \nUS4,975,369\n \n chKS-1/4 heavy chain. Briefly, 50 mL each of the conditioned media from each of the clones was concentrated by Protein A chromatography. The eluate were assayed by anti-Fc ELISA and anti-kappa ELISA. As a control, conditioned medium from a hybridoma chKS-1/4-producing clone was treated the same way and assayed at the same time. The ELISA results are summarized in Table 3.\n\n \n \n \nTable 3\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody\n \nhuFc ELISA\n \nKappa ELISA\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHybridoma chKS-1/4\n \n42 µg/mL\n \n44 µg/mL\n \n \n \n \n \n US4,975,369\n \n chKS-1/4-\nclone\n 1\n \n253 ng/mL\n \n0 ng/mL\n \n \n \n \n \n US4,975,369\n \n chKS-1/4-clone 2\n \n313 ng/mL\n \n0 ng/mL\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results showed that there was indeed no detectable kappa light chain associated with the \n \nUS4,975,369\n \n chKS-1/4 heavy chain. Furthermore, the hybridoma chKS-1/4 antibody was shown to bind KS antigen at 10-20 ng/mL, whereas the \n \nUS4,975,369\n \n antibody from both clones and concentrated to 253 and 313 ng/mL, still did not bind KS antigen (see Example 9 for measurement of binding to KS antigen.)\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 4. Expression and characterization of variant KS antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMutations that significantly lower the expression or the affinity of an antibody for a target molecule are expected to be less effective for therapeutic purposes in humans. Some approaches to reducing immunogenicity, such as \"veneering,\" \"humanization,\" and \"deimmunization\" involve the introduction of many amino acid substitutions, and may disrupt binding of an antibody to an antigen (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,639,641\n \n; and \n \n5,585,089\n \n; and \n \nPCT Publication Nos. WO 98/52976\n \n; \n \nWO 00/34317\n \n). There is a need in the art for classes of antibody sequences that will bind to epithelial cell adhesion molecule, but which are distinct from the original mouse monoclonal antibodies that recognize this antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious combinations of KS-1/4 heavy and light chain variable (\"V\") regions were tested for their ability to be expressed, and for their ability to bind to EpCAM. These results are summarized in Tables 4-6 and described below.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \nTable 5.

Thus, a larger number reflects a lower affinity for EpCAM.\n\n(***) Kappa light chain was not detectable by ELISA (equivalent to background); therefore, functional antibodies were not expressed.\n\n(****) n.d. = not detectable\n\nIn Group 2 and Group 3, the relative binding activity of each protein was normalized to the control shown in the first line for that group. The ELISA assay is primarily a reflection of off-rates, based on amount of protein bound after several rounds of washes. It is used as a rapid screen to rule out poor binders, but is not a precise measure of affinity. In Group 3, VH2 variants VH2.1 - VH2.4 were compared with VH1 to determine if amino acid insertions might result in improved relative binding.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequences are related as follows. As described in the examples, the VH0 and VK0 sequences were derived from PCR amplification from a hybridoma cell line that expresses the original mouse-derived KS-1/4 (SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2). VH-'369 is the VH sequence disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,975,369\n \n. Sequences VH1, VH2, VH2.1-2.4 VK1, and VK2 were derived either using deimmunization technology where potential T cell epitopes are eliminated or weakened by introduction of mutations that reduce binding of a peptide epitope to an MHC Class II molecule, or by changing non-human T cell epitopes so that they correspond to human self-epitopes that are present in human antibodies. The design of these constructs is further described and analyzed below. Constructs of Table 6 were generated by transfecting mammalian cells with combinations of nucleic acids that expressed the corresponding heavy and light chain V regions. Sequences VH6, VH7, VK6, VK7, and VK8 were generated by changing surface residues of the hybridoma KS-1/4 to human counterparts as described below, with the purpose of removing potential human B cell epitopes. \nConstructs\n 1 through 3 were generated by transfecting mammalian cells with combinations of nucleic acids that expressed heavy and light chain V regions VH6, VH7, VK6, VK7, and VK8 as described in Table 4 and below.\n\n\n \n\n\n4A. Characterization of KS antibodies with fewer human T cell epitopes\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSequences VH2.1-VH2.5 were made to test whether certain amino acid insertions and substitutions in the region of the KS-1/4 heavy chain CDR3 could be tolerated. Expression vectors for the light and heavy chain combinations VK0/VH1, VK1/VH7, VK1/VH1, VK1/VH2, VK1/VH1-IL2, VK1/VH2-IL2, and VK1/VH2.5-IL2 were constructed and the corresponding antibodies and antibody-IL2 fusion proteins expressed and tested according to methods described in the preceding examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, sequences VH1, VH2, VK1, and VK2 were obtained by total chemical synthesis. For each of these sequences, a series of overlapping oligonucleotides that span the entire coding and complementary strands of these regions were chemically synthesized, phosphorylated, and ligated. The ligated duplex molecules were then amplified by PCR with appropriate primers to the fragment ends, introduced into pCRII vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the sequences verified. These DNA fragments were then introduced into the expression vector pdHL7 at appropriate sites to generate the complete heavy (\"H\") chain and light (\"L\") chain, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequence VH2.5 was derived from VH2 by the modification of a single codon to obtain a Thr rather than a Gln at position 108 (Table 4), using standard molecular biology techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies were tested by ELISA (Table 6) and using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore machine and software) to compare their ability to bind to EpCAM. Results of the ELISA experiments were considered to reflect primarily off-rate and not on-rate, and to be generally less precise, such that a poor ELISA result was generally used to exclude certain constructs from further consideration. However, antibodies that showed good binding by the ELISA test needed to be characterized further.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults of the surface plasmon resonance analysis were as follows:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFusion Protein\n \nk\non\n(M\n-1\ns\n-1\n)\n \nk\noff\n(s\n-1\n)\n \nK\nD\n(M)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVK8/VH7-IL2\n \n3.1 x 10\n5\n \n \n3.2 x 10\n-4\n \n \n1.0 x 10\n-9\n \n \n \n \nVK1/VH2-IL2\n \n1.7x10\n5\n \n \n5.3x10\n-4\n \n \n3.1x10\n-9\n \n \n \n \nVK1/VH1-IL2\n \n2.8x10\n5\n \n \n2.2x10\n-3\n \n \n7.9x10\n-9\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause the off-rate of VK1/VH1-IL2 was much faster than for VK1/V2-IL2 or VK8/VH7-IL2, VK1/VH1-IL2 was considered to be a less useful fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsidering that VK1/VH1-IL2 and VK1/VH1-IL2 differ only by the methionine/isoleucine difference at V\nH\n position 100 in CDR3, the enhanced off-rate of VK1/VH1-IL2 compared to VK1/VH2-IL2 suggests that this position makes a hydrophobic contact with EpCAM, and that the slightly longer methionine side-chain makes a less effective contact. In the field of protein-protein interactions, it is generally thought that hydrophobic interactions play a major role in determining off-rates but a much less significant role in determining on-rates.\n\n\n \n\n\n4B. Characterization of KS-1/4 variants with single amino acid insertions\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe importance of the CDR3 sequence in the heavy chain V region for the affinity of the KS antibody to EpCAM was determined with a series of variants that contained an amino acid insertion or substitution in this region. Sequences VH2.1, VH2.2, VH2.3, and VH2.4 were generated by manipulation of an expression vector encoding VH2 and VK1 using standard recombinant DNA techniques. The resulting expression vectors were transfected into NS/0 cells and secreted antibody proteins purified as described in preceding examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was found that the VH1 variant was suboptimal compared to the VH2 variant, indicating that the isoleucine in CDR3 could not be substituted with methionine. The next goal was to test whether insertion of an amino acid in CDR3 could yield a KS-1/4 heavy chain V region with better binding characteristics than VH1. The data in Table 6 compare the binding of VK1/VH2.1, VK1/VH2.2, VK1/VH2.3, and VK1/VH2.4, with VK1/VH1. It was found that none of the constructs with an amino acid insertion in the KS-1/4 V\nH\n CDR3 showed improved antigen binding compared to VH1, rather, antigen binding activity of the insertion mutants was either somewhat decreased or profoundly decreased.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese results indicate that insertion of amino acids in CDR3 generally is deleterious to the antigen binding activity of KS-1/4 heavy chain V regions. When this data is analyzed, some general conclusions emerge. Specifically, the segment of KS-1/4 V\nH\n amino acid at positions 84 to 108, consisting of the amino acids Asn-Asn-Leu-Arg-Asn-Glu-Asp-Met-Ala-Thr-Tyr-Phe-Cys-Val-Arg-Phe-Ile-Ser-Lys-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Trp-Gly-Gln, is important for KS-1/4 antigen binding. This segment includes a framework segment, Asn-Asn-Leu-Arg-Asn-Glu-Asp-Met-Ala-Thr-Tyr-Phe-Cys-Val-Arg, which is generally tolerant to single and multiple amino acid substitutions, but not tolerant to amino acid insertions, which may have a deleterious effect on expression and assembly. In addition, the data suggests that for the amino acids at positions 86, 91, 93, 94, and 95, it is preferable to have hydrophobic amino acids for an antibody that is efficiently expressed and binds to EpCAM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsertion of an amino acid in the V\nH\n CDR3 segment, consisting of Phe-Ile-Ser-Lys-Gly-Asp-Tyr, is generally deleterious to the EpCAM antigen-binding function of a KS-1/4 antibody, although some insertions can be tolerated with only partial loss of activity. Similarly, substitution of these positions is also generally deleterious to binding of the EpCAM antigen, although some insertions can be tolerated with only partial loss of activity.\n\n\n \n\n\n4C. Construction of active derivatives of KS-1/4 antibodies with mouse surface residues converted to their human counterparts\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies were prepared by substituting amino acids within the KS-1/4 antibody with amino acids commonly found in human antibodies in order to minimize the immunogenicity of the mouse-derived V regions. Preferred KS derivatives also retained specific binding affinity for human EpCAM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nConstruct\n 1.\n It was found that the KS-1/4 light chain most closely resembled human consensus subgroup III, and the heavy chain most closely resembled subgroup I. Based on these similarities, a conceptual sequence consisting of the human consensus subgroup amino acids and KS-1/4-derived CDRs and non-consensus amino acids was generated. For this and the following constructs a three-dimensional model was generated using a Silicon Graphics Workstation and BioSym molecular modeling software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInspection of the three-dimensional model revealed that certain human-derived amino acids were close to the CDRs and were likely to influence their conformation. Based on this analysis, in the light chain, human Ser22, Arg44, and Phe66 were changed back to Thr, Lys, and Tyr, respectively. In the heavy chain, it was believed such changes were unnecessary.. In the final design for \nConstruct\n 1, the light chain had 18 human amino acids not found in the mouse light chain, and the heavy chain had 22 human amino acids not found in the mouse heavy chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNAs for expression of \nConstruct\n 1 were created using synthetic oligonucleotides. The \nConstruct\n 1 protein was efficiently expressed but was found to be more than 10-fold less active in an EpCAM binding assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nConstruct 2.\n A less aggressive approach was then taken, by which only the following changes were introduced:\n\n \n \n \nLight chain: K18R, A79P\n \nHeavy chain: P9A, L11V, A76T, N88S, M91T\n \n\n\n \n \n \nDNAs for expression of Construct 2 were created using synthetic oligonucleotides and standard recombinant DNA techniques. The Construct 2 protein was not efficiently expressed. It was further found that the combination of Construct 2 light chain and mouse KS-1/4 heavy chain was not efficiently expressed, while the combination of Construct 2 heavy chain and mouse KS-1/4 light chain was efficiently expressed. Thus, the expression defect appeared to lie in the Construct 2 light chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nConstruct 3.\n Based on the apparent expression defect in the Construct 2 light chain, a new light chain was constructed by fusing the N-terminal portion of the light chain of \nConstruct\n 1 with the C-terminal portion of the mouse light chain. The KpnI site, which encodes the amino acids at positions 35 and 36, was used. When this light chain was combined with the Construct 2 heavy chain, efficient expression and no significant loss of binding was observed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause Construct 3 resulted in an antibody with superior properties in terms of protein expression and affinity for the antigen when compared to \nConstruct\n 1 or 2, DNA sequences of Construct 3 were inserted into pdHL7s-IL2, resulting in pdHL7s-VK8/VH7-IL2, which is disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 40. For expression purposes, this plasmid DNA was electroporated into mouse myeloma cells NS/0 to produce a stably transfected cell line as described in Example 1A. Culture medium taken from stable clones was then assayed for antibody expression in an ELISA coated with human Fc, as described in Example 1B. The amino acid sequences of the heavy and light chain for this antibody fusion protein are shown in SEQ ID NO: 41 and SEQ ID NO: 42, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the binding of iodinated VK8/VH7 and VK8/VH7-IL2 to EpCAM expressed on the surface of PC-3 tumor cells was compared to binding of iodinated VK0/VH0-IL2, using methods described in Example 1F. Within experimental error, essentially identical binding affinities were found for VK8/VH7 and VK0/VH0, and for VK8/VH7-IL2 and VK0/VH0-IL2.\n\n\n \n\n\n4D. Structure-function relationships useful in constructing active KS-1/4 antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTaken together, the antigen binding activities of KS-1/4 antibodies and fusion proteins with the disclosed V region sequences provide guidance in designing sequences of KS-1/4 antibodies to EpCAM, as well as for proper expression and secretion of KS-1/4 antibodies. In particular, the KS-1/4 heavy and light chain V regions can tolerate multiple amino acid substitutions and retain activity, provided that these amino acid substitutions are outside the CDRs. The KS-1/4 heavy and light chain V regions do not generally appear to tolerate amino acid insertions, especially within CDRs or in framework regions between CDRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, if the hybridoma KS-1/4 sequence is taken to be a starting, \"wild-type\" sequence, the data indicate that the heavy chain V region can tolerate amino acid substitutions at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 9, 11, 16, 17, 38, 40, 69, 70, 71, 72, 76, 79, 80, 83, 88, 91, and 111 with little or no loss of activity. Similarly, the light chain can tolerate amino acid substitutions at \n \npositions\n \n 1, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 21, 41, 42, 59, 71, 73, 75, 77, and 103 with little or no loss of activity. These changes are outside the CDRs of KS-1/4 heavy and light chain V regions. The 17 clearly acceptable heavy chain amino acid substitutions represent about 21% of the amino acid positions outside the CDRs, and about 68% of the amino acid positions outside the CDRs for which an amino acid substitution was attempted. Similarly, the eighteen clearly acceptable light chain amino acid substitutions represent about 23% of the amino acid positions outside the CDRs, and about 72% of the amino acid positions outside the CDRs for which an amino acid substitution was attempted. There were only two examples of an amino acid substitution outside of a CDR that resulted in a significantly less useful protein: the substitution Ala79Pro in the light chain, which appeared to have a negative impact on expression; and the substitution Q108T in the heavy chain, which had a negative impact on antigen binding. Thus, an amino acid substitution can be introduced into a KS-1/4 antibody heavy chain or light chain sequence outside of a CDR, and there is a high probability that the substitution will result in an active protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutations involving the substitution of an amino acid in a CDR often have a negative impact on antigen binding. For example, the substitution I100M in the heavy chain reduces binding by about 8-fold. Mutations that involve the insertion of an amino acid generally have a negative impact on the utility of a KS-1/4 sequence. For example, the VH2-'369 heavy chain V region is unable to assemble into a proper antibody with a light chain, as described herein. The VH2.1 to 2.4 mutations have an insertion of an amino acid in CDR3 of the heavy chain V region, and each of these mutations has a negative impact on antigen binding.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5. Immunogenicity of a KS Antibody (Construct 3)-IL2 Fusion Protein in Humans\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a human clinical trial, twenty two patients received one or more treatment regimes, with each treatment regime comprising three consecutive daily 4-hour intraveous infusions ofKS antibody (Construct 3)-IL2. Each treatment regime was separated by a month (\nWeber et al. (2001). Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncology 20:259a\n.). Serum samples were harvested from each patient before and after each treatment regime and tested for antibody reactivity against the whole KS Antibody (Construct 3)-IL2 molecule or the Fc-IL2 component (without the Fv region). No reactivity was observed in any of the pre-immune sera. The results indicated that only 4 patients experienced any significant immune response against either the Fv regions alone, or both the Fv regions and the Fc-IL2 component. Furthermore, these responses did not appear to be boosted upon subsequent exposure to huKS-IL2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is believed that the use of the antibody-IL2 fusion protein constitutes a particularly stringent test of the immunogenicity of the V region, because the interleukin-2 moiety has an adjuvant effect. Accordingly, the results indicate that the KS Antibody (Construct 3) may be administered to humans with only a small number of recipients apparently developing an antibody response to the KS antibody (Construct 3)-IL2 fusion protein. These results are particularly encouraging in view of the fact that the KS antibody (Construct 3) contains a variable region that is almost entirely murine in origin but with a few amino acid residues replaced with the corresponding human amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects illustrative rather than limiting on the invention described herein.\n\n\n \nSEQUENCE LISTING\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n<110> Gillies, Stephen Lo, Kin-Ming Qian, Xiugi Lexigen Pharmaceuticals Corp.\n\n\n<120> Recombinant Tumor Specific Antibody And Use Thereof\n\n\n<130> LEX-019PC\n\n\n<150> \n \n \nUS\n 60/288,564\n \n \n\n<151> 2001-05-03\n\n\n<160> 42\n\n\n<170> PatentIn version 3.0\n\n\n<210> 1\n\n<211> 106\n\n<212> PRT\n\n<213> Artificial sequence\n\n\n<220>\n\n<223> KS VK mouse\n\n\n<400> 1\n\n \n\n\n<210> 2\n\n<211> 106\n\n<212> PRT\n\n<213> Artificial sequence\n\n\n<220>\n\n<223> KS VH mouse\n\n\n<400> 2\n\n\n\n \n\n\n<210> 3\n\n<211> 106\n\n<212> PRT\n\n<213> Artificial sequence\n\n\n<220>\n\n<223> variable light chain sequence in the EpCAM antibody\n\n\n<220>\n\n<221> misc_feature\n\n<222> (1) ..

It further relates to methods for using anti-NGF antibody molecules in diagnosis or treatment of NGF related disorders, including pain, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, other diseases of airway inflammation, diabetic neuropathy, cardiac arrhythmias, HIV, arthritis, psoriasis and cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides antibody molecules of particular value in binding and neutralising NGF, and thus of use in any of a variety of therapeutic treatments, as indicated by the experimentation contained herein and further by the supporting technical literature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNerve growth factor (β-NGF, commonly known as NGF) plays a well-known pivotal role in the development of the nervous system. In the adult, however, NGF plays a more restricted role, where it promotes the health and survival of a subset of central and peripheral neurons (Huang & Reichardt, 2001). NGF also contributes to the modulation of the functional characteristics of these neurons. As part of this latter process, NGF exerts tonic control over the sensitivity, or excitability, of nociceptors (Priestley et al., 2002; Bennett, 2001). These peripheral neurons sense and transmit to the central nervous system the various noxious stimuli that ultimately give rise to perceptions of pain (nociception). Thus, agents that reduce levels of NGF may possess utility as analgesic therapeutics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe societal cost of inadequately treated pain further supports the potential utility of analgesics based on anti-NGF activity. That is, despite the existence and widespread use of numerous pain medications, a clear need exists for new analgesics. Pain is one of the most common symptoms for which medical assistance is sought and is the primary complaint of half of all patients visiting a physician. The high cost of pain to society is well documented. In the U.S., for example, chronic pain afflicts some 34 million Americans. Pain results in 50 million workdays lost each year. Direct medical costs attributed to back pain, arthritic pain, and migraine amount to $40 billion annually alone. The total prescription pain medication market is approximately $15 billion per year (Pleuvry & Pleuvry).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs these statistics imply, a substantial percentage of pain sufferers fail to receive adequate pain relief. As a consequence, a large medical need remains for safe and effective analgesics with novel mechanisms of action (Pleuvry & Pleuvry).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic agents that reduce the tissue levels or inhibit the effects of secreted NGF have the potential to be just such novel analgesics. Subcutaneous injections of NGF itself produce pain in humans and animals. Thus, injected NGF causes a rapid thermal hyperalgesia, followed by delayed thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia (Petty et al., 1994; McArthur et al., 2000). Endogenously secreted NGF is similarly pro-nociceptive. Tissue-injury-induced release of NGF and its subsequent action in the periphery plays a major role in the induction of thermal hyperalgesia through the process of 'peripheral sensitization' (Mendell & Arvanian, 2002). Tissue injury promotes the release of pro-nociceptive and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which, in turn, induce the release of NGF from keratinocytes and fibroblasts. This released NGF acts directly on nociceptors to induce painful or nociceptive states within minutes of the noxious insult. This NGF also acts indirectly to induce and maintain nociceptive/pain states. It triggers mast cell degranulation, releasing pro-nociceptive agents such as histamine and serotonin and, importantly, more NGF, and can also stimulate sympathetic nerve terminals to release pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters, such as noradrenaline (Ma & Woolf, 1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTissue levels of NGF are elevated in CFA- and carrageenan-injected animals (Ma & Woolf, 1997; Amann & Schuligoi, 2000). Moreover, increased levels of NGF have been documented in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (Aloe & Tuveri, 1997) or cystitis (Lowe et al., 1997). In rodents, peripheral nerve injury increases the expression of NGF mRNA in macrophages, fibroblasts, and Schwann cells (Heumann et al., 1987). Over-expression of NGF in transgenic mice results in enhanced neuropathic pain behavior following nerve injury above that of wild-type mice (Ramer et al., 1998). Over hours and days, elevated NGF levels play a role in promoting 'central sensitization' - the enhancement of neurotransmission at synapses in the nociceptive pathways of the spinal cord. Central sensitization results in persistent and chronic hyperalgesia and allodynia. This process is thought to involve internalization of complexes of NGF and its high affinity receptor, trkA (tyrosine receptor kinase A). Retrograde transport of these complexes to nociceptor cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) potentiates secretion of nociceptive neuropeptides (e.g., substance P, CGRP), PKC activation, and NMDA receptor activation in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (Sah et al., 2003) - all processes that promote the sensitization of the nociceptive pathways. NGF also plays a role in the up-regulation and re-distribution of voltage-dependent and ligand-gated ion channels, including sodium channel subtypes and the capsaicin receptor, VR1 (Mamet et al., 1999; Fjell et al., 1999; Priestley et al., 2002). The altered activities and/or expression of transmitters, receptors, and ion channels underlie the increased sensitivity and excitability of nociceptors associated with neuropathic pain states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNGF can also promote the sprouting of sympathetic neurons and the formation of aberrant innervation of nociceptive neurons. This innervation is thought to contribute to the induction and maintenance of chronic nociceptive/pain states, such as sympathetically maintained pain, or complex regional pain syndrome (Ramer et al., 1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNGF-induced nociception/pain is mediated by the high affinity NGF receptor, trkA (tyrosine receptor kinase A) (Sah, et al., 2003). About 40 - 45% of nociceptor cell bodies in DRGs express trkA. These are the cell bodies of the small diameter fibers, or C-fibers, that also express the secreted pro-nociceptive peptides, substance P and CGRP. These fibers terminate in laminae I and II of the dorsal horn, where they transfer to the central nervous system the noxious stimuli sensed by peripheral nociceptors. Mutations or deletions in the trkA gene produce a phenotype characterized by loss of pain sensation both in humans (Indo, 2002) and in trkA knock-out mice (de Castro et al., 1998). Significantly, the expression of trkA is up-regulated in animals subjected to models of arthritic (Pozza et al., 2000) or cystitic pain (Qiao & Vizzard, 2002), or the inflammatory pain induced by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or carrageenan into the paw (Cho et al., 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNGF also binds to the p75 neurotrophin receptor. The role of the p75 receptor is dependent on its cellular environment and the presence of other receptors with which it is believed to play an accessory or co-receptor function. Interaction between the trkA and p75 receptors results in the formation of high affinity binding sites for NGF. The importance of such receptor interactions in NGF-mediated pain signalling is not clear, but recent studies have implicated the p75 receptor in cellular processes that may be relevant (Zhang & Nicol, 2004). However, whilst p75 receptor knockout mice display elevated thresholds to noxious stimuli, they remain responsive to the hyperalgesic effects of NGF, suggesting that trkA receptors alone are sufficient to mediate these effects (Bergmann \net al\n., 1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe evidence cited above indicates that NGF-mediated processes are responsible for the induction of acute pain, short-term pain, persistent nociceptive pain, and persistent or chronic neuropathic pain. Thus, anti-NGF agents are indicated as having utility as effective analgesics for treating sufferers of any or all of these various pain states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne such anti-NGF agent is trkA-Fc, which acts as a decoy or scavenger to bind up, and thereby inactivate, endogenous NGF. TrkA-Fc is a fusion protein consisting of the NGF binding region of trkA linked to a constant domain fragment (Fc) of an IgG antibody. TrkA-Fc produces hypoalgesia in naive animals, decreases nociceptor responses, and decreases sprouting of unmyelinated pain-sensing neurons (Bennett et al., 1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntisera raised against NGF can also reduce NGF levels when injected locally or systemically. Both anti-NGF antisera and trkA-Fc attenuate carrageenan- or CFA-induced inflammatory paw pain (Koltzenberg et al., 1999) and inflamed bladder responses in rats (Jaggar et al., 1999). Anti-NGF antiserum blocks heat and cold hyperalgesia, reverses established thermal hyperalgesia, and prevents collateral sprouting in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain (Woolf, 1996; Ro et al., 1999). Small molecule inhibitors of the trkA-NGF interaction have also been reported. In rats, the NGF-trkA inhibitor ALE-0540 reduces hyperalgesia in a thermally-induced inflammatory pain model and in the formalin test of acute and persistent pain (Owolabi et al., 1999). ALE-0540 also reduces mechanical allodynia in the sciatic nerve injury model of neuropathic pain (Owolabi et al., 1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic antibodies in general hold out the promise of a degree of target selectivity within a family of closely related receptors, receptor ligands, channels, or enzymes that is rarely attainable with small molecule drugs. NGF-mediated pain is particularly well suited to safe and effective treatment with antibodies because NGF levels increase in the periphery in response to noxious stimuli and antibodies have low blood-brain barrier permeability. Whilst polyclonal antibodies have been shown to be effective in animal models of pain, anti-NGF monoclonal antibodies are more likely to be successfully developed as human therapeutics due to the advantages in manufacturing and characterizing a consistent, well-defined, chemical, entity. The anti-nociceptive effects of mouse anti-NGF monoclonal antibodies (Sammons et al., 2000) have been reported, but the amino acid sequences of these antibodies were not provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent evidence suggests that NGF promotes other pathologies in addition to pain. Thus, anti-NGF antibodies may also possess utility for treating other NGF-mediated diseases, including but not limited to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, other diseases of airway inflammation (Hoyle, 2003; Lommatzch et al., 2003), diabetic neuropathy (Yasuda et al., 2003), cardiac arrhythmias (\n \nWO04/032852\n \n), HIV (Garaci et al., 2003), arthritis, psoriasis and cancer (Nakagawara, 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO02/09645\n \n relates to anti-NGF antibodies, in particular mouse monoclonal antibody 911, and use of such antibodies in treatment of various NGF-related disorders, including pain, asthma, arthritis and psoriasis. It states that the antibody 911 had no adverse effect on the immune system in an experimental mouse model of allergy. These antibodies were also described by Hongo et al., 2000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO04/03287\n \n describes the pain-reducing effect of the mouse monoclonal NGF antibody mab 911 and humanized NGF antibody E3 in experimental models of post-operative pain. E3 differs from human heavy chain gamma2a constant region by 2 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO04/03285\n \n describes methods for preventing sudden cardiac death and for treatment of cardiac arryhthmias using NGF antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO 01/78698\n \n describes the use of polyclonal antiserum to NGF to treat chronic visceral pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides specific binding members for NGF, preferably human NGF. Thus, a specific binding member of the invention may bind human NGF or non-human NGF (e.g. non-human primate NGF and/or rat NGF and/or mouse NGF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding members of the invention may be antibodies to human NGF, especially human antibodies, which may be cross-reactive with non-human NGF, including non-human primate NGF and/or mouse NGF and/or rat NGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA specific binding member in accordance with the present invention preferably neutralises NGF. Neutralisation means reduction or inhibition of biological activity of NGF, e.g. reduction or inhibition of NGF binding to one or more of its receptors (preferably TrkA). The reduction in biological activity may be partial or total. The degree to which an antibody neutralises NGF is referred to as its neutralising potency. Potency may be determined or measured using one or more assays known to the skilled person and/or as described or referred to herein, for example:\n\n \n \n \n\"FLIPR\" calcium mobilisation assay (see Example 2 herein)\n \nPC12 survival assay (see Example 5 herein)\n \nTF-1 proliferation assay (see Example 6 herein)\n \nReceptor binding inhibition assay (see Example 9 herein).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAssays and potencies are described in more detail elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding members of the present invention may be optimised for neutralising potency. Generally potency optimisation involves mutating the sequence of a selected specific binding member (normally the variable domain sequence of an antibody) to generate a library of specific binding members, which are then assayed for potency and the more potent specific binding members are selected. Thus selected \"potency-optimised\" specific binding members tend to have a higher potency than the specific binding member from which the library was generated. Nevertheless, high potency specific binding members may also be obtained without optimisation, for example a high potency specific binding member may be obtained directly from an initial screen e.g. a biochemical neutralisation assay. The present invention provides both potency-optimised and non-optimised specific binding members, as well as methods for potency optimisation from a selected specific binding member. The present invention thus allows the skilled person to generate specific binding members having high potency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA specific binding member in accordance with the present invention preferably exhibits antihyperalgesic and/or antiallodynic activity, e.g. inhibits carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a specific binding member of the invention comprises an antibody molecule. In other embodiments, a specific binding member of the invention comprises an antigen-binding site within a non-antibody molecule, e.g. a set of CDRs in a non-antibody protein scaffold, as discussed further below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various aspects and embodiments of the invention there is provided the subject-matter of the claims included below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred embodiments within the present invention are antibody molecules, whether whole antibody (e.g. IgG, such as IgG4) or antibody fragments (e.g. scFv, Fab, dAb). Preferably, an antibody molecule of the invention is a human antibody molecule. Antibody molecules comprising antibody antigen-binding sites are provided, as are antibody VH and VL domains. Within VH and VL domains are provided complementarity determining regions, (\"CDRs\"), and framework regions, (\"FRs\"), to form VH or VL domains as the case may be. An antibody antigen-binding site may consist of an antibody VH domain and/or a VL domain. All VH and VL sequences, CDR sequences, sets of CDRs and sets of HCDRs and sets of LCDRs disclosed herein represent aspects and embodiments of the invention. A \"set of CDRs\" comprises CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3. Thus, a set of HCDRs means HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3, and a set of LCDRs means LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3. Unless otherwise stated, a \"set of CDRs\" includes HCDRs and LCDRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of antibody VH and VL domains and CDRs according to the present invention are as listed in the appended sequence listing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of antibody lineages are disclosed herein, defined with reference to sequences, e.g. a set of CDR sequences, optionally with one or more, e.g. one or two, or two substitutions. The preferred parent lineage is the 1021E5 lineage. The 1021E5 lineage includes the preferred antibody molecule 1133C11 and other antibody molecules of the \"1133C11 lineage\", including 1252A5. Also within the 1021E5 parent lineage are antibody molecules 1165D4, 1230H7 and 1152H5. The present inventors have identified the 1021E5, 1083H4 and especially the 1133C11 lineages as providing human antibody antigen-binding sites against NGF that are of particular value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 1133C11 lineage is defined with reference to a set of six CDR sequences of 1133C11 as follows: HCDR1 SEQ ID NO: 193, HCDR2 SEQ ID NO: 194, HCDR3 SEQ ID NO: 195, LCDR1 SEQ ID NO: 198, LCDR2 SEQ ID NO: 199, and LCDR3 SEQ ID NO: 200. The set of CDRs wherein the HCDR1 has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 193, the HCDR2 has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 194, the HCDR3 has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 195, the LCDR1 has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 198, the LCDR2 has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 199, and the LCDR3 has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 200, are herein referred to as the \"1133C11 set of CDRs\". The HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3 within the 1133C11 set of CDRs are referred to as the \"1133C11 set of HCDRs\" and the LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3 within the 1133C11 set of CDRs are referred to as the \"1133C11 set of LCDRs\". A set of CDRs with the 1133C11 set of CDRs, 1133C11 set of HCDRs or 1133C11 LCDRs, or one or two substitutions therein, is said to be of the 1133C11 lineage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther preferred lineages and sets of CDRs are defined with reference to the analogous CDRs as set out anywhere herein, including as preferred embodiments the sets of CDRs disclosed in Table 2a (with SEQ ID NOS as set out in Table 2b). Table 2a and Table 2b show sets of CDRs (HCDRs and LCDRs) from optimised clones derived from clone 1021E5, illustrating how the CDR sequences of the optimised clones differ from those of 1021E5. A set of CDRs from Table 2a/2b includes a set of HCDRs and/or a set of LCDRs from any clone illustrated in the Table, optionally including 1021E5 itself.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSets of CDRs of these are provided, as indicated, as are sets of CDRs with the disclosed sequences containing one or two amino acid substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides specific binding members and antibody molecules comprising the defined sets of CDRs, set of HCDRs or set of LCDRs, as disclosed herein, and sets of CDRs of with one or two substitutions within the disclosed set of CDRs. The relevant set of CDRs is provided within an antibody framework or other protein scaffold, e.g. fibronectin or cytochrome B (Koide et al., 1998; Nygren et al., 1997), as discussed below. Preferably antibody framework regions are employed. For example, one or more CDRs or a set of CDRs of an antibody may be grafted into a framework (e.g. human framework) to provide an antibody molecule or different antibody molecules. For example, an antibody molecule may comprise CDRs of an antibody of the 1021E5 lineage and framework regions of human germline gene segment sequences. An antibody of a lineage may be provided with a set of CDRs within a framework which may be subject to \"germlining\", where one or more residues within the framework are changed to match the residues at the equivalent position in the most similar human germline framework (e.g. DP10 from the VH1 family) or a framework of the λ1 family e.g. DPL5. Thus, antibody framework regions are preferably germline and/or human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides an isolated human antibody specific for NGF, having a VH domain comprising a set of HCDRs in a human germline framework comprising DP10. Normally the specific binding member also has a VL domain comprising a set of LCDRs, preferably in a human germline framework comprising a Vλ1, e.g. DPL5. Preferably, the CDRs are a set of CDRs disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"substantially as set out\" it is meant that the relevant CDR or VH or VL domain of the invention will be either identical or highly similar to the specified regions of which the sequence is set out herein. By \"highly similar\" it is contemplated that from 1 to 5, preferably from 1 to 4 such as 1 to 3 or 1 or 2, or 3 or 4, amino acid substitutions may be made in the CDR and/or VH or VL domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a specific binding member for NGF, comprising an antibody antigen-binding site which is composed of a human antibody VH domain and a human antibody VL domain and which comprises a set of CDRs, wherein the VH domain comprises HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3 and the VL domain comprises LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3, wherein the HCDR1 has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 193, the HCDR2 has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 194, the HCDR3 has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 195, the LCDR1 has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 198, the LCDR2 has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 199, and the LCDR3 has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 200; or wherein the set of CDRs contains one or two amino acid substitutions compared with this set of CDRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the invention provides a specific binding member for NGF, comprising an antibody antigen-binding site which is composed of a human antibody VH domain and a human antibody VL domain and which comprises a set of CDRs, wherein the set of CDRs is the 1133C11 set of CDRs or other set of CDRs disclosed herein, or a set of CDRs containing one or two substitutions compared with the 1133C11 set of CDRs or other set of CDRs disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, the one or two substitutions are at one or two of the following residues within the CDRs of the VH and/or VL domains, using the standard numbering of Kabat (1991).\n\n31, 34 in HCDR1\n\n51, 55, 56, 57, 58, 65 in HCDR2\n\n96 in HCDR3\n\n26, 27, 27A, 27B, 28, 29, 30 in LCDR1\n\n56 in LCDR2\n\n90, 94 in LCDR3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments one or two substitutions are made at one or two of the following residues within the 1133C11 set of CDRs in accordance with the identified groups of possible substitute residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPosition of substitution\n \nSubstitute Residue selected from the group consisting of\n \n \n \n \n31 in HCDR1:\n \nA\n \n \n \n34 in HCDR1:\n \nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n51 in HCDR2:\n \nV\n \n \n \n55 in HCDR2:\n \nN\n \n \n \n56 in HCDR2:\n \nA\n \n \n \n57 in HCDR2:\n \nV\n \n \n \n58 in HCDR2:\n \nS\n \n \n \n65 in HCDR2:\n \nD\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n96 in HCDR3:\n \nN\n \n \n \n26 in LCDR1:\n \nT\n \n \n \n26 in LCDR1:\n \nG\n \n \n \n27 in LCDR1:\n \nN\n \n \n \n27 in LCDR1:\n \nR\n \n \n \n27A in LCDR1:\n \nT\n \n \n \n27A in LCDR1:\n \nP\n \n \n \n27B in LCDR1:\n \nD\n \n \n \n28 in LCDR1:\n \nT\n \n \n \n29 in LCDR1:\n \n \nE\n \n \n \n \n30 in LCDR1:\n \nD\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n56 in LCDR2:\n \n \nT\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n90 in LCDR3:\n \nA\n \n \n \n94 in LCDR3:\n \nG.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nResidue 29E within LCDR1 is a particularly preferred embodiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred embodiments have the 1133C11 or 1252A5, 1152H5, 1165D4, 1230H7 or 1021E5 set of CDRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment an isolated specific binding member comprises a set of CDRs which contains the 1133C11 set of CDRs with the amino acid sequence FNSALIS (SEQ ID NO: 532) or the amino acid sequence MISSLQP (SEQ ID NO: 533), substituted for the amino acid sequence LNPSLTA (SEQ ID NO: 531) within HCDR3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny set of HCDRs of the lineages disclosed herein can be provided in a VH domain that is used as a specific binding member alone or in combination with a VL domain.

In a further highly preferred embodiment, a VL domain is provided with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 197, this being termed \"1133C11 VL domain\". A highly preferred antibody antigen-binding site provided in accordance with the present invention is composed of the 1133C11 VH domain, SEQ ID NO: 192, and the 1133C11 VL domain, SEQ ID NO: 197. This antibody antigen-binding site may be provided within any desired antibody molecule format, e.g. scFv, Fab, IgG, IgG4 etc., as is discussed further elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further highly preferred embodiment, a VH domain is provided with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 392, this being termed \"1252A5 VH domain\". In a further highly preferred embodiment, a VL domain is provided with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 397, this being termed \"1252A5 VL domain\". A highly preferred antibody antigen-binding site provided in accordance with the present invention is composed of the 1252A5 VH domain, SEQ ID NO: 392, and the 1252A5 VL domain, SEQ ID NO: 397. This antibody antigen-binding site may be provided within any desired antibody molecule format, e.g. scFv, Fab, IgG, IgG4 etc., as is discussed further elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further highly preferred embodiment, the present invention provides an IgG4 antibody molecule comprising the 1252A5 VH domain, SEQ ID NO: 392, and the 1252A5 VL domain, SEQ ID NO: 397. This is termed herein \"1252A5 IgG4\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther IgG or other antibody molecules comprising the 1252A5 VH domain, SEQ ID NO: 392, and/or the 1252A5 VL domain, SEQ ID NO: 397, are provided by the present invention, as are other antibody molecules comprising the 1252A5 set of HCDRs (SEQ ID NOS: 393, 394 and 395) within an antibody VH domain, and/or the 1252A5 set of LCDRs (SEQ ID NOS: 398, 399 and 400) within an antibody VL domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted, the present invention provides a specific binding member which binds human NGF and which comprises the 1252A5 VH domain (SEQ ID NO: 392) and/or the 1,252A5 VL domain (SEQ ID NO: 397). Properties of such a specific binding member are disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, a VH domain is paired with a VL domain to provide an antibody antigen-binding site, although as discussed further below a VH domain alone may be used to bind antigen. In one preferred embodiment, the 1252A5 VH domain (SEQ ID NO: 392) is paired with the 1252A5 VL domain (SEQ ID NO: 397), so that an antibody antigen-binding site is formed comprising both the 1252A5 VH and VL domains. Analogous embodiments are provided for the other VH and VL domains disclosed herein. In other embodiments, the 1252A5 VH is paired with a VL domain other than the 1252A5 VL. Light-chain promiscuity is well established in the art. Again, analogous embodiments are provided by the invention for the other VH and VL domains disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariants of the VH and VL domains and CDRs of the present invention, including those for which amino acid sequences are set out herein, and which can be employed in specific binding members for NGF can be obtained by means of methods of sequence alteration or mutation and screening. Such methods are also provided by the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with further aspects of the present invention there is provided a specific binding member which competes for binding to antigen with any specific binding member which both binds the antigen and comprises a specific binding member, VH and/or VL domain disclosed herein, or HCDR3 disclosed herein, or variant of any of these. Competition between binding members may be assayed easily \nin vitro,\n for example using ELISA and/or by tagging a specific reporter molecule to one binding member which can be detected in the presence of one or more other untagged binding members, to enable identification of specific binding members which bind the same epitope or an overlapping epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, a further aspect of the present invention provides a specific binding member comprising a human antibody antigen-binding site that competes with an antibody molecule, for example especially 1252A5 or other preferred scFv and/or IgG4, for binding to NGF. In further aspects the present invention provides a specific binding member comprising a human antibody antigen-binding site which competes with an antibody antigen-binding site for binding to NGF, wherein the antibody antigen-binding site is composed of a VH domain and a VL domain, and wherein the VH and VL domains comprise a set of CDRs of the 1133C11, 1021E5, 1252A5 or other lineage, disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious methods are available in the art for obtaining antibodies against NGF and which may compete with a 1252A5 or other antibody molecule, an antibody molecule with a 1252A5 or other set of CDRs, or an antibody molecule with a set of CDRs of 1252A5 or other lineage, for binding to NGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of obtaining one or more specific binding members able to bind the antigen, the method including bringing into contact a library of specific binding members according to the invention and said antigen, and selecting one or more specific binding members of the library able to bind said antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe library may be displayed on particles or molecular complexes, e.g. replicable genetic packages such as yeast, bacterial or bacteriophage (e.g. T7) particles, or covalent, ribosomal or other \nin vitro\n display systems, each particle or molecular complex containing nucleic acid encoding the antibody VH variable domain displayed on it, and optionally also a displayed VL domain if present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing selection of specific binding members able to bind the antigen and displayed on bacteriophage or other library particles or molecular complexes, nucleic acid may be taken from a bacteriophage or other particle or molecular complex displaying a said selected specific binding member. Such nucleic acid may be used in subsequent production of a specific binding member or an antibody VH or VL variable domain by expression from nucleic acid with the sequence of nucleic acid taken from a bacteriophage or other particle or molecular complex displaying a said selected specific binding member.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody VH variable domain with the amino acid sequence of an antibody VH variable domain of a said selected specific binding member may be provided in isolated form, as may a specific binding member comprising such a VH domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbility to bind NGF may be further tested, also ability to compete with e.g. 1252A5 (e.g. in scFv format and/or IgG format, e.g. IgG4) for binding to NGF. Ability to neutralise NGF may be tested, as discussed further below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA specific binding member according to the present invention may bind NGF with the affinity of a 1252A5 or other antibody molecule, e.g. scFv, or preferably 1252A5 or other IgG4, or with an affinity that is better.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA specific binding member according to the present invention may neutralise NGF with the potency of a 1252A5 or other antibody molecule, e.g. scFv, or preferably 1252A5 or other IgG4, or with a potency that is better.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding affinity and neutralisation potency of different specific binding members can be compared under appropriate conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention have a number of advantages over existing commercially available anti-NGF antibodies. For example, the present invention provides human or germlined antibodies, which are expected to display a lower degree of immunogenicity when chronically or repeatedly administered to humans for therapeutic or diagnostic use. Further, the present invention provides antibodies that are more potent neutralisers of NGF and therefore a desired therapeutic or diagnostic effect may be achieved using less antibody material. In addition, in one embodiment of the invention, the potency for inhibition of the NGF/TrKA receptor interaction is greater than that observed for inhibition of the NGF/p75 receptor interaction. This may confer advantages over other apparently non-selective NGF antagonist treatments in this regard, either in the magnitude or nature of the therapeutic effect achieved, or in reducing undesirable side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides heterogeneous preparations comprising anti-NGF antibody molecules. For example, such preparations may be mixtures of antibodies with full-length heavy chains and heavy chains lacking the C-terminal lysine, with various degrees of glycosylation and/or with derivatized amino acids, such as cyclization of an N-terminal glutamic acid to form a pyroglutamic acid residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further aspects, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid which comprises a sequence encoding a specific binding member, VH domain and/or VL domains according to the present invention, and methods of preparing a specific binding member, a VH domain and/or a VL domain of the invention, which comprise expressing said nucleic acid under conditions to bring about production of said specific binding member, VH domain and/or VL domain, and recovering it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the present invention provides nucleic acid, generally isolated, encoding an antibody VH variable domain and/or VL variable domain disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention provides nucleic acid, generally isolated, encoding a VH CDR or VL CDR sequence disclosed herein, especially a VH CDR selected from: 1133C11 (VH CDR1 SEQ ID NO: 193, VH CDR2 SEQ ID NO: 194, and VH CDR3 SEQ ID NO: 195), 1152H5(VH CDR1 SEQ ID NO: 263, VH CDR2 SEQ ID NO: 264, and VH CDR3 SEQ ID NO: 265), and 1252A5 (VH CDR1 SEQ ID NO: 393, VH CDR2 SEQ ID NO: 394, and VH CDR3 SEQ ID NO: 395), or a VL CDR selected from: 1133C11(VL CDR1 SEQ ID NO: 198, VL CDR2 SEQ ID NO: 199, and VL CDR3 SEQ ID NO: 200), 1152H5 (VL CDR1 SEQ ID NO: 268, VL CDR2 SEQ ID NO: 269, and VL CDR3 SEQ ID NO: 270), and 1252A5 (VL CDR1 SEQ ID NO: 398, VL CDR2 SEQ ID NO: 399, and VL CDR3 SEQ ID NO: 400), most preferably 1252A5 VH CDR3 (SEQ ID NO: 395). Nucleic acid encoding the 1252A5 set of CDRs, nucleic acid encoding the 1252A5 set of HCDRs and nucleic acid encoding the 1252A5 set of LCDRs are also provided by the present invention, as are nucleic acids encoding individual CDRs, HCDRs, LCDRs and sets of CDRs, HCDRs, LCDRs of the 1252A5, 1133C11 or 1021E5 lineage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect provides a host cell transformed with nucleic acid of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA yet further aspect provides a method of production of an antibody VH variable domain, the method including causing expression from encoding nucleic acid. Such a method may comprise culturing host cells under conditions for production of said antibody VH variable domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalogous methods for production of VL variable domains and specific binding members comprising a VH and/or VL domain are provided as further aspects of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method of production may comprise a step of isolation and/or purification of the product. A method of production may comprise formulating the product into a composition including at least one additional component, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther aspects of the present invention provide for compositions containing specific binding members of the invention, and their use in methods of inhibiting or neutralising NGF, including methods of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding members according to the invention may be used in a method of treatment or diagnosis of the human or animal body, such as a method of treatment (which may include prophylactic treatment) of a disease or disorder in a human patient which comprises administering to said patient an effective amount of a specific binding member of the invention. Conditions treatable in accordance with the present invention include any in which NGF plays a role, especially pain, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, other diseases of airway inflammation, diabetic neuropathy, HIV, cardiac arrhythmias, arthritis, psoriasis and cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese and other aspects of the invention are described in further detail below.\n\n\n \n\n\nTERMINOLOGY\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is convenient to point out here that \"and/or\" where used herein is to be taken as specific disclosure of each of the two specified features or components with or without the other. For example \"A and/or B\" is to be taken as specific disclosure of each of (i) A, (ii) B and (iii) A and B, just as if each is set out individually herein.\n\n\n \n\n\nNGF\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nNGF (also known as beta-NGF) is nerve growth factor. In the context of the present invention, NGF is normally human NGF, although it may be non-human NGF (e.g. non-human primate NGF and/or rat NGF and/or mouse NGF). NGF is also referred to in places as \"the antigen\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNGF used in an assay described herein is normally human, rat or mouse NGF, but NGF from another non-human animal could be used, e.g. non-human primate NGF.\n\n\n \nPain\n\n\n \n \n \nThis describes, as is well known in the art, sensation of pain, and may encompass one or more, or all, of the following:\n\n \n \n \nhyperalgesia (exaggerated pain response to a normally painful stimulus);\n \nallodynia (sensation of pain caused by a stimulus that is not normally painful);\n \nspontaneous sensation of pain caused by any mechanism in the absence of any apparent external influence;\n \npain evoked by physical stimuli, such as heat, warmth, cold, pressure, vibration, static or dynamic touch, or body posture and movement;\n \nsomatic and visceral pain caused by any mechanism, for example, trauma, infection, inflammation, metabolic disease, stroke or neurological disease.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nPain may for example be acute pain, short-term pain, persistent nociceptive pain, or persistent or chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n\n \n\n\nSpecific binding member\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis describes a member of a pair of molecules that have binding specificity for one another. The members of a specific binding pair may be naturally derived or wholly or partially synthetically produced. One member of the pair of molecules has an area on its surface, or a cavity, which specifically binds to and is therefore complimentary to a particular spatial and polar organisation of the other member of the pair of molecules. Thus the members of the pair have the property of binding specifically to each other. Examples of types of specific binding pairs are antigen-antibody, biotin-avidin, hormone-hormone receptor, receptor-ligand, enzyme-substrate. The present invention is concerned with antigen-antibody type reactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA specific binding member normally comprises a molecule having an antigen-binding site. For example, a specific binding member may be an antibody molecule or a non-antibody protein that comprises an antigen-binding site. An antigen binding site may be provided by means of arrangement of CDRs on non-antibody protein scaffolds such as fibronectin or cytochrome B etc. (Haan & Maggos, 2004; Koide et al., 1998; Nygren et al., 1997), or by randomising or mutating amino acid residues of a loop within a protein scaffold to confer binding specificity for a desired target. Scaffolds for engineering novel binding sites in proteins have been reviewed in detail by Nygren et al. (1997). Protein scaffolds for antibody mimics are disclosed in \n \nWO/0034784\n \n in which the inventors describe proteins (antibody mimics) that include a fibronectin type III domain having at least one randomised loop. A suitable scaffold into which to graft one or more CDRs, e.g. a set of HCDRs, may be provided by any domain member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. The scaffold may be a human or non-human protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn advantage of a non-antibody protein scaffold is that it may provide an antigen-binding site in a scaffold molecule that is smaller and/or easier to manufacture than at least some antibody molecules. Small size of a specific binding member may confer useful physiological properties such as an ability to enter cells, penetrate deep into tissues or reach targets within other structures, or to bind within protein cavities of the target antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUse of antigen binding sites in non-antibody protein scaffolds is reviewed in Wess, 2004. Typical are proteins having a stable backbone and one or more variable loops, in which the amino acid sequence of the loop or loops is specifically or randomly mutated to create an antigen-binding site having specificity for binding the target antigen. Such proteins include the IgG-binding domains of protein A from S. aureus, transferrin, tetranectin, fibronectin (e.g. 10th fibronectin type III domain) and lipocalins. Other approaches include synthetic \"Microbodies\" (Selecore GmbH), which are based on cyclotides - small proteins having intra-molecular disulphide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to antibody sequences and/or an antigen-binding site, a specific binding member according to the present invention may comprise other amino acids, e.g. forming a peptide or polypeptide, such as a folded domain, or to impart to the molecule another functional characteristic in addition to ability to bind antigen. Specific binding members of the invention may carry a detectable label, or may be conjugated to a toxin or a targeting moiety or enzyme (e.g. via a peptidyl bond or linker). For example, a specific binding member may comprise a catalytic site (e.g. in an enzyme domain) as well as an antigen binding site, wherein the antigen binding site binds to the antigen and thus targets the catalytic site to the antigen. The catalytic site may inhibit biological function of the antigen, e.g. by cleavage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough, as noted, CDRs can be carried by scaffolds such as fibronectin or cytochrome B (Haan & Maggos, 2004; Koide et al., 1998; Nygren et al., 1997), the structure for carrying a CDR or a set of CDRs of the invention will generally be of an antibody heavy or light chain sequence or substantial portion thereof in which the CDR or set of CDRs is located at a location corresponding to the CDR or set of CDRs of naturally occurring VH and VL antibody variable domains encoded by rearranged immunoglobulin genes. The structures and locations of immunoglobulin variable domains may be determined by reference to (Kabat, et al., 1987, and updates thereof, now available on the Internet (http://immuno.bme.nwu.edu or find \"Kabat\" using any search engine).\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody molecule\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis describes an immunoglobulin whether natural or partly or wholly synthetically produced. The term also covers any polypeptide or protein comprising an antibody antigen-binding site. Antibody fragments that comprise an antibody antigen-binding site are molecules such as Fab, scFv, Fv, dAb, Fd; and diabodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is possible to take monoclonal and other antibodies and use techniques of recombinant DNA technology to produce other antibodies or chimeric molecules that retain the specificity of the original antibody. Such techniques may involve introducing DNA encoding the immunoglobulin variable region, or the CDRs, of an antibody to the constant regions, or constant regions plus framework regions, of a different immunoglobulin. See, for instance, \n \nEP-A-184187\n \n, \n \nGB 2188638A\n \n or \n \nEP-A-239400\n \n, and a large body of subsequent literature. A hybridoma or other cell producing an antibody may be subject to genetic mutation or other changes, which may or may not alter the binding specificity of antibodies produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs antibodies can be modified in a number of ways, the term \"antibody molecule\" should be construed as covering any specific binding member or substance having an antibody antigen-binding site with the required specificity. Thus, this term covers antibody fragments and derivatives, including any polypeptide comprising an antibody antigen-binding site, whether natural or wholly or partially synthetic. Chimeric molecules comprising an antibody antigen-binding site, or equivalent, fused to another polypeptide are therefore included. Cloning and expression of chimeric antibodies are described in \n \nEP-A-0120694\n \n and \n \nEP-A-0125023\n \n, and a large body of subsequent literature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther techniques available in the art of antibody engineering have made it possible to isolate human and humanised antibodies. For example, human hybridomas can be made as described by Kontermann & Dubel (2001). Phage display, another established technique for generating specific binding members has been described in detail in many publications such as Kontermann & Dubel (2001) and \n \nWO92/01047\n \n (discussed further below). Transgenic mice in which the mouse antibody genes are inactivated and functionally replaced with human antibody genes while leaving intact other components of the mouse immune system, can be used for isolating human antibodies (Mendez et al., 1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthetic antibody molecules may be created by expression from genes generated by means of oligonucleotides synthesized and assembled within suitable expression vectors, for example as described by Knappik et al. (2000) or Krebs et al. (2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been shown that fragments of a whole antibody can perform the function of binding antigens. Examples of binding fragments are (i) the Fab fragment consisting of VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iii) the Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single antibody; (iv) the dAb fragment (Ward, 1989; McCafferty et al., 1990; Holt et al., 2003), which consists of a VH or a VL domain; (v) isolated CDR regions; (vi) F(ab')2 fragments, a bivalent fragment comprising two linked Fab fragments (vii) single chain Fv molecules (scFv), wherein a VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a peptide linker which allows the two domains to associate to form an antigen binding site (Bird et al., 1988; Huston et al., 1988); (viii) bispecific single chain Fv dimers (\n \nPCT/US92/09965\n \n) and (ix) \"diabodies\", multivalent or multispecific fragments constructed by gene fusion (\n \nWO94/13804\n \n; Holliger et al., 1993). Fv, scFv or diabody molecules may be stabilised by the incorporation of disulphide bridges linking the VH and VL domains (Reiter et al., 1996). Minibodies comprising a scFv joined to a CH3 domain may also be made (Hu et al., 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA dAb (domain antibody) is a small monomeric antigen-binding fragment of an antibody, namely the variable region of an antibody heavy or light chain (Holt \net al.,\n 2003). VH dAbs occur naturally in camelids (e.g. camel, llama) and may be produced by immunising a camelid with a target antigen, isolating antigen-specific B cells and directly cloning dAb genes from individual B cells. dAbs are also producible in cell culture. Their small size, good solubility and temperature stability makes them particularly physiologically useful and suitable for selection and affinity maturation. A specific binding member of the present invention may be a dAb comprising a VH or VL domain substantially as set out herein, or a VH or VL domain comprising a set of CDRs substantially as set out herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere bispecific antibodies are to be used, these may be conventional bispecific antibodies, which can be manufactured in a variety of ways (Holliger & Winter, 1993), e.g. prepared chemically or from hybrid hybridomas, or may be any of the bispecific antibody fragments mentioned above. Examples of bispecific antibodies include those of the BITE\n™\n technology in which the binding domains of two antibodies with different specificity can be used and directly linked via short flexible peptides. This combines two antibodies on a short single polypeptide chain. Diabodies and scFv can be constructed without an Fc region, using only variable domains, potentially reducing the effects of anti-idiotypic reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific diabodies, as opposed to bispecific whole antibodies, may also be particularly useful because they can be readily constructed and expressed in \nE.coli\n. Diabodies (and many other polypeptides such as antibody fragments) of appropriate binding specificities can be readily selected using phage display (\n \nWO94/13804\n \n) from libraries. If one arm of the diabody is to be kept constant, for instance, with a specificity directed against NGF, then a library can be made where the other arm is varied and an antibody of appropriate specificity selected. Bispecific whole antibodies may be made by knobs-into-holes engineering (Ridgeway et al., 1996).\n\n\n \nAntigen-binding site\n\n\n \n \n \nThis describes the part of a molecule that binds to and is complementary to all or part of the target antigen. In an antibody molecule it is referred to as the antibody antigen-binding site, and comprises the part of the antibody that specifically binds to and is complementary to all or part of the target antigen. Where an antigen is large, an antibody may only bind to a particular part of the antigen, which part is termed an epitope. An antibody antigen-binding site may be provided by one or more antibody variable domains. Preferably, an antibody antigen-binding site comprises an antibody light chain variable region (VL) and an antibody heavy chain variable region (VH).\n\n\n \n\n\nSpecific\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis may be used to refer to the situation in which one member of a specific binding pair will not show any significant binding to molecules other than its specific binding partner(s). The term is also applicable where e.g. an antigen-binding site is specific for a particular epitope that is carried by a number of antigens, in which case the specific binding member carrying the antigen-binding site will be able to bind to the various antigens carrying the epitope.\n\n\n \n\n\nIsolated\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis refers to the state in which specific binding members of the invention, or nucleic acid encoding such binding members, will generally be in accordance with the present invention. Isolated members and isolated nucleic acid will be free or substantially free of material with which they are naturally associated such as other polypeptides or nucleic acids with which they are found in their natural environment, or the environment in which they are prepared (e.g. cell culture) when such preparation is by recombinant DNA technology practised \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo.\n Members and nucleic acid may be formulated with diluents or adjuvants and still for practical purposes be isolated - for example the members will normally be mixed with gelatin or other carriers if used to coat microtitre plates for use in immunoassays, or will be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents when used in diagnosis or therapy. Specific binding members may be glycosylated, either naturally or by systems of heterologous eukaryotic cells (e.g. CHO or NS0 (ECACC 85110503) cells, or they may be (for example if produced by expression in a prokaryotic cell) unglycosylated.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs noted above, a specific binding member in accordance with the present invention preferably neutralises NGF. The degree to which an antibody neutralises NGF is referred to as its neutralising potency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPotency is normally expressed as an IC50 value, in nM unless otherwise stated. IC50 is the median inhibitory concentration of an antibody molecule. In functional assays, IC50 is the concentration that reduces a biological response by 50 % of its maximum. In ligand-binding studies, IC50 is the concentration that reduces receptor binding by 50 % of maximal specific binding level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIC50 may be calculated by plotting % biological response (represented e.g. by calcium ion mobilisation in a FLIPR assay, by survival in a PC12 assay, or by proliferation in a TF-1 proliferation assay) or % specific receptor binding as a function of the log of the specific binding member concentration, and using a software program such as Prism (GraphPad) to fit a sigmoidal function to the data to generate IC50 values, for example as described in Example 2, 5, 6 or 9 herein. A specific binding member in accordance with the present invention preferably inhibits human NGF-evoked intracellular calcium mobilisation in cells expressing TrkA receptor, e.g. cells recombinantly transfected with a TrkA gene, for instance HEK cells. In a \"FLIPR\" calcium mobilisation assay as described in Example 2 herein, a specific binding member according to the invention preferably has a potency (IC50) for neutralising human NGF of or less than 600, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20 or 10 nM. Normally, a specific binding member of the invention has a potency of 5 nM or less, preferably 2.5 nM or less, more preferably 1 nM or less. In particularly preferred embodiments, the potency is 0.5 nM or less, e.g. 0.4 nM or less; 0.3 nM or less; 0.2 nM or less; or 0.15 nM or less. In some embodiments, the potency may be about 0.1 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPotency may be between 0.1-100 nM, 0.1-50 nM, 0.1-10 nM, or 0.1-1.0 nM. For example, potency may be 0.1-5.0 nM, 0.2-5.0 nM, 0.3-5.0 nM, or 0.3-0.4 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention, the neutralising potency of a non potency-optimised specific binding member in a HEK cell assay as described herein is about 1.8 to 560 nM for human NGF and/or about 2.9 to 620 nM for rat NGF. In some embodiments, the neutralizing potency of potency-optimised binding members in HEK cell assays as described herein are about 0.12 to 120nM for human NGF, about 0.11 to 37 nM for rat NGF and about 0.11 to 71 nM for mouse NGF. However, these are examples only and higher potencies may be achieved. Although potency optimisation may be used to generate higher potency specific binding members from a given specific binding member, it is also noted that high potency specific binding members may be obtained even without potency optimisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA specific binding member in accordance with the present invention preferably inhibits NGF-maintained serum-deprived PC12 cell survival. The neutralising potency of a specific binding member of the present invention in a PC12 survival assay for human NGF as described herein in Example 5 is generally 1500 nM or less, and is preferably 50 nM or less, or 10 nM or less. As explained above and as demonstrated herein, potency-optimisation may be used to achieve higher anti-NGF potencies. Preferably, a specific binding member has a potency of or less than 5 nM, 4 nM, 3 nM, 2 nM, 1.5 nM, 1 nM or 0.5 nM. In some embodiments, potency is about 0.1 nM or more, 0.2 nM or more. Thus, potency may be between 0.1 or 0.2 nM and 0.5, 1.5, 5 or 50 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention, the neutralizing potency of a potency optimised specific binding member in a PC12 survival assay as described herein is about 0.2 to 670nM for human NGF and is about 0.2 to 54 nM for rat NGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA specific binding member in accordance with the present invention preferably inhibits NGF-stimulated TF-1 cell proliferation. The neutralising potency of a specific binding member (normally a potency-optimised specific binding member) of the present invention in a TF-1 proliferation assay for human NGF as described herein in Example 6 is generally 5 nM or less, preferably 1 nM or less. Preferably, a specific binding member of the invention has a potency of or less than 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.45, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 or 0.1 nM for human NGF. For example, potency may be between 0.05 - 0.1 nm, 0.05 - 0.2 nM, 0.05 - 0.3 nM, 0.05 - 0.4 nM, or 0.05 - 0.5 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention, the neutralizing potency of a potency optimised specific binding member in a TF-1 proliferation assay as described herein is about 0.08 to 0.7nM for human NGF, about 0.07 to 1.9 nM for rat NGF and about 0.07 to 1.4nM for mouse NGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA specific binding member in accordance with the present invention preferably inhibits NGF binding to a TrkA and/or p75 receptor, preferably a human TrkA and/or p75 receptor. The invention also extends more generally to a specific binding member that preferentially blocks NGF binding to TrkA receptor over NGF binding to p75 receptor. The neutralising potency of a specific binding member (normally a potency-optimised specific binding member) of the present invention in a TrkA receptor binding assay as described herein in Example 9 is generally 2.5 nM or less, preferably 1 nM or less for neutralising human NGF. Preferably, a specific binding member of the invention has a potency of or less than 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 or 0.075 nM for neutralising human NGF binding to TrkA. For example, potency may be between 0.05 - 0.1 nm, 0.05 - 0.2 nM, 0.05 - 0.3 nM, 0.05 - 0.4 nM, or 0.05 - 0.5 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe neutralising potency of a specific binding member (normally a potency-optimised specific binding member) of the present invention in a p75 receptor binding assay as described herein in Example 9 is generally 1.5 nM or less, preferably 1 nM or less for neutralising human NGF. Preferably, a specific binding member of the invention has a potency of or less than 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 or 0.1 nM for neutralising human NGF binding to p75. For example, potency may be between 0.1 - 0.2 nM, 0.1 - 0.3 nM, 0.1 - 0.4 nM, 0.1 - 0.5 nM, or 0.1-0.6 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred specific binding members according to the present invention inhibit NGF (e.g. human and/or rat NGF) binding to TrkA receptor preferentially over NGF binding to p75 receptor. Accordingly, in some embodiments a specific binding member of the invention has a lower binding inhibition constant, Ki, for inhibition of NGF (e.g. human and/or rat NGF) binding to TrkA than for NGF binding to p75. Ki may be calculated using the formula set out in Example 9. Alternatively, binding inhibition constants can be expressed as pKi, which can be calculated as -log\n10\nKi. Thus, a specific binding member of the invention preferably has a higher pKi value for inhibition of NGF binding to TrkA than to p75.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, a specific binding member according to the invention binds human NGF and/or rat NGF with an affinity of or less than 1, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3 or 0.2 nM. For example, a specific binding member may bind human NGF with an affinity of about 0.25-0.44nM and rat NGF with an affinity of about 0.25-0.70 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, variants of antibody molecules disclosed herein may be produced and used in the present invention. Following the lead of computational chemistry in applying multivariate data analysis techniques to the structure/property-activity relationships (Wold, \net al\n. 1984) quantitative activity-property relationships of antibodies can be derived using well-known mathematical techniques such as statistical regression, pattern recognition and classification (Norman \net al\n, 1998; Kandel & Backer, 1995; Krzanowski, 2000; Witten & Frank, 1999; Denison (Ed), 2002; Ghose & Viswanadhan). The properties of antibodies can be derived from empirical and theoretical models (for example, analysis of likely contact residues or calculated physicochemical property) of antibody sequence, functional and three-dimensional structures and these properties can be considered singly and in combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody antigen-binding site composed of a VH domain and a VL domain is formed by six loops of polypeptide: three from the light chain variable domain (VL) and three from the heavy chain variable domain (VH). Analysis of antibodies of known atomic structure has elucidated relationships between the sequence and three-dimensional structure of antibody combining sites (Chothia et al. 1992; Al-Lazikani, \net al\n. 1997). These relationships imply that, except for the third region (loop) in VH domains, binding site loops have one of a small number of main-chain conformations: canonical structures. The canonical structure formed in a particular loop has been shown to be determined by its size and the presence of certain residues at key sites in both the loop and in framework regions (Chothia \net al\n. and Al-Lazikani \net al\n., supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis study of sequence-structure relationship can be used for prediction of those residues in an antibody of known sequence, but of an unknown three-dimensional structure, which are important in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of its CDR loops and hence maintain binding specificity. These predictions can be backed up by comparison of the predictions to the output from lead optimization experiments. In a structural approach, a model can be created of the antibody molecule (Chothia, \net al\n. 1986) using any freely available or commercial package such as WAM (Whitelegg & Rees, 2000). A protein visualisation and analysis software package such as Insight II (Accelerys, Inc.) or Deep View (Guex & Peitsch, 1997) may then be used to evaluate possible substitutions at each position in the CDR. This information may then be used to make substitutions likely to have a minimal or beneficial effect on activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe techniques required to make substitutions within amino acid sequences of CDRs, antibody VH or VL domains and specific binding members generally are available in the art. Variant sequences may be made, with substitutions that may or may not be predicted to have a minimal or beneficial effect on activity, and tested for ability to bind and/or neutralise NGF and/or for any other desired property.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariable domain amino acid sequence variants of any of the VH and VL domains whose sequences are specifically disclosed herein may be employed in accordance with the present invention, as discussed. Particular variants may include one or more amino acid sequence alterations (addition, deletion, substitution and/or insertion of an amino acid residue), may be less than about 20 alterations, less than about 15 alterations, less than about 10 alterations or less than about 5 alterations, maybe 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1. Alterations may be made in one or more framework regions and/or one or more CDRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably alterations do not result in loss of function, so a specific binding member comprising a thus-altered amino acid sequence preferably retains an ability to bind and/or neutralise NGF. More preferably, it retains the same quantitative binding and/or neutralising ability as a specific binding member in which the alteration is not made, e.g. as measured in an assay described herein. Most preferably, the specific binding member comprising a thus-altered amino acid sequence has an improved ability to bind or neutralise NGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlteration may comprise replacing one or more amino acid residue with a non-naturally occurring or non-standard amino acid, modifying one or more amino acid residue into a non-naturally occurring or non-standard form, or inserting one or more non-naturally occurring or non-standard amino acid into the sequence. Preferred numbers and locations of alterations in sequences of the invention are described elsewhere herein. Naturally occurring amino acids include the 20 \"standard\" L-amino acids identified as G, A, V, L, I, M, P, F, W, S, T, N, Q, Y, C, K, R, H, D, E by their standard single-letter codes. Non-standard amino acids include any other residue that may be incorporated into a polypeptide backbone or result from modification of an existing amino acid residue. Non-standard amino acids may be naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring. Several naturally occurring non-standard amino acids are known in the art, such as 4-hydroxyproline, 5-hydroxylysine, 3-methylhistidine, N-acetylserine, etc. (Voet & Voet, 1995). Those amino acid residues that are derivatised at their N-alpha position will only be located at the N-terminus of an amino-acid sequence. Normally in the present invention an amino acid is an L-amino acid, but in some embodiments it may be a D-amino acid. Alteration may therefore comprise modifying an L-amino acid into, or replacing it with, a D-amino acid. Methylated, acetylated and/or phosphorylated forms of amino acids are also known, and amino acids in the present invention may be subject to such modification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequences in antibody domains and specific binding members of the invention may comprise non-natural or non-standard amino acids described above. In some embodiments non-standard amino acids (e.g. D-amino acids) may be incorporated into an amino acid sequence during synthesis, while in other embodiments the non-standard amino acids may be introduced by modification or replacement of the \"original\" standard amino acids after synthesis of the amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUse of non-standard and/or non-naturally occurring amino acids increases structural and functional diversity, and can thus increase the potential for achieving desired NGF binding and neutralising properties in a specific binding member of the invention. Additionally, D-amino acids and analogues have been shown to have better pharmacokinetic profiles compared with standard L-amino acids, owing to \nin vivo\n degradation of polypeptides having L-amino acids after administration to an animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, a CDR amino acid sequence substantially as set out herein is preferably carried as a CDR in a human antibody variable domain or a substantial portion thereof. The HCDR3 sequences substantially as set out herein represent preferred embodiments of the present invention and it is preferred that each of these is carried as a HCDR3 in a human heavy chain variable domain or a substantial portion thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariable domains employed in the invention may be obtained or derived from any germ-line or rearranged human variable domain, or may be a synthetic variable domain based on consensus or actual sequences of known human variable domains. A CDR sequence of the invention (e.g. CDR3) may be introduced into a repertoire of variable domains lacking a CDR (e.g. CDR3), using recombinant DNA technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, Marks \net al\n. (1992) describe methods of producing repertoires of antibody variable domains in which consensus primers directed at or adjacent to the 5' end of the variable domain area are used in conjunction with consensus primers to the third framework region of human VH genes to provide a repertoire of VH variable domains lacking a CDR3. Marks \net al\n. further describe how this repertoire may be combined with a CDR3 of a particular antibody. Using analogous techniques, the CDR3-derived sequences of the present invention may be shuffled with repertoires of VH or VL domains lacking a CDR3, and the shuffled complete VH or VL domains combined with a cognate VL or VH domain to provide specific binding members of the invention. The repertoire may then be displayed in a suitable host system such as the phage display system of \n \nWO92/01047\n \n or any of a subsequent large body of literature, including Kay, Winter & McCafferty (1996), so that suitable specific binding members may be selected. A repertoire may consist of from anything from 10\n4\n individual members upwards, for example from 10\n6\n to 10\n8\n or 10\n10\n members. Other suitable host systems include yeast display, bacterial display, T7 display, ribosome display and covalent display.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalogous shuffling or combinatorial techniques are also disclosed by Stemmer (1994), who describes the technique in relation to a β-lactamase gene but observes that the approach may be used for the generation of antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further alternative is to generate novel VH or VL regions carrying CDR-derived sequences of the invention using random mutagenesis of one or more selected VH and/or VL genes to generate mutations within the entire variable domain. Such a technique is described by Gram \net al\n. (1992), who used error-prone PCR. In preferred embodiments one or two amino acid substitutions are made within a set of HCDRs and/or LCDRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother method that may be used is to direct mutagenesis to CDR regions of VH or VL genes. Such techniques are disclosed by Barbas \net al\n. (1994) and Schier \net al.\n (1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll the above-described techniques are known as such in the art and the skilled person will be able to use such techniques to provide specific binding members of the invention using routine methodology in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the invention provides a method for obtaining an antibody antigen-binding site specific for NGF antigen, the method comprising providing by way of addition, deletion, substitution or insertion of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence of a VH domain set out herein a VH domain which is an amino acid sequence variant of the VH domain, optionally combining the VH domain thus provided with one or more VL domains, and testing the VH domain or VH/VL combination or combinations to identify a specific binding member or an antibody antigen-binding site specific for NGF antigen and optionally with one or more preferred properties, preferably ability to neutralise NGF activity. Said VL domain may have an amino acid sequence which is substantially as set out herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn analogous method may be employed in which one or more sequence variants of a VL domain disclosed herein are combined with one or more VH domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, 1252A5 VH domain (SEQ ID NO: 392) may be subject to mutation to provide one or more VH domain amino acid sequence variants, optionally combined with 1252A5 VL (SEQ ID NO: 397).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the invention provides a method of preparing a specific binding member specific for NGF antigen, which method comprises:\n\n \n \n \n(a) providing a starting repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a VH domain which either include a CDR3 to be replaced or lack a CDR3 encoding region;\n \n(b) combining said repertoire with a donor nucleic acid encoding an amino acid sequence substantially as set out herein for a VH CDR3 such that said donor nucleic acid is inserted into the CDR3 region in the repertoire, so as to provide a product repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a VH domain;\n \n(c) expressing the nucleic acids of said product repertoire;\n \n(d) selecting a specific binding member specific for NGF; and\n \n(e) recovering said specific binding member or nucleic acid encoding it.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAgain, an analogous method may be employed in which a VL CDR3 of the invention is combined with a repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a VL domain that either include a CDR3 to be replaced or lack a CDR3 encoding region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, one or more, or all three CDRs may be grafted into a repertoire of VH or VL domains that are then screened for a specific binding member or specific binding members specific for NGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, one or more of 1252A5 HCDR1 (SEQ ID NO: 393), HCDR2 (SEQ ID NO: 394) and HCDR3 (SEQ ID NO: 395), or the 1252A5 set of HCDRs, may be employed, and/or one or more of 1252A5 LCDR1 (SEQ ID NO: 398), LCDR2 (SEQ ID NO: 399) and LCDR3 (SEQ ID NO: 400) or the 1252A5 set of LCDRs may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other analogous embodiments 1152H5, 1165D4 or 1230H7 is substituted for 1252A5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, other VH and VL domains, sets of CDRs and sets of HCDRs and/or sets of LCDRs disclosed herein may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA substantial portion of an immunoglobulin variable domain will comprise at least the three CDR regions, together with their intervening framework regions. Preferably, the portion will also include at least about 50% of either or both of the first and fourth framework regions, the 50% being the C-terminal 50% of the first framework region and the N-terminal 50% of the fourth framework region. Additional residues at the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the substantial part of the variable domain may be those not normally associated with naturally occurring variable domain regions. For example, construction of specific binding members of the present invention made by recombinant DNA techniques may result in the introduction of N- or C-terminal residues encoded by linkers introduced to facilitate cloning or other manipulation steps. Other manipulation steps include the introduction of linkers to join variable domains of the invention to further protein sequences including antibody constant regions, other variable domains (for example in the production of diabodies) or detectable/functional labels as discussed in more detail elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough in a preferred aspect of the invention specific binding members comprising a pair of VH and VL domains are preferred, single binding domains based on either VH or VL domain sequences form further aspects of the invention. It is known that single immunoglobulin domains, especially VH domains, are capable of binding target antigens in a specific manner. For example, see the discussion of dAbs above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of either of the single specific binding domains, these domains may be used to screen for complementary domains capable of forming a two-domain specific binding member able to bind NGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis may be achieved by phage display screening methods using the so-called hierarchical dual combinatorial approach as disclosed in \n \nWO92/01047\n \n, in which an individual colony containing either an H or L chain clone is used to infect a complete library of clones encoding the other chain (L or H) and the resulting two-chain specific binding member is selected in accordance with phage display techniques such as those described in that reference. This technique is also disclosed in Marks \net al\n, \nibid\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding members of the present invention may further comprise antibody constant regions or parts thereof, preferably human antibody constant regions or parts thereof. For example, a VL domain may be attached at its C-terminal end to antibody light chain constant domains including human Cκ or Cλ chains, preferably Cλ chains. Similarly, a specific binding member based on a VH domain may be attached at its C-terminal end to all or part (e.g. a CH1 domain) of an immunoglobulin heavy chain derived from any antibody isotype, e.g. IgG, IgA, IgE and IgM and any of the isotype sub-classes, particularly IgG1 and IgG4. IgG4 is preferred. IgG4 is preferred because it does not bind complement and does not create effector functions. Any synthetic or other constant region variant that has these properties and stabilizes variable regions is also preferred for use in embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding members of the invention may be labelled with a detectable or functional label. Detectable labels include radiolabels such as \n131\nI or \n99\nTc, which may be attached to antibodies of the invention using conventional chemistry known in the art of antibody imaging. Labels also include enzyme labels such as horseradish peroxidase. Labels further include chemical moieties such as biotin that may be detected via binding to a specific cognate detectable moiety, e.g. labelled avidin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding members of the present invention are designed to be used in methods of diagnosis or treatment in human or animal subjects, preferably human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, further aspects of the invention provide methods of treatment comprising administration of a specific binding member as provided, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such a specific binding member, and use of such a specific binding member in the manufacture of a medicament for administration, for example in a method of making a medicament or pharmaceutical composition comprising formulating the specific binding member with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClinical indications in which an anti-NGF antibody may be used to provide therapeutic benefit include pain, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, other diseases of airway inflammation, diabetic neuropathy, arthritis, psoriasis, cardiac arrhythmias, HIV and cancer. As already explained, anti-NGF treatment is indicated for all these diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-NGF treatment may be given orally, by injection (for example, subcutaneously, intravenously, intraperitoneal or intramuscularly), by inhalation, by the intravesicular route (instillation into the urinary bladder), or topically (for example intraocular, intranasal, rectal, into wounds, on skin). The route of administration can be determined by the physicochemical characteristics of the treatment, by special considerations for the disease or by the requirement to optimise efficacy or to minimise side-effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is envisaged that anti-NGF treatment will not be restricted to use in the clinic. Therefore, subcutaneous injection using a needle free device is also preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombination treatments may be used to provide significant synergistic effects, particularly the combination of an anti-NGF specific binding member with one or more other drugs. A specific binding member according to the present invention may be provided in combination or addition to short or long acting analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-asthmatic, anti-fibrotic, antiviral, chemotherapeutic agents and immunotherapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombination treatment with one or more short or long acting analgesics and/or anti-inflammatory agents, such as opioids and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may be employed for treatment of conditions characterized by pain and/or inflammation for example rheumatoid arthritis or post-surgical pain. Antibodies of the present invention can also be used in combination with anti-asthma, anti-allergic, or anti-fibrotic therapies, such as inhaled beta adrenoceptor agonists, steroids, cytokine antagonists, or other novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of asthma, allergic asthma, other allergic conditions, or any condition characterized by abnormal fibrosis. Antibodies of the present invention may also be used in combination with anti-infective agents, for example antiviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, compositions provided may be administered to individuals. Administration is preferably in a \"therapeutically effective amount\", this being sufficient to show benefit to a patient. Such benefit may be at least amelioration of at least one symptom. The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of administration, will depend on the nature and severity of what is being treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage etc, is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors, and may depend on the severity of the symptoms and/or progression of a disease being treated. Appropriate doses of antibody are well known in the art; see Ledermann et al. (1991) and Bagshawe (1991). Specific dosages indicated herein, or in the Physician's Desk Reference (2003) as appropriate for the type of medicament being administered, may be used. A therapeutically effective amount or suitable dose of a specific binding member of the invention can be determined by comparing its \nin vitro\n activity and \nin vivo\n activity in an animal model. Methods for extrapolation of effective dosages in mice and other test animals to humans are known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe precise dose will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the antibody is for diagnosis or for treatment, the size and location of the area to be treated, the precise nature of the antibody (e.g. whole antibody, fragment or diabody), and the nature of any detectable label or other molecule attached to the antibody. A typical antibody dose will be in the range 100µg to 1 g for systemic applications, and 1µg to 1mg for topical applications. Typically, the antibody will be a whole antibody, preferably the IgG4 isotype. This is a dose for a single treatment of an adult patient, which may be proportionally adjusted for children and infants, and also adjusted for other antibody formats in proportion to molecular weight. Treatments may be repeated at daily, twice-weekly, weekly or monthly intervals, at the discretion of the physician. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, treatment is periodic, and the period between administrations is about two weeks or more, preferably about three weeks or more, more preferably about four weeks or more, or about once a month. In other preferred embodiments of the invention, treatment may be given before, and/or after surgery, and more preferably, may be administered or applied directly at the anatomical site of surgical treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding members of the present invention will usually be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, which may comprise at least one component in addition to the specific binding member.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, and for use in accordance with the present invention, may comprise, in addition to active ingredient, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabiliser or other materials well known to those skilled in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The precise nature of the carrier or other material will depend on the route of administration, which may be oral, or by injection, e.g. intravenous.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in tablet, capsule, powder, liquid or semi-solid form. A tablet may comprise a solid carrier such as gelatin or an adjuvant. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally comprise a liquid carrier such as water, petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil. Physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol may be included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor intravenous injection, or injection at the site of affliction, the active ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen-free and has suitable pH, isotonicity and stability. Those of relevant skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example, isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection. Preservatives, stabilisers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives may be included, as required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition may be administered alone or in combination with other treatments, either simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding members of the present invention may be formulated in liquid, semi-solid or solid forms depending on the physicochemical properties of the molecule and the route of delivery. Formulations may include excipients, or combinations of excipients, for example: sugars, amino acids and surfactants. Liquid formulations may include a wide range of antibody concentrations and pH. Solid formulations may be produced by lyophilisation, spray drying, or drying by supercritical fluid technology, for example. Formulations of anti-NGF will depend upon the intended route of delivery: for example, formulations for pulmonary delivery may consist of particles with physical properties that ensure penetration into the deep lung upon inhalation; topical formulations may include viscosity modifying agents, which prolong the time that the drug is resident at the site of action. In certain embodiments, the specific binding member may be prepared with a carrier that will protect the specific binding member against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Robinson, 1978.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a method comprising causing or allowing binding of a specific binding member as provided herein to NGF. As noted, such binding may take place \nin vivo\n, e.g. following administration of a specific binding member, or nucleic acid encoding a specific binding member, or it may take place \nin vitro,\n for example in ELISA, Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, immuno-precipitation, affinity chromatography, or cell based assays such as a TF-1 assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of binding of specific binding member to NGF may be determined. Quantitation may be related to the amount of the antigen in a test sample, which may be of diagnostic interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA kit comprising a specific binding member or antibody molecule according to any aspect or embodiment of the present invention is also provided as an aspect of the present invention. In a kit of the invention, the specific binding member or antibody molecule may be labelled to allow its reactivity in a sample to be determined, e.g. as described further below. Components of a kit are generally sterile and in sealed vials or other containers. Kits may be employed in diagnostic analysis or other methods for which antibody molecules are useful. A kit may contain instructions for use of the components in a method, e.g. a method in accordance with the present invention. Ancillary materials to assist in or to enable performing such a method may be included within a kit of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reactivities of antibodies in a sample may be determined by any appropriate means. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is one possibility. Radioactive labelled antigen is mixed with unlabelled antigen (the test sample) and allowed to bind to the antibody. Bound antigen is physically separated from unbound antigen and the amount of radioactive antigen bound to the antibody determined. The more antigen there is in the test sample the less radioactive antigen will bind to the antibody. A competitive binding assay may also be used with non-radioactive antigen, using antigen or an analogue linked to a reporter molecule. The reporter molecule may be a fluorochrome, phosphor or laser dye with spectrally isolated absorption or emission characteristics. Suitable fluorochromes include fluorescein, rhodamine, phycoerythrin and Texas Red. Suitable chromogenic dyes include diaminobenzidine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther reporters include macromolecular colloidal particles or particulate material such as latex beads that are coloured, magnetic or paramagnetic, and biologically or chemically active agents that can directly or indirectly cause detectable signals to be visually observed, electronically detected or otherwise recorded. These molecules may be enzymes, which catalyse reactions that develop, or change colours or cause changes in electrical properties, for example. They may be molecularly excitable, such that electronic transitions between energy states result in characteristic spectral absorptions or emissions. They may include chemical entities used in conjunction with biosensors. Biotin/avidin or biotin/streptavidin and alkaline phosphatase detection systems may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe signals generated by individual antibody-reporter conjugates may be used to derive quantifiable absolute or relative data of the relevant antibody binding in samples (normal and test).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides the use of a specific binding member as above for measuring antigen levels in a competition assay, that is to say a method of measuring the level of antigen in a sample by employing a specific binding member as provided by the present invention in a competition assay. This may be where the physical separation of bound from unbound antigen is not required. Linking a reporter molecule to the specific binding member so that a physical or optical change occurs on binding is one possibility. The reporter molecule may directly or indirectly generate detectable, and preferably measurable, signals. The linkage of reporter molecules may be directly or indirectly, covalently, e.g. via a peptide bond or non-covalently. Linkage via a peptide bond may be as a result of recombinant expression of a gene fusion encoding antibody and reporter molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides for measuring levels of antigen directly, by employing a specific binding member according to the invention for example in a biosensor system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mode of determining binding is not a feature of the present invention and those skilled in the art are able to choose a suitable mode according to their preference and general knowledge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted, in various aspects and embodiments, the present invention extends to a specific binding member that competes for binding to NGF with any specific binding member defined herein, e.g. 1252A5 IgG4. Competition between binding members may be assayed easily \nin vitro,\n for example by tagging a specific reporter molecule to one binding member which can be detected in the presence of other untagged binding member(s), to enable identification of specific binding members which bind the same epitope or an overlapping epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetition may be determined for example using ELISA in which NGF is immobilised to a plate and a first tagged binding member along with one or more other untagged binding members is added to the plate. Presence of an untagged binding member that competes with the tagged binding member is observed by a decrease in the signal emitted by the tagged binding member.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn testing for competition a peptide fragment of the antigen may be employed, especially a peptide including or consisting essentially of an epitope of interest. A peptide having the epitope sequence plus one or more amino acids at either end may be used. Specific binding members according to the present invention may be such that their binding for antigen is inhibited by a peptide with or including the sequence given. In testing for this, a peptide with either sequence plus one or more amino acids may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding members that bind a specific peptide may be isolated for example from a phage display library by panning with the peptide(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides an isolated nucleic acid encoding a specific binding member of the present invention. Nucleic acid may include DNA and/or RNA. In a preferred aspect, the present invention provides a nucleic acid that codes for a CDR or set of CDRs or VH domain or VL domain or antibody antigen-binding site or antibody molecule, e.g. scFv or IgG4, of the invention as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides constructs in the form of plasmids, vectors, transcription or expression cassettes which comprise at least one polynucleotide as above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a recombinant host cell that comprises one or more constructs as above. A nucleic acid encoding any CDR or set of CDRs or VH domain or VL domain or antibody antigen-binding site or antibody molecule, e.g. scFv or IgG4 as provided, itself forms an aspect of the present invention, as does a method of production of the encoded product, which method comprises expression from encoding nucleic acid therefor. Expression may conveniently be achieved by culturing under appropriate conditions recombinant host cells containing the nucleic acid. Following production by expression a VH or VL domain, or specific binding member may be isolated and/or purified using any suitable technique, then used as appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding members, VH and/or VL domains, and encoding nucleic acid molecules and vectors according to the present invention may be provided isolated and/or purified, e.g. from their natural environment, in substantially pure or homogeneous form, or, in the case of nucleic acid, free or substantially free of nucleic acid or genes of origin other than the sequence encoding a polypeptide with the required function. Nucleic acid according to the present invention may comprise DNA or RNA and may be wholly or partially synthetic. Reference to a nucleotide sequence as set out herein encompasses a DNA molecule with the specified sequence, and encompasses a RNA molecule with the specified sequence in which U is substituted for T, unless context requires otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSystems for cloning and expression of a polypeptide in a variety of different host cells are well known. Suitable host cells include bacteria, mammalian cells, plant cells, yeast and baculovirus systems and transgenic plants and animals. The expression of antibodies and antibody fragments in prokaryotic cells is well established in the art. For a review, see for example Plückthun (1991). A common, preferred bacterial host is \nE\n. \ncoli.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression in eukaryotic cells in culture is also available to those skilled in the art as an option for production of a specific binding member for example Chadd & Chamow (2001), Andersen & Krummen (2002), Larrick & Thomas (2001). Mammalian cell lines available in the art for expression of a heterologous polypeptide include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney cells, NS0 mouse melanoma cells, YB2/0 rat myeloma cells, human embryonic kidney cells, human embryonic retina cells and many others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable vectors can be chosen or constructed, containing appropriate regulatory sequences, including promoter sequences, terminator sequences, polyadenylation sequences, enhancer sequences, marker genes and other sequences as appropriate. Vectors may be plasmids e.g. phagemid, or viral e.g. 'phage, as appropriate. For further details see, for example, Sambrook & Russell (2001). Many known techniques and protocols for manipulation of nucleic acid, for example in preparation of nucleic acid constructs, mutagenesis, sequencing, introduction of DNA into cells and gene expression, and analysis of proteins, are described in detail in Ausubel et al., 1988 and Ausubel et al., 1999.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, a further aspect of the present invention provides a host cell containing nucleic acid as disclosed herein. Such a host cell may be \nin vitro\n and may be in culture. Such a host cell may be \nin vivo\n. \nIn vivo\n presence of the host cell may allow intracellular expression of the specific binding members of the present invention as \"intrabodies\" or intracellular antibodies. Intrabodies may be used for gene therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA still further aspect provides a method comprising introducing such nucleic acid into a host cell. The introduction may employ any available technique. For eukaryotic cells, suitable techniques may include calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection and transduction using retrovirus or other virus, e.g. vaccinia or, for insect cells, baculovirus. Introducing nucleic acid in the host cell, in particular a eukaryotic cell may use a viral or a plasmid based system. The plasmid system may be maintained episomally or may incorporated into the host cell or into an artificial chromosome. Incorporation may be either by random or targeted integration of one or more copies at single or multiple loci. For bacterial cells, suitable techniques may include calcium chloride transformation, electroporation and transfection using bacteriophage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe introduction may be followed by causing or allowing expression from the nucleic acid, e.g. by culturing host cells under conditions for expression of the gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the nucleic acid of the invention is integrated into the genome (e.g. chromosome) of the host cell. Integration may be promoted by inclusion of sequences that promote recombination with the genome, in accordance with standard techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method that comprises using a construct as stated above in an expression system in order to express a specific binding member or polypeptide as above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAspects and embodiments of the present invention will now be illustrated, by way of example, with reference to the following experimentation and the accompanying drawings, in which:\n\n \n \n \n \nFigure 1\n shows concentration-inhibition curves for antibody neutralisation of human (\nFigure 1A\n) and rat (\nFigure 1B\n) NGF in the human TrkA receptor calcium mobilisation assay. Human IgG4 NGF antibodies were compared with the commercial NGF antibodies G1131, Mab5260Z, and MAB256 for inhibition of intracellular calcium mobilisation evoked by 1nM NGF.

The libraries were derived from (A) spleen lymphocytes (Hutchings, 2001), (B) a combination of peripheral blood lymphocytes, tonsil B cells and bone marrow B cells (Vaughan et al., 1996) and (C) the light chains and VH CDR3 regions of A combined with the framework of the DP47 germline heavy chain.\n\n\n \n\n\nSelection of scFv\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe phage selection procedure used was essentially as described in Hutchings, \nsupra.\n ScFv that recognised NGF were isolated from phage display libraries in a series of selection cycles on human and rat NGF. In brief, unmodified antigen was coated to Nunc Maxisorb tubes. Phage were incubated on the antigen in a total volume of 500µl for 1h prior to washing to remove unbound phage. Bound phage were then rescued as described by Vaughan \net al., supra\n and the selection process repeated. To assist the isolation of human/rodent cross-reactive scFv alternate rounds of selection were performed on the respective species isoforms of NGF. A maximum of four rounds of selection was performed with any one library using this alternating isoform selection strategy. Either human or rat β-NGF were used as the initial antigen for first round selections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOutputs from rounds 2-4 were prioritised for biochemical screening based on the percentage of NGF-specific clones isolated and the sequence diversity of these clones. The percentage of NGF-specific clones was determined in each case by phage ELISA. Sequence diversity was determined by DNA sequencing.\n\n\n \n\n\nPhage EZISA protocol\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCultures of phage transduced bacteria were prepared in 1ml 2xTY medium containing 100µg/ml ampicillin and 50µg/ml kanamycin with shaking at 30°C for 16h. Phage supernatant was prepared by centrifugation of the culture (10 min at 3000rpm) and blocking with 3% w/v milk powder in PBS for 1h. Blocked phage were then added to plates previously coated with (1µg/ml) antigen or irrelevant antigen. Plates were washed between each step with three rinses in PBS-Tween 20 (0.1% v/v) followed by three rinses in PBS. Bound phage were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)/anti-M13 conjugate (Amersham UK) diluted 1:5000 in 3% w/v milk powder PBS for 1h, and developed by incubation with tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma). The colorimetric reaction was stopped after an appropriate period by adding 0.5M sulphuric acid. Absorbance readings were taken at 450nm. Clones which bound specifically to the antigen were identified as having a signal on the antigen greater than or equal to 5x that on the irrelevant antigen.\n\n\n \n\n\nDNA Sequencing\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDouble stranded DNA template for sequencing was obtained by PCR of scFv using the primers FDTETSEQ24 (TTTGTCGTCTTTCCAGACGTTAGT - SEQ ID NO: 534) and PUCreverse (AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG - SEQ ID NO: 535). Excess primer and dNTPs from the primary PCR were removed using Macherey-Nagel Nucleofast 96 well PCR plates (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. VH genes were sequenced with primer Lseq (GATTACGCCAAGCTTTGGAGC SEQ ID NO: 536). VL genes were sequenced with primer MYC Seq 10 (CTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTG SEQ ID NO: 537). Each reaction mixture contained 20-40ng DNA, 3 - 20pmol primer and 4µl Big Dye Terminator V3.0 (Applied Biosystems, UK) in a volume of 20µl. Sequencing reactions consisted of 25 cycles of 96°C 10s; 50°C, 5s; 60°C, 4min. Samples were run and analysed on an Applied Biosystems 3700 DNA Analyser. Areas of ambiguity were analysed manually using Continuity software developed in-house (Cambridge Antibody Technology, UK) and SeqEd DNA sequence manipulation software (Applied Biosystems, UK).\n\n\n \n\n\nBiochemical screen for NGF-neutralising scFv\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe output from the phage selection process was further screened to identify clones that inhibited NGF binding to a TrkA receptor extracellular domain fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCrude scFv samples were prepared from periplasmic lysates of \nE.coli\n TG-1 bacteria transfected with selected phage for evaluation in the binding assay. Nunc Maxisorb 96 well plates were coated overnight with human TrkA receptor extracellular domain fusion protein (R&D Systems; coating concentration; human NGF assay, 0.25nM; rat NGF assay, 1nM). Assay plates were washed with PBS / \nTween\n 20, blocked for 2h using 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, and washed again. ScFv samples were preincubated for 30min with 1nM human or rat recombinant β-NGF (R&D Systems) in 1% BSA. Samples were transferred in a volume of 100µl to assay plates and incubated for 60min at room temperature. Plates were washed and NGF that remained bound to the plates was labelled using 0.3µg/ml of either anti-human NGF biotin (Peprotech) or anti-rat NGF biotin (R&D Systems) diluted in 1% BSA, followed by incubation for 60min at room temperature. Biotin-labelled anti-NGF was detected using the DELFIA (Wallac) time-resolved fluorescence detection system. Briefly, plates were washed and 100µl streptavidin Eu\n3+\n added to each well, diluted 1/1000 in DELFIA assay buffer. Plates were incubated for a further 60 min at room temperature and washed with DELFIA wash buffer, followed by addition of 100µl DELFIA enhancement solution to each well. Plates were read using a Wallac Victor fluorimetric plate reader (excitation wavelength 314nm; emission wavelength 615nm).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClones that inhibited both human and rat NGF binding by more than 70% as periplasmic lysate scFv preparations were re-evaluated as purified scFv in the binding assay. Purified scFv preparations were prepared as described in Example 3 of \n \nWO01/66754\n \n. Protein concentrations of purified scFv preparations were determined using the BCA method (Pierce). Re-assay highlighted the following scFv antibodies that were potent neutralisers of human and rat NGF binding to the human TrkA receptor extracellular domain fusion protein:\n\n \n \n \n1064F8 (VH SEQ ID NO: 2; VL SEQ ID NO: 7),\n \n1022E3 (VH SEQ ID NO: 12; VL SEQ ID NO: 17),\n \n1083H4 (VH SEQ ID NO: 22; VL SEQ ID NO: 27),\n \n1021E5 (VH SEQ ID NO: 32; VL SEQ ID NO: 37),\n \n1033G9 (VH SEQ ID NO: 42; VL SEQ ID NO: 47),\n \n1016A8 (VH SEQ ID NO: 52; VL SEQ ID NO: 57),\n \n1028F8 (VH SEQ ID NO: 62; VL SEQ ID NO: 67),\n \n1033B2 (VH SEQ ID NO: 72; VL SEQ ID NO: 77),\n \n1024C4 (VH SEQ ID NO: 82; VL SEQ ID NO: 87), and\n \n1057F11 (VH SEQ ID NO: 92; VL SEQ ID NO: 97).\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpression of human IgG4 antibodies and in vitro functional evaluation of NGF-neutralising potency\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe NGF-neutralising scFv 1064F8, 1022E3, 1083H4, 1021E5, 1033G9, 1016A8, 1028F8, 1033B2, 1024C4, and 1057F11 were reformatted as human IgG4 antibodies and assayed for NGF neutralising potency in a whole-cell assay system.\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG conversion\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nVectors were constructed for the most potent scFv clones to allow re-expression as whole antibody human IgG4, essentially as described by Persic \net al.\n (1997). EBNA-293 cells maintained in conditioned medium were co-transfected with constructs expressing heavy and light chain domains. Whole antibody was purified from the medium using protein A affinity chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia). The purified antibody preparations were sterile filtered and stored at 4°C in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) prior to \nin vitro\n potency evaluation. Protein concentration was determined spetrophotometrically according to Mach et al. (1992).\n\n\n \n\n\nFLIPR assay of intracellular calcium mobilisation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe potency and efficacy of anti-human IgGs for neutralising NGF were determined in a cell-based fluorescent calcium-mobilisation assay. The potency of human antibodies was compared with mouse anti-human NGF (MAB256; R&D Systems), rat anti-mouse NGF (G1131; Promega), and mouse anti-mouse NGF (MAB5260Z; Chemicon). Anti-NGF IgGs were co-incubated with recombinant human β-NGF (Calbiochem, 480275) or recombinant rat β-NGF (R&D Systems, 556-NG-100). The complex was then added to HEK293 cells expressing recombinant human TrkA receptors loaded with the calcium sensitive dye, Fluo-4, and then Ca\n2+\n-dependent fluorescence was monitored.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHEK cells (peak-S, Edge Biosystems) transfected with recombinant human TrkA (obtained from M. Chao, Skirball Institute, NY) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (MEM, Cellgro, MT10-017-CV) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, SH30071.03), 1.5 µg/ml puromycin (Edge Biosystems, 80018) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Confluent cells were harvested by dislodging the cells with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS), and then loaded with loading buffer containing 6 µM Fluo-4 (Molecular Probes) at 37°C for 1.5h in the presence of an anion transport inhibitor (2.5 mM probenecid in 1% FBS/MEM). After washing the cells once with assay buffer (2.5 mM probenecid in 0.1% BSA Hank's / HEPES), the cells were plated on poly-D-lysine coated, clear bottom 96-well plates (Costar #3904) at approximately 60,000 cells/well in 120 µl. The cells were incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, and the plates were then centrifuged at 1,200 rpm (290 x g) for 5min. Prior to testing, the plates were pre-warmed at 35°C for 20 min. Test IgGs were assayed at 7 concentrations in triplicate wells. Thirty-five microlitres of 10X anti-NGF IgG and equal amounts of 10 nM human-, rat- or mouse 2.5S NGF were pre-incubated at room temperature for approximately 1h. Plates containing the pre-complexed IgGs and plates containing 100 µl/well assay buffer were pre-warmed at 35°C for 20min before testing on the Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR; Molecular Devices). Following the addition of 80µl/well assay buffer to the cell plate and incubation for 5 min at 35°C, 50µl/well of diluted anti-human IgG / NGF complex was added to the cell plate in the FLIPR with continuous monitoring of the Ca\n2+\n-dependent fluorescence. The NGF-induced fluorescence was calculated as the difference between the baseline fluorescence intensity just prior to NGF addition and highest fluorescence intensity attained in 2 minutes following NGF addition. The average of triplicate NGF-induced fluorescence values in the absence of antibody was defined as 100% calcium mobilisation. In the presence of antibody, the average ± SD of triplicate NGF-induced fluorescence values was calculated as a percent of control calcium mobilisation. The percent of control calcium mobilisation values were plotted as function of the log of the IgG concentration. IC\n50\n values were calculated by fitting the sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) function using Prism (GraphPad).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll antibodies tested displayed concentration-related inhibition of human NGF-evoked intracellular calcium mobilisation. The rank order of potency for neutralisation of human NGF was 1064F8 > 1022E3 > 1083H4 ≥ 1033G9 ≥ 1016A8 ≥ 1028F8 ≥ 1021E5 ≥ 1033B2 >> 1024C4 >> 1057F11 (Table 1). Five antibodies were further evaluated for functional neutralisation of rat NGF, and these were approximately equipotent against both species isoforms (\nFigures 1A and 1B\n; Table 1).\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsolation of optimised human IgG4 NGF antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRibosome display scFv potency optimisation,\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nLarge ribosome display libraries were created and selected for scFv that specifically recognised recombinant human NGF (R&D Systems), essentially as described in Hanes \net al.\n (2000). Initially, the clones 1064F8, 1022E3, 1083H4, 1021E5, 1033G9, 1016A8, 1028F8, 1033B2, and 1024C4 were converted to ribosome display format, where the templates were subsequently used for library creation. The clone 1057F11 was not chosen for potency optimisation, and therefore a ribosome display template was not made for this antibody. On the DNA level, a T7 promoter was added at the 5'-end for efficient transcription to mRNA. On the mRNA level, the construct contained a prokaryotic ribosome-binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence). At the 3'end of the single chain, the stop codon was removed and a portion of gIII was added to act as a spacer (Hanes \net\n al., supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRibosome display libraries derived from 1064F8, 1022E3, 1083H4, 1021E5, 1033G9, 1016A8, 1028F8, 1033B2, and 1024C4 were created by mutagenesis of the scFv HCDR3. PCR reactions were performed with non-proof reading Taq polymerase. Affinity-based selections were performed whereby, following incubation with the library, biotinylated human NGF was coupled to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Dynal M280). Bound tertiary complexes (mRNA-ribosome-scFv) were recovered by magnetic separation whilst unbound complexes were washed away. The mRNA encoding the bound scFv were then rescued by RT-PCR as described in Hanes \net al\n., (\nsupra\n) and the selection process repeated with decreasing concentrations (100 nM - 10 pM over five rounds) of biotinylated human NGF present during the selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nError-prone PCR was also used to further increase library size. An error rate of 7.2 mutations per 1,000 bp was employed (Diversify\n™\n, Clontech) during the selection regime. Error-prone PCR reactions were performed before selections commenced at rounds three and four using biotinylated human NGF concentrations of 1 nM and 0.1 nM, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA representative proportion of scFv from the output of selection rounds three, four and five were ligated into pCantab6 vector (Vaughan \net al.,\n 1996) and cloned in the TG1 strain of \nE.coli.\n A sample of these scFv was DNA sequenced as described in Example 1 to confirm sequence diversity of the output before screening in vitro for NGF neutralising activity. Clones were screened as unpurified scFv in the NGF / TrkA receptor extracellular domain fusion protein binding assay, as described in Example 1. The concentration of the periplasmic lysate scFv preparations in the assays was reduced to 0.5% - 5% of the final assay volume, and clones that inhibited both human and rat NGF binding >95% were isolated for further study. In this way a panel of potency-optimised, cross-reactive NGF neutralisers was isolated. Surprisingly, the most potent NGF neutralisers were derived from the parent clones 1021E5 and 1083H4, which were not the most potent of the parent antibodies. Optimised clones were sequenced and reassayed as purified scFv to confirm potency before reformatting to human IgG4 as described in Example 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies derived from the parent clone 1021E5 (VH SEQ ID NO: 32; VL SEQ ID NO: 37) and converted to human IgG4 format were 1126F1 (VH SEQ ID NO: 102; VL SEQ ID NO: 107), 1126G5 (VH SEQ ID NO: 112; VL SEQ ID NO: 117), 1126H5 (VH SEQ ID NO: 122; VL SEQ ID NO: 127), 1127D9 (VH SEQ ID NO: 132; VL SEQ ID NO: 137), 1127F9 (VH SEQ ID NO: 142; VL SEQ ID NO: 147), 1131D7 (VH SEQ ID NO: 152; VL SEQ ID NO: 157), 1131H2 (VH SEQ ID NO: 162; VL SEQ ID NO: 167), 1132A9 (VH SEQ ID NO: 172; VL SEQ ID NO: 177), 1132H9 (VH SEQ ID NO: 182; VL SEQ ID NO: 187), 1133C11 (VH SEQ ID NO: 192; VL SEQ ID NO: 197), 1134D9 (VH SEQ ID NO: 202; VL SEQ ID NO: 207), 1145D1 (VH SEQ ID NO: 212; VL SEQ ID NO: 217), 1146D7 (VH SEQ ID NO: 222; VL SEQ ID NO: 227), 1147D2 (VH SEQ ID NO: 232; VL SEQ ID NO: 237), 1147G9 (VH SEQ ID NO: 242; VL SEQ ID NO: 247), 1150F1 (VH SEQ ID NO: 252; VL SEQ ID NO: 257), 1152H5 (VH SEQ ID NO: 262; VL SEQ ID NO: 267), 1155H1 (VH SEQ ID NO: 272; VL SEQ ID NO: 277), 1158A1 (VH SEQ ID NO: 282; VL SEQ ID NO: 287), 1160E3 (VH SEQ ID NO: 292; VL SEQ ID NO: 297), 1165D4 (VH SEQ ID NO: 302; VL SEQ ID NO: 307), 1175H8 (VH SEQ ID NO: 312; VL SEQ ID NO: 317), 1211G10 (VH SEQ ID NO: 322; VL SEQ ID NO: 327), 1214A1 (VH SEQ ID NO: 332; VL SEQ ID NO: 337), 1214D10 (VH SEQ ID NO: 342; VL SEQ ID NO: 347), 1218H5 (VH SEQ ID NO: 352; VL SEQ ID NO: 357),and 1230H7 (VH SEQ ID NO: 362; VL SEQ ID NO: 367).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies derived from the parent clone 1083H4 (VH SEQ ID NO: 22; VL SEQ ID NO: 27) and converted to human IgG4 format were 1227H8 (VH SEQ ID NO: 372; VL SEQ ID NO: 377) and 1230D8 (VH SEQ ID NO: 382; VL SEQ ID NO: 387).\n\n\n \n\n\nGermlining framework regions of 1133C11 to derive 1252A5 and other 1021E5 variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nExamination of the VH and VL CDR sequence information for optimised clones derived from 1021E5 highlighted that a large proportion of these antibodies contained the amino acid sequence LNPSLTA (SEQ ID NO: 531) in VH CDR3 (i.e. amino acids 100A to 100G according to the Kabat numbering system). These clones are shown in Table 2a, highlighting how they vary in amino acid sequence in the VH and VL CDR regions, together with an estimate of their NGF neutralising potency when assayed as purified scFv. Of these clones, 1133C11 differed in CDR regions from 1021E5 only by the 7 consecutive amino acids 100A to 100G as described. Therefore, 1133C11 was chosen for germlining, first to confirm that potency was retained with the modified framework, and second to allow subsequent CDR mutations to be introduced, if desired, in order to generate further germline antibodies of interest from the same lineage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe derived amino acid VH and VL sequences of 1133C11 were aligned to the known human germline sequences in the VBASE database (\nTomlinson [1997], MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, Cambridge, UK\n) and the closest germline identified. The closest germline for the VH of 1133C11 was identified as DP10, a member of the VH1 family. The 1133C11 VH has 5 amino acid changes from the DP10 germline within framework regions. The closest germline for the VL of 1133C11 was identified as DPL5, a member of the Vλ1 family. The 1133C11 VL has only 4 changes from the germline within framework regions. Framework regions of 1133C11 were returned to germline by site directed mutagenesis of the scFv to derive the scFv 1252A5 (VH SEQ ID NO: 392; VL SEQ ID NO: 397). This was converted to human IgG4 as described in Example 2. Germlining of other variants of 1021E5-derived clones was achieved by introducing CDR mutations onto the germlined 1252A5 IgG4 backbone. This method resulted in generation of the germlined antibodies G1152H5 (VH SEQ ID NO: 402; VL SEQ ID NO: 407), G1165D4 (VH SEQ ID NO: 412; VL SEQ ID NO: 417) and G1230H7 (VH SEQ ID NO: 422; VL SEQ ID NO: 427).\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of optimised human IgG4 antibodies in the FLIPR assay of intracellular calcium mobilisation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOptimised human IgG4 NGF antibodies were evaluated in an assay of NGF-evoked intracellular calcium mobilisation in cells recombinantly expressing the human TrkA receptor, as described in Example 2. Antibodies were assayed for neutralising activity against human, rat, and mouse NGF (\nFigures 2A, 2B\n, and \n2C\n; Table 3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntracellular calcium mobilisation evoked by 1nM NGF was inhibited by all optimised human antibodies tested. Optimised antibodies displayed subnanomolar IC\n50\n values, in most cases representing greater than one hundredfold enhancement of NGF neutralising potency over the parent IgGs (Table 3). Neutralising potencies (IC\n50\n) of the germlined human IgG4 antibodies against the human, rat and mouse NGF isoforms were, respectively:\n\n \n \n \n1252A5 - 0.33nM, 0.29nM, and 0.26nM;\n \nG1152H5 - 0.22nM, 0.27nM, and 0.18nM;\n \nG1165D4 - 0.32nM, 0.33nM, and 0.27nM;\n \nG1230H7 - 0.31nM, 0.34nM, and 0.25nM.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThese results highlight the efficiency and value of the ribosome display technique for antibody potency optimisation. A more conventional approach to antibody optimisation in the past has been to generate phage display libraries of variant scFv antibodies. This process is labour intensive and slower than the ribosome display method, which often means that only a single parent scFv is used as the starting point for library construction. The relative ease of generating ribosome display libraries allows multiple scFv parents to be optimised simultaneously and, as demonstrated in Example 3, this can lead to the isolation of highly potent antibodies derived from parent clones that would have been otherwise overlooked for optimisation.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of optimised human IgG4 antibodies in a PC12 cell survival assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the PC12 assay, NGF maintains the survival of serum-deprived rat PC12 cells expressing native TrkA and p75 receptors for two days. Neutralising NGF antibodies reduce cell survival measured with AlamarBlue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Cellgro, 18040181) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (JRH,12103-78P), 10% heat-inactivated donor horse serum (JRH, 12446-77P), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were harvested by trituration, and then washed twice with serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 0.01% BSA (Sigma, A7030). Cells were plated in rat tail collagen (Biological Technology Institute, BT-274)-coated 96 well plates at 50,000 cells/well in 120 µl serum-free media with 0.01% BSA. Serial dilutions of 5X anti-human NGF IgGs were made using serum-free media and 40 µl/well was added to the cell plate. 40µl/well 0.5 nM human β-NGF (Calbiochem, 480275) or rat recombinant NGF (R&D Systems, 556-NG-100) was added to the plate, and the total volume was brought up to 200 µl/well with serum-free medium. Maximal cell death was defined by 80 µl/well of serum-free medium in triplicate wells. 100% survival was defined by 40µl/well serum-free media and 40µl/well 0.5nM NGF in triplicate wells. The plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO\n2\n for 48h.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo measure the cell viability, 22 µl/well AlamarBlue was added and the plates were read immediately to determine the background fluorescence in each well with a fluorometric plate reader (BMG) at 530 nm excitation wavelength and 590 nm emission wavelength. Following an incubation for 6-7h at 37°C, the plate was re-read to determine total fluorescence. The Alamar blue fluorescence was calculated as the difference between the background and total fluorescence intensities. In the presence of antibody, the average ± SD of triplicate fluorescence values was calculated as a percent of the average of \ntriplicate\n 100% survival fluorescence values. The percent of control survival values were plotted as function of the log of the IgG concentration. IC\n50\n values were calculated by fitting the sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) function using Prism (GraphPad).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults from the PC12 assay further confirmed the increased potency of optimised human IgG4 NGF antibodies over their parent IgGs. Antibodies inhibited human and rat NGF-maintained PC12 cell survival in a concentration-related manner (\nFigures 3A and 3B\n; Table 3). Germlining appeared to reduce the NGF neutralising potency of the test antibodies, particularly against the rat NGF isoform. For example, the mean IC\n50\n of the germline antibody G1152H5 for inhibition of cell survival mediated by 1nM human or rat NGF was 1.1nM and 7.3nM, respectively. In contrast, the mean IC\n50\n for neutralisation of 1nM human or rat NGF by 1152H5 (ie non-germline antibody) was 0.40nM and 0.38nM, respectively.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\n\n\nNGF-neutralising activity in a TF-1 cell proliferation assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe TF-1 cell line is a human premyeloid cell line that can be stimulated to proliferate by exogenous growth factors and cytokines. TF-1 cells express the human TrkA receptor, and proliferate in response to activation with NGF. The TF-1 cell proliferation assay was used to further characterise the in vitro functional potency of neutralising human IgG4 NGF antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTF-1 cells were obtained from R&D Systems and maintained according to supplied protocols. Assay media comprised of RPMI-1640 with GLUTAMAX I (Invitrogen) containing 5% foetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 1% sodium pyruvate (Sigma). Prior to each assay, TF-1 cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 minutes, the media removed by aspiration and the cells resuspended in assay media. This process was repeated three times with cells resuspended at a final concentration of 10\n5\n /ml in assay media and 100µl was added to each well of a 96 well flat bottomed tissue culture assay plate to give final cell density at 1x10\n4\n/well. Test solutions of antibodies (in triplicate) were diluted to give a final assay concentration of 1µg/ml in assay media and titrated 1:5 across assay plate. An irrelevant antibody (CAT-001) not directed at NGF, was used as a negative control. In addition, a reference monoclonal antibody MAB256 (R&D Systems) was used as a positive control. Fifty microlitres of test antibodies were then added to each well followed by 50µl of native purified murine (7S form; Invitrogen), rat (Sigma) or human (Sigma) NGF diluted to give a final assay concentration of 200pM. Assay plates were incubated for 68h at 37°C in 5% CO\n2\n in a humidified chamber. Twenty microlitres of tritiated thymidine (5.0 µCi/ml, NEN) was then added to each assay well and assay plates were returned to the incubator for a further 5h. Cells were harvested onto 96 well glass fibre filter plates (Perkin Elmer) using a cell harvester. MicroScint 20TM (50µl) was then added to each well of the filter plate and [\n3\nH]-thymidine incorporation quantified using a Packard TopCount microplate liquid scintillation counter. In the presence of antibody, thymidine incorporation (quantified as counts per minute) was calculated as the difference between the average background (i.e. cells not exposed to NGF) and the average total (i.e. cells stimulated with NGF) counts per minute and expressed as a percent of maximum proliferation. The percent maximum proliferation was plotted as function of the log of the IgG concentration. IC\n50\n values were calculated by fitting the sigmoidal dose (variable slope) function using GraphPad prism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman IgG4 NGF antibodies were potent inhibitors of TF-1 cell proliferation mediated by human, rat and mouse NGF isoforms(\nFigures 4A, 4B\n, and \n4C\n). These results demonstrate that antibodies derived from the 1021E5 lineage can disrupt NGF signalling mediated by activation of native human NGF receptors in vitro. In accordance with the observed activity of human NGF antibodies in the PC12 cell survival assay (Example 5), non-germline antibodies were more potent than their germline counterparts in the TF-1 proliferation assay (Table 3). Based on mean IC50 data, the rank order of potency of the antibodies tested for inhibition of proliferation mediated by 200pM human NGF was 1133C11 > 1152H5 > 1252A5 = G1152H5 >> MAB256.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-Reactivity of anti-NGF IgGs with other neurotrophins\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nELISAs were performed to determine the cross-reactivity of the anti-NGF IgGs for other neurotrophins. The ELISAs consisted of coating plates with 100 ng/well human NGF (R&D systems, 256-GF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; R&D systems, 248-BD), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3; R&D systems, 257-N3), or neurotrophin-4 (NT4; R&D systems, 257-N4) at room temperature for 5-6 h, followed by blocking the plates with 0.25% HSA at 4°C overnight. Increasing concentrations of anti-NGF IgG, ranging from 0.03 - 10 nM, were incubated at room temperature for 2 h to allow binding to each neurotrophin. Anti-NGF IgGs were detected with a biotinylated anti-human polyclonal antibody (1:300) (Rockland 609-1602), streptavidin-linked alkaline phosphatase (1:1000), and fluorescent Substrate A. Positive controls demonstrating neurotrophin binding to the plate utilised commercial biotinylated anti-human polyclonal antibodies (R&D \nSystems anti-NGF BAF\n 256, anti-BDNF BAM 648, anti-NT-3 BAF 267, anti-NT-4 BAF 268), which were detected directly using streptavidin-linked alkaline phosphatase and subsequent addition of Substrate A. Nonspecific binding was determined using wells coated with BSA instead of neurotrophin. Product development was followed over time from 0 - 60 min after addition of Substrate A. Anti-NGF IgG 1064F8 was used to optimise the assay. For 1064F8, there was linear product development for 15 min, which then leveled off with time, probably due to substrate depletion. Cross-reactivities were calculated as a percent of the specific binding to neurotrophin relative to NGF for all concentrations of IgG. For high affinity IgGs such as 1064F8, percent cross-reactivities were calculated using 15 min product development data. For low affinity IgGs such as 1016A8, percent cross-reactivities were calculated using 60 min product development data.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cross-reactivities of seven human IgG4 NGF antibodies to BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 relative to NGF were determined. At the concentrations tested, all seven antibodies showed negligible cross-reactivity (Table 4). For example, with 1252A5 the highest levels of cross-reactivity observed with NT-3, NT-4 and BDNF were 1.1%, 0.9% and 1.4%, respectively (\nFigure 5\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermination of the NGF-binding affinity of human NGF antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe NGF-binding affinities of human IgG4 NGF antibodies were determined using a radioligand-binding assay format, performed at room temperature. Briefly, flashplates (Perkin Elmer SMP200) were coated with 100µl/well of 2.2µg/ml goat anti-human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 1h. Wells were washed with PBS and then blocked for 1h with 200µl/well PBS containing 3% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, UK). Wells were washed with PBS and 10 ng of human NGF antibody was added to each well in a volume of 0.1ml PBS containing 0.5% w/v BSA. Following incubation for 1h plates were washed with PBS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadioiodinated human and rat NGF were obtained from Amersham UK (human \n125\nI-NGF, Amersham cat. no. IM286; rat \n125\nI-NGF, custom-labelled recombinant rat β-NGF) purchased from R&D Systems, cat. no. 556-GF-100). Each \n125\nI-NGF isoform was serially diluted in assay buffer (PBS containing 0.5% w/v BSA and 0.05% v/v Tween 20) and duplicate 100µl samples were added to the assay plate to give a measure of 'total binding' over the concentration range 2pM-15nM. Non-specific binding (NSB) was determined at each \n125\nI-NGF concentration by measuring binding in the presence of a large excess of non-radiolabelled NGF. NSB wells contained \n125\nI-NGF (2pM-15nM) together with a final concentration of 500 nM unlabelled human β-NGF (R&D Systems Cat. No. 256-GF-100) or rat β-NGF (R&D Systems Cat. No. 556-GF-100), as appropriate. Plates were incubated overnight, and wells counted for 1min on a gamma counter (TopCount NXT, Perkin Elmer). Specific binding was calculated according to the formula specific binding = total binding - non-specific binding'. Binding curves were plotted and binding parameters determined according to a one-site saturation binding model using Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman and rat \n125\nI-NGF displayed saturable, high affinity binding to the human IgG4 NGF antibodies, 1252A5 and G1152H5 (\nFigures 6\n and \n7\n). Calculated Kd values for the binding interaction with human \n125\nI-NGF were 0.35nM for 1252A5, and 0.37nM for G1152H5. Kd values for rat \n125\nI-NGF binding were 0.44nM for 1252A5 and 0.50nM for G1152H5.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermination of Ki values for inhibition of NGF binding to human TrkA and p75 receptors\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nExperiments were performed to determine whether the antibodies 1252A5 and G1152H5 display differential inhibition of NGF binding to TrkA and p75 receptors. Competition binding experiments were designed in order to calculate binding inhibition constant (Ki) values. IC\n50\ns were calculated for antibody-mediated inhibition of radiolabelled human or rat NGF binding to human TrkA- or p75-receptor fusion proteins. Ki values were then derived using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman TrkA and p75 receptor fusion proteins (R&D Systems) were diluted in Dulbecco's PBS (Gibco) to final concentrations of 10nM and 0.6nM, respectively. Maxisorp Nunc white 96 well microtitre plates (Nalge Nunc) were coated overnight at 4°C with 100µl/well of the diluted TrkA or p75 receptor solution. Plates were washed 3 times with \nPBS Tween\n 20, and then blocked with 200µl/well 3% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Plates were washed after 1h incubation at room temperature. Test antibodies were diluted to the desired concentration in assay buffer (0.5%w/v BSA and 0.05%v/\nv Tween\n 20 in PBS). An irrelevant antibody, not directed towards NGF, was used as a negative control whilst non-radiolabelled NGF was used as a reference inhibitor of radioligand binding. Duplicate wells were prepared for each concentration of test sample. Human or rat \n125\nI-NGF (Amersham Biosciences) was diluted with assay buffer such that the final concentration in assay wells, when mixed with test sample, was 150pM in a total assay volume of 100µl. Assay plates were incubated at room temperature for 2h before washing with PBS/\nTween\n 20 to remove unbound \n125\nI-NGF. Bound radiolabel was quantified by addition of 100µl/well Microscint 20 (Perkin Elmer) followed by counting using a Packard TopCount microplate liquid scintillation counter. Data were plotted and analysed using Graphpad Prism software to calculate IC\n50\n values for each experiment, and to derive the corresponding Ki according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation; \n \n \nKi\n \n=\n \n \nIC\n \n50\n \n \n/\n \n \n1\n \n+\n \nD\n \n/\n \nKd\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere:\n\n \n \n \nD =\n \nthe NGF concentration in the assay (nominally 150pM, but actual assay concentrations were determined for each experiment)\n \nKd =\n \nthe affinity of NGF for the TrkA or p75 receptor under identical assay conditions. This was determined by saturation binding analysis of \n125\nI-NGF binding to TrkA and p75 receptors in separate experiments.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAll antibodies evaluated, except the human IgG4 control, inhibited human and rat \n125\nI-NGF binding to human TrkA and p75 receptors (\nFigures 8\n and \n9\n; Table 5). Table 6 shows IC50 and Ki values calculated from data shown in \nFigure 8A\n; Table 7 shows IC50 and Ki values calculated from data shown in \nFigure 8B\n; Table 8 shows IC50 and Ki values calculated from data shown in \nFigure 9A\n; Table 9 shows IC50 and Ki values calculated from data shown in \nFigure 9B\n. Antibody 1252A5 consistently showed the greatest potency of \n125\nI-NGF binding inhibition. Interestingly, binding inhibition constant values determined for 1252A5-mediated inhibition of NGF binding to TrkA and p75 receptors were significantly different. Thus, the calculated mean pKi for inhibition of human NGF binding to TrkA and p75 was 10.26 ± 0.08 and 9.85 ± 0.04, respectively (P<0.01, Student's T-test; both n=3). Calculated mean pKi for inhibition of rat NGF to TrkA and p75 receptors was 9.79 ± 0.04 and 9.55 ± 0.03, respectively (P<0.05, Student's T-test; both n=3). This result suggests that 1252A5 is a preferential inhibitor of the interaction between NGF and the TrkA receptor, and unexpectedly contrasts with the results obtained with G1152H5 for which there was no significant difference between corresponding pKi values (Table 5).\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntihyperalgesic activity of human IgG4 NGF antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antihyperalgesic activity of NGF antibodies was evaluated in a mouse model of carrageenan-induced thermal hypersensitivity. Male mice (20-25g body weight) were initially acclimatised to the test apparatus for 2h. The following day, baseline measures of responsiveness to thermal stimulation of both hind paws were determined. A focussed heat source was applied to the plantar hind paw surface, and the latency to withdrawal was recorded, according to the method of Hargreaves et al. (1988). Baseline values were calculated as the mean of triplicate determinations for each paw, recorded 10 min apart. Mice then received an intraperitoneal injection of NGF-neutralising human IgG4 antibody or control isotype-matched null antibody in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) vehicle. Twenty-four hours later, inflammatory hyperalgesia was induced by subplantar injection of carrageenan (2% w/v in PBS; 30µl injection volume). After a further 24h period, withdrawal latencies were again determined for inflamed and non-inflamed hind paws.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThermal hyperalgesia observed 24h after carrageenan injection was dose-dependently inhibited by pretreatment of mice with the human IgG4 NGF antibody 1252A5 (\nFigure 10\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll documents cited are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nAl-Lazikani, et al.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. \nField of the Invention\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds, compositions comprising a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound and methods for preventing or treating pain or diarrhea in an animal comprising administering to an animal in need of such prevention or treatment an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound.\n\n\n \n\n\n2. \nBackground of the Invention\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPain is the most common symptom for which patients seek medical advice and treatment. Pain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limited, chronic pain can persist for 3 months or longer and lead to significant changes in a patient's personality, lifestyle, functional ability or overall quality of life (\nK.M. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine 100-107, J.C. Bennett and F. Plum eds., 20th ed. 1996\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPain has been traditionally managed by administering a non-opioid analgesic, such as acetylsalicylic acid, choline magnesium trisalicylate, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, diflusinal and naproxen; or an opioid analgesic, such as morphine, hydromorphone, methadone, levorphanol, fentanyl, oxycodone and oxymorphone. \nId.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnited States Patent No. \n \n6,576,650 B1\n \n, United States Patent \n \n6,166,039\n \n, and United States Patent No. \n \n5,849,761, to Yaksh\n \n and United States Patent No. \n \n6,573,282, to Yaksh et al.\n \n describe 1,4-substituted piperidine derivatives allegedly useful as peripherally active anti hyperalgesic opiates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnited States Patent No. \n \n6,362,203 B1 to Mogi et al.\n \n describes 4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidine derivatives that are alleged to exhibit peripheral analgesic action.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCanadian Patent Publication No. \n \n949560 of Carron et al.\n \n describes piperidine derivatives bearing substituents at the 1 and 4 positions that are alleged to be useful as analgesics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternational Publication No. \n \nWO 02/38185 A2 of Dunn et al\n \n \n.\n describes 1,4 substituted piperidine compounds that are allegedly useful as an antihyperalgesic opiate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Abstract of International Publication No. \n \nWO 01/70689 A1\n \n also discloses piperidine derivatives carrying substituents at the 1 and 4 positions that are allegedly useful as opioid δ receptor agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTraditional opioid analgesics exert their pharmacological activity once they have passed through the blood-brain barrier. But this passage through the blood-brain barrier can lead to undesirable central nervous system-mediated side effects, such as respiratory depression, increased drug tolerance, increased drug dependence, constipation and unwanted euphoria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere remains a clear need for new drugs that are useful for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea and that reduce or avoid one or more side effects associated with traditional therapy for treating pain or diarrhea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCitation of any reference in Section 2 of this application is not an admission that such reference is prior art to the present application.\n\n\n \n\n\n3. \nSummary of the Invention\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses compounds having the formula (I):\n\n \n \n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAr' is -C\n3\n-C\n8\n cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl or -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl, each being unsubstituted or substituted with one, two, or three R\n2\n groups;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAr\n2\n is phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl or -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl, each being unsubstituted or substituted with one, two, or three R\n2\n groups;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAr\n4\n is -C\n3\n-C\n8\n cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl or -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl, each being unsubstituted or substituted with one, two, or three R\n2\n groups;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG is -H, -C(O)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nCO\n2\nR\n4\n -C(O)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nR\n5\n, -(C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkylene)CO\n2\nR\n4\n, or -(C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkylene)R\n5\n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1\n = -H, -C(O)NH\n2\n, -C(O)NHOH, -CO\n2\nR\n4\n, -CHO, -CN, -(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -C(O)NH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -C(O)N(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, -CF\n3\n, -CHF\n2\n, -CH\n2\nF,\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n2\n and R\n3\n are each independently -halogen, -C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl, -O(C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl), -NH(C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl), -N(C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl)\n2\n, -CF\n3\n, or -OCF\n3\n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n4\n = -H, -C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl, -CH\n2\nO(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -CH\n2\nN(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, or -CH\n2\nNH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl);\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n5\n = -NH\n2\n, -NHSO\n2\nR\n4\n, -C(O)NH\n2\n, -C(O)NHOH, - SO\n2\nNH\n2\n, -C(O)NH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -C(O)N(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, -SO\n2\nNH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -SO\n2\nN(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, -H, -OH, -CN, or -C\n3\n-C\n8\n cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl, -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl each C\n3\n-C\n8\n cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl, -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl being unsubstituted or substituted with one or more R\n2\n groups;\n\nm = an integer ranging from 0 to 4;\n\nn = an integer ranging from 1 to 4;\n\np=0 or 1;

4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds of the present invention can be made using conventional organic syntheses as well as by the following illustrative methods.\n\n\n \n\n\n4.3.1 \nSynthesis of Compounds of Structure 3\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nScheme 1 depicts methods for making intermediates useful in the synthesis of 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds of formula I and formula II, in which R\n1\n is -C(O)NZ\n1\nZ\n2\n, where Z\n1\n and Z\n2\n are each independently a -(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl) group or Z\n1\n and Z\n2\n and the nitrogen atom to which they are attached are taken together to form N-(4-R\n4\n)-N'-1-piperazinyl, aziridyl, azetidyl, pyrrolidyl, piperidyl, homopiperidyl, pyrrolyl or morpholinyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBromoacids 1 are converted to bromoacid chlorides 2 using thionylchloride (\nJ.S. Pizey, Synthetic Reactions 2: 65 (1974\n)), or, as depicted, using oxalyl chloride. Bromoacid chlorides 2 are reacted with Z\n1\nZ\n2\n NH, optionally in the presence of base such as Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, to provide reactive intermediates 3.\n\n \n \n\nwhere -W- is -C(Ar\n1\n)(Ar\n2\n)- or -C(H)(Ar\n3\n)-, and m, Ar\n1\n, Ar\n2\n, and Ar\n3\n are as defined above.\n\n\n \n\n\n4.3.2 \nSynthesis of Compounds of Structure 10\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nScheme 2 depicts methods for making intermediates useful in the synthesis 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds of formula l and formula ll, in which G is, for example, -CH\n2\nC(O)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n and where n, p, R\n3\n, and Ar\n4\n are as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNitriles 4 are added to a mixture of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and potassium carbonate. The resulting suspension is stirred at room temperature and then at reflux temperature to provide the amidoxime product 5. The amidoximes 5 are reacted with malonyl chloride derivates 6 to provide the product N-benzyl-piperidinyl compounds 7. The N-benzyl-piperidinyloxadiazoles 7 are heated in DMF in the presence of molecular sieves to provide the N-benzyl-oxadiazolyl-piperidine compounds 8, which are reacted with 1-chloroethyl chloroformate 9 to remove the benzyl moiety and provide the oxadiazolyl piperidines 10.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.3.3 \nSynthesis of Compounds of Structure 12\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nScheme 3 depicts methods for use in the synthesis 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds of formula I and formula II, in which R\n1\n is, for example, -C(O)NZ\n1\nZ\n2\n, where Z\n1\n and Z\n2\n are each independently a -(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl) group or Z\n1\n and Z\n2\n and the nitrogen atom to which they are attached are taken together to form N-(4-R\n4\n)-N'-1-piperazinyl, aziridyl, azetidyl, pyrrolidyl, piperidyl, homopiperidyl, pyrrolyl or morpholinyl; and in which G is, for example, -CH\n2\nC(O)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n; where -W- is -C(Ar\n1\n)(Ar\n2\n)- or -C(H)(Ar\n3\n)- ; and n, m, p, Ar\n1\n, Ar\n2\n, Ar\n3\n, Ar\n4\n, and R\n3\n are as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReactive intermediates 3 and oxadiazolylpiperidines 10 are combined and stirred, initially at 0°C, and then at room temperature to provide 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine compounds 11. The 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine compounds 11, may be dissolved in ammonia in methanol (e.g. 7N, Aldrich) and stirred at reflux temperature to provide the corresponding amides 12.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.3.4 \nSynthesis of Compounds of Structure 14\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nScheme 4 depicts methods for use in the synthesis 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds of formula I and formula 11, in which R\n1\n is -CO\n2\nR\n4\n and G is, for example, -CH\n2\nC(0)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n; where -W- is -C(Ar\n1\n)(Ar\n2\n)- or -C(H)(Ar\n3\n)- ; and n, m, p, Ar\n1\n, Ar\n2\n, Ar\n3\n, Ar\n4\n, and R\n3\n are as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBromoacid chlorides 2 (Scheme 1) are reacted with R\n4\n0H, optionally in the presence of a base such as pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine or Hünig's base, to provide bromoesters 13. Bromoesters 13 are reacted with oxadiazolylpiperidines 10 (Scheme 2) to provide 4-oxadiazolyl-piperidines 14.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.3.5 \nSynthesis of Compounds of Structure 4\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, compounds according to structure 4 \n(e.g.\n those in which where p is 0), which can be used in the synthesis of 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds of the invention, are prepared according to Scheme 5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCommercially-available (Aldrich) benzyl compounds 25, where X is -Cl or -Br, are reacted with bis(2-chloroethyl)amine 26 (Aldrich) in DMF in the presence of triethylamine at a temperature within the range of room temperature to 80 °C to provide the benzyl-protected amine 27.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstituted acetonitrile 28, dissolved in THF, is first treated with NaH at room temperature and then reacted with benzyl-protected amine 27 at reflux temperature in THF to provide the nitrile 4, which can be used, for example, in the synthesis depicted in Scheme 2, above.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach structure depicted herein is intended to encompass all stereoisomers and tautomers thereof, each of which is understood to be included in the present invention, whether specifically disclosed or not, and whether or not the stereoisomer or tautomer depicted herein represents a stereoisomer or tautomer in excess relative to any other stereoisomer ir tautomer thereof. Accordingly, the invention also encompasses 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds and their uses as described herein in the form of their individual stereoisomer or tautomers. In addition, one or more hydrogen, carbon or other atoms of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound can be replaced by an isotope of the hydrogen, carbon or other atoms, respectively. Such compounds, which are encompassed by the present invention, are useful as research and diagnostic tools in metabolic pharmacokinetic studies and in binding assays.\n\n\n \n\n\n4.4 \nTherapeutic Uses of the 4-0xadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the invention, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are administered to an animal, in one embodiment a mammal, in another embodiment a human, for the treatment or prevention of pain. The 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used to treat or prevent acute or chronic pain. For example, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used for, but are not limited to, treating or preventing cancer pain, central pain, labor pain, myocardial infarction pain, pancreatic pain, colic pain, post operative pain, headache pain, muscle pain, and pain associated with intensive care.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can also be used for inhibiting, preventing, or treating pain associated with inflammation or with an inflammatory disease in an animal. The pain to be inhibited, treated or prevented may be associated with inflammation associated with an inflammatory disease, which can arise where there is an inflammation of the body tissue, and which can be a local inflammatory response and/or a systemic inflammation. For example, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used to inhibit, treat, or prevent pain associated with inflammatory diseases including, but not limited to: organ transplant rejection; reoxygenation injury resulting from organ transplantation (see \nGrupp et al. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 31:297 303 (1999\n)) including, but not limited to, transplantation of the heart, lung, liver, or kidney; chronic inflammatory diseases of the joints, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and bone diseases associated with increased bone resorption; inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ileitis, ulcerative colitis, Barrett's syndrome, and Crohn's disease; inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and chronic obstructive airway disease; inflammatory diseases of the eye, including corneal dystrophy, trachoma, onchocerciasis, uveitis, sympathetic ophthalmitis and endophthalmitis; chronic inflammatory diseases of the gum, including gingivitis and periodontitis; tuberculosis; leprosy; inflammatory diseases of the kidney, including uremic complications, glomerulonephritis and nephrosis; inflammatory diseases of the skin, including sclerodermatitis, psoriasis and eczema; inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, including chronic demyelinating diseases of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis, AIDS-related neurodegeneration and Alzheimer s disease, infectious meningitis, encephalomyelitis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and viral or autoimmune encephalitis; autoimmune diseases, including Type I and Type 11 diabetes mellitus; diabetic complications, including, but not limited to, diabetic cataract, glaucoma, retinopathy, nephropathy (such as microaluminuria and progressive diabetic nephropathy), polyneuropathy, mononeuropathies, autonomic neuropathy, gangrene of the feet, atherosclerotic coronary arterial disease, peripheral arterial disease, nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar coma, foot ulcers, joint problems, and a skin or mucous membrane complication (such as an infection, a shin spot, a candidal infection or necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum); immune-complex vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); inflammatory diseases of the heart, such as cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease hypercholesterolemia, and atherosclerosis; as well as various other diseases that can have significant inflammatory components, including preeclampsia, chronic liver failure, brain and spinal cord trauma, and cancer. The 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can also be used for inhibiting, treating, or preventing pain associated with inflammatory disease that can, for example, be a systemic inflammation of the body, exemplified by gram-positive or gram negative shock, hemorrhagic or anaphylactic shock, or shock induced by cancer chemotherapy in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., shock associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Such shock can be induced, e.g., by a chemotherapeutic agent that is adminstered as a treatment for cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are administered to an animal, in one embodiment a mammal, in another embodiment a human, for the treatment or prevention of diarrhea. The 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used to treat or prevent acute or chronic diarrhea. For example, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used for, but are not limited to, treating or preventing acute diarrhea caused by a virus, such as but not limited to Norwalk-virus, Norwalk-like virus, Rotavirus, and Cytomegaloviurs: protozoa, such as but not limited to \nGirardia lamlia, Crpytosporidium\n and \nEntamoeba histolytica;\n and bacteria, including but not limited to \nStapylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens,\n enterotoxigenic \nE. coli, Vibrio cholera,\n enterohemmorrhagic \nE. coli\n 0157:H5, \nVibrio parahaemolyticus, Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella,\n enteroinvasive \nE. coli, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Yersinia enterocolitica, Chlamydia, Nisseria gonorrhoeae,\n and \nListeria monocytogenes.\n For example, the 4-0xadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used for treating or preventing chronic diarrhea classified as including, but not limited to, osmotic diarrhea, secretory diarrhea, or resulting from an inflammatory condition, a malabsorption syndrome, a motility disorder, and a chronic infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present inventor believes that unlike traditional opioid agonists and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds do not significantly cross the blood-brain barrier. Accordingly, the administration of an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound to an animal should result in fewer side effects, including, for example, respiratory depression, unwanted euphoria, sedation, increased drug tolerance, and increased drug dependence, that can result from the administration of traditional opioid agonists or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. In one embodiment, the administration of an effective amount of a 4-0xadiazolyl-piperidine Compound to an animal results in none of the aforementioned side effects. Therefore, in certain embodiments, the present methods encompass treating or preventing pain, while reducing or eliminating one or more of the aforementioned side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are agonists for and, accordingly, are capable of stimulating an opioid receptor. In one embodiment, the opiod receptor is a µ receptor. In another embodiment, the opioid receptor is an ORL-1 receptor. In a further embodiment, the opioid receptor is a δ-opioid receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to methods for stimulating opioid-receptor function in a cell comprising contacting a cell capable of expressing an opioid receptor with an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound. The method is also useful for stimulating opioid receptor function in a cell \nin vivo,\n in an animal, in one embodiment a human, by contacting a cell capable of expressing an opioid receptor, in an animal, with an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound. In one embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea in an animal. Brain tissue, spinal chord tissue, immune cells, cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and primary afferent nerve cells are examples of tissues and/or cells that are capable of expressing an opioid receptor. This method can be used \nin vitro,\n for example, as an assay to select cells that express an opioid receptor.\n\n\n \n\n\n4.4.1 \nTherapeutic/Prophylactic Administration and Compositions of the Invention\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDue to their activity, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are advantageously useful in veterinary and human medicine. As described above, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are useful for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea in an animal in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen administered to an animal, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be administered as a component of a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The present compositions, which comprise a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound, are in one embodiment administered orally. The compositions of the invention can also be adapted for and administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings \n(e.g.,\n oral mucosa, rectal, and intestinal mucosa, \netc.)\n and can be administered alone or together with another therapeutic agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, capsules, etc., and can be used to administer the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of administration include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The mode of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner. In most instances, administration will result in the release of a therapeutically effective amount of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds into the bloodstream.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn specific embodiments, it may be desirable to administer the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds locally. This may be achieved, for example, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and excipients such as triglycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see\n Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n) and \nTreat et al., Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer 317-327 and 353-365 (1989\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be delivered in a controlled-release system \n(see, e.g.,\n \nGoodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984\n)). Other controlled release systems discussed in the review by\n Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n) may be used. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (\nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n); \nSefton, CRC Crit. Ref Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987\n); \nBuchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980\n); and \nSaudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989\n)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used \n(see\n \nMedical Applications of Controlled Release (Langer and Wise eds., 1974\n); \nControlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance (Smolen and Ball eds., 1984\n); \nRanger and Peppas, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983\n); \nLevy et al., Science 228:190 (1985\n); \nDuring et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989\n); and \nHoward et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989\n)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of a target of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose. In further embodiments, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be administered by controlled-release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos.: 3,845,770\n \n; \n \n3,916,899\n \n; \n \n3,536,809\n \n; \n \n3,598,123\n \n; \n \n4,008,719\n \n; \n \n5,674,533\n \n; \n \n5,059,595\n \n; \n \n5,591,767\n \n; \n \n5,120,548\n \n; \n \n5,073,543\n \n; \n \n5,639,476\n \n; \n \n5,354,556\n \n; and \n \n5,733,566\n \n, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds. The invention thus encompasses single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration to the animal. Such pharmaceutical excipients can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The pharmaceutical excipients can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents may be used. When administered to an animal, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are preferably sterile. Water is a particularly useful excipient when the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The present compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for intravenous administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, normal (about 0.9%) saline, about 25 to about 30% polyethylene glycol (\"PEG\") diluted with saline or water, and about 2 to about 30% hydroxypropyl p-cyclodextrin diluted with water. In one embodiment, compositions for intravenous administration comprise the compound dissolved in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions may also include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water-free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are to be administered by infusion, they can be dispensed, for example, from an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for intraperitoneal administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, normal (about 0.9%) saline, about 25 to about 30% PEG diluted with saline or water, about 25 to about 30% propylene glycol (PG) diluted with saline or water, and about 2 to about 30% hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin diluted with water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for subcutaneous and intramuscular administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, water, normal (about 0.9%) saline, about 25 to about 30% PEG diluted with saline or water, and about 25 to about 30% PG diluted with saline or water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for oral administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, water, normal (about 0.9%) saline, about 25 to about 30% polyethylene glycol PEG diluted with saline or water, about 2 to about 30% hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin diluted with water, about 25 to about 30% PG diluted with saline or water, and about 1 to about 5% methylcellulose diluted with water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for intracerebroventricular and intrathecal administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, normal (about 0.9%) saline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained release formulations, suppositories, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the composition is in the form of a capsule \n(see e.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,698,155\n \n). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., 19th ed. 1995\n), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral administration to an animal, particularly a human being. Compositions for oral delivery may be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs, for example. Orally administered compositions can contain preserving agents, coloring agents, and one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin and flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated or otherwise formulated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these later platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate-release formulations. A time delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate may also be used. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, such excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControlled release pharmaceutical compositions can have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled counterparts. In one embodiment a controlled-release composition comprises a minimal amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled release compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled release compositions can favorably affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound, and can thus reduce the occurrence of adverse side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, controlled release compositions can initially release an amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound that promptly treats or prevents pain or diarrhea, and then gradually and continually release another amount of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. To maintain this constant level of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound in the body, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of 4-0xadiazolyl-piperidine Compound being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds that is effective in the treatment or prevention of pain or diarrhea can depend on the nature or severity of the disorder or condition causing the pain and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal effective dosage amounts. The precise dose to be employed can also depend on the intended route of administration, and the degree or severity of the pain or diarrhea and can be determined according to the judgment of the medical practitioner in view of each patient's circumstances and published clinical studies. Suitable effective dosage amounts can range from about 10 micrograms to about 2500 milligrams about every 4 h, although typically about 100 mg or less. In one embodiment, the effective dosage amount ranges from about 0.01 milligrams to about 100 milligrams of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound about every 4 h, in another embodiment about 0.020 milligrams to about 50 milligrams about every 4 h, and in another embodiment about 0.025 milligrams to about 20 milligrams about every 4 h. The dosage amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered; that is, if more than one 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound is administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a cell capable of expressing an opioid receptor is contacted with a 4-Oxadiazolyl-pipeiidine Compound \nin vitro,\n the effective amount for opioid receptor function stimulation will typically range from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/L, in one embodiment from about 0.1 mg to about 50 mg/L, and in another embodiment from about 1 mg to about 20 mg/L, of a solution or suspension of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In one embodiment, the opiod receptor is a µ receptor. In another embodiment, the opiod receptor is an ORL-1 receptor. In a further embodiment, the opioid receptor is a δ-opioid receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a cell capable of expressing an opioid receptor is contacted with a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound \nin vivo,\n the effective amount for opioid receptor function stimulation will typically range from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, in one embodiment from about 0.1 mg to about 50 mg/kg body weight per day, and in another embodiment from about 1 mg to about 20 mg/kg of body weight per day. In one embodiment, the opiod receptor is a µ receptor. In another embodiment, the opiod receptor is an ORL-1 receptor. In a further embodiment, the opioid receptor is a δ-opioid receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be assayed \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo\n for their ability to treat or prevent pain or diarrhea prior to use in humans. Animal model systems can be used to demonstrate the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds' safety or efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present methods for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea in an animal can further comprise administering to the animal an effective amount a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound in combination with an effective amount of another therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present methods for stimulating opioid-receptor function in a cell can further comprise contacting the cell with an effective amount of another therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of other therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, an opioid agonist, a non-opioid analgesic, a non-steroid antiinflammatory agent, an antimigraine agent, a Cox-II inhibitor, an antiemetic, a β-adrenergic blocker, an anticonvulsant, an antidepressant, a Ca\n2+\n -channel blocker, an anticancer agent, an anti-anxiety agent, an agent for treating or preventing an addictive disorder and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffective amounts of the other therapeutic agents are well known to those skilled in the art. However, it is well within the skilled artisan's purview to determine the other therapeutic agent's optimal effective-amount range. In one embodiment of the invention, where another therapeutic agent is administered to an animal, the effective amount of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound is less than its effective amount would be where the other therapeutic agent is not administered. In this case, without being bound by theory, it is believed that the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound and the other therapeutic agent act synergistically to treat or prevent pain or diarrhea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful opioid agonists include, but are not limited to, alfentanil, allylprodine, alphaprodine, anileridine, benzylmorphine, bezitramide, buprenorphine, butorphanol, clonitazene, codeine, desomorphine, dextromoramide, dezocine, diampromide, diamorphone, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, dimenoxadol, dimepheptanol, dimethylthiambutene, dioxaphetyl butyrate, dipipanone, eptazocine, ethoheptazine, ethylmethylthiambutene, ethylmorphine, etonitazene fentanyl, heroin, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, hydroxypethidine, isomethadone, ketobemidone, levorphanol, levophenacylmorphan, lofentanil, meperidine, meptazinol, metazocine, methadone, metopon, morphine, myrophine, nalbuphine, narceine, nicomorphine, norlevorphanol, normethadone, nalorphine, normorphine, norpipanone, opium, oxycodone, oxymorphone, papaveretum, pentazocine, phenadoxone, phenomorphan, phenazocine, phenoperidine, piminodine, piritramide, proheptazine, promedol, properidine, propiram, propoxyphene, sufentanil, tilidine, tramadol, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the opioid agonist is selected from codeine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, morphine, tramadol, oxymorphone, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful non-opioid analgesics include non steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, benoxaprofen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, flubufen, ketoprofen, indoprofen, piroprofen, carprofen, oxaprozin, pramoprofen, muroprofen, trioxaprofen, suprofen, aminoprofen, tiaprofenic acid, fluprofen, bucloxic acid, indomethacin, sulindac, tolmetin, zomepirac, tiopinac, zidometacin, acemetacin, fentiazac, clidanac, oxpinac, mefenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, flufenamic acid, niflumic acid, tolfenamic acid, diflurisal, flufenisal, piroxicam, sudoxicam, isoxicam, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures thereof.
