What is referred to herein as the \"antisense\" or \"antisense starnd\" or \"guide strand\" refers to an oligonucleotide having complementarity to a target nucleic acid, for example target mRNA. Without wishing to be bound to theory, the antisense, or guide strand, is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and directs post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide strand base pairs with a complementary sequence of a messenger RNA molecule and mediates cleavage of the mRNA by Argonaute, the catalytic component of RISC complex. \n\n\n A \"pro-apoptotic polypeptide\" refers to a polypeptide encoded by any of the above listed genes, including splice variants, isoforms, orthologs, or paralogs and the like. \n\n\nAn \"inhibitor\" is a compound which is capable of reducing the expression of a gene or the activity of the product of such gene to an extent sufficient to achieve a desired biological or physiological effect. The term \"inhibitor\" as used herein refers to one or more of an oligonucleotide inhibitor, including siRNA, shRNA, miRNA and ribozymes. Inhibition may also be referred to as down-regulation or, for RNAi, silencing. \n\n\nThe term \"inhibit\" as used herein refers to reducing the expression of a gene or the activity of the product of such gene to an extent sufficient to achieve a desired biological or physiological effect. Inhibition may be complete or partial. \n\n As used herein, the terms \"polynucleotide\" and \"nucleic acid\" may be used interchangeably and refer to nucleotide sequences comprising deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and ribonucleic acid (RNA). The terms should also be understood to include, as equivalents, analogs of either RNA or DNA made from nucleotide analogs. Throughout this application mRNA sequences are set forth as representing the target of their corresponding genes. The terms \"mRNA polynucleotide sequence\" and mRNA are used interchangeably. \n\n\n \"Oligonucleotide\" or \"oligomer\" refers to a deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide sequence from about 2 to about 50 nucleotides. Each DNA or RNA nucleotide may be independently natural or synthetic, and or modified or unmodified. Modifications include changes to the sugar moiety, the base moiety and or the linkages between nucleotides in the oligonucleotide. The compounds of the present invention encompass molecules comprising deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified deoxyribonucleotides, modified ribonucleotides and combinations thereof.As used herein, the terms \"non-pairing nucleotide analog\" means a nucleotide analog which comprises a non-base pairing moiety including but not limited to: 6 des amino adenosine (Nebularine), 4-Me-indole, 3-nitropyrrole, 5- nitroindole, Ds, Pa, N3-Me ribo U, N3-Me riboT, N3-Me dC, N3-Me-dT, Nl-Me-dG, Nl- Me-dA, N3-ethyl-dC, N3-Me dC. In some embodiments the non-base pairing nucleotide analog is a ribonucleotide. In other embodiments it is a deoxyribonucleotide. \n\n\n The present invention provides methods and compositions for inhibiting expression of a target gene in vivo. In general, the method includes administering oligoribonucleotides, in particular small interfering RNAs (i.e., siRNAs) or a nucleic acid material that generates siRNA in a cell, to target a mammalian mRNA in an amount sufficient to down-regulate expression of a target gene by an RNA interference mechanism. In particular, the method is useful for inhibiting expression of the gene for treatment of a subject suffering from a disease related to expression of that gene. In accordance with the present invention, the siRNA molecules or inhibitors of the target gene are used as drugs to treat various pathologies. \n\n\n \"siRNA compound\" and \"nucleic acid molecule\" may be used interchangeably herein. \n\n \"Nucleotide\" is meant to encompass a compound consisting of a nucleoside (a sugar, usually ribose or deoxyribose, and a purine or pyrimidine base) and a phospho linker; such as a deoxyribonucleotide and a ribonucleotide, which may be natural or synthetic, and be modified or unmodified. Modifications include changes and substitutions to the sugar moiety, the base moiety and/or the internucleotide linkages. \n\n\n A \"phosphate based\" moiety includes inorganic phosphate (Pi) and phosphorothioate (Ps).\n\n\nAll analogs of, or modifications to, a nucleotide / oligonucleotide may be employed with the present invention, provided that said analog or modification does not substantially adversely affect the function of the nucleotide / oligonucleotide. Acceptable modifications include modifications of the sugar moiety, modifications of the base moiety, modifications in the internucleotide linkages and combinations thereof. \n\n\n What is sometimes referred to in the present invention as an \"abasic nucleotide\" or \"abasic nucleotide analog\" is more properly referred to as a pseudo-nucleotide or an unconventional moiety. A nucleotide is a monomeric unit of nucleic acid, consisting of a ribose or deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate, and a base (adenine, guanine, thymine, or cytosine in DNA; adenine, guanine, uracil, or cytosine in RNA). A modified nucleotide comprises a modification in one or more of the sugar, phosphate and or base. The abasic pseudo- nucleotide lacks a base, and thus is not strictly a nucleotide. Abasic deoxyribose moiety includes for example abasic deoxyribose-3 '-phosphate; l ,2-dideoxy-D-ribofuranose-3- phosphate; l ,4-anhydro-2-deoxy-D-ribitol-3-phosphate. Inverted abasic deoxyribose moiety includes inverted deoxyriboabasic; 3 ',5' inverted deoxyabasic 5 '-phosphate.

The compounds of the present invention may be synthesized using one or more inverted nucleotides, for example inverted thymidine or inverted adenine (for example see Takei, et al, 2002. JBC 277(26):23800-06. \n\n\n The term \"non-nucleotide moiety\" refers to a moiety that is not a nucleotide, i.e does not include all of the components of a nucleotide: a sugar, a base and a linker. \n\n\n The term \"unconventional moiety\" as used herein refers to the non-nucleotide moieties including an abasic moiety, an inverted abasic moiety, a hydrocarbon (alkyl) moiety, and an inorganic phosphate and further includes a deoxyribonucleotide, a modified deoxyribonucleotide, a mirror nucleotide (L-DNA or L-RNA), a non-base pairing nucleotide analog and a nucleotide joined to an adjacent nucleotide by a 2'-5' internucleotide phosphate bond; bridged nucleic acids including LNA and ethylene bridged nucleic acids, linkage modified (e.g. PACE) and base modified nucleotides as well as additional moieties explicitly disclosed herein as unconventional moieties. \n\n\n An alkyl moiety, a \"hydrocarbon moiety' or a or \"derivative\" of alkyl or hydrocarbon moiety refers to C2, C3, C4, C5 or C6 straight chain or branched alkyl moieties, including for example C2 (ethyl), C3 (propyl) and such moieties per se or further comprising a \n\n functional group including alcohols, phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, phosphonoacetate and also includes amines, carboxylic acids, esters, amides aldehydes. \"Hydrocarbon moiety\" and \"alkyl moiety\" are used interchangeably. Without wishing to be bound to theory, the nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein and having a 3' non-nucleotide overhang (Z or Z' i.e. C3Pi-C3Ps; C3Pi-C30H; C3Pi-C3Pi; C3pi-rAb; C3pi-dAb) are recognized by the PAZ domain of Argonaute and are able to perform RNAi, while exhibiting good stability. \n\n\n \"Terminal functional group\" includes halogen, alcohol, amine, carboxylic, ester, amide, aldehyde, ketone, ether groups. \n\n\n In the context of the present invention, a \"mirror\" nucleotide (also referred to as a spiegelmer) is a nucleotide analog with reverse chirality to the naturally occurring or commonly employed nucleotide, i.e., a mirror image of the naturally occurring or commonly employed nucleotide. The mirror nucleotide is a ribonucleotide (L-RNA) or a deoxyribonucleotide (L-DNA) and may further comprise at least one sugar or base modification and/or a backbone modification, such as a phosphorothioate or phosphonate moiety.

Naturally occurring bases include adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and uracil. Modified bases of nucleotides include inosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2- aminoadenine, 6-methyl, 2-propyl and other alkyl adenines, 5-halo uracil, 5-halo cytosine, 6-aza cytosine and 6-aza thymine, pseudo uracil, 4- thiouracil, 8-halo adenine, 8-aminoadenine, 8-thiol adenine, 8-thiolalkyl adenines, 8-hydroxyl adenine and other 8-substituted adenines, 8-halo guanines, 8-amino guanine, 8-thiol guanine, 8-thioalkyl guanines, 8- hydroxyl guanine and other substituted guanines, other aza and deaza adenines, other aza and deaza guanines, 5-trifluoromethyl uracil and 5- trifluoro cytosine. SiRNA compounds comprising one or more abasic pseudo- nucleotides are encompassed by the present invention. A nucleotide monomer comprising a modified base, including abasic pseudo-nucleotide monomers, may be substituted for one or more ribonucleotides of the oligonucleotide. An abasic pseudo-nucleotide monomer may be included at the one or more of the terminal positions or as a 5' terminal cap. A 5' terminal cap may also be selected from an inverted abasic pseudo-nucleotide analog, an L-DNA nucleotide, and a C6-imine phosphate. \n\n\nIn addition, analogues of polynucleotides are prepared wherein the structure of one or more nucleotide is fundamentally altered and better suited as therapeutic or experimental reagents. An example of a nucleotide analog is a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) wherein the deoxyribose (or ribose) phosphate backbone in DNA (or RNA comprises with a polyamide backbone \n\n which is similar to that found in peptides. PNA analogs have been shown to be resistant to enzymatic degradation and to have extended lives in vivo and in vitro. \n\n\n Possible modifications to the sugar residue are manifold and include 2'-0 alkyl, 2'-halo (e.g. 2' deoxy fluoro), locked nucleic acid (LNA), glycol nucleic acid (GNA), threose nucleic acid (TNA), arabinoside; altritol (ANA) and other 6-membered sugars including morpholinos, and cyclohexinyls.

One or more deoxyribonucleotides are also tolerated in the compounds of the present invention. In some embodiments (Ν') comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 DNA moieties.\n\n\nLNA compounds are disclosed in International Patent Publication Nos. WO 00/47599, WO 99/14226, and WO 98/39352. Examples of siRNA compounds comprising LNA nucleotides are disclosed in Elmen et al, (NAR 2005. 33(l):439-447) and in International Patent Publication No. WO 2004/083430. Six-membered ring nucleotide analogs are disclosed in Allart, et al (Nucleosides & Nucleotides, 1998, 17: 1523-1526,; and Perez-Perez, et al, 1996, Bioorg. and Medicinal Chem Letters 6: 1457-1460) Oligonucleotides comprising 6- membered ring nucleotide analogs including hexitol and altritol nucleotide monomers are disclosed in International patent application publication No. WO 2006/047842. \n\n\n Backbone modifications, also known as internucleotide linkage modifications, , such as ethyl (resulting in a phospho-ethyl triester); propyl (resulting in a phospho-propyl triester); and butyl (resulting in a phospho-butyl triester) are also possible. Other backbone modifications include polymer backbones, cyclic backbones, acyclic backbones, thiophosphate-D-ribose backbones, amidates, phosphonoacetate derivatives. Certain structures include siRNA compounds having one or a plurality of 2'-5' internucleotide linkages (bridges or backbone). \n\n In some embodiments, neither (N)x nor (N')y are phosphorylated at the 3' and 5' termini. In other embodiments either or both (N)x and (N')y are phosphorylated at the 3' termini (3' Pi). In yet another embodiment, either or both (N)x and (N')y are phosphorylated at the 3' termini with non-cleavable phosphate groups. In yet another embodiment, either or both (N)x and (N')y are phosphorylated at the terminal 2' termini position using cleavable or non- cleavable phosphate groups. Further, the inhibitory nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may comprise one or more gaps and/or one or more nicks and/or one or more mismatches. Without wishing to be bound by theory, gaps, nicks and mismatches have the advantage of partially destabilizing the nucleic acid / siR A, so that it may be more easily processed by endogenous cellular machinery such as DICER, DROSHA or RISC into its inhibitory components. \n\n\n In the context of the present invention, a gap in a nucleic acid refers to the absence of one or more internal nucleotides in one strand, while a nick in a nucleic acid refers to the absence of an internucleotide linkage between two adjacent nucleotides in one strand. Any of the molecules of the present invention may contain one or more gaps and/or one or more nicks.\n\n\nOligonucleotides \n\n\n In a non-limiting example, Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) of PCT Patent Application Publication No. WO 2009/044392, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference in its entirety, comprise nucleic acid sequences of sense and corresponding antisense oligomers, useful in preparing siRNA compounds according to the present application. The compounds are used as chemically and or structurally modified compounds. \n\n\n The selection and synthesis of siRNA corresponding to known genes has been widely reported; see for example Ui-Tei et al., J Biomed Biotechnol. 2006; 65052; Chalk et al., BBRC. 2004, 319(l):264-74; Sioud & Leirdal, Met. Mol Biol. 2004, 252:457-69; Levenkova et al, Bioinform. 2004, 20(3):430-2; Ui-Tei et al, NAR. 2004, 32(3):936-48. For examples of the use and production of modified siRNA see for example Braasch et al., \n\n Biochem. 2003, 42(26):7967-75; Chiu et al., RNA. 2003, 9(9): 1034-48; PCT Publication Nos. WO 2004/015107 and WO 02/44321 and US Patent Nos. 5,898,031 and 6,107,094.\n\n\nThe present invention provides double-stranded oligonucleotides (e.g. siRNAs), which down-regulate the expression of a desired gene. A siRNA of the invention is a duplex oligoribonucleotide in which the sense strand is derived from the mRNA sequence of the desired gene, and the antisense strand is at least substantially complementary to the sense strand. In general, some deviation from the target mRNA sequence is tolerated without compromising the siRNA activity (see e.g. Czauderna et al., NAR. 2003, 31(1 1):2705-2716). An siRNA of the invention inhibits gene expression on a post-transcriptional level with or without destroying the mRNA. Without being bound by theory, siRNA may target the mRNA for specific cleavage and degradation and/ or may inhibit translation from the targeted message. \n\n\n In other embodiments at least one of the two strands may have an overhang of at least one nucleotide at the 5'-terminus; the overhang may consist of at least one deoxyribonucleotide. The length of RNA duplex is from about 16 to about 40 ribonucleotides, preferably 19 ribonucleotides. Further, the length of each strand may independently have a length selected from the group consisting of about 16 to about 40 bases, preferably 18 to 23 bases and more preferably 19 ribonucleotides. \n\n\n In certain embodiments the complementarity between said first strand and the target nucleic acid is perfect. In some embodiments, the strands are substantially complementary, i.e. having one, two or up to five mismatches between said first strand and the target mRNA or between the first and the second strands. Substantially complementary refers to complementarity of greater than about 70%, and less than 100% to another sequence. For example in a duplex region consisting of 19 base pairs one mismatch results in 94.7% complementarity, two mismatches results in about 89.5% complementarity, 3 mismatches results in about 84.2% complementarity, 4 mismatches results in about 79% complementarity and 5 mismatches results in about 74% complementarity, rendering the duplex region substantially complementary. Accordingly, substantially identical refers to identity of greater than about 70%, to another sequence. \n\n The first strand and the second strand may be linked by a loop structure, which may be comprised of a non-nucleic acid polymer such as, inter alia, polyethylene glycol. Alternatively, the loop structure may be comprised of a nucleic acid, including modified and non-modified ribonucleotides and modified and non-modified deoxyribonucleotides. \n\n\nFurther, the 5'-terminus of the first strand of the siRNA may be linked to the 3'-terminus of the second strand, or the 3'-terminus of the first strand may be linked to the 5'-terminus of the second strand, said linkage being via a nucleic acid linker typically having a length between 2-100 nucleobases, preferably about 2 to about 30 nucleobases. \n\n\n In some embodiments of the compounds of the invention having alternating ribonucleotides modified in at least one of the antisense and the sense strands of the compound, for 19 mer and 23 mer oligomers the ribonucleotides at the 5' and 3' termini of the antisense strand are modified in their sugar residues, and the ribonucleotides at the 5' and 3' termini of the sense strand are unmodified in their sugar residues. For 21 mer oligomers the ribonucleotides at the 5' and 3' termini of the sense strand are modified in their sugar residues, and the ribonucleotides at the 5' and 3' termini of the antisense strand are unmodified in their sugar residues, or may have an optional additional modification at the 3' terminus. As mentioned above, in some embodiments the middle nucleotide of the antisense strand is unmodified.\n\n\nAccording to one embodiment of the invention, the antisense and the sense strands of the oligonucleotide / siRNA are phosphorylated only at the 3 '-terminus and not at the 5'- terminus. According to another embodiment of the invention, the antisense and the sense strands are non-phosphorylated. According to yet another embodiment of the invention, the 5' most ribonucleotide in the sense strand is modified to abolish any possibility of in vivo 5'- phosphorylation. \n\n\n Any siRNA sequence disclosed herein are prepared having any of the modifications / structures disclosed herein. The combination of sequence plus structure is novel and is useful used in the treatment of the conditions disclosed herein. \n\n Pharmaceutical Compositions \n\n\n While it may be possible for the compounds of the present invention to be administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present them as a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more of the compounds of the invention; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This composition may comprise a mixture of two or more different oligonucleotides / siR As.\n\n\nThe invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound of the invention covalently or non-covalently bound to one or more compounds of the invention in an amount effective to inhibit one or more genes as disclosed above; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compound may be processed intracellularly by endogenous cellular complexes to produce one or more oligoribonucleotides of the invention. \n\n\n The invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and one or more of the compounds of the invention in an amount effective to down-regulate expression in a cell of a target gene, the compound comprising a sequence substantially complementary to the sequence of (N)\nx\n. In certain embodiments, the target gene is a viral, bacterial or mammalian gene. In various embodiments the target gene is a mammalian gene, preferably a human gene. \n\n\n Additionally, the invention provides a method of inhibiting the expression of a target gene, by at least 50% as compared to a control, comprising contacting an mR A transcript of the target gene with one or more of the compounds of the invention. In some embodiments an active siRNA compound inhibits gene expression at a level of at least 50%, 60% or 70% as compared to control. In certain embodiments inhibition is at a level of at least 75%, 80% or 90% as compared to control. In some embodiments the target gene is a pro-apoptotic gene as disclosed herein. \n\n\n In one embodiment the oligoribonucleotide is inhibiting one or more of the pro-apoptotic genes of the present invention, whereby the inhibition is selected from the group \n\n comprising inhibition of gene function, inhibition of polypeptide and inhibition of mRNA expression. \n\n\n In one embodiment the compound inhibits expression of a polypeptide encoded by a target gene whereby the inhibition is selected from the group comprising inhibition of function (which may be examined by an enzymatic assay or a binding assay with a known interactor of the native gene / polypeptide, inter alia), inhibition of protein (which may be examined by Western blotting, ELISA or immuno-precipitation, inter alia) and inhibition of mRNA expression (which may be examined by Northern blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, in-situ hybridisation or microarray hybridisation, inter alia). \n\n\nIn additional embodiments the invention provides a method of treating a subject suffering from a disease accompanied by an elevated level of the pro-apoptotic genes of the present invention, the method comprising administering to the subject a compound of the invention in a therapeutically effective dose thereby treating the subject. \n\n\n Delivery \n\n\nIn some embodiments the siRNA molecules of the present invention are delivered to the target tissue by direct application of the naked molecules prepared with a carrier or a diluent.\n\n\nThe term \"naked siRNA\" refers to siRNA molecules that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist, promote or facilitate entry into the cell, including viral sequences, viral particles, liposome formulations, lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. For example, siRNA in PBS is \"naked siRNA\". \n\n\n However, in some embodiments the siRNA molecules of the invention are delivered in liposome or lipofectin formulations and the like and are prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Such methods are described, for example, in US Patent Nos. 5,593,972, 5,589,466, and 5,580,859, which are herein incorporated by reference. \n\n\nDelivery systems aimed specifically at the enhanced and improved delivery of siRNA into mammalian cells have been developed, (see, for example, Shen et al FEBS Let. 2003, 539: 111-114; Xia et al, Nat. Biotech. 2002, 20: 1006-1010; Reich et al, Mol. Vision 2003, \n\n 9: 210-216; Sorensen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 2003. 327: 761-766; Lewis et al, Nat. Gen. 2002, 32: 107-108 and Simeoni et al, NAR 2003, 31,11 : 2717-2724). siRNA has recently been successfully used for inhibition of gene expression in primates (see for example, Tolentino et al, Retina 24(4):660. \n\n\nThe pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, solvents, diluents, excipients, adjuvants and vehicles as well as implant carriers generally refer to inert, non-toxic solid or liquid fillers, diluents or encapsulating material not reacting with the active ingredients of the invention and they include liposomes and microspheres. Examples of delivery systems useful in the present invention include US Patent Nos. 5,225,182; 5,169,383; 5,167,616; 4,959,217; 4,925,678; 4,487,603; 4,486,194; 4,447,233; 4,447,224; 4,439,196; and 4,475,196. Many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are well known to those skilled in the art. In one specific embodiment of this invention topical and transdermal formulations may be selected. The siRNAs or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are administered and dosed in accordance with good medical practice, taking into account the clinical condition of the individual patient, the disease to be treated, the site and method of administration, scheduling of administration, patient age, sex, body weight and other factors known to medical practitioners. \n\n\n The \"therapeutically effective dose\" for purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations as are known in the art. The dose must be effective to achieve improvement including but not limited to improved survival rate or more rapid recovery, or improvement or elimination of symptoms and other indicators as are selected as appropriate measures by those skilled in the art. \n\n\n In general, Dosage may be from 0.01 mg to 1 g per kg of body weight (e.g., 0.1 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, 1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg, 1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, or 500 mg per kg). \n\n\n A suitable dosage unit of nucleic acid molecules may be in the range of 0.001 to 0.25 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, or in the range of 0.01 to 20 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, or in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrograms per \n\n kilogram body weight per day, or in the range of 0.10 to 5 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, or in the range of 0.1 to 2.5 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day.\n\n\nSuitable amounts of nucleic acid molecules may be administered and these amounts can be empirically determined using standard methods. Effective concentrations of individual nucleic acid molecule species in the environment of a cell may be about 1 femtomolar, about 50 femtomolar, 100 femtomolar, 1 picomolar, 1.5 picomolar, 2.5 picomolar, 5 picomolar, 10 picomolar, 25 picomolar, 50 picomolar, 100 picomolar, 500 picomolar, 1 nanomolar, 2.5 nanomolar, 5 nanomolar, 10 nanomolar, 25 nanomolar, 50 nanomolar, 100 nanomolar, 500 nanomolar, 1 micromolar, 2.5 micromolar, 5 micromolar, 10 micromolar, 100 micromolar or more. \n\n\n The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form varies depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Dosage unit forms generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient. \n\n\nIt is understood that the specific dose level for any particular subject depends upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions that include the nucleic acid molecule disclosed herein may be administered once daily, qid, tid, bid, QD, or at any interval and for any duration that is medically appropriate. However, the therapeutic agent may also be dosed in dosage units containing two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day. In that case, the nucleic acid molecules contained in each sub-dose may be correspondingly smaller in order to achieve the total daily dosage unit. The dosage unit can also be compounded for a single dose over several days, e.g., using a conventional sustained release formulation which provides sustained and consistent release of the dsRNA over a several day period. Sustained release formulations are well known in the art. The dosage unit may contain a corresponding multiple of the daily dose. The composition can be \n\n compounded in such a way that the sum of the multiple units of a nucleic acid together contain a sufficient dose. \n\n\n Kits and containers \n\n\n Also provided are kits, containers and formulations that include a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., an siNA molecule) as provided herein for reducing expression of a target gene for administering the nucleic acid molecule to a subject. In some embodiments a kit includes at least one container and at least one label. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, and test tubes. The containers can be formed from a variety of materials such as glass, metal or plastic. Kits may further include associated indications and/or directions; reagents and other compositions or tools used for such purpose can also be included. \n\n\n The container can alternatively hold a composition that is effective for treating, diagnosis, prognosing or prophylaxing a condition and can have a sterile access port (for example the container can be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). The active agents in the composition can be a nucleic acid molecule capable of specifically binding a target gene and/or modulating the function of a target gene. \n\n\n A kit may further include a second container that includes a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and/or dextrose solution. It can further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, stirrers, needles, syringes, and/or package inserts with indications and/or instructions for use. \n\n\n The units dosage ampoules or multidose containers, in which the nucleic acid molecules are packaged prior to use, may include an hermetically sealed container enclosing an amount of polynucleotide or solution containing a polynucleotide suitable for a pharmaceutically effective dose thereof, or multiples of an effective dose. The polynucleotide is packaged as a sterile formulation, and the hermetically sealed container is designed to preserve sterility of the formulation until use. \n\n The container in which the polynucleotide including a sequence encoding a cellular immune response element or fragment thereof may include a package that is labeled, and the label may bear a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency, for example the Food and Drug Administration, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency under Federal law, of the manufacture, use, or sale of the polynucleotide material therein for human administration. \n\n\n Federal law requires that the use of pharmaceutical compositions in the therapy of humans be approved by an agency of the Federal government. In the United States, enforcement is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration, which issues appropriate regulations for securing such approval, detailed in 21 U.S.C. § 301-392. Regulation for biologic material, including products made from the tissues of animals is provided under 42 U.S.C. § 262. Similar approval is required by most foreign countries. Regulations vary from country to country, but individual procedures are well known to those in the art and the compositions and methods provided herein preferably comply accordingly. \n\n\nThe dosage to be administered depends to a large extent on the condition and size of the subject being treated as well as the frequency of treatment and the route of administration. Regimens for continuing therapy, including dose and frequency may be guided by the initial response and clinical judgment. \n\n\n The compounds of the present invention are administered by any of the conventional routes of administration. It should be noted that the compound is administered as the compound, per se, or as pharmaceutically acceptable salt and is administered alone or as an active ingredient in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, solvents, diluents, excipients, adjuvants and vehicles. The compounds are administered orally, topically, subcutaneously or parenterally including intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraperitoneally, and intranasal, inhalation, transtympanic administration as well as intrathecal and infusion techniques. Implants of the compounds are also useful. Liquid forms may be prepared for injection, the term including subcutaneous, transdermal, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, and other parental routes of administration. The liquid compositions include aqueous solutions, with and without organic co-solvents, aqueous or \n\n oil suspensions, emulsions with edible oils, as well as similar pharmaceutical vehicles. In a particular embodiment, the administration comprises intravenous administration. In another embodiment the administration comprises topical or local administration. \n\n\n In addition, in certain embodiments the compositions for use in the novel treatments of the present invention may be formed as aerosols, for example for intranasal administration.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, oral compositions (such as tablets, suspensions, solutions) may be effective for local delivery to the oral cavity such as oral composition suitable for mouthwash for the treatment of oral mucositis. \n\n\n In embodiments the subject being treated is a warm-blooded animal and, in particular, mammals including human. \n\n\n In an additional embodiment, the modification is a modification of the phosphate moiety, whereby the modified phosphate moiety is selected from the group comprising phosphorothioate or lack of a phosphate group. \n\n\n The molecules of the present invention comprise siRNA, synthetic siR As, synthetic shRNAs, in addition to other nucleic acid sequences or molecules which encode such molecules or other inhibitory nucleotide molecules. \n\n\n A further end modification is a biotin group. Such biotin group may preferably be attached to either the most 5' or the most 3' nucleotide of the first and/or second strand or to both ends. In a more embodiment the biotin group is coupled to a polypeptide or a protein. It is also within the scope of the present invention that the polypeptide or protein is attached through any of the other aforementioned end modifications. \n\n\n The various end modifications as disclosed herein are preferably located at the ribose moiety of a nucleotide of the nucleic acid according to the present invention. More particularly, the end modification may be attached to or replace any of the OH-groups of the ribose moiety, including but not limited to the 2ΌΗ, 3ΌΗ and 5ΌΗ position, provided that the nucleotide thus modified is a terminal nucleotide. Inverted abasic or abasic are nucleotides, either deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides which do not have a nucleobase moiety. This kind \n\n of compound is, inter alia, described in Sternberger, M., et al., (2002). Antisense Nucleic Acid Drag Dev, 12, 131-43. siNA compounds are described in international patent application WO 03/070918. \n\n\n It is to be understood that, in the context of the present invention, any of the siRNA molecules disclosed herein, or any long double-stranded RNA molecules (typically 25-500 nucleotides in length) which are processed by endogenous cellular complexes (such as DICER - see above) to form the siRNA molecules disclosed herein, or molecules which comprise the siRNA molecules disclosed herein, are incorporated into the molecules of the present invention to form additional novel molecules, and are employed in the treatment of the diseases or disorders described herein. \n\n\n In particular, it is envisaged that a long oligonucleotide may be delivered in a carrier, preferably a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and may be processed intracellularly by endogenous cellular complexes (e.g. by DROSHA and DICER as described above) to produce one or more smaller double stranded oligonucleotides (siRNAs) which are oligonucleotides of the invention. This oligonucleotide is termed a tandem shRNA construct. It is envisaged that this long oligonucleotide is a single stranded oligonucleotide comprising one or more stem and loop structures, wherein each stem region comprises a sense and corresponding antisense siRNA sequence. Any molecules, such as, for example, antisense DNA molecules which comprise the inhibitory sequences disclosed herein (with the appropriate nucleic acid modifications) are particularly desirable and may be used in the same capacity as their corresponding RNAs / siRNAs for all uses and methods disclosed herein. \n\n\n In addition, analogs of polynucleotides can be prepared wherein the structure of the nucleotide is fundamentally altered and that are better suited as therapeutic or experimental reagents. An example of a nucleotide analog is a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) wherein the deoxyribose (or ribose) phosphate backbone in DNA (or RNA comprises a polyamide backbone which is similar to that found in peptides. PNA analogs have been shown to be resistant to degradation by enzymes and to have extended lives in vivo and in vitro. Further,\n\n\nPNAs have been shown to bind stronger to a complementary DNA sequence than a DNA \n\n molecule. This observation is attributed to the lack of charge repulsion between the PNA strand and the DNA strand. Other modified monomers useful in synthesizing the oligonucleotides include moieties having polymer backbones, cyclic backbones, or acyclic backbones. \n\n\nMethods of Treatment \n\n\n In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for the treatment of a subject in need of treatment for a disease or disorder associated with the abnormal expression of a target gene, comprising administering to the subject an amount of an inhibitor which reduces or inhibits expression of the gene. \n\n\nIn certain embodiments the subject being treated is a warm-blooded animal and, in particular, mammals including human. \n\n\n The methods of the invention comprise administering to the subject one or more inhibitory compounds which down-regulate expression of a gene; and in particular siRNA in a therapeutically effective dose so as to thereby treat the subject. \n\n\nThe term \"treatment\" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) a disorder as listed herein. Those in need of treatment include those already experiencing the disease or condition, those prone to having the disease or condition, and those in which the disease or condition is to be prevented. The compounds of the invention are administered before, during or subsequent to the onset of the disease or condition or symptoms associated therewith. In cases where treatment is for the purpose of prevention, then the present invention relates to a method for delaying the onset of or averting the development of the disease or disorder. \n\n\n The present invention relates to the use of compounds which down-regulate the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes of the invention particularly to novel small interfering RNAs (siR As), in the treatment of the following diseases or conditions in which inhibition of the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes is beneficial: hearing loss, acute renal failure (ARF), glaucoma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other acute lung and respiratory injuries, ischemia-reperfusion injury following lung transplantation, organ transplantation \n\n including lung, liver, heart, bone marrow, pancreas, cornea and kidney transplantation which includes DGF; spinal cord injury, pressure sores, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), dry eye syndrome, ocular ischemic conditions including ION and NAION; oral mucositis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Other indications include chemical- induced nephrotoxicity and chemical-induced neurotoxicity, for example toxicity induced by cisplatin and cisplatin-like compounds, by aminoglycosides, by loop diuretics, and by hydroquinone and their analogs. \n\n\n Methods, molecules and compositions which inhibit the pro-apoptotic genes of the invention are discussed herein at length, and any of said molecules and/or compositions may be beneficially employed in the treatment of a subject suffering from any of said conditions.\n\n\nIn a further aspect an article of manufacture is provided which includes packaging material comprising an oligonucleotide composition according to the invention that is therapeutically effective in treating a subject suffering from any one of the indications disclsoed herein, and instructions for use. \n\n\nThe present invention also provides for a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises: \n\n\n providing one or more compounds of the invention ; and \n\n\n admixing said compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n The present invention also provides for a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises admixing one or more compounds of the present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the compound used in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition is admixed with a carrier in a pharmaceutically effective dose. In a particular embodiment the compound of the present invention is conjugated to a steroid or to a lipid or to another suitable molecule e.g. to cholesterol. \n\n Synthesis of modified compounds \n\n\n The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized by any of the methods that are well known in the art for synthesis of ribonucleic (or deoxyribonucleic) oligonucleotides. Such synthesis is, among others, described in Beaucage and Iyer, Tetrahedron 1992; 48:2223-2311; Beaucage and Iyer, Tetrahedron 1993; 49: 6123-6194 and Caruthers, et. al, Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 287-313; the synthesis of thioates is, among others, described in Eckstein, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402, the synthesis of R A molecules is described in Sproat, in Humana Press 2005 edited by Herdewijn P.; Kap. 2: 17-31 and respective downstream processes are, among others, described in Pingoud et. al., in IRL Press 1989 edited by Oliver R.W.A.; Kap. 7: 183-208. \n\n\n Other synthetic procedures are known in the art e.g. the procedures as described in Usman et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1987, 109:7845; Scaringe et al, NAR, 1990, 18:5433; Wincott et al, NAR 1995,. 23:2677-2684; and Wincott et al, Methods Mol. Bio., 1997, 74:59, and these procedures may make use of common nucleic acid protecting and coupling groups, such as dimethoxytrityl at the 5'-end, and phosphoramidites at the 3'-end. The modified (e.g. 2'-0- methylated) nucleotides and unmodified nucleotides are incorporated as desired. \n\n\n The oligonucleotides of the present invention can be synthesized separately and joined together post-synthetically, for example, by ligation (Moore et al., Science 1992, 256:9923; International Patent Publication No. WO 93/23569; Shabarova et al, NAR 1991, 19:4247; Bellon et al., Nucleosides & Nucleotides, 1997, 16:951 ; Bellon et al., Bioconjugate Chem 1997, 8:204), or by hybridization following synthesis and/or deprotection. \n\n\n It is noted that a commercially available machine (available, inter alia, from Applied Biosystems) can be used; the oligonucleotides are prepared according to the sequences disclosed herein. Overlapping pairs of chemically synthesized fragments can be ligated using methods well known in the art (e.g., see US Patent No. 6,121 ,426). The strands are synthesized separately and then are annealed to each other in the tube. Then, the double- stranded siRNAs are separated from the single-stranded oligonucleotides that were not annealed (e.g. because of the excess of one of them) by HPLC. In relation to the siRNAs or \n\n siRNA fragments of the present invention, two or more such sequences can be synthesized and linked together for use in the present invention. \n\n\n The compounds of the invention can also be synthesized via tandem synthesis methodology, as described for example in US Patent Publication No. 2004/0019001 (McSwiggen), wherein both siRNA strands are synthesized as a single contiguous oligonucleotide fragment or strand separated by a cleavable linker which is subsequently cleaved to provide separate siRNA fragments or strands that hybridize and permit purification of the siRNA duplex. The linker is selected from a polynucleotide linker or a non-nucleotide linker. \n\n\n The term \"Covalent bonding\" as used herein refers to chemical bonding that is characterized by the sharing of pairs of electrons between atoms. \n\n\n The term \"Noncovalent bonding\" as used herein refers to a variety of interactions that are not covalent in nature between molecules or parts of molecules that provide force to hold the molecules or parts of molecules together, usually in a specific orientation or conformation. These noncovalent interactions include: ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds. Van der Waals forces and dipole-dipole bonds.siRNAs and RNA interference \n\n\n RNA interference (RNAi) is a phenomenon involving double-stranded (ds) RNA-dependent gene specific posttranscriptional silencing. Initial attempts to study this phenomenon and to manipulate mammalian cells experimentally were frustrated by an active, non-specific antiviral defense mechanism which was activated in response to long dsRNA molecules (Gil et al. Apoptosis, 2000. 5: 107-114). Later, it was discovered that synthetic duplexes of 21 nucleotide RNAs could mediate gene specific RNAi in mammalian cells, without stimulating the generic antiviral defense mechanisms (see Elbashir et al. Nature 2001, 41 1 :494-498 and Caplen et al. PNAS USA 2001 , 98:9742-9747). As a result, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have become powerful tools in attempting to understand gene function. \n\n\n RNA interference (RNAi) in mammals is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Fire et al, Nature 1998, 391 :806) or microRNAs (miRNAs) (Ambros, Nature 2004, 431(7006):350-355; Bartel, Cell 2004, 116(2): 281-97). The corresponding process in plants \n\n is commonly referred to as specific post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or R A silencing and is also referred to as quelling in fungi. \n\n\n An siRNA is a double-stranded RNA or modified RNA molecule which down-regulates or silences (prevents) the expression of a gene/ mRNA of its endogenous (cellular) counterpart. The selection and synthesis of siRNA corresponding to known genes has been widely reported; (see for example Ui-Tei et al., J Biomed Biotech. 2006; 2006: 65052; Chalk et al., BBRC. 2004, 319(1): 264-74; Sioud & Leirdal, Met. Mol Biol; 2004, 252:457-69; Levenkova et al, Bioinform. 2004, 20(3):430-2; Ui-Tei et al, NAR. 2004, 32(3):936-48).\n\n\nFor examples of the use of, and production of, modified siRNA see, for example, Braasch et al, Biochem. 2003, 42(26):7967-75; Chiu et al, RNA, 2003, 9(9): 1034-48; PCT publications WO 2004/015107 (atugen AG) and WO 02/44321 (Tuschl et al). US Patent Nos. 5,898,031 and 6,107,094, teach chemically modified oligomers. US Patent Publication Nos. 2005/0080246 and 2005/0042647 relate to oligomeric compounds having an alternating motif and dsRNA compounds having chemically modified internucleoside linkages, respectively. \n\n\n Other modifications have been disclosed. The inclusion of a 5'-phosphate moiety was shown to enhance activity of siRNAs in Drosophila embryos (Boutla, et al., Curr. Biol. 2001, 11 : 1776-1780) and is required for siRNA function in human HeLa cells (Schwarz et al., Mol. Cell, 2002, 10:537-48). Amarzguioui et al, (NAR, 2003, 31(2):589-95) showed that siRNA activity depended on the positioning of the 2'-0-methyl (2'OMe) modifications. Holen et al (NAR. 2003, 31(9):2401-07) report that an siRNA having small numbers of 2'OMe modified nucleosides gave good activity compared to wild type but that the activity decreased as the numbers of 2'OMe modified nucleosides was increased. Chiu and Rana (RNA. 2003, 9: 1034-48) teach that incorporation of 2'OMe modified nucleosides in the sense or antisense strand (fully modified strands) severely reduced siRNA activity relative to unmodified siRNA. The placement of a 2'OMe group at the 5'-terminus on the antisense strand was reported to severely limit activity whereas placement at the 3'-terminus of the \n\n antisense and at both termini of the sense strand was tolerated (Czauderna et al., NAR. 2003, 31(11):2705-16; WO 2004/015107). \n\n\n Several studies have revealed that siRNA therapeutics are effective in vivo in both mammals and in humans. Bitko et al., have shown that specific siRNA molecules directed against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nucleocapsid N gene are effective in treating mice when administered intranasally (Nat. Med. 2005, 1 l(l):50-55). Recent reviews discussing siRNA therapeutics are available (Barik, et al., J. Mol. Med 2005, 83:764-773; Dallas and Vlassov, Med. Sci. Monitor 2006, 12(4):RA67-74; Chakraborty, Current Drug Targets 2007, 8(3):469-82; Dykxhoorn et al, Gene Therapy 2006. 13:541-552). \n\n\nMucke (IDrugs 2007 10(1):37-41) presents a review of current therapeutics, including siRNA to various targets, for the treatment of ocular diseases, for example age related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma. \n\n\n A number of PCT applications have recently been published that relate to the RNAi phenomenon. These include: PCT publication WO 00/44895; PCT publication WO 00/49035; PCT publication WO 00/63364; PCT publication WO 01/36641 ; PCT publication WO 01/36646; PCT publication WO 99/32619; PCT publication WO 00/44914; PCT publication WO 01/29058; and PCT publication WO 01/75164. \n\n\n RNA interference (RNAi) is based on the ability of dsRNA species to enter a cytoplasmic protein complex, where it is then targeted to the complementary cellular RNA and specifically degrade it. The RNA interference response features an endonuclease complex containing an siRNA, commonly referred to as an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates cleavage of single-stranded RNA having a sequence complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex. Cleavage of the target RNA may take place in the middle of the region complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex (Elbashir et al., Genes Dev., 2001, 15(2): 188-200). In more detail, longer dsRNAs are digested into short (17-29 bp) dsRNA fragments (also referred to as short inhibitory RNAs, \"siRNAs\") by type III RNAses (DICER, DROSHA, etc.; Bernstein et al, Nature, 2001 , 409(6818):363-6; Lee et al., Nature, 2003, 425(6956):415-9). The RISC protein complex recognizes these fragments \n\n and complementary mRNA. The whole process is culminated by endonuclease cleavage of target mRNA (McManus & Sharp, Nature Rev Genet, 2002, 3(10):737-47; Paddison & Hannon, Curr Opin Mol Ther. 2003, 5(3):217-24). (For additional information on these terms and proposed mechanisms, see for example Bernstein et al., RNA 2001, 7(11): 1509- 21 ; Nishikura, Cell 2001 , 107(4):415-8 and PCT publication WO 01/36646). \n\n\n\n\nsiRNA Structures \n\n\n The selection and synthesis of siRNA corresponding to known genes has been widely reported; (see for example Ui-Tei et al., J Biomed Biotech. 2006; 2006: 65052; Chalk et al., BBRC. 2004, 319(1): 264-74; Sioud & Leirdal, Met. Mol Biol; 2004, 252:457-69; Levenkova et al, Bioinform. 2004, 20(3):430-2; Ui-Tei et al, NAR. 2004, 32(3):936-48).\n\n\nFor examples of the use of, and production of, modified siRNA see, for example, Braasch et al, Biochem. 2003, 42(26):7967-75; Chiu et al, RNA, 2003, 9(9): 1034-48; PCT publications WO 2004/015107 (atugen AG) and WO 02/44321 (Tuschl et al). US Patent Nos. 5,898,031 and 6,107,094, teach chemically modified oligomers. US Patent Publication Nos. 2005/0080246 and 2005/0042647 relate to oligomeric compounds having an alternating motif and dsRNA compounds having chemically modified internucleoside linkages, respectively. \n\n\n Other modifications have been disclosed. The inclusion of a 5'-phosphate moiety was shown to enhance activity of siRNAs in Drosophila embryos (Boutla, et al., Curr. Biol. 2001, 11 : 1776-1780) and is required for siRNA function in human HeLa cells (Schwarz et al., Mol. Cell, 2002, 10:537-48). Amarzguioui et al, (NAR, 2003, 31(2):589-95) showed that siRNA activity depended on the positioning of the 2'-0-methyl (2'OMe) modifications. Holen et al (NAR. 2003, 31(9):2401-07) report that an siRNA having small numbers of 2'OMe modified nucleosides gave good activity compared to wild type but that the activity decreased as the numbers of 2'OMe modified nucleosides was increased. Chiu and Rana (RNA. 2003, 9: 1034-48) teach that incorporation of 2'OMe modified nucleosides in the sense or antisense strand (fully modified strands) severely reduced siRNA activity relative to unmodified siRNA. The placement of a 2'OMe group at the 5'-terminus on the antisense strand was reported to severely limit activity whereas placement at the 3'-terminus of the antisense and at both termini of the sense strand was tolerated (Czauderna et al., NAR. 2003, 31(11):2705-16; WO 2004/015107). \n\n The siRNAs according to the present invention all possess one 3' overhang on either the sense or antisense strand and optionally two 3' overhangs, one on each of the sense and antisense strands. \n\n\n The molecules of the present invention offer an advantage in that they are non-toxic and are useful in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for treatment of various diseases.\n\n\nPCT Patent Application No. PCT/IL2007/001278 (PCT Publication No. WO 2008/050329) and US Serial No. 11/978,089 to the assignee of the present invention relate to inhibitors of pro-apoptotic genes, and are incorporated by reference in their entirety. \n\n\n The present invention relates generally to compounds which down-regulate expression of various genes, particularly to novel small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and to the use of these novel siRNAs in the treatment of a subject suffering from various medical conditions. \n\n\n Molecules and compositions are discussed herein at length, and any of said molecules and/or compositions may be beneficially employed in the treatment of a subject suffering from any of said conditions. \n\n\nThe siRNA compounds of the present invention possess structures and modifications which may for example increase activity, increase stability, and or minimize toxicity; the novel modifications of the siRNAs of the present invention are beneficially applied to double stranded RNA useful in preventing or attenuating target gene expression, in particular the target genes discussed herein. \n\n\nAccording to one aspect the present invention provides inhibitory oligonucleotide compounds comprising unmodified and/or modified nucleotides. The compound comprises at least one 3' overhang comprising at least one non-nucleotide moiety. The compounds of the present invention may additionally comprise a modified ribonucleotide, wherein at least one of N or N' is selected from the group consisting of a sugar modification, a base modification and an internucleotide linkage modification. In some embodiments the compounds of the present invention include at least one modified nucleotide including DNA, LNA (locked nucleic acid) including ENA (ethylene -bridged nucleic acid; PNA (peptide \n\n nucleic acid); arabinoside; PACE (phosphonoacetate and derivatives thereof), mirror nucleotide, or nucleotides with a 6 member sugar analog (eg. hexose or morpholino). \n\n\n In one embodiment the compound comprises at least one modified ribonucleotide having a 2' modification on the sugar moiety (\"2' sugar modification\"). In certain embodiments the compound comprises 2'0-alkyl or 2'-fluoro or 2'0-allyl or any other 2' sugar modification, optionally on alternate positions. One possible 2' modification is 2' O-methyl (2' methoxy, 2'OMe). \n\n\n Other stabilizing modifications are also possible (eg. modified nucleotides added to a 3' or 5' terminus of an oligomer). In some embodiments the backbone of the oligonucleotides is modified and comprises phosphate-D-ribose entities but may also contain thiophosphate-D- ribose entities, phosphodiester L-ribose entities, triester, thioate, 2'-5' bridged backbone (also may be referred to as 5 '-2'), PACE modified internucleotide linkage or any other type of modification. \n\n\n The invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation. \n\n\n Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is, therefore, to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention can be practiced otherwise than as specifically described. The present invention is illustrated in detail below with reference to examples, but is not to be construed as being limited thereto. \n\n\n Citation of any document herein is not intended as an admission that such document is pertinent prior art, or considered material to the patentability of any claim of the present application.

The following specific embodiments are, therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limitative of the claimed invention in any way. \n\n\n Standard molecular biology protocols known in the art not specifically described herein are generally followed essentially as in Sambrook et al., Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, New- York (1989, 1992), and in Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Baltimore, Maryland (1988), and as in Ausubel et al, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Baltimore, Maryland (1989) and as in Perbal, A Practical Guide to Molecular Cloning, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1988), and as in Watson et al., Recombinant DNA, Scientific American Books, New York and in Birren et al (eds) Genome Analysis: A Laboratory Manual Series, Vols. 1-4 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York (1998) and methodology as set forth in US Patent Nos. 4,666,828; 4,683,202; 4,801,531 ; 5,192,659 and 5,272,057 and incorporated herein by reference. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out generally as in PCR Protocols: A Guide To Methods And Applications, Academic Press, San Diego, CA (1990). In situ (In cell) PCR in combination with Flow Cytometry is useful for detection of cells containing specific DNA and mRNA sequences (Testoni et al., Blood 1996, 87:3822.) Methods of performing RT-PCR are also well known in the art. \n\n\n SEQUENCE LISTING \n\n\n The sequence listing for this application created Sep. 16, 2009, has been filed electronically via EFS-Web on 16-Sept-2010 and is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\nExample 1 : Generation of nucleic acid molecules and In vitro testing of modified siRNA compounds \n\n\n Using proprietary algorithms and the known sequence of of a target nucleotide, for eample the mRNA of a target gene, the sense and antisense sequences of many potential siRNA \n\n nucleic acid molecules are generated. Nucleic acid molecules are depicted in 5' to 3' orientation, and the sense and complementary antisense sequences are depicted on the same line in the tables, unless otherwise noted. \n\n\n Table A provides exemplary, non-limiting, nucleic acid sequences useful in generating nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein. \n\n\n Table A: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Activity: \n\n\n The modified siRNA compounds according to the present invention were tested for activity as follows: About 1.5-2x10\n5\n tested cells (HeLa cells and/or 293T cells for siRNA targeting human genes and NRK52 (normal rat kidney proximal tubule cells) cells and/or NMuMG \n\n cells (mouse mammary epithelial cell line) for siRNA targeting the rat/mouse gene) were seeded per well in 6 wells plate (70-80% confluent). \n\n\n About 24 hours later, cells weretransfected with modified siRNA compounds using the Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) at final concentrations of from 0.001 nM to about 50 nM. The cells are incubated at 37°C in a C0\n2\n incubator for 72h. \n\n\n As positive control for transfection PTEN-Cy3 labeled modified siRNA compounds are used. GFP siRNA compounds are used as negative control for siRNA activity. \n\n\n At 72h after transfection cells are harvested and RNA was extracted from cells. Transfection efficiency is tested by fluorescent microscopy. \n\n\nThe percent of inhibition of gene expression using specific preferred siRNA structures is determined using qPCR analysis of a target gene in cells expressing the endogenous gene.\n\n\nThe IC50 value of the tested RNAi activity is determined by constructing a dose-response curve using the activity results obtained with the various final siRNA concentrations. The dose response curve is constructed by plotting the relative amount of residual SERPINH1 mRNA versus the logarithm of transfected siRNA concentration. The curve is calculated by fitting the best sigmoid curve to the measured data. The method for the sigmoid fit is also known as a 3 -point curve fit. \n\n\n100 - Bot \n\n\n Y = Bot + \\ _\n|\n_ Q(LogIC50-X)xHMSlope where Y is the residual target mRNA response, X is the logarithm of transfected siRNA concentration, Bot is the Y value at the bottom plateau, LogIC50 is the X value when Y is halfway between bottom and top plateaus and HillSlope is the steepness of the curve. \n\n Serum Stability Experiments \n\n\n The modified siRNA compounds according to the present invention are tested for duplex stability in human serum or human tissue extract, as follows: \n\n\nsiRNA molecules at final concentration of 7uM are incubated at 37°C in 100% human serum (Sigma Cat# H4522). (siRNA stock lOOuM diluted in human serum 1 : 14.29 or human tissue extract from various tissue types.). Five ul (5ul) are added to 15ul 1.5xTBE-loading buffer at different time points (for example 0, 30min, lh, 3h, 6h, 8h, lOh, 16h and 24h). Samples are immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and are kept at -20°C. \n\n\n Each sample is loaded onto a non- denaturing 20% acrylamide gel, prepared according to methods known in the art. The oligos are visualized with ethidium bromide under UV light.\n\n\nIn general, the siRNAs having specific sequences that are selected for in vitro testing are specific for human and a second species such as rat or rabbit genes. \n\n\n Stability to exonucleases \n\n\n To study the stabilization effect of 3' non-nucleotide moieties on a nucleic acid molecule the sense strand, the antisense strand and the annealed siRNA duplex are incubated in cytosolic extracts prepared from different cell types. \n\n\n Extract: HCT116 cytosolic extract (12mg/ml). \n\n\n Extract buffer: 25mM Hepes pH-7.3 at 37oC; 8mM MgCl; 150mM NaCl with ImM DTT was added fresh immediately before use. \n\n\nMethod: 3.5ml of test siRNA (lOOmM), were mixed with 46.5ml contain 120mg of HCT1 16 cytosolic extract. The 46.5ml consists of 12ml of HCT116 extract, and 34.5ml of the extract buffer supplemented with DTT and protease inhibitors cocktail/100 (Calbiochem, setIII-539134). The final concentration of the siRNA in the incubation tube is 7mM. The sample was incubated at 37oC, and at the indicated time point 5ml were moved to fresh tube, mixed with 15ml of lXTBE-50% Glycerol loading buffer, and snap frozen in Liquid N2. The final concentration of the siRNA in the loading buffer is 1.75mM (21ng siRNA/ml). For \n\n Analyses by native PAGE and EtBr staining 50ng are loaded per lane. For Northern analyses lng of tested siRNA was loaded per lane. \n\n\n The applicants have shown that nucleic acid molecules which include the 3' terminal alkyu; or alkyl derivative overhang exhibit enhanced stability compared to a blunt ended nucleic acid molecules and nucleic acid molecules comprising 3' nucleotide overhangs. \n\n\n Exemplary Compounds \n\n\nsiRNA compounds comprising non-nucleotide moieties covalently attached to the 3' terminus were synthesized and tested as described above. Figure 2 provides a table of compounds useful in RNAi comprising sequences and modifications disclosed herein. Legend for the modifications follows: a prefix \"z\" indicates a moiety (nucleotide or non- nucleotide) covalently attached to the 3' or 5' terminal nucleotide.

Storage Conditions: -80°C. \n\n\n Animals: Age: 6-8 week old male rats. 180-220gr \n\n\n Group Size: n= 4/10; Total number of animals: 112 \n\n\n Animal Husbandry: Diet: Animals were provided an ad libitum commercial rodent diet (Harlan Teklad diet for rodents), and free access to drinking water. \n\n\n Environment: (i) Acclimatization of at least 5 days. \n\n (ii) All the animals were confined in a limited access facility with environmentally controlled housing conditions throughout the entire study period, and maintained in accordance with HBI approved standard operating procedures (SOPs). Automatically controlled environmental conditions are set to maintaintemperature at 20 - 24° C with a relative humidity (RH) of 30-70%, a 12-hrlight/12-hr dark cycle and 15-30 air changes/hr in the study room. Temperature, RH and the light cycle weree monitored by the control computer. \n\n\n EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN \n\n\n \n\n Study design: All animals from experimental groups I - XII were injected IVT unilaterally into the Left Eye (LE)) at dose of 20μg of test article or control (CNL) in ΙΟμΙ PBS vehicle or ΙΟμΙ vehicle only. Experimental group XIII will be used as intact control. The termination step will be accomplished according to the study design (1 day, 3 days and 7 days after IVT treatment). \n\n\nAnesthesia: Animals were anesthetized with an Isoflurane special circuit system (Stoelting, USA). Pupils will be dilated with Mydramid (0.5% tropicamide) eye drops. For additional topical anesthesia, will be used Localin (OXYBUPROCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE 0.4%). \n\n The Lacromycin (Gentamycin Sulfate (Equivalent to 0.3% Gentamycin base) ophthalmic solution to prevent/decrease post surgery inflammatory process. \n\n\n Intravitreal injection was performed under a dissecting microscope. A 30/33-gauge needle was used to make a punch incision 1 mm posterior to the temporal limbus, and a syringe needle (30/33-gauge Insulin syringe 0.3ml,PIC 0.8mm, Italy) was inserted through the incision, 1.5 mm deep, as observed through the dilated pupil. \n\n\n Scheduled euthanasia All animals were deeply anesthetized (Equithesine 4ml/kg LP) and euthanized (decapitated) according to the study design (Table, Termination). \n\n\n Tissue Collection: Both eyes from all animals were enucleated and stored on ice. The eyes will be dissected using a microscope, and gross pathologies will be graded according to sample grading scale (see appendix 5 for \"Eye Pathology Score\"). The cornea will be punctured using a 27/30G needle, to remove aqueous humor from the anterior chamber. Using a microsurgical blade, a cut will be made along the limbus, and the cornea and the lens removed. The remaining eyecup will be opened by a sagittal cut through the sclera. The retina will be extracted from the eyecup, rinsed in PBS and separated. Using fine-tip forceps the retina will be collected into the appropriate test tube, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transferred to the Molecular Biology Unit for extraction of total RNA. \n\n\n EVALUATION \n\n\n Knockdown activity of the siRNA targeting CASP2 in the rat retina was determined by CASP2 mRNA expression level quantification using the qPCR method. CASP2 4 siRNA cleavage site on the target gene will be verified by RACE and siRNA quantitation in the retina was performed by S&L qPCR (stem and loop qPCR). \n\n\n Samples RNA Isolation: RNA were processed from retina samples according to standard procedures for total RNA isolation wiith EZRNA, by double extraction. \n\n\nCASP2 4 siRNA quantification by qPCR: The delivery of the CASP2 4 siRNA in the retina was measured by qPCR siRNA quantification. qPCR was performed according to standard methods using SYBR Green method on Applied Biosystem 7300 PCR System. \n\n CASP2_4 siR A directed cleavage of CASP2 mR A in rat retina was determined by the detection of the cleavage product using the RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) method in the respective experimental groups. If evidence of the expected cleavage product is shown, the siRNA cleavage site on the target gene will be verified by sequence analysis and optionally the cleavage product will be quantified using qPCR. \n\n\n CASP2 mRNA quantification by qPCR: after cDNA is prepared CASP2 knock down will be verified by CASP2 mRNA quantification by qPCR. qPCR will be performed according to standard methods standard methods using SYBR Green method on Applied Biosystem 7300 PCR System. \n\n\nPRELIMINARY RESULTS \n\n\n Preliminary results indicate that the Q- 1007 is taken up more efficiently into the retinal cells that Q- 1203. \n\n\n Example 3: Model systems of acute renal failure (ARF) \n\n\n ARF is a clinical syndrome characterized by rapid deterioration of renal function that occurs within days. Without being bound by theory the acute kidney injury may be the result of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury such as renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in patients undergoing major surgery such as major cardiac surgery. The principal feature of ARF is an abrupt decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), resulting in the retention of nitrogenous wastes (urea, creatinine). Recent studies, support that apoptosis in renal tissues is prominent in most human cases of ARF. The principal site of apoptotic cell death is the distal nephron. During the initial phase of ischemic injury, loss of integrity of the actin cytoskeleton leads to flattening of the epithelium, with loss of the brush border, loss of focal cell contacts, and subsequent disengagement of the cell from the underlying substratum. \n\n\n Testing an active siRNA compound was performed using an animal model for ischemia- reperfusion- induced ARF, as indicated in PCT patent application publication No. WO/2009/044392. \n\n An existing siR A can be advantageously modified and future siR A can be designed and produced to provide active nucleic acid molecules. In some embodiments siRNA compounds which utilize the oligonucleotide pairs set forth in Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) of PCT Patent Publication No. WO/2009/044392, in particular siRNAs directed to specific proapoptotic genes, in particular to genes TP53BP2, LRDD, CYBA, ATF3, CASP2, HRK, CIQBP, BNIP3, MAPK8, MAPK14, RAC1, GSK3B, P2RX7, TRPM2, PARG, CD38, STEAP4, BMP2, CX43, TYROBP, CTGF, and SPP1) and further include and least one 3 ' overhang according to the present invention are tested in the above model system and found to be protective against ischemia reperfusion. \n\n\nExample 4: Model systems of pressure sores or pressure ulcers \n\n\n Pressure sores or pressure ulcers including diabetic ulcers, are areas of damaged skin and tissue that develop when sustained pressure (usually from a bed or wheelchair) cuts off circulation to vulnerable parts of the body, especially the skin on the buttocks, hips and heels. The lack of adequate blood flow leads to ischemic necrosis and ulceration of the affected tissue. Pressure sores occur most often in patients with diminished or absent sensation or who are debilitated, emaciated, paralyzed, or long bedridden. Tissues over the sacrum, ischia, greater trochanters, external malleoli, and heels are especially susceptible; other sites may be involved depending on the patient's situation. \n\n\n Testing the active inhibitors of the invention (such as siRNA compounds) for treating pressure sore, ulcers and similar wounds is performed in the mouse model as described in Reid et al, J Surg.

An existing siRNA can be advantageously modified and future siRNA can be designed and produced to provide active nucleic acid molecules. In some embodiments siRNA compounds which utilize the oligonucleotide pairs set forth in Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) of PCT patent application publication No. WO/2009/044392, and specifically compounds directed to genes \n\n CIQBP, RAC1, GSK3B, P2RX7, TRPM2, PARG, CD38, STEAP4, BMP2, CX43, or TYROBP and further include and least one 3' non— nucleotide overhang according to the present invention are tested in animal models where it is shown that these siRNA compounds treat and prevent pressure sores and ulcers. \n\n\nExample 5: Model systems of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \n\n\n Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized mainly by emphysema, which is permanent destruction of peripheral air spaces, distal to terminal bronchioles. Emphysema is also characterized by accumulation of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils in bronchioles and alveolar structures. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis may occur as part of COPD or independently. \n\n\n Testing the active inhibitors of the invention (such as siRNA) for treating COPD/ emphysema/chronic bronchitis is performed in animal models such as those disclosed as follows: \n\n\n Starcher and Williams, 1989. Lab. Animals, 23:234-240; Peng, et al, 2004.; Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 169: 1245-1251; Jeyaseelan et al, 2004. Infect. Immunol, 72: 7247-56. Additional models are described in PCT patent publication WO 2006/023544 assigned to the assignee of the present application, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application. \n\n\n An existing siRNA can be advantageously modified and future siRNA can be designed and produced to provide active nucleic acid molecules.

The two common types of spinal cord injury are due to trauma and disease. Traumatic injury can be due to automobile accidents, falls, gunshot, diving accidents inter alia, and diseases which can affect the spinal cord include polio, spina bifida, tumors and Friedreich's ataxia. \n\n\n An existing siRNA can be advantageously modified and future siRNA can be designed and produced to provide active nucleic acid molecules. In some embodiments siRNA compounds which utilize the oligonucleotide pairs set forth in 7 Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) of PCT patent application publication No. WO/2009/044392, and in particular siRNA directed to genes LRDD, CYBA, ATF3, CASP2, HRK, CIQBP, BNIP3, MAPK8, MAPK14, RAC1, GSK3B, P2RX7, TRPM2, PARG, CD38, STEAP4, BMP2, CX43, TYROBP, CTGF, and RHOA and further include and least one 3' overhang according to the present invention are tested in this animal model, which show that these siRNA compounds promote functional recovery following spinal cord injury and thus may be used to treat spinal cord injury. \n\n\n Example 7: Model systems of Glaucoma \n\n\n Testing the active inhibitors of the invention (such as siRNA) for treating or preventing glaucoma is done in the animal model for example as described by Pease et al., J. Glaucoma, 2006, 15(6):512-9 (Manometric calibration and comparison of TonoLab and TonoPen tonometers in rats with experimental glaucoma and in normal mice). \n\n\nAn existing siRNA can be advantageously modified and future siRNA can be designed and produced to provide active nucleic acid molecules.

Seven days prior to the optic nerve crush, the retinal ganglion cells (RGC) are selectively labelled by application of the retrograde tracer FluoroGold (2%, Fluorochrome, Englewood, CO) to the superior colliculus. The tracer is transported by retrograde transport along RGC axons resulting in complete and specific labelling of all RGCs within 1 week post injection of the fluorescent tracer. The animals are subjected to the optic nerve crush injury 7 days post retrograde tracing. The orbital optic nerve is exposed through a supraorbital approach and all axons in the optic nerve are transected by crushing with forceps for 10 seconds, 2 mm from the lamina cribrosa. A single dose of 20μg/ 5μ1 of PBS of an siRNA compound according to the invention is microinjected into the vitreous body 2 mm anterior to the nerve head, using a glass micropipette at the time of the optic nerve crush The survival of RGCs is determined 7 days following the optic nerve crush by counting FluoroGold-labelled RGCs on flat-mounted retinas. The experimental animals are perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde at 1 week after the optic nerve crash. Both retinas are dissected out, fixed for an additional 30 min and flat-mounted on a glass slide for ganglion cell layer quantification. The number of fluorescent RGCs is counted in 16 distinct areas in each retina and the percent of survival of the RGCs is determined compared to samples obtained from rats which did not undergo optic nerve crush injury at all or samples obtained from rats which were injected with PBS, control siRNA or GFP siRNA along with the optic nerve crush injury. Microglia cells that may have incorporated FluoroGold after phagocytosis of dying RGCs were distinguished by their characteristic morphology and excluded from quantitative analyses. \n\n\n Another model of optic nerve axotomy where the entire population of RGCs are axotomized by transecting the optic nerve close to the eye is useful for testing the compounds and compositions of the present invention.

May 15, 2002 2002;22:3977-3986). \n\n Example 8: Model systems of ischemia/reperfusion injury following lung transplantation in rats \n\n\n Testing the active inhibitors of the invention (such as siRNA) for treating or preventing ischemia/reperfusion injury or hypoxic injury following lung transplantation is done in one or more of the experimental animal models, for example as described by Mizobuchi et al., 2004. J. Heart Lung Transplant, 23:889-93; Huang, et al., 1995. J. Heart Lung Transplant. 14: S49; Matsumura, et al, 1995. Transplantation 59: 1509-1517; Wilkes, et al, 1999. Transplantation 67:890-896; Naka, et al, 1996. Circulation Research, 79: 773-783. \n\n\n An existing siRNA can be advantageously modified and future siRNA can be designed and produced to provide active nucleic acid molecules. In some embodiments siRNA compounds which utilize the oligonucleotide pairs set forth in Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) of PCT patent application publication No. WO/2009/044392, and in particular to TP53BP2, LRDD, CYBA, CASP2, BNIP3, RAC1 , and DUOX1 and further include and least one 3' non-nucleotide overhang according to the present invention are tested in these animal models, which show that these siRNA compounds treat and/or prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury following lung transplantation and thus may be used in conjunction with transplant surgery. \n\n\n Example 9: Model systems of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome \n\n\n Testing the active inhibitors of the invention (such as siRNA) for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome is done in the animal model as described by Chen et al (J Biomed Sci. 2003;10(6 Pt l):588-92. siRNA compounds according to Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (Cl- C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) of PCT patent application publication No. WO/2009/044392, in particular to genes CYBA, HRK, BNIP3, MAPK8, MAPK14, RAC1, GSK3B, P2RX7, TRPM2, PARG, SPP1, and DUOX1 and further include and least one 3' overhang according to the present invention are tested in this animal model which shows that these siRNAs treat and/or prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome and thus may be used to treat this condition. \n\n Example 10: Model systems of hearing loss conditions \n\n\n (i) Chinchilla model of carboplatin-induced or cisplatin-induced cochlea hair cell death\n\n\nChinchillas are pre-treated by direct administration of specific siRNA in saline to the left ear of each animal. Saline is given to the right ear of each animal as placebo. Two days following the administration of the specific siRNA compounds of the invention, the animals are treated with carboplatin (75 mg/kg ip) or cisplatin (intraperitoneal infusion of 13mg/kg over 30 minutes). After sacrifice of the chinchillas (two weeks post carboplatin treatment) the % of dead cells of inner hair cells (IHC) and outer hair cells (OHC) is calculated in the left ear (siRNA treated) and in the right ear (saline treated). It is calculated that the % of dead cells of inner hair cells (IHC) and outer hair cells (OHC) is lower in the left ear (siRNA treated) than in the right ear (saline treated). \n\n\n (ii) Chinchilla model of acoustic-induced cochlea hair cell death \n\n\n The activity of specific siRNA in an acoustic trauma model is studied in chinchilla. The animals are exposed to an octave band of noise centered at 4 kHz for 2.5h at 105 dB. The left ear of the noise-exposed chinchillas is pre-treated (48 h before the acoustic trauma) with 30 μg of siRNA in ~10 μL of saline; the right ear is pre-treated with vehicle (saline). The compound action potential (CAP) is a convenient and reliable electrophysiological method for measuring the neural activity transmitted from the cochlea. The CAP is recorded by placing an electrode near the base of the cochlea in order to detect the local field potential that is generated when a sound stimulus, such as click or tone burst, is abruptly turned on. The functional status of each ear is assessed 2.5 weeks after the acoustic trauma. Specifically, the mean threshold of the compound action potential recorded from the round window is determined 2.5 weeks after the acoustic trauma in order to determine if the thresholds in the siRNA-treated ear are lower (better) than the untreated (saline) ear. In addition, the level of inner and outer hair cell loss is determined in the siRNA-treated and the control ear. \n\n\n An existing siRNA can be advantageously modified and future siRNA can be designed and produced to provide active nucleic acid molecules. In some embodiments siRNA compounds \n\n which utilize the oligonucleotide pairs set forth in Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) of PCT patent application publication No. WO/2009/044392, in particular to genes TP53BP2, LRDD, CYBA, ATF3, CASP2, NOX3, HRK, CIQBP, BNIP3, MAPK8, MAPK14, RAC1, GSK3B, P2RX7, TRPM2, PARG, CD38, STEAP4, BMP2, CX43, TYROBP, and CTGF and further include and least one 3' overhang according to the present invention are tested in this animal model which shows that the thresholds in the siRNA-treated ear are lower (better) than in the untreated (saline) ear. In addition, the amount of inner and outer hair cell loss is lower in the siRNA-treated ear than in the control ear. \n\n\nExample 11. Animal models of Osteoarthritis (OA) \n\n\n Collagen induced arthritis (CIA): CIA in mice is described in Trentham et al. (1977. J. Exp. Med. 146: 857-868). Adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA):AA is described in Kong et al, (1999. Nature, 402:304-308). A menisectomy model is described in Han et al., (1999. Nagoya J Med Sci 62(3-4): 115-26). \n\n\nThe effect of different siRNA inhibitors, such as siRNA to SSP1 , on different parameters related to OA such as chondrocyte proliferation, terminal differentiation and development of arthritis, is evaluated using one or more of the above models, in addition to in vitro models known in the art. siRNA compounds directed to specific proapoptotic genes, in particular to SSP1, and further include and least one 3' overhang according to the present invention are tested in these animal models which show that these siRNAs treat and/or prevent OA and thus may be used to treat this condition. \n\n\n Example 12: Rat model systems for transplantation-associated acute kidney injury \n\n\n Warm ischemia - In test rats a left nephrectomy is performed, followed by auto transplantation that results in a warm kidney graft preservation period of 45 minutes. Following auto transplantation, a right nephrectomy is performed on the same animal. Chemically modified siRNA to a target is administered intravenously via the femoral vein either before harvesting of the kidney graft (mimicking donor treatment) (\"pre\"), or after the \n\n kidney autotransplantation (mimicking recipient treatment), or both before harvest and after transplantation (combined donor and recipient treatment) (\"pre -post\"). \n\n\n Cold ischemia - A left nephrectomy is performed on a donor animal, followed by a cold preservation (on ice) of the harvested kidney for a period of 5 hours. At the end of this period, the recipient rat will undergo a bilateral nephrectomy, followed by transplantation of the cold-preserved kidney graft. The total warm ischemia time (including surgical procedure) is about 30 minutes. Chemically modified siRNA is administered intravenously via the femoral vein, either to the donor animal prior to the kidney harvest (\"pre\"), or to the recipient animal 15 minutes (\"post 15 min\") or 4 hours (post 4 hrs) post-transplantation. To assess the efficacy of siRNA in improvement of post- transplantation renal function, serum creatinine levels are measured on days 1, 2, and 7 post-transplantation in both warm and cold ischemia models."
