Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe instant invention is concerned with substituted beta-carboline derivatives, which are selective antagonists of the somatostatin subtype receptor 3 (SSTR3) which are useful for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and of conditions that are often associated with this disease, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, obesity, lipid disorders, and hypertension. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of depression and anxiety.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nDiabetes is a disease derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose (hyperglycemia) in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. In Type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), insulin is still produced by islet cells in the pancreas. Patients having Type 2 diabetes have a resistance to the effects of insulin in stimulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, including muscle, liver and adipose tissues. These patients often have normal levels of insulin, and may have hyperinsulinemia (elevated plasma insulin levels), as they compensate for the reduced effectiveness of insulin by secreting increased amounts of insulin (Polonsky, \nInt. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord \n24 \nSuppl \n2:S29-31, 2000). The beta cells within the pancreatic islets initially compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin output. Insulin resistance is not primarily caused by a diminished number of insulin receptors but rather by a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not yet completely understood. This lack of responsiveness to insulin results in insufficient insulin-mediated activation of uptake, oxidation and storage of glucose in muscle, and inadequate insulin-mediated repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver. Eventually, a patient may be become diabetic due to the inability to properly compensate for insulin resistance. In humans, the onset of Type 2 diabetes due to insufficient increases (or actual declines) in beta cell mass is apparently due to increased beta cell apoptosis relative to non-diabetic insulin resistant individuals (Butler et al., \nDiabetes \n52:102-110, 2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPersistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia that occurs with diabetes is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with obesity, hypertension, and alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism, as well as other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus have a significantly increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, effective therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, obesity, and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus. Patients who have insulin resistance often exhibit several symptoms that together are referred to as syndrome X or Metabolic Syndrome. According to one widely used definition, a patient having Metabolic Syndrome is characterized as having three or more symptoms selected from the following group of five symptoms: (1) abdominal obesity, (2) hypertriglyceridemia, (3) low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), (4) high blood pressure, and (5) elevated fasting glucose, which may be in the range characteristic of Type 2 diabetes if the patient is also diabetic. Each of these symptoms is defined clinically in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III, or ATP III), National Institutes of Health, 2001, NIH Publication No. 01-3670. Patients with Metabolic Syndrome, whether they have or develop overt diabetes mellitus, have an increased risk of developing the macrovascular and microvascular complications that occur with Type 2 diabetes, such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are several available treatments for Type 2 diabetes, each of which has its own limitations and potential risks. Physical exercise and a reduction in dietary intake of calories often dramatically improves the diabetic condition and are the usual recommended first-line treatment of Type 2 diabetes and of pre-diabetic conditions associated with insulin resistance. Compliance with this treatment is generally very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of fat and carbohydrates. Pharmacologic treatments have largely focused on three areas of pathophysiology: (1) hepatic glucose production (biguanides), (2) insulin resistance (PPAR agonists), (3) insulin secretion (sulfonylureas); (4) incretin hormone mimetics (GLP-1 derivatives and analogs, such as exenatide and luraglitide); and (5) inhibitors of incretin hormone degradation (DPP-4 inhibitors).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biguanides belong to a class of drugs that are widely used to treat Type 2 diabetes. Phenformin and metformin are the two best known biguanides and do cause some correction of hyperglycemia. The biguanides act primarily by inhibiting hepatic glucose production, and they also are believed to modestly improve insulin sensitivity. The biguanides can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic drugs, such as insulin or insulin secretagogues, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. However, phenformin and metformin can induce lactic acidosis, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. Metformin has a lower risk of side effects than phenformin and is widely prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glitazones (e.g., 5-benzylthiazolidine-2,4-diones) are a class of compounds that can ameliorate hyperglycemia and other symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. The glitazones that are currently marketed (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma subtype. The PPAR-gamma agonists substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of Type 2 diabetes, resulting in partial or complete correction of elevated plasma glucose levels without the occurrence of hypoglycemia. PPAR-gamma agonism is believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensititization that is observed in human patients who are treated with the glitazones. New PPAR agonists are currently being developed. Many of the newer PPAR compounds are agonists of one or more of the PPAR alpha, gamma and delta subtypes. The currently marketed PPAR gamma agonists are modestly effective in reducing plasma glucose and hemoglobinA1C. The currently marketed compounds do not greatly improve lipid metabolism and may actually have a negative effect on the lipid profile. Thus, the PPAR compounds represent an important advance in diabetic therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother widely used drug treatment involves the administration of insulin secretagogues, such as the sulfonylureas (e.g., tolbutamide, glipizide, and glimepiride). These drugs increase the plasma level of insulin by stimulating the pancreatic O-cells to secrete more insulin. Insulin secretion in the pancreatic β-cell is under strict regulation by glucose and an array of metabolic, neural and hormonal signals. Glucose stimulates insulin production and secretion through its metabolism to generate ATP and other signaling molecules, whereas other extracellular signals act as potentiators or inhibitors of insulin secretion through GPCR's present on the plasma membrane. Sulfonylureas and related insulin secretagogues act by blocking the ATP-dependent K+ channel in O-cells, which causes depolarization of the cell and the opening of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels with stimulation of insulin release. This mechanism is non-glucose dependent, and hence insulin secretion can occur regardless of the ambient glucose levels. This can cause insulin secretion even if the glucose level is low, resulting in hypoglycemia, which can be fatal in severe cases. The administration of insulin secretagogues must therefore be carefully controlled. The insulin secretagogues are often used as a first-line drug treatment for Type 2 diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, and alogliptin) provide a new route to increase insulin secretion in response to food consumption. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels increase in response to the increases in glucose present after eating and glucagon stimulates the production of insulin. The serine proteinase enzyme DPP-4 which is present on many cell surfaces degrades GLP-1. DPP-4 inhibitors reduce degradation of GLP-1, thus potentiating its action and allowing for greater insulin production in response to increases in glucose through eating.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere has been a renewed focus on pancreatic islet-based insulin secretion that is controlled by glucose-dependent insulin secretion. This approach has the potential for stabilization and restoration of β-cell function. In this regard, the present application claims compounds that are antagonists of the somatostatin subtype receptor 3 (SSTR3) as a means to increase insulin secretion in response to rises in glucose resulting from eating a meal.

Binding affinities for the SSTR3 receptor expressed as K\ni \nvalues are given below each structure.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe SSTR3 as identified herein is a target for affecting insulin secretion and assessing beta-cell mass. Glucose stimulated insulin secretion was found to be stimulated by abrogating the expression of SSTR3 and through the use of an SSTR3 selective antagonist. An important physiological action of insulin is to decrease blood glucose levels. As disclosed in the present application, targeting the SSTR3 has different uses including therapeutic applications, diagnostic applications, and evaluation of potential therapeutics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSomatostatin is a hormone that exerts a wide spectrum of biological effects mediated by a family of seven transmembrane (TM) domain O-protein-coupled receptors. (Lahlou et al., \nAnn. N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n1014:121-131, 2004, Reisine et al., \nEndocrine Review \n16 :427-442, 1995.) The predominant active forms of somatostatin are somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28. Somatostatin-14 is a cyclic tetradecapeptide. Somatostatin-28 is an extended form of somatostatin-14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSomatostatin subtype receptor 3 (SSTR3) is the third of five related G-protein receptor subtypes responding to somatostatin. The other receptors are the somatostatin subtype receptor 1 (SSTR1), somatostatin subtype receptor 2 (SSTR2), somatostatin subtype receptor 4 (SSTR4) and somatostatin subtype receptor 5 (SSTR5). The five distinct subtypes are encoded by separate genes segregated on different chromosomes. (Patel et al., \nNeuroendocrinol. \n20:157-198, 1999). All five receptor subtypes bind somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28, with low nanomolar affinity. The ligand binding domain for somatostatin is made up of residues in TMs III-VII with a potential contribution by the second extracellular loop. Somatostatin receptors are widely expressed in many tissues, frequently as multiple subtypes that coexist in the same cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe five different somatostatin receptors all functionally couple to inhibition of adenylate cyclase by a pertussin-toxin sensitive protein (G\nαi1-3\n). (Lahlou et al., \nAnn. N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n1014:121-131, 2004.) Somatostatin-induced inhibition of peptide secretion results mainly from a decrease in intracellular Ca\n2+\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the wide spectrum of somatostatin effects, several biological responses have been identified with different receptor subtypes selectivity. These include growth hormone (GH) secretion mediated by SSTR2 and SSTR5, insulin secretion mediated by SSTR1 and SSTR5, glucagon secretion mediated by SSTR2, and immune responses mediated by SSTR2. (Patel et al., \nNeuroendocrinol. \n20:157-198, 1999; Crider et al., \nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents \n13:1427-1441, 2003.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferent somatostatin receptor sequences from different organisms are well known in the art. (See for example, Reisine et al., \nEndocrine Review \n16 :427-442, 1995.) Human, rat, and murine SSTR3 sequences and encoding nucleic acid sequences are provided in SEQ ID NO: 3 (human SSTR3 cDNA gi|44890055|ref|NM|01051.21 CDS 526.1782); SEQ ID NO: 4 (human SSTR3AA gi|4557861|ref|NP\n—\n001042.1|); SEQ ID NO: 5 (mouse SSTR3 cDNA gi|6678040|ref|NM\n—\n009218.1| CDS1 . . . 1287); SEQ ID NO: 6 (mouse SSTR3 AA gi|6678041|ref|NP\n—\n033244.1|); SEQ ID NO: 7 (rat SSTR3 cDNA gi|19424167|ref|NM\n—\n133522.1| CDS 656 . . . 1942); SEQ ID NO: 8 (rat SSTR3A gi|19424168|ref|NP\n—\n598206.1|). SSTR3 antagonists can be identified using SSTR3 and nucleic acid encoding for SSTR3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable assays include detecting compounds competing with a SSTR3 agonist for binding to SSTR3 and determining the functional effect of compounds on a SSTR3 cellular or physiologically relevant activity. SSTR3 cellular activities include cAMP inhibition, phospholipase C increase, tyrosine phsophatases increase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) decrease, K\n+\n channel increase, Na\n+\n/H\n+\n exchange decrease, and ERK decrease. (Lahlou et al., \nAnn. NY. Acad, Sci. \n1014:121-131, 2004.) Functional activity can be determined using cell lines expressing SSTR3 and determining the effect of a compound on one or more SSTR3 activities (e.g., Poitout et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n44:29900-3000, 2001; Hocart et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n41:1146-1154, 1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSSTR3 binding assays can be performed by labeling somatostatin and determining the ability of a compound to inhibit somatostatin binding. (Poitout et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n44:29900-3000, 2001; Hocart et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n41:1146-1154, 1998.) Additional formats for measuring binding of a compound to a receptor are well-known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA physiologically relevant activity for SSTR3 inhibition is stimulating insulin secretion. Stimulation of insulin secretion can be evaluated in vitro or in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSSTR3 antagonists can be identified experimentally or based on available information. A variety of different SSTR3 antagonists are well known in the art. Examples of such antagonists include peptide antagonists, β-carboline derivatives, and a decahydroisoquinoline derivative. (Poitout et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n44:29900-3000, 2001, Hocart et al., \nJ. Med.

By independently substituted, it is meant that the (two or more) substituents can be the same or different.\n\n\n \nOptical Isomers—Diastereoisomers—Geometric Isomers—Tautomers:\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of structural formula I may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereoisomeric mixtures and individual diastereoisomers. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of the compounds of structural formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of structural formula I may be separated into their individual diastereoisomers by, for example, fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent, for example methanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture thereof, or via chiral chromatography using an optically active stationary phase. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, any stereoisomer of a compound of the general structural formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known absolute configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereoisomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereoisomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography, such as chiral chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers which have different points of attachment of hydrogen accompanied by one or more double bond shifts. For example, a ketone and its enol form are keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of the present invention. Examples of tautomers which are intended to be encompassed within the compounds of the present invention are illustrated below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSalts:\n\n\n \n \n \nIt will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of structural formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and also salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable when they are used as precursors to the free compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or in other synthetic manipulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids. Salts of basic compounds encompassed within the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refer to non-toxic salts of the compounds of this invention which are generally prepared by reacting the free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid. Representative salts of basic compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, the following: acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, bromide, camsylate, carbonate, chloride, clavulanate, citrate, dihydrochloride, edetate, edisylate, estolate, esylate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glutamate, glycollylarsanilate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroxynaphthoate, iodide, isethionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methylbromide, methylnitrate, methylsulfate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, N-methylglucamine ammonium salt, oleate, oxalate, pamoate (embonate), palmitate, pantothenate, phosphate/diphosphate, polygalacturonate, salicylate, stearate, sulfate, subacetate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate, triethiodide and valerate. Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include, but are not limited to, salts derived from inorganic bases including aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, mangamous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion-exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in the case of a carboxylic acid (—COOH) or alcohol group being present in the compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable esters of carboxylic acid derivatives, such as methyl, ethyl, or pivaloyloxymethyl, or acyl derivatives of alcohols, such as O-acetyl, O-pivaloyl, O-benzoyl, and O-aminoacyl, can be employed. Included are those esters and acyl groups known in the art for modifying the solubility or hydrolysis characteristics for use as sustained-release or prodrug formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolvates, and in particular, the hydrates of the compounds of structural formula I are included in the present invention as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplifying the invention is the use of the compounds disclosed in the Examples and herein.\n\n\n \nUtilities:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein are potent and selective antagonists of the somatostatin subtype receptor 3 (SSTR3). The compounds are efficacious in the treatment of diseases that are modulated by SSTR3 ligands, which are generally antagonists. Many of these diseases are summarized below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more of the following diseases may be treated by the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to a patient in need of treatment. Also, the compounds of Formula I may be used for the manufacture of a medicament for treating one or more of these diseases:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 2 diabetes);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) hyperglycemia;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) Metabolic Syndrome;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(4) obesity;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(5) hypercholesterolemia;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(6) hypertriglyceridemia (elevated levels of triglyceride-rich-lipoproteins);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(7) mixed or diabetic dyslipidemia;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(8) low HDL cholesterol;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(9) high LDL cholesterol;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(10) hyperapoBlipoproteinemia; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(11) atherosclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the uses of the compounds is directed to the treatment of one or more of the following diseases by administering a therapeutically effective amount to a patient in need of treatment. The compounds may be used for manufacturing a medicament for use in the treatment of one or more of these diseases:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) Type 2 diabetes;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) hyperglycemia;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) Metabolic Syndrome;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(4) obesity; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(5) hypercholesterolemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds are expected to be effective in lowering glucose and lipids in diabetic patients and in non-diabetic patients who have impaired glucose tolerance and/or are in a pre-diabetic condition. The compounds may ameliorate hyperinsulinemia, which often occurs in diabetic or pre-diabetic patients, by modulating the swings in the level of serum glucose that often occurs in these patients. The compounds may also be effective in treating or reducing insulin resistance. The compounds may be effective in treating or preventing gestational diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds, compositions, and medicaments as described herein may also be effective in reducing the risks of adverse sequelae associated with metabolic syndrome, and in reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, delaying the onset of atherosclerosis, and/or reducing the risk of sequelae of atherosclerosis. Sequelae of atherosclerosis include angina, claudication, heart attack, stroke, and others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy keeping hyperglycemia under control, the compounds may also be effective in delaying or preventing vascular restenosis and diabetic retinopathy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention may also have utility in improving or restoring β-cell function, so that they may be useful in treating type 1 diabetes or in delaying or preventing a patient with Type 2 diabetes from needing insulin therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds generally may be efficacious in treating one or more of the following diseases: (1) Type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, or NIDDM), (2) hyperglycemia, (3) impaired glucose tolerance, (4) insulin resistance, (5) obesity, (6) lipid disorders, (7) dyslipidemia, (8) hyperlipidemia, (9) hypertriglyceridemia, (10) hypercholesterolemia, (11) low HDL levels, (12) high LDL levels, (13) atherosclerosis and its sequelae; (14) vascular restenosis, (15) abdominal obesity, (16) retinopathy, (17) metabolic syndrome, (18) high blood pressure (hypertension), and (19) insulin resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the invention provides a method for the treatment and control of mixed or diabetic dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, low HDL levels, high LDL levels, hyperlipidemia, and/or hypertriglyceridemia, which comprises administering to a patient in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound having formula I. The compound may be used alone or advantageously may be administered with a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor, particularly an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor such as lovastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rivastatin, itavastatin, or ZD-4522. The compound may also be used advantageously in combination with other lipid lowering drugs such as cholesterol absorption inhibitors (for example stanol esters, sterol glycosides such as tiqueside, and azetidinones such as ezetimibe), ACAT inhibitors (such as avasimibe), CETP inhibitors (for example torcetrapib and those described in published applications WO2005/100298, WO2006/014413, and WO2006/014357), niacin and niacin receptor agonists, bile acid sequestrants, microsomal triglyceride transport inhibitors, and bile acid reuptake inhibitors. These combination treatments may be effective for the treatment or control of one or more related conditions selected from the group consisting of hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidemia, high LDL, and low HDL.\n\n\n \nAdministration and Dose Ranges:\n\n\n \n \n \nAny suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dose of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. Preferably compounds of Formula I are administered orally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration, the condition being treated and the severity of the condition being treated. Such dosage may be ascertained readily by a person skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen treating or controlling diabetes mellitus and/or hyperglycemia or hypertriglyceridemia or other diseases for which compounds of Formula I are indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 100 milligram per kilogram of animal body weight, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1.0 milligrams to about 1000 milligrams. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 1 milligram to about 500 milligrams. For a particularly potent compound, the dosage for an adult human may be as low as 0.1 mg. In some cases, the daily dose may be as high as one gm. The dosage regimen may be adjusted within this range or even outside of this range to provide the optimal therapeutic response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOral administration will usually be carried out using tablets or capsules. Examples of doses in tablets and capsules are 0.1 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg. Other oral forms may also have the same or similar dosages.\n\n\n \nCompositions:\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention provides compositions which comprise a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient, as well as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids. A composition may also comprise a prodrug, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, if a prodrug is administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn practical use, the compounds of Formula I can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions as oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 percent of active compound. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. The active compounds can also be administered intranasally as, for example, liquid drops or spray.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, depending on the solubility of the compound or salt being administered, it may be advantageous to formulate the compound or salt as a solution in an oil such as a triglyceride of one or more medium chain fatty acids, a lipophilic solvent such as triacetin, a hydrophilic solvent (e.g. propylene glycol), or a mixture of two or more of these, also optionally including one or more ionic or nonionic surfactants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, polysorbate 80, polyethoxylated triglycerides, and mono and/or diglycerides of one or more medium chain fatty acids. Solutions containing surfactants (especially 2 or more surfactants) will form emulsions or microemulsions on contact with water. The compound may also be formulated in a water soluble polymer in which it has been dispersed as an amorphous phase by such methods as hot melt extrusion and spray drying, such polymers including hydroxylpropylmethylcellulose acetate (HPMCAS), hydroxylpropylmethyl cellulose (HPMCS), and polyvinylpyrrolidinones, including the homopolymer and copolymers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula I may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant or mixture of surfactants such as hydroxypropylcellulose, polysorbate 80, and mono and diglycerides of medium and long chain fatty acids. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.\n\n\n \nCombination Therapy:\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula I may be used in combination with other drugs that may also be useful in the treatment or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which compounds of Formula I are useful. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of Formula I. In the treatment of patients who have Type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and co-morbidities that accompany these diseases, more than one drug is commonly administered. The compounds of this invention may generally be administered to a patient who is already taking one or more other drugs for these conditions. Often the compounds will be administered to a patient who is already being treated with one or more antidiabetic compound, such as metformin, sulfonylureas, and/or PPAR agonists, when the patient's glycemic levels are not adequately responding to treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a compound of Formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula I is preferred. However, the combination therapy also includes therapies in which the compound of Formula I and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compound of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of Formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of other active ingredients that may be administered in combination with a compound of Formula I, and either administered separately or in the same pharmaceutical composition, include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) PPAR gamma agonists and partial agonists, including both glitazones and non-glitazones (e.g. troglitazone, pioglitazone, englitazone, MCC-555, rosiglitazone, balaglitazone, netoglitazone, T-131, LY-300512, LY-818, and compounds disclosed in WO02/08188, WO2004/020408, and WO2004/020409.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) biguanides, such as metformin and phenformin;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) inhibitors;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(d) dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, and alogliptin;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(e) insulin or insulin mimetics;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(f) sulfonylureas such as tolbutamide, glimepiride, glipizide, and related materials;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(g) α-glucosidase inhibitors (such as acarbose);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(h) agents which improve a patient's lipid profile, such as (i) HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rivastatin, itavastatin, ZD-4522 and other statins), (ii) bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, colestipol, and dialkylaminoalkyl derivatives of a cross-linked dextran), (iii) niacin receptor agonists, nicotinyl alcohol, nicotinic acid, or a salt thereof, (iv) PPARα agonists, such as fenofibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil, clofibrate, fenofibrate and bezafibrate), (v) cholesterol absorption inhibitors, such as ezetimibe, (vi) acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors, such as avasimibe, (vii) CETP inhibitors, such as torcetrapib, and (viii) phenolic antioxidants, such as probucol;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) PPARα/γ dual agonists, such as muraglitazar, tesaglitazar, farglitazar, and JT-501;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(j) PPARδ agonists, such as those disclosed in WO97/28149;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(k) anti-obesity compounds, such as fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, phentiramine, subitramine, orlistat, neuropeptide Y Y5 inhibitors, MC4R agonists, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB-1) antagonists/inverse agonists (e.g., rimonabant and taranabant), and 133 adrenergic receptor agonists;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(l) ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(m) agents intended for use in inflammatory conditions, such as aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, azulfidine, and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) selective inhibitors;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(n) glucagon receptor antagonists;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(o) GLP-1;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(p) GIP-1;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(q) GLP-1 analogs and derivatives, such as exendins, (e.g., exenatide and liruglatide);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(r) 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (HSD-1) inhibitors;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(s) GPR40;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(t) GPR119; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(u) SSTR5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above combinations include combinations of a compound of the present invention not only with one other active compound, but also with two or more other active compounds. Non-limiting examples include combinations of compounds having Formula I with two or more active compounds selected from biguanides, sulfonylureas, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, other PPAR agonists, PTP-1B inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) inverse agonists/antagonists.\n\n\n \nBiological Assays\n\n\nSomatostatin Subtype Receptor 3 Production\n\n\n \n \n \nSSTR3 can be produced using techniques well known in the art including those involving chemical synthesis and those involving recombinant production. (See e.g., Vincent, \nPeptide and Protein Drug Delivery\n, New York, N.Y., Decker, 1990\n; Current Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, John Wiley, 1987-2002, and Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, \n2\nnd \nEdition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant nucleic acid techniques for producing a protein involve introducing, or producing, a recombinant gene encoding the protein in a cell and expressing the protein. A purified protein can be obtained from cell. Alternatively, the activity of the protein in a cell or cell extract can be evaluated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA recombinant gene contains nucleic acid encoding a protein along with regulatory elements for protein expression. The recombinant gene can be present in a cellular genome or can be part of an expression vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe regulatory elements that may be present as part of a recombinant gene include those naturally associated with the protein encoding sequence and exogenous regulatory elements not naturally associated with the protein encoding sequence. Exogenous regulatory elements such as an exogenous promoter can be useful for expressing a recombinant gene in a particular host or increasing the level of expression. Generally, the regulatory elements that are present in a recombinant gene include a transcriptional promoter, a ribosome binding site, a terminator, and an optionally present operator. A preferred element for processing in eukaryotic cells is a polyadenylation signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression of a recombinant gene in a cell is facilitated through the use of an expression vector. Preferably, an expression vector in addition to a recombinant gene also contains an origin of replication for autonomous replication in a host cell, a selectable marker, a limited number of useful restriction enzyme sites, and a potential for high copy number. Examples of expression vectors are cloning vectors, modified cloning vectors, specifically designed plasmids and viruses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf desired, expression in a particular host can be enhanced through codon optimization. Codon optimization includes use of more preferred codons. Techniques for codon optimization in different hosts are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \nEnhancement of Glucose Dependent Insulin Secretion (GDIS) by SSTR3 antagonists in Isolated Mouse Islet Cells:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPancreatic islets of Langerhans were isolated from the pancreas of normal C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Maine) by collagenase digestion and discontinuous Ficoll gradient separation, a modification of the original method of Lacy and Kostianovsky (Lacy et al., \nDiabetes \n16:35-39, 1967). The islets were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 medium (11 mM glucose) before GDIS assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo measure GDIS, islets were first preincubated for 30 minutes in the Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer with 2 mM glucose (in petri dishes). The KRB medium contains 143.5 mM Na\n+\n, 5.8 mM K\n+\n, 2.5 mM Ca\n2+\n, 1.2 mM Mg\n2+\n, 124.1 mM Cl\n−\n, 1.2 mM PO\n4\n \n3−\n, 1.2 mM SO\n4\n \n2+\n, 25 mM CO\n3\n \n2−\n, 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). The islets were then transferred to a 96-well plate (one islet/well) and incubated at 37° C. for 60 minutes in 200 μl of KRB buffer with 2 or 16 mM glucose, and other agents to be tested such as octreotide and a SST3 antagonist. (Zhou et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n278:51316-51323, 2003.) Insulin was measured in aliquots of the incubation buffer by ELISA with a commercial kit (ALPCO Diagnostics, Windham, N.H.).\n\n\n \nSSTR Binding Assays:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe receptor-ligand binding assays of all 5 subtype of SSTRs were performed with membranes isolated from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells stably expressing the cloned human somatostatin receptors in 96-well format as previous reported. (Yang et al. \nPNAS \n95:10836-10841, 1998, Birzin et al. \nAnal. Biochem. \n307:159-166, 2002.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stable cell lines for SSTR1-SSTR5 were developed by stably transfecting with DNA for all five SSTRs using Lipofectamine. Neomycin-resistant clones were selected and maintained in medium containing 400 μg/mL G418 (Rohrer et al. \nScience \n282:737-740, 1998). Binding assays were performed using (3-\n125\nI-Tyr11)-SRIF-14 as the radioligand (used at 0.1 nM) and The Packard Unifilter assay plate. The assay buffer consisted of 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.8) with 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, leupeptin (10 μg/mL), pepstatin (10 μg/mL), bacitracin (200 μg/mL), and aprotinin (0.5 μg/mL). CHO-K1 cell membranes, radiolabeled somatostatin, and unlabeled test compounds were resuspended or diluted in this assay buffer. Unlabeled test compounds were examined over a range of concentrations from 0.01 nM to 10,000 nM. The K\ni \nvalues for compounds were determined as described by Cheng and Prusoff \nBiochem Pharmacol. \n22:3099-3108 (1973).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention, particularly the compounds of Examples 1-19 and the Examples listed in Tables 2 and 3, exhibited K\ni \nvalues in the range of 100 nM to 0.1 nM against SSTR3 and exhibited K\ni \nvalues greater than 100 nM against SSTR1, SSTR2, SSTR4, and SSTR5 receptors.\n\n\n \nFunctional Assay to Assess the Inhibition of SSTR3 Mediated Cyclic AMP Production:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effects of compounds that bind to human and murine SSTR3 with various affinities on the functional activity of the receptor were assessed by measuring cAMP production in the presence of Forskolin (FSK) along or FSK plus SS-14 in SSTR3 expressing CHO cells. FSK acts to induce cAMP production in these cells by activating adenylate cyclases, whereas SS-14 suppresses cAMP production in the SSTR3 stable cells by binding to SSTR3 and the subsequent inhibition of adenylate cyclases via an alpha subunit of GTP-binding protein (Gαi).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo measure the agonism activity of the compounds, we pre-incubated the human or mouse SSTR3 stable CHO cells with the compounds for 15 min, followed by a one-hour incubation of the cells with 3.5 μM FSK (in the continuous presence of the compounds). The amount of cAMP produced during the incubation was quantified with the Lance cAMP assay kit (PerkinElmer, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Majority of the compounds described in this application show no or little agonism activity. Therefore we used % Activation to reflect the agonism activity of each compound. The % Activation which was calculated with the following formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n% Activation=[(FSK−Unknown)/(FSK−SS-14]×100\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo measure the antagonism activity of the compounds, we pre-incubated the human or mouse SSTR3 stable CHO cells with the compounds for 15 min, followed by a one-hour incubation of the cells with a mixture of 3.5 μM FSK+100 nM SS-14 (in the continuous presence of the compounds). The amount of cAMP produced during the incubation was also quantified with the Lance cAMP assay. The antagonism activity of each compound was reflected both by % Inhibition (its maximum ability to block the action of SS-14) and an IC\n50 \nvalue obtained by a eight-point titration. The % Inhibition of each compound was calculated using the following formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n% Inhibition=[1−(unknown cAMP/FSK+SS-14 cAMP)]×100\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some case, 20% of human serum was included in the incubation buffer during the antagonism mode of the function assay to estimate the serum shift of the potency.\n\n\n \nGlucose Tolerance Test in Mice:\n\n\n \n \n \nMale C57BL/6N mice (7-12 weeks of age) are housed 10 per cage and given access to noimal diet rodent chow and water ad libitum. Mice are randomly assigned to treatment groups and fasted 4 to 6 h. Baseline blood glucose concentrations are determined by glucometer from tail nick blood. Animals are then treated orally with vehicle (0.25% methylcellulose) or test compound. Blood glucose concentration is measured at a set time point after treatment (t=min) and mice are then challenged with dextrose intraperitoneally—(2-3 g/kg) or orally (3-5 g/kg). One group of vehicle-treated mice is challenged with saline as a negative control. Blood glucose levels are determined from tail bleeds taken at 20, 40, 60 minutes after dextrose challenge. The blood glucose excursion profile from t=0 to t=60 min is used to integrate an area under the curve (AUC) for each treatment. Percent inhibition values for each treatment are generated from the AUC data normalized to the saline-challenged controls. A similar assay may be performed in rats. Compounds of the present invention are active after an oral dose in the range of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \nAbbreviations used in the following Schemes and Examples: aq. is aqueous; API-ES is atmospheric pressure ionization-electrospray (mass spectrum term); AcCN is acetonitrile; Boc is tert-butoxy carbonyl; d is day(s); DCM is dichloromethane; DEAD is diethyl azodicarboxylate; DIBAL is diisobutylaluminum hydride; DIPEA is N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Hunig's base); DMAP is 4-dimethylaminopyridine; DMF is N,N-dimethylformamide; DMSO is dimethylsulfoxide; EDC is 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride; EPA is ethylene polyacrylamide (a plastic); EtOAc is ethyl acetate; g is gram; h is hour(s); Hex is hexane; HOBt is 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; HPLC is high pressure liquid chromatography; HPLC/MS is high pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectrum; in vacuo means rotary evaporation under diminished pressure; IPA is isopropyl alcohol; IPAC or IPAc is isopropyl acetate; KHMDS is potassium hexamethyldisilazide; LC is liquid chromatography; LC-MS is liquid chromatography-mass spectrum; LDA is lithium diisopropylamide; M is molar; Me is methyl; MeOH is methanol; MHz is megahertz; mg is milligram; min is minute(s); mL is milliliter; mmol is millimole; MPLC is medium-pressure liquid chromatography; MS or ms is mass spectrum; MTBE is methyl tort-butyl ether; N is normal; NaHMDS is sodium hexamethyldisilazide; nm is nanometer; NMR is nuclear magnetic resonance; NMM is N-methylmorpholine; PyBOP is (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate; R\nt \nis retention time; rt or RT is room temperature; sat. is saturated; TEA is triethylamine; TPA is trifluoroacetic acid; TFAA is trifluoroacetic acid anhydride; THF is tetrahydrofuran; and TLC or tlc is thin layer chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are illustrated in the following Schemes and Examples.

The present invention also relates to intermediates of these compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and methods of using the compounds. These novel macrocyclic compounds are useful as therapeutics for a range of disease indications. In particular, these compounds are useful for treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal disorders including, but not limited to, post-operative ileus, gastroparesis, including diabetic gastroparesis, opioid bowel dysfunction, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, short bowel syndrome and functional gastrointestinal disorders.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe improved understanding of various physiological regulatory pathways enabled through the research efforts in genomics and proteomics has begun to impact the discovery of novel pharmaceutical agents. In particular, the identification of key receptors and their endogenous ligands has created new opportunities for exploitation of these receptor/ligand pairs as therapeutic targets. For example, ghrelin is a recently characterized 28-amino acid peptide hormone isolated originally from the stomach of rats with the orthologue subsequently identified in humans. (Kojima, M.; Hosoda, H. et al. Nature 1999, 402, 656-660.) The existence of this peptide in a range of other species suggests a conserved and important role in normal body function. This peptide has been demonstrated to be the endogenous ligand for a previously orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), \ntype\n 1 growth hormone secretatogue receptor (hGHS-R1a) (Howard, A. D.; Feighner, S. D.; et al. A receptor in pituitary and hypothalamus that functions in growth hormone release. Science 1996, 273, 974-977.) found predominantly in the brain (arcuate nucleus and ventromedial nucleus in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and substantia nigra) and pituitary. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,242,199; Intl. Pat. Appl. Nos. WO 97/21730 and WO 97/22004) The receptor has also been detected in other areas of the central nervous system (CNS) and in peripheral tissues, for instance adrenal and thyroid glands, heart, lung, kidney, and skeletal muscles. This receptor was identified and cloned prior to the isolation and characterization of the endogenous peptide ligand and is distinct from other receptors involved in the regulation of growth hormone (GH) secretion, in particular, the growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) receptor.\n\n\nA unique characteristic of both the rat and human peptides is the presence of the n-octanoyl (Oct) moiety on Ser\n3\n. However, the des-acyl form predominates in circulation, with approximately 90% of the hormone in this form. This group is derived from a post-translational modification and appears relevant for bioactivity and possibly also for transport into the CNS. (Banks, W. A.; Tschöp, M.; Robinson, S. M.; Heiman, M. L. Extent and direction of ghrelin transport across the blood-brain barrier is determined by its unique primary structure. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002, 302, 822-827.) In a GH-releasing assay, the des-octanoyl form of the hormone was at least 100-fold less potent than the parent peptide, although it has been suggested that the des-acyl species may be responsible for some of the other biological effects associated with ghrelin. This des-acyl form has also been postulated to be primarily responsible for the cardiovascular and cell proliferation effects attributed to ghrelin, while the acylated form participates in maintenance of energy balance and growth hormone release. (Baldanzi, G.; Filighenddu, N.; Cutrupi, S.; et al. Ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin inhibit cell death in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells through ERK1/2 and PI-3 kinase/AKT. J. Cell Biol. 2002, 159, 1029-1037) Similarly, des-Gln\n14\n-ghrelin and its octanoylated derivative have been isolated as endogenous forms of the hormone arising from alternative splicing of the ghrelin gene, but both are found to be inactive in stimulating GH release in vivo. (Hosoda, H.; Kojima, M.; Matsuo, H.: Kangawa, K. Purification and characterization of rat des-Gln\n14\n-ghrelin, a second endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor. J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 21995-2120.). Other minor forms of ghrelin produced by post-translational processing have been observed in plasma, although no specific activity has been attributed to them. (Hosoda, H.; Kojima. M.; et al. Structural divergence of human ghrelin. Identification of multiple ghrelin-derived molecules produced by post-translational processing. J. Biol. Chem. 2003, 278, 64-70.)\n\n\nEven prior to the isolation of this receptor and its endogenous peptide ligand, a significant amount of research was devoted to finding agents that can stimulate GH secretion. The proper regulation of human GH has significance not only for proper body growth, but also a range of other critical physiological effects. GH and other GH-stimulating peptides, such as GHRH and growth hormone releasing factor (GRF), as well as their derivatives and analogues, are administered via injection. Therefore, to better take advantage of these positive effects, attention was focused on the development of orally active therapeutic agents that would increase GH secretion, termed GH secretagogues (GHS). Additionally, use of these agents was expected to more closely mimic the pulsatile physiological release of GH.\n\n\nBeginning with the identification of the growth hormone-releasing peptides (GHRP) in the late 1970's. (Bowers, C. Y. Growth hormone-releasing peptides: physiology and clinical applications. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. \nDiabetes\n 2000, 7, 168-174; Camanni, F.; Ghigo, E.; Arvat, E. Growth hormone-releasing peptides and their analogs. Front. Neurosci. 1998, 19, 47-72; Locatelli, V.; Torsello, A. Growth hormone secretagogues: focus on the growth hormone-releasing peptides. Pharmacol. Res. 1997, 36, 415-423.) a host of agents have been studied for their potential to act as GHS. In addition to their stimulation of GH release and concomitant positive effects in that regard, GHS were projected to have utility in the treatment of a variety of other disorders, including wasting conditions (cachexia) as seen in HIV patients and cancer-induced anorexia, musculoskeletal frailty in the elderly, and growth hormone deficient diseases. Many efforts over the past 25 years have yielded a number of potent, orally available GHS. (Smith, R. G.; Sun, Y. X.; Beatancourt, L.; Asnicar, M. Growth hormone secretagogues: prospects and pitfalls. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004, 18, 333-347; Fehrentz, J.-A.; Martinez, J.; Boeglin, D.; Guerlavais, V.; Deghenghi, R. Growth hormone secretagogues: Past, present and future. \nIDrugs\n 2002, 5, 804-814; Svensson, J. Exp. Opin. Ther. \nPatents\n 2000, 10, 1071-1080; Nargund, R. P.; Patchett, A. A.; et al. Peptidomimetic growth hormone secretagogues. Design considerations and therapeutic potential. J. Med. Chem. 1998, 41, 3103-3127; Ghigo, E; Arvat, E.; Camanni, F. Orally active growth hormone secretagogues: state of the art and clinical perspective. Ann. Med. 1998, 30, 159-168; Smith, R. G.; Van der Ploeg, L. H. T.; Howard, A. D.; Feighner, S. D.; et al. Peptidomimetic regulation of growth hormone secretion. Endocr. Rev. 1997, 18, 621-645.) These include small peptides, such as hexarelin (Zentaris) and ipamorelin (Novo Nordisk), and adenosine analogues, as well as small molecules such as carpomorelin (Pfizer), L-252,564 (Merck). MK-0677 (Merck), NN7203 (Novo Nordisk), G-7203 (Genentech), S-37435 (Kaken) and SM-130868 (Sumitomo), designed to be orally active for the stimulation of growth hormone. However, clinical testing with such agents have rendered disappointing results due to, among other things, lack of efficacy over prolonged treatment or undesired side effects, including irreversible inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes (Zdravkovic M.; Olse, A. K.; Christiansen, T.; et al. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2003, 58, 683-688.) Therefore, there remains a need for pharmacological agents that could effectively target the GHS-R1a receptor for therapeutic action.\n\n\nDespite its involvement in GH modulation, ghrelin is primarily synthesized in the oxyntic gland of the stomach, although it is also produced in lesser amounts in other organs, including the kidney, pancreas and hypothalamus. (Kojima, M.; Hsoda, H.; Kangawa, K. Purification and distribution of ghrelin: the natural endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor. Horm. Res. 2001, 56 (Suppl. 1), 93-97; Ariyasu, H.; Takaya, K.; Tagami, T.; et al. Stomach is a major source of circulating ghrelin, and feeding state determines plasma ghrelin-like immunoreactivity levels in humans. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001, 86, 4753-4758) In addition to its role in stimulating GH release, the hormone has a variety of other endocrine and non-endocrine functions (Broglio, F.; Gottero, C.; Arvat, E.; Ghigo, E. Endocrine and non-endocrine actions of ghrelin. Horm. Res. 2003, 59, 109-117) and has been shown to interact with a number of other systems in playing a role in maintaining proper energy balance. (Horvath. T. L.; Diano, S.; Sotonyi, P.; Heiman, M.; Tschöp, M. Ghrelin and the regulation of energy balance—a hypothalamic perspective. Endocrinology 2001, 142, 4163-4169; Casanueva, F. F.; Dieguez, C. Ghrelin: the link connecting growth with metabolism and energy homeostasis. Rev. Endocrinol. Metab. Disord. 2002, 3, 325-338). In particular, ghrelin plays a role as an orexigenic signal in the control of feeding, in which it acts to counteract the effects of leptin. Indeed, it was the first gut peptide proven to have such orexigenic properties. (Kojima, M.; Kangawa, K. Ghrelin, an orexigenic signaling molecule from the gastrointestinal tract. Curr. Opin. \nPharmacology\n 2002, 2, 665-668.) The hormone also is implicated in the hypothalamic regulation of the synthesis and secretion of a number of other neuropeptides involved in appetite and feeding behavior. Levels of ghrelin are elevated in response to fasting or extended food restriction. (Nakazato, M.; Murakami, N.; Date, Y.; Kojima, M.; et al. A role for ghrelin in the central regulation of feeding. Nature 2001, 409, 194-198) For example, subjects suffering with anorexia or bulimia exhibit elevated ghrelin levels. Circulating levels of the hormone have been found to rise before meals and fall after meals. In addition, diet-induced weight loss leads to increased ghrelin levels, although obese subjects who have gastric bypass surgery do not likewise experience such an increase. (Cummings, D. E.; Weigle, D. S.; Frayo, R. S.; et al. Plasma ghrelin levels after diet-induced weight loss or gastric bypass surgery. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002, 346, 1623-1630)\n\n\nThis intimate involvement of ghrelin in control of food intake and appetite has made it an attractive target for obesity research. Indeed, few other natural substances have been demonstrated to be involved in the modulation of both GH secretion and food intake.\n\n\nAn additional effect of ghrelin that has not to date been exploited for therapeutic purposes is in modulating gastric motility and gastric acid secretion. The prokinetic activity appears to be independent of the GH-secretory action and is likely mediated by the vagal-cholinergic muscarinic pathway. The dose levels required are equivalent to those necessary for the hormone's GH and appetite stimulation actions. It is noteworthy that, in contrast to its inactivity for ghrelin's other actions, the des-Gln\n14 \npeptide demonstrated promotion of motility as well. (Trudel, L.; Bouin, M.; Tomasetto, C.; Eberling, P.; St-Pierre, S.; Bannon, P.; L'Heureux, M. C.: Poitras, P. Two new peptides to improve post-operative gastric ileus in dog. Peptides 2003, 24, 531-534; Trudel, L.; Tomasetto, C.; Rio, M. C.; Bouin, M.; Plourde, V.; Eberling, P.; Poitras, P. Ghrelin/motilin-related peptide is a potent prokinetic to reverse gastric postoperative ileus in rats. Am. J. Physiol. 2002, 282, G948-G952; Peeters, T. L. Central and peripheral mechanisms by which ghrelin regulates gut motility. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2003, 54(Supp. 4), 95-103.)\n\n\nGhrelin also has been implicated in various aspects of reproduction and neonatal development. (Arvat, E.; Gianotti, L.; Giordano, R.; et al. Growth hormone-releasing hormone and growth hormone secretagogue-receptor ligands. Focus on reproductive system. \nEndocrine\n 2001, 14, 35-43) Also of significance are the cardiovascular effects of ghrelin, since the peptide is a powerful vasodilator. As such, ghrelin agonists have potential for the treatment of chronic heart failure (Nagaya, N.; Kangawa, K. Ghrelin, a novel growth hormone-relasing peptide, in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Regul. Pept. 2003, 114, 71-77; Nagaya, N.; Kangawa, K. Ghrelin improves left ventricular dysfunction and cardiac cachexia in heart failure. Curr. Opin. Phannacol. 2003, 3, 146-151; Bedendi, I.; Alloatti, G.; Marcantoni, A.; Malan, D.; Catapano, F.; Ghé, C.; et al. Cardiac effects of ghrelin and its endogenous derivatives des-octanoyl ghrelin and des-Gln\n14\n-ghrelin. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003, 476, 87-95) Intl. Pat. Appl. Publ. WO 2004/014412 describes the use of ghrelin agonists for the protection of cell death in myocardial cells and as a cardioprotectant treatment for conditions leading to heart failure. Lastly, evidence has been obtained that ghrelin may have implications in anxiety and other CNS disorders as well as the improvement of memory. (Carlini, V. P., Monzon, M. E., Vans, M. M., Cragnolini, A. B., Schioth, H. B., Scimonelli, T. N., de Barioglio, S. R. Ghrelin increases anxiety-like behavior and memory retention in rats. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002, 299, 739-743)\n\n\nThe myriad effects of ghrelin in humans have suggested the existence of subtypes for its receptor, although none have as yet been identified. (Torsello, A.; Locatelli, Y.; Melis, M. R.; Succu, S.; Spano, M. S.; Deghenghi, R.; Muller, E. E.: Argiolas, A.; Torsello, A.; Locatelli, V.; et al. Differential orexigenic effects of hexarelin and its analogs in the rat hypothalamus: indication for multiple growth hormone secretagogue receptor subtypes. Neuroendocrinology 2000, 72, 327-332.) However, a truncated, inactive form of GHS-R1a, termed GHS-R1b, was isolated and identified during the original characterization studies. Evidence is mounting that additional receptor subtypes could be present in different tissues to explain the diverse effects displayed by the endogenous peptides and synthetic GHS. For instance, high affinity binding sites for ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin have also been found in breast cancer cell lines, cardiomyocytes, and guinea pig heart that are involved in mediating the antiproliferative, cardioprotective and negative cardiac inotropic effects of these peptides. Similarly, specific GHS binding sites besides GHS-R1a and GHS-R1b have been found in prostate cancer cells. Further, ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin exert different effects on cell proliferation in prostate carcinoma cell lines. (Cassoni, P.; Ghé, C.; Marrocco, T.; et al. Expression of ghrelin and biological activity of specific receptors for ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin in human prostate neoplasms and related cell lines, Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2004, 150, 173-184) These various receptor subtypes may then be implicated independently in the wide array of biological activities displayed by the endogenous peptides and synthetic GHS. Indeed, recently, the existence of receptor subtypes was offered as an explanation for the promotion of fat accumulation by ghrelin, despite its potent stimulation of the lipolytic hormone, growth hormone, (Thompson, N. M.; Gill, D. A. S.; Davies, R.; Loveridge, N.; Houston, P. A.; Robinson, I. C. A. F.; Wells, T. Ghrelin and des-octanoyl ghrelin promote adipogenesis directly in vivo by a mechanism independent of the type 1a growth hormone secretagogue receptor. Endocrinology 2004, 145, 234-242.) Further, this work suggested that the ratio of ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin production could help regulate the balance between adipogenesis and lipolysis in response to nutritional status.\n\n\nThe successful creation of peptidic ghrelin analogues that separate the GH-modulating effects of ghrelin from the effects on weight gain and appetite provides strong evidence for the existence and physiological relevance of other receptor subtypes. (Halem, H. A.; Taylor, J. E.; Dong, J. Z.; Shen, Y.; Datta, R.; Ahizaid, A.; Diano, S.; Horvath, T.; Zizzari, P.; Bluet-Pajot, M.-T.; Epelbaum, J.; Culler, M. D. Novel analogs of ghrelin: physiological and clinical implications. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2004, 151, S71-S75.) BIM-28163 functions as an antagonist at the GHS-R1a receptor and inhibits receptor activation by native ghrelin. However, this same molecule is a full agonist with respect to stimulating weight gain and food intake. Additionally, the existence of a still uncharacterized receptor subtype has been proposed based on binding studies in various tissues that showed differences between peptidic and non-peptidic GHS. (Ong, H.; Menicoll, N.; Escher, F.; Collu, R.; Deghenghi, R.; Locatelli, V.; Ghigo, E.; Muccioli, G.; Boghen, M.; Nilsson, M. Endocrinology 1998, 139, 432- 435.) Differences between overall GHS-R expression and that of the GHS-R1a subtype in rat testis have been reported. (Barreiro, M. L.; Suominen, J. S.; Gaytan, F.; Pinilla, L.; Chopin, L. K.; Casanueva, F. F.; Dieguez, C.; Aguilar, E.; Toppari, J.; Tena-Sempere, M. Developmental, stage-specific, and hormonally regulated expression of growth hormone secretagogue receptor messenger RNA in rat testis. Biol. Reproduction 2003, 68, 1631-1640) A GHS-R subtype on cholinergic nerves is postulated as an explanation for the differential actions of ghrelin and a peptidic GHS on neural contractile response observed during binding studies at the motilin receptor. (Depoortere, I.; Thijs, T.; Thielemans, L.; Robberecht, P.; Peeters, T. L. Interaction of the growth hormone-releasing peptides ghrelin and growth hormone-releasing peptide-6 with the motilin receptor in the rabbit gastric antrum. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther 2003, 305, 660-667.)\n\n\nThe variety of activities associated with the ghrelin receptor could also be due to different agonists activating different signaling pathways as has been shown for ghrelin and adenosine, both of which interact as agonists at GHS-R1a (Carreira, M. C.; Camina, J. P.; Smith, R. G.; Casanueva, F. F. Agonist-specific coupling of growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1a to different intracellular signaling systems. Role of adenosine. Neuroendocrinology 2004, 79, 13-25.)\n\n\nThe functional activity of a GPCR has been shown to often require the formation of dimers or other multimeric complexes with itself or other proteins. (Park, P. S.; Filipek, S.; Wells, J. W.; Palczewski, K. Oligomerization of G protein-coupled receptors: past, present, and future. Biochemistry 2004, 43, 15643-15656; Rios, C. D.; Jordan, B. A.; Gomes, I.; Devi, L. A. G-protein-coupled receptor dimerization: modulation of receptor function. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001, 92, 71-87; Devi, L. A. Heterodimerization of G-protein-coupled receptors: pharmacology, signaling and trafficking. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001, 22, 532-537.) Likewise, the activity of the ghrelin receptor might also be at least partially governed by such complexes. For example, certain reports indicate that interaction of GHS-R1a with GHRH (Cunha, S. R.; Mayo, K. E. Ghrelin and growth hormone (GH) secreatagogues potentiate GH-releasing hormone (GHRH)-induced \ncyclic adenosine\n 3′,5′-monophosphate production in cells expressing transfected GHRH and GH secretagogue receptors. Endocrinology 2002, 143, 4570-4582; Malagón, M. M.; Luque, R. M.; Ruiz-Guerrero, E.; Rodriguez-Pacheco, F.; Garcia-Navarro, S.; Casanueva, F. F.; Gracia-Navarro, F.; Castaño, J. P. Intracellular signaling mechanisms mediating ghrelin-stimulated growth hormone release in somatotropes Endocrinology 2003, 144, 5372-5380) or between receptor subtypes (Chan, C. B.; Cheng, C. H. K. Identification and functional characterization of two alternatively spliced growth hormone secretagogue receptor transcripts from the pituitary of black seabream Acanthopagrus schlegeli. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004, 214, 81-95) may be involved in modulating the function of the receptor.\n\n\nThe vast majority of reported approaches to exploiting the ghrelin receptor for therapeutic purposes have focused on modulating metabolic functions. Similarly, the vast majority of literature on GHS focuses on conditions that can be treated via its GH promoting actions. Some embodiments of the invention described herein, in particular, take advantage of selective activation of the ghrelin receptor to provide an avenue for the treatment of diseases characterized by GI dysmotility. The improved GI motility observed with ghrelin demonstrates that ghrelin agonists may be useful in correcting conditions associated with reduced or restricted motility (Murray, C. D. R.; Kamm, M. A.; Bloom, S. R.; Emmanuel, A. V. Ghrelin for the gastroenterologist: history and potential. \nGastroenterology\n 2003, 125, 1492-1502; Fujino, K.; Inui, A.; Asakawa, A.; Kihara, N.; Fujimura, M.; Fujimiya, M. Ghrelin induces fasting motor activity of the gastrointestinal tract in conscious fed rats. J. Physiol. 2003, 550, 227-240; Edholm, T.; Levin, F.; Hellström, P. M.; Schmidt, P. T. Ghrelin stimulates motility in the small intestine of rats through intrinsic cholinergic neurons. Regul. Pept. 2004, 121, 25-30.)\n\n\nIncluded among these conditions is post-operative ileus (POI, Luckey, A.; Livingston, E.; Taché, Y. Mechanisms and treatment of postoperative ileus. Arch. Surg. 2003, 138, 206-214; Baig, M. K.; Wexner, S. D. Postoperative ileus: a review. Dis. Colon Rectum 2004, 47, 516-526). POI is defined as the impairment of GI motility that routinely occurs following abdominal, intestinal, gynecological and pelvic surgeries. In the U.S. alone, 4.3 million surgeries annually induce POI, accounting for an economic impact of over $1 billion. POI is considered a deleterious response to surgical manipulation with a variable duration that generally persists for 72 hours. It is characterized by pain, abdominal distention or bloating, nausea and vomiting, accumulation of gas and fluids in the bowel, and delayed passage of stool. Patients are neither able to tolerate oral feeding nor to have bowel movements until gut function returns. POI leads to numerous undesirable consequences, including increased patient morbidity, the costly prolongation of hospital stays and, further, is a major cause of hospital readmission. In addition, opiate drugs given as analgesics after surgery exacerbate this condition due to their well-recognized side effect of inhibiting bowel function.\n\n\nSurgical manipulation of the stomach or intestine causes a disorganization of the gut-brain signaling pathways, impairing GI activity and triggering POI. Ghrelin acts locally in the stomach to stimulate and coordinate the firing of vagal afferent neurons and thereby modulate gut motility. Thus, ghrelin accelerates gastric emptying in humans (Inui, A.; Asakawa, A.; Bowers, C. Y.; Mantovani, G.; Laviano, A.; Meguid, M. M.; Fujimiya, M. Ghrelin, appetite, and gastric motility: the emerging role of the stomach as an endocrine organ. FASEB J. 2004, 18, 439-456; Peeters, T. L. Central and peripheral mechanisms by which ghrelin regulates gut motility. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2003, 54(Supp. 4), 95-103.) and is a potent agent proven to treat POI in animal models (Trudel. L.; Tomasetto, C.; Rio, M. C.; Bouin, M.; Plourde, V.; Eberling, P.; Poitras, P. Ghrelin/motilin-related peptide is a potent prokinetic to reverse gastric postoperative ileus in rats. Am. J. Physiol. 2002, 282, G948-G952; Trudel, L.; Bouin, M.; Tomasetto, C.; Eberling, P.; St-Pierre, S.; Bannon, P.; L'Heureux, M. C.; Poitras, P. Two new peptides to improve post-operative gastric ileus in dog. Peptides 2003, 24, 531-534). Ghrelin agonists duplicate the effects of ghrelin, thus targeting directly the underlying cause of POI to accelerate normalization of gut function and enable more rapid discharge from the hospital. Intravenous administration is often the preferred route of treatment for POI due to the impaired GI motility in these patients that impedes oral therapy. No agent is currently approved by the U.S. FDA specifically for the treatment of POI.\n\n\nAnother major motility disorder is gastroparesis, a particular problem for both type I and type II diabetics. (Camilleri, M. Advances in diabetic gastroparesis. Rev. Gastroenterol. Disord. 2002, 2, 47-56; Tack et al. Gastroenterology 2004; 126: A485; Moreaux, B.; VandenBerg, J.; Thielmans, L.; Meulemans, A.; Coulie, B. Activation of the GHS receptor accelerates gastric emptying in the dog. Digestive Disease Week, 15-20 May 2004, New Orleans, La., USA Abstract M1009; Tack et al. Gastroenterology 2004, 126: A74) Gastroparesis (“stomach paralysis”) is a syndrome characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of any mechanical obstruction. It is variably characterized by abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, anorexia, early satiety, malnutrition, dehydration, gastroesophageal reflux, cramping and bloating. This chronic condition can lead to frequent hospitalization, increased disability and decreased quality of life. Severe, symptomatic gastroparesis is common in individuals suffering from diabetes, affecting from 5-10% of diabetics for a total patient population of 1 million in the U.S. alone. Neuropathy is a frequent, debilitating complication of diabetes. Visceral neuropathy results in GI dysfunction, especially involving the stomach, leading to impaired gastric motility. Ghrelin promotes gastric emptying both by stimulating the vagus nerve and via direct prokinetic action at the gastric mucosa. Moreover, a recent clinical study indicates that intravenous administration of the natural ghrelin peptide is an effective acute therapy in diabetic gastroparesis patients. A ghrelin agonist would therefore be highly effective in over-coming the fundamental motility barrier faced by gastroparesis patients and correcting this condition. As with POI, no accepted or efficacious therapy for diabetic gastroparesis is available and most current therapies aim to provide only symptomatic relief. Further, many of the therapeutics in development have a mechanism of action similar to earlier products that have failed in this indication. Surgical procedures may ameliorate the disease process, but offer no possibility of cure.\n\n\nOpioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OBD, Kurz, A.; Sessler, D. J. Opioid-Induced Bowel Dysfunction. Drugs 2003, 63, 649-671.) is the term applied to the confluence of symptoms involving the reduced GI motility that results from treatment with opioid analgesics. Approximately 40-50% of patients taking opioids for pain control experience OBD. It is characterized by hard, dry stools, straining, incomplete evacuation, bloating, abdominal distension and increased gastric reflux. In addition to the obvious short-term distress, this condition leads to physical and psychological deterioration in patients undergoing long term opioid treatment, Further, the dysfunction can be so severe as to become a dose-limiting adverse effect that actually prevents adequate pain control. As with POI, a ghrelin agonist can be expected to counteract the dysmotility resulting from opioid use.\n\n\nTwo less common conditions may also be helped through the GI motility stimulation effects of ghrelin and ghrelin agonists. Short bowel syndrome is a condition that occurs after resection of a substantial portion of small intestine and is characterized by malnutrition. Patients are observed to have decreased ghrelin levels resulting from loss of the ghrelin-producing neuroendocrine cells of the intestine. It is possible the short bowel feeds back on the release of the hormone. (Krsek, M.; Rosicka, M.; Haluzik, M.; et al. Plasma ghrelin levels in patients with short bowel syndrome. Endocr. Res. 2002, 28, 27-33.) Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a syndrome defined by the presence of chronic intestinal dilation and dysmotility in the absence of mechanical obstruction or inflammation. Both genetic and acquired causes are known to result in this disorder, which affects high numbers of individuals worldwide annually. (Hirano. I.; Pandolfino, J. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Dig. Dis. 2000, 18, 83-92.)\n\n\nOther conditions and disorders that could be addressed through stimulation of the ghrelin receptor are: emesis such as caused by cancer chemotherapy, constipation such as associated with the hypomotility phase of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), delayed gastric emptying associated with wasting conditions, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastric ulcers (Sibilia, V.; Rindi, G.; Pagani, F.; Rapetti, D.; Locatelli, V; Torsello, A.; Campanini, N.; Degenghi, R.; Netti, C. Ghrelin protects against ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in rats: studies on the mechanism of action. Endocrinology 2003, 144, 353-359.) and Crohn's disease.\n\n\nAdditionally, GI dysmotility is a significant problem in other mammals as well. For example, the motility dysfunction termed ileus or colic is the number one cause of mortality among horses. Further, ileus is one of the most common complications of equine intestinal surgery, in other words, post-operative ileus. This condition may also have a non-surgical etiology. Some horses may be predisposed to ileus based upon the anatomy and functioning of their digestive tract. Virtually any horse is susceptible to colic with only minor differences based upon age, sex and breed. Additionally, ileus may affect other animals, for example canines. (Roussel, A. J., Jr.; Cohen, N. D.; Hooper, R. N.; Rakestraw, P. C. Risk factors associated with development of postoperative ileus in horses. J. Am Vet. Med Assoc. 2001, 219, 72-78; Van Hoogmoed, L. M.; Nieto, J. E.; Snyder, J. R.; Harmon, F. A. Survey of prokinetic use in horses with gastrointestinal injury. Vet. Surg. 2004, 33, 279-285.)\n\n\nImportantly, for most of the above conditions, no specific, approved therapeutics exist and most therapies simply address symptomatic relief. However, specific modulation of the ghrelin receptor provides an opportunity to directly target the site of pathophysiological disturbance to better treat the underlying condition and improve clinical outcome. Further, unlike other agents that interact at the GHS-R1a receptor, the compounds of the invention are believed not to stimulate concurrent GH secretion. This separation of the gastrointestinal and GH effects has not previously been reported for any modulators of this receptor. However, as already mentioned, the existence of analogues that separate the appetite control and GH modulatory effects associated with ghrelin has been recently reported.\n\n\nWO 01/00830 reports on short gastrointestinal peptides (SGIP) that secrete growth hormone and also promote GI motility, but these were not shown to be due to action at the ghrelin receptor. U.S. Pat. No. 6,548,501 discloses specific compounds, but as GHS, useful for stimulation of GI motility. Moreover, other endogenous factors are known to stimulate secretion of GH, but do not promote GI motility. Indeed, many actually inhibit this physiological function. Specific receptor agonists such as the compounds of the present invention have much better potential to be selective and effective therapeutic agents.\n\n\nWork has continued at the development of potent and selective GHS with a number of small molecule derivatives now being known as has been recently summarized.

When they have, antagonist activity has been more prevalent. For example, the 14-amino acid compound, vapreotide, an SRIH-14 agonist and somatostatin mimetic, was demonstrated to be a ghrelin antagonist. (Deghenghi R, Papotti M, Ghigo E, et al. Somatostatin octapeptides (lanreotide, octreotide, vapreotide, and their analogs) share the growth hormone-releasing peptide receptor in the human pituitary gland. \nEndocrine\n 2001, 14, 29-33.) The binding and antagonist activities of analogues of cortistatin, a cyclic neuropeptide known to bind nonselectively to somatostatin receptors, to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor have been reported (Intl. Pat. Appl. WO 03/004518). (Deghenghi R, Broglio F, Papotti M, et al. Targeting the ghrelin receptor—Orally active GHS and cortistatin analogs. Endocrine 2003, 22, 13-18) In particular, one of these analogues, EP-01492 (cortistatin-8) has been advanced into preclinical studies for the treatment of obesity as a ghrelin antagonist. These compounds exhibit an IC\n50 \nof 24-33 nM. In addition, these cyclic compounds and their derivatives, plus their use with metal binding agents have been described for their ability to be useful for radiodiagnostic or radiotherapeutic use in the treatment of tumors and acromegaly.\n\n\nCyclic and linear analogues of growth hormone 177-191 have been studied as treatments for obesity (WO 99/12969), with one particular compound, AOD9604, having entered the clinic for this indication. A compound already studied that is most similar to the molecules of the present invention is the GHS, G-7203 (EC\n50\n=0.43 nM), the cyclic peptide analogue of the growth hormone releasing peptide, GHRP-2 (Elias, K. A.; Ingle, G. S.; Burnier, J. P.; Hammonds, G.; McDowell, R. S.; Rawson, T. E.; Somers, T. C.; Stanley, M. S.; Cronin, M. J. In vitro characterization of four novel classes of growth hormone-releasing peptide. Endocrinol. 1995, 136, 5694-5699). However, simplification of this cyclic derivative led to still potent, linear compounds, whereas, for compounds of the invention, linear analogues have been found to be devoid of ghrelin receptor activity.\n\n\nThe macrocyclic compounds of the invention possess agonist activity. As previously mentioned, however, unlike other agonists of the hGHS-R1a receptor, the compounds of the invention unexpectedly have an insignificant stimulatory effect on the release of growth hormone. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention can exhibit selective action in the GI tract or for metabolic disorders without side effects due to GH release.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides novel conformationally-defined macrocyclic compounds. These compounds can function as modulators, in particular agonists, of the ghrelin (growth hormone secretagogue) receptor (GHS-R1a).\n\n\nAccording to aspects of the present invention, the present invention relates to compounds according to formula I, II and/or III:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor an optical isomer, enantiomer, diastereomer, racemate or stereochemical mixture thereof.\n\n\nwherein:\n\n\n\nR\n1 \nis hydrogen or the side chain of an amino acid, or alternatively R\n1 \nand R\n2 \ntogether form a 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-membered ring, optionally comprising an O, S or N atom in the ring, wherein the ring is optionally substituted with R\n8 \nas defined below, or alternatively R\n1 \nand R\n9 \ntogether form a 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-membered ring, optionally comprising an O, S or additional N atom in the ring, wherein the ring is optionally substituted with R\n8 \nas defined below;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis hydrogen or the side chain of an amino acid, or alternatively R\n1 \nand R\n2 \ntogether form a 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-membered ring, optionally comprising an O, S or N atom in the ring, wherein the ring is optionally substituted with R\n8 \nas defined below;

Generally, when a substituted form of a group is present, such substituted group is preferably not further substituted or, if substituted, the substituent comprises only a limited number of substituted groups, in some \n \n \n \ninstances\n \n \n \n 1, 2, 3 or 4 such substituents.\n\n\nWhen any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or in any formula herein, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.\n\n\nA “stable compound” or “stable structure” refers to a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.\n\n\nThe term “amino acid” refers to the common natural (genetically encoded) or synthetic amino acids and common derivatives thereof, known to those skilled in the art. When applied to amino acids, “standard” or “proteinogenic” refers to the genetically encoded 20 amino acids in their natural configuration. Similarly, when applied to amino acids, “unnatural” or “unusual” refers to the wide selection of non-natural, rare or synthetic amino acids such as those described by Hunt, S. in Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Amino Acids, Barrett, G. C., Ed., Chapman and Hall: New York, 1985.\n\n\nThe term “residue” with reference to an amino acid or amino acid derivative refers to a group of the formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\nAA \nis an amino acid side chain, and n=0, 1 or 2 in this instance.\n\n\n\nThe term “fragment” with respect to a dipeptide, tripeptide or higher order peptide derivative indicates a group that contains two, three or more, respectively, amino acid residues.\n\n\nThe term “amino acid side chain” refers to any side chain from a standard or unnatural amino acid, and is denoted R\nAA\n. For example, the side chain of alanine is methyl, the side chain of valine is isopropyl and the side chain of tryptophan is 3-indolylmethyl.\n\n\nThe term “agonist” refers to a compound that duplicates at least some of the effect of the endogenous ligand of a protein, receptor, enzyme or the like.\n\n\nThe term “antagonist” refers to a compound that inhibits at least some of the effect of the endogenous ligand of a protein, receptor, enzyme or the like.\n\n\nThe term “growth hormone secretagogue” (GHS) refers to any exogenously administered compound or agent that directly or indirectly stimulates or increases the endogenous release of growth hormone, growth hormone-releasing hormone, or somatostatin in an animal, in particular, a human. A GHS may be peptidic or non-peptidic in nature, in some instances, with an agent that can be administered orally. In some instances, the agent can induce a pulsatile response.\n\n\nThe term “modulator” refers to a compound that imparts an effect on a biological or chemical process or mechanism. For example, a modulator may increase, facilitate, upregulate, activate, inhibit, decrease, block, prevent, delay, desensitize, deactivate, down regulate, or the like, a biological or chemical process or mechanism. Accordingly, a modulator can be an “agonist” or an “antagonist.” Exemplary biological processes or mechanisms affected by a modulator include, but are not limited to, receptor binding and hormone release or secretion. Exemplary chemical processes or mechanisms affected by a modulator include, but are not limited to, catalysis and hydrolysis.\n\n\nThe term “variant” when applied to a receptor is meant to include dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers and other biological complexes containing multiple components. These components can be the same or different.\n\n\nThe term “peptide” refers to a chemical compound comprised of two or more amino acids covalently bonded together.\n\n\nThe term “peptidomimetic” refers to a chemical compound designed to mimic a peptide, but which contains structural differences through the addition or replacement of one of more functional groups of the peptide in order to modulate its activity or other properties, such as solubility, metabolic stability, oral bioavailability, lipophilicity, permeability, etc. This can include replacement of the peptide bond, side chain modifications, truncations, additions of functional groups, etc. When the chemical structure is not derived from the peptide, but mimics its activity, it is often referred to as a “non-peptide peptidomimetic.”\n\n\nThe term “peptide bond” refers to the amide [—C(═O)—NH—] functionality with which individual amino acids are typically covalently bonded to each other in a peptide.\n\n\nThe term “protecting group” refers to any chemical compound that may be used to prevent a potentially reactive functional group, such as an amine, a hydroxyl or a carboxyl, on a molecule from undergoing a chemical reaction while chemical change occurs elsewhere in the molecule. A number of such protecting groups are known to those skilled in the art and examples can be found in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis,” Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. Wuts, editors, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 3\nrd \nedition, 1999 [ISBN 0471160199]. Examples of amino protecting groups include, but are not limited to, phthalimido, trichloroacetyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, and adamantyloxycarbonyl. In some embodiments, amino protecting groups are carbamate amino protecting groups, which are defined as an amino protecting group that when bound to an amino group forms a carbamate. In other embodiments, amino carbamate protecting groups are allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), tertbutoxycarbonyl (Boc) and α,α-dimethyl-3,5-dimethoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Ddz). For a recent discussion of newer nitrogen protecting groups: Theodoridis, G. Tetrahedron 2000, 56, 2339-2358. Examples of hydroxyl protecting groups include, but are not limited to, acetyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), trityl (Trt), tert-butyl, and tetrahydropyranyl (THP). Examples of carboxyl protecting groups include, but are not limited to methyl ester, tert-butyl ester, benzyl ester, trimethylsilylethyl ester, and 2,2,2-trichloroethyl ester.\n\n\nThe term “solid phase chemistry” refers to the conduct of chemical reactions where one component of the reaction is covalently bonded to a polymeric material (solid support as defined below). Reaction methods for performing chemistry on solid phase have become more widely known and established outside the traditional fields of peptide and oligonucleotide chemistry.\n\n\nThe term “solid support,” “solid phase” or “resin” refers to a mechanically and chemically stable polymeric matrix utilized to conduct solid phase chemistry. This is denoted by “Resin,” “P-” or the following symbol:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of appropriate polymer materials include, but are not limited to, polystyrene, polyethylene, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol grafted or covalently bonded to polystyrene (also termed PEG-polystyrene, TentaGel™, Rapp, W.; Zhang, L.; Bayer, E. In Innovations and Persepctives in Solid Phase Synthesis, Peptides, Polypeptides and Oligonucleotides; Epton, R., Ed.; SPCC Ltd.: Birmingham, UK; p 205), polyacrylate (CLEAR™), polyacrylamide, polyurethane, PEGA [polyethyleneglycol poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) co-polymer, Meldal, M. Tetrahedron Lett, 1992, 33, 3077-3080], cellulose, etc. These materials can optionally contain additional chemical agents to form cross-linked bonds to mechanically stabilize the structure, for example polystyrene cross-linked with divinylbenezene (DVB, usually 0.1-5%, preferably 0.5-2%). This solid support can include as non-limiting examples aminomethyl polystyrene, hydroxymethyl polystyrene, benzhydrylamine polystyrene (BHA), methylbenzhydrylamine (MBHA) polystyrene, and other polymeric backbones containing free chemical functional groups, most typically, —NH\n2 \nor —OH, for further derivatization or reaction. The term is also meant to include “Ultraresins” with a high proportion (“loading”) of these functional groups such as those prepared from polyethyleneimines and cross-linking molecules (Barth, M.; Rademann, J. J. Comb. Chem. 2004, 6, 340-349). At the conclusion of the synthesis, resins are typically discarded, although they have been shown to be able to be reused such as in Frechet, J. M. J.; Hague, K. E. Tetrahedron Lett. 1975, 16, 3055.\n\n\nIn general, the materials used as resins are insoluble polymers, but certain polymers have differential solubility depending on solvent and can also be employed for solid phase chemistry. For example, polyethylene glycol can be utilized in this manner since it is soluble in many organic solvents in which chemical reactions can be conducted, but it is insoluble in others, such as diethyl ether. Hence, reactions can be conducted homogeneously in solution, then the product on the polymer precipitated through the addition of diethyl ether and processed as a solid. This has been termed “liquid-phase” chemistry.\n\n\nThe term “linker” when used in reference to solid phase chemistry refers to a chemical group that is bonded covalently to a solid support and is attached between the support and the substrate typically in order to permit the release (cleavage) of the substrate from the solid support. However, it can also be used to impart stability to the bond to the solid support or merely as a spacer element. Many solid supports are available commercially with linkers already attached.\n\n\nAbbreviations used for amino acids and designation of peptides follow the rules of the IUPAC-IUB Commission of Biochemical Nomenclature in J. Biol. Chem. 1972, 247, 977-983. This document has been updated: Biochem. J., 1984, 219, 345-373; Eur. J. Biochem., 1984, 138, 9-37; 1985, 152, 1; Internat. J. Pept. Prot.

Extensions to the rules were published in the JCBN/NC-IUB Newsletter 1985, 1986, 1989; see Biochemical Nomenclature and Related Documents, 2nd edition, Portland Press, 1992, pp 68-69.\n\n\nThe term “effective amount” or “effective” is intended to designate a dose that causes a relief of symptoms of a disease or disorder as noted through clinical testing and evaluation, patient observation, and/or the like, and/or a dose that causes a detectable change in biological or chemical activity. The detectable changes may be detected and/or further quantified by one skilled in the art for the relevant mechanism or process. As is generally understood in the art, the dosage will vary depending on the administration routes, symptoms and body weight of the patient but also depending upon the compound being administered.\n\n\nAdministration of two or more compounds “in combination” means that the two compounds are administered closely enough in time that the presence of one alters the biological effects of the other. The two compounds can be administered simultaneously (concurrently) or sequentially. Simultaneous administration can be carried out by mixing the compounds prior to administration, or by administering the compounds at the same point in time but at different anatomic sites or using different routes of administration. The phrases “concurrent administration”, “administration in combination”, “simultaneous administration” or “administered simultaneously” as used herein, means that the compounds are administered at the same point in time or immediately following one another. In the latter case, the two compounds are administered at times sufficiently close that the results observed are indistinguishable from those achieved when the compounds are administered at the same point in time.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutically active metabolite” is intended to mean a pharmacologically active product produced through metabolism in the body of a specified compound.\n\n\nThe term “solvate” is intended to mean a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate form of a specified compound that retains the biological effectiveness of such compound.

An isolated compound refers to a compound that, in some embodiements, comprises at least 10%, at least 25%, at least 50% or at least 70% of the compounds of a mixture. In some embodiments, the compound, pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or pharmaceutical composition containing the compound exhibits a statistically significant binding and/or antagonist activity when tested in biological assays at the human ghrelin receptor.\n\n\nIn the case of compounds, salts, or solvates that are solids, it is understood by those skilled in the art that the inventive compounds, salts, and solvates may exist in different crystal or polymorphic forms, all of which are intended to be within the scope of the present invention and specified formulas.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I, II and/or III disclosed herein have asymmetric centers. The inventive compounds may exist as single stereoisomers, racemates, and/or mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers. All such single stereoisomers, racemates, and mixtures thereof are intended to be within the scope of the present invention. In particular embodiments, however, the inventive compounds are used in optically pure form. The terms “S” and “R” configuration as used herein are as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E, Fundamentals of Stereochemistry (Pure Appl. Chem. 1976, 45, 13-30.)\n\n\nUnless otherwise depicted to be a specific orientation, the present invention accounts for all stereoisomeric forms. The compounds may be prepared as a single stereoisomer or a mixture of stereoisomers. The non-racemic forms may be obtained by either synthesis or resolution. The compounds may, for example, be resolved into the component enantiomers by standard techniques, for example formation of diastereomeric pairs via salt formation. The compounds also may be resolved by covalently bonding to a chiral moiety. The diastereomers can then be resolved by chromatographic separation and/or crystallographic separation. In the case of a chiral auxiliary moiety, it can then be removed. As an alternative, the compounds can be resolved through the use of chiral chromatography. Enzymatic methods of resolution could also be used in certain cases.\n\n\nAs generally understood by those skilled in the art, an “optically pure” compound is one that contains only a single enantiomer. As used herein, the term “optically active” is intended to mean a compound comprising at least a sufficient excess of one enantiomer over the other such that the mixture rotates plane polarized light. Optically active compounds have the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. The excess of one enantiomer over another is typically expressed as enantiomeric excess (e.e.). In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes “d” and “l” or (+) and (−) are used to denote the optical rotation of the compound (i.e., the direction in which a plane of polarized light is rotated by the optically active compound). The “l” or (−) prefix indicates that the compound is levorotatory (i.e., rotates the plane of polarized light to the left or counterclockwise) while the “d” or (+) prefix means that the compound is dextrarotatory (i.e., rotates the plane of polarized light to the right or clockwise). The sign of optical rotation, (−) and (+), is not related to the absolute configuration of the molecule, R and S.\n\n\nA compound of the invention having the desired pharmacological properties will be optically active and, can be comprised of at least 90% (80% e.e.), at least 95% (90% e.e.), at least 97.5% (95% e.e.) or at least 99% (98% e.e.) of a single isomer.\n\n\nLikewise, many geometric isomers of double bonds and the like can also be present in the compounds disclosed herein, and all such stable isomers are included within the present invention unless otherwise specified. Also included in the invention are tautomers and rotamers of formula I, II and/or III.\n\n\nThe use of the following symbols at the right refers to substitution of one or more hydrogen atoms of the indicated ring\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwith the defined substituent R.\n\n\n\nThe use of the following symbol indicates a single bond or an optional double bond: ═\n\n\nEmbodiments of the present invention further provide intermediate compounds formed through the synthetic methods described herein to provide the compounds of formula I, II and/or III. The intermediate compounds may possess utiltity as a therapeutic agent for the range of indications described herein and/or a reagent for further synthesis methods and reactions.\n\n\n2. Synthetic Methods\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I, II and/or II can be synthesized using traditional solution synthesis techniques or solid phase chemistry methods. In either, the construction involves four phases: first, synthesis of the building blocks comprising recognition elements for the biological target receptor, plus one tether moiety, primarily for control and definition of conformation. These building blocks are assembled together, typically in a sequential fashion, in a second phase employing standard chemical transformations. The precursors from the assembly are then cyclized in the third stage to provide the macrocyclic structures. Finally, the post-cyclization processing fourth stage involving removal of protecting groups and optional purification provides the desired final compounds. Synthetic methods for this general type of macrocyclic structure are described in Intl. Pat. Appls, WO 01/25257, WO 2004/111077, WO 2005/012331 and WO 2005/012332, including purification procedures described in WO 2004/111077 and WO 2005/012331.\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the present invention, the macrocyclic compounds of formula I, II and/or III may be synthesized using solid phase chemistry on a soluble or insoluble polymer matrix as previously defined. For solid phase chemistry, a preliminary stage involving the attachment of the first building block, also termed “loading,” to the resin must be performed. The resin utilized for the present invention preferentially has attached to it a linker moiety, L. These linkers are attached to an appropriate free chemical functionality, usually an alcohol or amine, although others are also possible, on the base resin through standard reaction methods known in the art, such as any of the large number of reaction conditions developed for the formation of ester or amide bonds. Some linker moieties for the present invention are designed to allow for simultaneous cleavage from the resin with formation of the macrocycle in a process generally termed “cyclization-release.” (van Maarseveen, J. H. Solid phase synthesis of heterocycles by cyclization/cleavage methodologies. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 1998, 1, 185-214; Ian W. James, Linkers for solid phase organic synthesis. Tetrahedron 1999, 55, 4855-4946; Eggenweiler, H.-M. Linkers for solid-phase synthesis of small molecules: coupling and cleavage techniques. \nDrug Discovery Today\n 1998, 3, 552-560; Backes, B. J.; Ellman, J. A. Solid support linker strategies. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997, 1, 86-93. Of particular utility in this regard for compounds of the invention is the 3-thiopropionic acid linker. (Hojo, H.; Aimoto, S. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1991, 64, 111-117; Zhang, L.; Tam, J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 3311-3320.)\n\n\nSuch a process provides material of higher purity as only cyclic products are released from the solid support and minimal contamination with the linear precursor occurs as would happen in solution phase. After sequential assembly of all the building blocks and tether into the linear precursor using known or standard reaction chemistry, base-mediated intramolecular attack on the carbonyl attached to this linker by an appropriate nucleophilic functionality that is part of the tether building block results in formation of the amide or ester bond that completes the cyclic structure as shown (Scheme 1). An analogous methodology adapted to solution phase can also be applied as would likely be preferable for larger scale applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this description accurately represents the pathway for one of the methods of the present invention, the thioester strategy, another method of the present invention, that of ring-closing metathesis (RCM), proceeds through a modified route where the tether component is actually assembled during the cyclization step. However, in the RCM methodology as well, assembly of the building blocks proceeds sequentially, followed by cyclization (and release from the resin if solid phase). An additional post-cyclization processing step is required to remove particular byproducts of the RCM reaction, but the remaining subsequent processing is done in the same manner as for the thioester or analogous base-mediated cyclization strategy.\n\n\nMoreover, it will be understood that steps including the methods provided herein may be performed independently or at least two steps may be combined. Additionally, steps including the methods provided herein, when performed independently or combined, may be performed at the same temperature or at different temperatures without departing from the teachings of the present invention.\n\n\nNovel macrocyclic compounds of the present invention include those formed by a novel process including cyclization of a building block structure to form a macrocyclic compound comprising a tether component described herein. Accordingly, the present invention provides methods of manufacturing the compounds of the present invention comprising (a) assembling building block structures, (b) chemically transforming the building block structures, (c) cyclizing the building block structures including a tether component, (d) removing protecting groups from the building block structures, and (e) optionally purifiying the product obtained from step (d). In some embodiments, assembly of the building block structures may be sequential. In further embodiments, the synthesis methods are carried out using traditional solution synthesis techniques or solid phase chemistry techniques.\n\n\nA. Amino Acids\n\n\nAmino acids, Boc- and Fmoc-protected amino acids and side chain protected derivatives, including those of N-methyl and unnatural amino acids, were obtained from commercial suppliers [for example Advanced ChemTech (Louisville, Ky., USA), Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland), ChemImpex (Wood Dale, Ill., USA), Novabiochem (subsidiary of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), PepTech (Burlington, Mass., USA), Synthetech (Albany, Oreg., USA)] or synthesized through standard methodologies known to those in the art. Ddz-amino acids were either obtained commercially from Orpegen (Heidelberg, Germany) or Advanced ChemTech (Louisville, Ky., USA) or synthesized using standard methods utilizing Ddz-OPh or Ddz-N\n3\n. (Birr, C.; Lochinger, W.; Stahnke, G.; Lang, P. The α,α-dimethyl-3,5-dimethoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Ddz) residue, an N-protecting group labile toward weak acids and irradiation. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1972, 763, 162-172.) Bts-amino acids were synthesized by known methods. (Vedejs, E.; Lin, S.; Klapara, A.; Wang, J. “Heteroarene-2-sulfonyl Chlorides (BtsCl, ThsCl): Reagents for Nitrogen Protection and >99% Racemization-Free Phenylglycine Activation with SOCl\n2\n.” J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 9796-9797. Also WO 01/25257, WO 2004/111077) N-Alkyl amino acids, in particular N-methyl amino acids, are commercially available from multiple vendors (Bachem, Novabiochem, Advanced ChemTech, ChemImpex). In addition, N-alkyl amino acid derivatives were accessed via literature methods. (Hansen, D. W., Jr.: Pilipauskas, D. J. Org. Chem. 1985, 50, 945-950.)\n\n\nB. Tethers\n\n\nTethers were obtained from the methods previously described in Intl. Pat. Appl. WO 01/25257, WO 2004/111077, WO 2005/012331 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/622,055 60/622,005. Procedures for synthesis of tethers as described herein are presented in the Examples below. Exemplary tethers (T) include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nand intermediates in the manufacture thereof, wherein (Z) is the site of a covalent bond of T to Z\n2\n, Z\n5 \nor Z\n10 \nand Z\n2\n, Z\n5 \nand Z\n10 \nare defined above for formula I, II and III, respectively, and wherein (X) is the site of a covalent bond of T to X, X\n2 \nor X\n3 \nand X, X\n2 \nand X\n3 \nare defined above for formula I; II and III, respectively, L\n7 \nis —CH\n2\n— or —O—; U\n1 \nis —CR\n101\nR\n102\n— or —C(═O)—; R\n100 \nis lower alkyl; R\n101\n, and R\n102 \nare each independently hydrogen, lower alkyl or substituted lower alkyl; xx is 2 or 3; yy is 1 or 2; zz is 1 or 2; and aaa is 0 or 1.\n\n\n\nC. Solid Phase Techniques\n\n\nSpecific solid phase techniques for the synthesis of the macrocyclic compounds of the invention have been described in WO 01/25257, WO 2004/111077, WO 2005/012331 and WO 2005/012332. Solution phase synthesis routes, including methods amenable to larger scale manufacture, were described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. Nos. 60/622,055 60/622,005 and 60/642,271.\n\n\nIn certain cases, however, the lability of protecting groups precluded the use of the standard basic medium for cyclization in the thioester strategy discussed above. In these cases, either of two acidic methods was employed to provide macrocyclization under acid conditions. One method utilized HOAc, while the other method employed HOAt (Scheme 2). For example, the acetic acid cyclization was used for compound 219.\n\n\nAfter executing the deprotection of the Ddz or Boc group on the tether, the resin was washed sequentially with DCM (2×), DCM-MeOH (1:1, 2×), DCM (2×), and DIPEA-DCM (3:7, 1×). The resin was dried under vacuum for 10 min, then added immediately to a solution of HOAc in degassed DMF (5% v/v). The reaction mixture was agitated at 50-70° C. O/N. The resin was filtered, washed with THF, and the combined filtrate and washes evaporated under reduced pressure (water aspirator, then oil pump) to afford the macrocycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a representative macrocycle with tether Tl, AA\n3\n=Leu, AA\n2\n=Leu, AA\n1\n=Phe, the application of the HOAt method shown in \nScheme\n 2 provided the cyclic peptidomimetic in 10% yield, while the acetic acid method was more effective, and gave 24% overall yield of the same macrocycle. This latter methodology was particularly effective for compounds containing His(Mts) residues. For example, with tether T8, AA\n3\n=Phe, AA\n2\n=Acp, AA,=His(Mts), the macrocycle was obtained in 20% overall yield, although the majority of the product no longer had the Mts group on histidine (15:1 versus still protected).\n\n\nSynthesis of representative macrocyclic compounds of the present invention are shown in the Examples below. Table 1A below presents a summary of the synthesis of 224 representative compounds of the present invention. The reaction methodology employed for the construction of the macrocyclic molecule is indicated in \nColumn\n 2 and relates to the particular scheme of the synthetic strategy, for example, use of the thioester strategy as shown in \nFIG. 2\n or the RCM approach as shown in \nFIG. 3\n. \nColumn\n 3 indicates if any substituents are present on N\nBB1\n. Columns 4-6 and 8 indicate the individual building blocks employed for each compound, amino acids, hydroxy acids or tether utilizing either standard nomenclature or referring to the building block designations presented elsewhere in this application. \nColumn\n 7 indicates the method used for attachment of the tether, either a Mitsunobu reaction (previously described in WO 01/25257) or reductive amination (previously described in WO 2004/111077). The relevant deprotection and coupling protocols as appropriate for the nature of the building block are performed utilizing standard procedures and those described in WO 2004/111077 for the assembly of the cyclization precursors. The building blocks are listed in the opposite order from which they are added in order to correlate the building block number with standard peptide nomenclature. Hence BB\n3 \nis added first, followed by BB\n2\n, then BB\n1\n, finally the tether (T). In the case of the RCM, the tether is not formed completely until the cyclization step, but the portion of the tether attached to BB\n1 \nis still added at this stage of the sequence, unless it is already part of that building block. The final macrocycles are obtained after application of the appropriate deprotection sequences. If any reaction was required to be carried out post-cyclization, it is listed in \nColumn\n 9. All of the macrocycles presented in Table 1A were purified and met internal acceptance criteria. Yields (Column 10) are either isolated or as calculated based upon CLND analysis. It should be noted that compounds 58 and 99 were not cyclized and represent the linear analogues of \ncompounds\n 10 and 133, respectively. The lack of binding potency observed with these linear analogues illustrates the importance of the macrocyclic structural feature for the desired activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE

For Table 1B, the reaction methodology employed for the construction of the macrocyclic molecule is indicated in \nColumn\n 2 and relates to the particular scheme of the synthetic strategy. Columns 3-6 indicate the individual building blocks employed for each compound, amino acids or tether utilizing either standard nomenclature or referring to the building block designations presented elsewhere in this application. \nColumn\n 7 indicates the method used for attachment of the tether. The building blocks are listed in the opposite order from which they are added in order to correlate the building block number with standard peptide nomenclature. \nColumn\n 8 indicates if any additional reaction chemistry was applied, such as to remove auxiliary protection or to reduce a double bond (as was performed with many RCM intermediate products). All of the macrocycles in Tables 1B and 1C were purified and met the acceptance criteria. Yields (Column 9-10) are either isolated or as calculated based upon CLND analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis of Representative Compounds of the

Such methods can be conducted in a high throughput manner to permit the simultaneous evaluation of many compounds.\n\n\nSpecific assay methods for the human (GHS-R1a), swine and rat GHS-receptors (U.S. Pat. No. 6,242,199, Intl. Pat. Appl. Nos. WO 97/21730 and 97/22004), as well as the canine GHS-receptor (U.S. Pat. No. 6,645,726), and their use in generally identifying agonists and antagonists thereof are known.\n\n\nAppropriate methods for determining the functional activity of compounds of the present invention that interact at the human ghrelin receptor are also described below.\n\n\nA. Competitive Radioligand Binding Assay (Ghrelin Receptor)\n\n\nThe competitive binding assay at the human growth hormone secretagogue receptor (hGHS-R1a) was carried out analogously to assays described in the literature. (Bednarek M A et al. Structure-function studies on the new growth hormone-releasing peptide ghrelin: minimal sequence of ghrelin necessary for activation of growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a; J. Med.

On the test day, compounds were allowed to thaw at rt O/N and then diluted in assay buffer according to the desired test concentrations. Under these conditions, the maximal final DMSO concentration in the assay was 0.1%.\n\n\nAssay Protocol\n\n\nIn deep-well plates, 220 μL of diluted cell membranes (final concentration: 0.71 μg/well) were combined with 40 μL of either binding buffer (total binding, N=5), 1 μM ghrelin (non-specific binding, N=3) or the appropriate concentration of test compound (N=2 for each test concentration). The reaction was initiated by addition of 40 μL of [\n125\nI]-ghrelin (final conc. 0.0070-0.0085 nM) to each well. Plates were sealed with TopSeal-A, vortexed gently and incubated at rt for 30 min. The reaction was arrested by filtering samples through Multiscreen Harvest plates (pre-soaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine) using a Tomtec Harvester, washed 9 times with 500 μL of cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4, 4° C.), and then plates were air-dried in a fumehood for 30 min. A bottom seal was applied to the plates prior to the addition of 25 μL of MicroScint-0 to each well. Plates were than sealed with TopScal-A and counted for 30 sec per well on a TopCount Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence Counter (PerkinElmer) using a count delay of 60 sec. Results were expressed as counts per minute (cpm).\n\n\nData were analyzed by GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.) using a variable slope non-linear regression analysis. K; values were calculated using a K\nd \nvalue of 0.01 nM for [\n125\nI]-ghrelin (previously determined during membrane characterization).\n\n\nD\nmax \nvalues were calculated using the following formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nD\n \nmax\n \n \n=\n \n \n1\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntest\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nconcentration\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nwith\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nmaximal\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \ndisplacement\n \n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnon\n \n⁢\n \n \n-\n \n \n⁢\n \nspecific\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nbinding\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntotal\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nbinding\n \n \n-\n \n \nnon\n \n⁢\n \n \n-\n \n \n⁢\n \nspecific\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nbinding\n \n \n \n \n×\n \n100\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere total and non-specific binding represent the cpm obtained in the absence or presence of 1 μM gltrelin, respectively.\n\n\n\nBinding activity at the gherlin receptor for representative compounds of the present invention is shown below in Table 3A through 3E.

Aequorin Functional Assay (Ghrelin Receptor)\n\n\n\nThe functional activity of compounds of the invention found to bind to the GHS-R1a receptor can be determined using the method described below which can also be used as a primary screen for ghrelin receptor activity in a high throughput fashion. (LePoul, E.; et al. Adaptation of aequorin functional assay to high throughput screening. J. Biomol. Screen. 2002, 7, 57-65; Bednarek, M. A.; et al. Structure-function studies on the new growth hormone-releasing peptide ghrelin: minimal sequence of ghrelin necessary for activation of growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a. J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 4370-4376; Palucki, B. L.; et al. Spiro(indoline-3,4′-piperidine) growth hormone secretagogues as ghrelin mimetics. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001, 11, 1955-1957.)\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\nMembranes were prepared using AequoScreen™ (EUROSCREEN, Belgium) cell lines expressing the human ghrelin receptor (cell line ES-410-A; receptor accession #60179). This cell line is typically constructed by transfection of the human ghrelin receptor into CHO—K1 cells co-expressing G\nα16 \nand the mitochondrially targeted Aequorin (Ref #ES-WT-A5).\n\n \n \n1. Ghrelin (reference agonist; Bachem, #H-4864)\n \n2. Assay buffer: DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium) containing 0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumin; pH 7.0).\n \n3. Coelenterazine (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands).\n\n\nFinal test concentrations (N=8) for compounds of the invention: 10, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 μM.\n\n\nCompound Handling\n\n \n\n\nStock solutions of compounds (10 mM in 100% DMSO) were provided frozen on dry ice and stored at −20° C. prior to use. From the stock solution, mother solutions were made at a concentration of 500 μM by 20-fold dilution in 26% DMSO. Assay plates were then prepared by appropriate dilution in DMEM medium containing 0.1% BSA. Under these conditions, the maximal final DMSO concentration in the assay was <0.6%.\n\n\nCell Preparation\n\n\nAequoScreen™ cells were collected from culture plates with Ca\n2+ \nand Mg\n2+\n-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 5 mM EDTA, pelleted for 2 min at 1000×g, re-suspended in DMEM—Ham's F12 containing 0.1% BSA at a density of 5×10\n6 \ncells/mL, and incubated O/N at rt in the presence of 5 μM coelenterazine. After loading, cells were diluted with assay buffer to a concentration of 5×10\n5 \ncells/mL.\n\n\nAssay Protocol\n\n\nFor agonist testing, 50 μL of the cell suspension was mixed with 50 μL of the appropriate concentration of test compound or ghrelin (reference agonist) in 96-well plates (duplicate samples). Ghrelin (reference agonist) was tested at several concentrations concurrently with the test compounds in order to validate the experiment. The emission of light resulting from receptor activation in response to ghrelin or test compounds was recorded using the Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 reader (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., Japan).\n\n\nAnalysis and Expression of Results\n\n\nResults were expressed as Relative Light Units (RLU). Concentration response curves were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.) by non-linear regression analysis (sigmoidal dose-response) based on the equation E=E\nmax\n/(1+EC\n50\n/C)n where E was the measured RLU value at a given agonist concentration (C), E\nmax \nwas the maximal response, EC\n50 \nwas the concentration producing 50% stimulation and n was the slope index. For agonist testing, results for each concentration of test compound were expressed as percent activation relative to the signal induced by ghrelin at a concentration equal to the EC\n80 \n(i.e. 3.7 nM). EC\n50\n, Hill slope and % E\nmax \nvalues are reported.\n\n\nThe data show that the representative compounds examined act as agonists at the ghrelin receptor and are devoid of antagonist activity at the concentrations studied. In addition, these compounds were demonstrated to have high selectivity for the ghrelin receptor versus its closest counterpart, the motilin receptor, with which it has 52% sequence homology. (Feighner, S. D.; Tan, C. P.; McKee, K. K.; Palyha, O. C.; Hreniuk, D. L.; Pong, S.-S.; Austin, C. P.; Figueroa, D.; MacNeil, D.; Cascieri, M. A.; Nargund, R.; Bakshi, R.; Abramovitz, M.; Stocco, R.; Kargman, S.; O'Neill, G.; van der Ploeg, L. H. T.; Evans, J.; Patchett, A. A.; Smith, R. G.; Howard, A. D. Receptor for motilin identified in the human gastrointestinal system. Science 1999, 284, 2184-2188.) The endogenous peptides themselves have 36% of residues in common and ghrelin was even identified at one point as motilin-related peptide. (Tomasetto, C.; Karam, S. M.; Ribieras, S.; Masson, R.; Lefebvre, O.; Staub, A.; Alexander, G.; Chenard, M. P.; Rio, M. C. Identification and characterization of a novel gastric peptide hormone: the motilin-related peptide. Gastroenterology 2000, 119, 395-405.) Ghrelin does not interact appreciably at the motilin receptor, although GHRP-6 does. (Depoortere, I.; Thijs, T.; Thielemans, L.; Robberecht, P.; Peeters, T. L. Interaction of the growth hormone-releasing peptides ghrelin and growth hormone-releasing peptide-6 with the motilin receptor in the rabbit gastric antrum. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 305, 660-667.) On the other hand, motilin itself as been demonstrated to have some GH-releasing effects. (Samson, W. K.; Lumpkin, M. D.; Nilayer, G.; McCann, S. M. Motilin: a novel growth hormone releasing agent. Brain Res. Bull. 1984, 12, 57-62.)\n\n\nThe level of agonist activity and selectivity for representative compounds of the invention are shown below in Table 4.

Cell Culture Assay for Growth Hormone Release\n\n\n\nCell culture assays for determining growth hormone release can be employed as described in Cheng, et al. Endocrinology 1989, 124, 2791-2798. In particular, anterior pituitary glands are obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats and placed in cold culture medium. These pituitaries are sectioned, for example into one-eighth sections. then digested with trypsin. Cells are collected after digestion, pooled, and transferred into 24 well plates (minimum 200,000 cells per well). After a monolayer of cells has formed, generally after at least 4 d in culture, the cells are washed with medium prior to exposure to the test samples and controls. Varying concentrations of the test compounds and of ghrelin as a positive control were added to the medium. The cells are left for 15 min at 37° C., then the medium removed and the cells stored frozen. The amount of GH release was measured utilizing a standard radioimmunoassay as known to those in the art.\n\n\nD.

Analytical detection of parent compound in plasma samples performed by LC-MS after an appropriate preparation protocol: extraction using solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges (Oasis MCX, Oasis HLB) or liquid-liquid extraction.\n\n\nHPLC-MS Method\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nColumn: Atlantis dC18 from Waters 2.1×30 mm\n\n\nMobile Phases:\n\n\nA: 95% McOH, 5% water, 0.1% TFA\n\n\nB: 95% water. 5% MeOH, 0.1% TFA\n\n\nFlow: 0.5 mL/min\n\n\nGradient (linear):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime(min)\n\n\nA\n\n\n \nB\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n30%\n\n\n70%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n30%\n\n\n70%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n100% \n\n\n 0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n100% \n\n\n 0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n30%\n\n\n70%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n30%\n\n\n70%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analyte was quantitated based upon a standard curve and the method validated with internal standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetic Parameters for Representative Compounds of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCom-\n\n\nMode of\n\n\nElimination\n\n\nClearance\n\n\nBioavailability\n\n\n\n\n\n\npound\n\n\nAdministration\na \n \n\n\n(t\n1/2\n, min) \n\n\n(mL/min/kg)\n\n\n(oral)\nb\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n31\n\n\n67\n\n\nna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n298\n\n\ni.v.\n\n\n75\n\n\n17\n\n\nna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n298\n\n\ns.c.\n\n\n66\n\n\n15\n\n\nna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n298\n\n\np.o.\n\n\n312\n\n\n14\n\n\n29%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\ni.v. = intravenous (10 time points over 150 min); s.c. = subcutaneous (10 time points over 360 min), p.o. = oral (10 time points over 240 min)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\nna = not applicable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults of the time courses for these studies are provided in \nFIGS. 6A-6D\n.\n\n\nE. Gastric Emptying\n\n\nTo examine the effects of compounds of the invention in a model for gastroparesis, compounds were evaluated for possible effects on gastric emptying in fasted rats. For example, \n \ncompounds\n \n 25 and 298 at 100 μg/kg caused a significant increase (≧30%) in gastric emptying relative to the vehicle control group. The relative efficacy (39% increase) of \n \ncompounds\n \n 25 and 298 at 100 μg/kg i.v. was similar to concurrently run positive reference agents GHRP-6 at 20 μg/kg i.v. (40% increase) and metoclopramide at 10 mg/kg I.v. (41% increase). Accordingly, compounds 25 and 298 at a dose of 100 μg/kg demonstrated gastrokinetic activity in rats, with efficiency similar to GHRP-6 at 20 μg/kg and metoclopramide at 10 mg/kg. Further, \ncompound\n 25 also demonstrated gastric emptying at 30 μg/kg. This is significantly more potent than other compounds interacting at this receptor previously found to enhance GI motility, which were unable to promote gastric emptying at 100 μg/kg (U.S. Pat. No. 6,548,501).\n\n\nTest Substances and Dosing Pattern\n\n\nGHRP-6 and test samples were dissolved in vehicle of 9% HPBCD/0.9% NaCl. Immediately following oral administration of methylcellulose (2%) containing phenol red (0.05%) (2 mL/rat), test substances or vehicle (9% HPBCD/0.9% NaCl) were each administered intravenously (i.v.) at a dosing volume of 5 mL/kg.\n\n\nAnimals\n\n\nMale Wistar rats were provided by LASCO (A Charles River Licensee Corporation, Taiwan). Space allocation for 6 animals was 45×23×15 cm. Animals were housed in APEC® cages and maintained in a controlled temperature (22° C.-24° C.) and humidity (60%-80%) environment with 12 h light, 12 h dark cycles for at least one week in the laboratory prior to being used. Free access to standard lab chow for rats (Lab Diet, Rodent Diet, PMI Nutrition International, USA) and tap water was granted. All aspects of this work including housing, experimentation and disposal of animals were performed in general accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., 1996).\n\n\nChemicals\n\n\nGlucose (Sigma, USA), Metoclopramide-HCl (Sigma, USA), Methylcellulose (Sigma, USA), NaOH (Sodium Hydroxide, Wako, Japan), Pyrogen free saline (Astar, Taiwan), Phenol Red-Sodium salt (Sigma, USA) and Trichloroacetic acid (Merck, USA).\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\n8-well strip (Costar, USA), 96-well plate (Costar, USA), Animal case (ShinTeh, R. O. C.), Centrifugal separator (Kokusan, H-107, Japan), Glass syringe (1 mL, 2 mL, Mitsuba, Japan), Hypodermic needle (25G×1″, TOP Corporation, Japan), Microtube (Treff, Switzerland), pH-meter (Hanna, USA), Pipetman (P100, Gilson, France), Pipette tips (Costar, USA), Rat oral needle (Natsume, Japan), Spectra Fluor plus (Austria), Stainless scissors (Klappencker, Germany) and Stainless forceps (Klappencker, Germany).\n\n\nAssay\n\n\nTest substances were each administered intravenously to a group of 5 O/N-fasted Wistar derived male rats weighing 200±20 g immediately after methylcellulose (2%) containing phenol red (0.05%) was administered orally at 2 mL/animal. The animals were then sacrificed 15 minutes later. The stomach was immediately removed, homogenized in 0.1 N NaOH (5 mL) and centrifuged. Following protein precipitation by 20% trichloroacetic acid (0.5 mL) and re-alkalization of the supernatant with 0.1 N NaOH, total phenol red remaining in the stomach was determined by a colorimetric method at 560 nm. A 30 percent or more (≧30%) increase in gastric emptying, detected as the decrease in phenol red concentration in the stomach relative to the vehicle control group, is considered significant.\n\n\nResults for two representative compounds of the invention are shown in \nFIG. 7\n and in the Examples below.\n\n\nF. Gastric Emptying and Intestinal Transit in Rat Model of Postoperative Ileus\n\n\nThis clinically relevant model for POI is adapted from that of Kalff. (Kalff, J. C.; Schraut, W. H.; Simmons, R. L.; Bauer, A. J. Surgical manipulation of the gut elicits an intestinal muscularis inflammatory response resulting in postsurgical ileus. Ann. Surg 1998, 228, 652-663.) Other known models can also be used to study the effect of compounds of the invention. (Trudel, L.; Bouin, M.; Tomasetto, C.; Eberling, P.; St-Pierre, S.; Barron, P.; L'Heureux,M. C.; Poitras, P. Two new peptides to improve post-operative gastric ileus in dog. Peptides 2003, 24, 531-534; (b) Trudel, L.; Tomasetto, C.; Rio. M. C.; Bouin, M.; Plourde, V.; Eberling, P.; Poitras, P. Ghrelin/motilin-related peptide is a potent prokinetic to reverse gastric postoperative ileus in rats. Am. J. Physiol. 2002, 282, G948-G952.)\n\n\nAnimals\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1. Rat. Sprague-Dawley, male, ˜300 g.\n\n\n2. Fasted O/N prior to study.\n\n\nInduction of Post-Operative Ileus (POI)\n\n\n\n1. Isofluorane anaesthesia under sterile conditions.\n\n\n2. Midline abdominal incision.\n\n\n3. Intestines and caecum were eviscerated and kept moist with saline.\n\n\n4. The intestines and caecum were manipulated along its entire length with moist cotton applicators analogous to the ‘running of the bowel’ in the clinical setting. This procedure was timed to last for 10 min.\n\n\n5. Intestines were gently replaced into the abdomen and the abdominal wound was stitched closed under sterile conditions.\n\n\nDosing\n\n\n\n1. Rat was allowed to recover from isofluorane anaesthesia.\n\n\n2. Test compounds (or vehicle) were administered intravenously via previously implanted jugular catheter.\n\n\n3. Immediate intragastric gavage of methylcellulose (2%) labeled with radioactive \n99m\nTc, t=0.\n\n\nExperimental\n\n\n\n1. At t=15 min, animal was euthanized with CO\n2\n.\n\n\n2. Stomach and 10 cm sections along the small intestine were immediately ligated, cut and placed in tubes for measuring of \n99m\nTc in gamma counter.\n\n\n3. Stomach emptying and small intestinal transit were measured by calculation of the geometric mean.\n\n\nGeometric mean=Σ(% total radioactivity×number of segment)/100\n\n\n\n\n\nResults are depicted in the graph in \nFIG. 8\n and indicate that \nCompound\n 298 at 100 μg/kg (i.v. n=5) significantly improves postoperative ileus in comparison to POI+vehicle treated rats. Further results are presented in the Examples below,\n\n\nG. Growth Hormone Response to Test Compounds\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention likewise can be tested in a number of animal models for their effect on GH release. For example, rats (Bowers, C. Y.; Momany, F.; Reynolds, G. A.; Chang, D.; Hong, A.; Chang, K. Endocrinology 1980, 106, 663-667), dogs (Hickey, G.; Jacks, T.; Judith, F.; Taylor, J.; Schoen, W. R.; Krupa, D.; Cunningham, P.; Clark, J.; Smith, R. G. \nEndocrinology\n 1994, 134, 695-701; Jacks, T.; Hickey, G.; Judith, F.; Taylor, J.; Chen, H.; Krupa, D.; Feeney, W.; Schoen, W. R.; Ok, D.; Fisher, M.; Wyvratt, M.; Smith, R. J. Endocrinology 1994, 143, 399-406; Hickey, G. J.; Jacks, T. M.; Schleim, K. D.; Frazier, E.; Chen, H. Y.; Krupa, D.; Feeney, W.; Nargund, R. P.; Patchett, A. A.; Smith, R. G. J. Endocrinol. 1997, 152, 183-192), and pigs (Chang, C. H.; Rickes, E. L.; Marsilio, F.; McGuire, L.; Cosgrove, S.; Taylor, J.; Chen, H. Y.; Feighner, S.; Clark, J. N.; Devita, R.; Schoen, W. R.; Wyvratt, M.; Fisher, M.; Smith, R. G.; Hickey, G. Endocrinology 1995, 136, 1065-1071; Peschke, B.; Hanse, B. S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999, 9, 1295-1298) have all been successfully utilized for the in vivo study of the effects of GHS and would likewise be applicable for investigation of the effect of ghrelin agonists on GH levels. The measurement of ghrelin of GH levels in plasma after appropriate administration of compounds of the invention can be performed using radioimmunoassay via standard methods known to those in the art. (Deghenghi, R.; et al. Life Sciences 1994, 54, 1321-1328.) Binding to tissue can be studied using whole body autoradiography after dosing of an animal with test substance containing a radioactive label. (Ahnfelt-Rønne, I.; Nowak, J.; Olsen, U. B. Do growth hormone-releasing peptides act as ghrelin secretagogues? \nEndocrine\n 2001, 14, 133-135.)\n\n\nThe following method is employed to determine the temporal pattern and magnitude of the growth hormone (GH) response to test compounds, administered either systemically or centrally. Results for \ncompound\n 298 demonstrating its lack of effect on GH release are presented in \nFIG. 9\n. \nCompound\n 25 gave similar results. Further results are presented in the Examples below.\n\n\nDosing and Sampling Procedures for In Vivo Studies of GH Release\n\n\nAdult male Sprague Dawley rats (225-300 g) were purchased from Charles River Canada (St. Constant, Canada) and individually housed on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle (lights on, time: 0600-1800) in a temperature (22±1° C.)- and humidity-controlled room. Purina rat chow (Ralston Purina Co., St. Louis, Mo.) and tap water were freely available. For these studies, chronic intracerebroventricular (icy) and intracardiac venous cannulas were implanted under sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, ip) anesthesia using known techniques. The placement of the icy cannula was verified by both a positive drinking response to icy carbachol (100 ng/110 μl) injection on the day after surgery and methylene blue dye at the time of sacrifice. After surgery, the rats were placed directly in isolation test chambers with food and water freely available until body weight returned to preoperative levels (usually within 5-7 d). During this time, the rats were handled daily to minimize any stress associated with handling on the day of the experiment. On the test day, food was removed 1.5 h before the start of sampling and was returned at the end. Free moving rats were iv injected with either test sample at various levels (3, 30, 300, 1000 μg/kg) or normal saline at two different time points during a 6-h sampling period. The \n \ntimes\n \n 1100 and 1300 were chosen because they reflect typical peak and trough periods of GH secretion, as previously documented. The human ghrelin peptide (5 μg, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Belmont, Calif.) was used as a positive control in the experiments and was diluted in normal saline just before use. To assess the central actions of test compounds on pulsatile GH release, a 10-fold lower dose of the test sample or normal saline was administered icy at the same time points, 1100 and 1300. Blood samples (0.35 mL) were withdrawn every 15 min over the 6-h sampling period (time: 1000-1600) from all animals. To document the rapidity of the GH response to the test compound, an additional blood sample was obtained 5 min after each injection. All blood samples were immediately centrifuged, and plasma was separated and stored at −20° C. for subsequent GH assay. To avoid hemodynamic disturbance, the red blood cells were resuspended in normal saline and returned to the animal after removal of the next blood sample. All animal studies were conducted under procedures approved by an animal care oversight committee.\n\n\nGH Assay Method\n\n\nPlasma GH concentrations were measured in duplicate by double antibody RIA using materials supplied by the NIDDK Hormone Distribution Program (Bethesda, Md.). The averaged plasma GH values for 5-6 rats per group are reported in terms of the rat GH reference preparation. The standard curve was linear within the range of interest; the least detectable concentration of plasma GH under the conditions used was approximately 1 ng/mL. All samples with values above the range of interest were reassayed at dilutions ranging from 1:2 to 1:10. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were acceptable for duplicate samples of pooled plasma containing a known GH concentration.\n\n\n4. Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThe macrocyclic compounds of the present invention or pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof according to the invention may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions of various dosage forms. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, one or more compounds, including optical isomers, enantiomers, diastereomers, racemates or stereochemical mixtures thereof, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as the active ingredient is intimately mixed with appropriate carriers and additives according to techniques known to those skilled in the art of pharmaceutical formulations.\n\n\nA pharmaceutically acceptable salt refers to a salt form of the compounds of the present invention in order to permit their use or formulation as pharmaceuticals and which retains the biological effectiveness of the free acids and bases of the specified compound and that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Examples of such salts are described in Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use, Wermuth, C. G. and Stahl, P. H. (eds.), Wiley-Verlag Helvetica Acta, Züirich, 2002 [ISBN 3-906390-26-8]. Examples of such salts include alkali metal salts and addition salts of free acids and bases.

Illustrative examples of suitable salts include organic salts derived from amino acids such as glycine, lysine and arginine; ammonia; primary, secondary, and tertiary amines such as ethylenediamine, N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethanolamine, choline, and procaine, and cyclic amines, such as piperidine, morpholine, and piperazine; as well as inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum, and lithium.\n\n\nThe carriers and additives used for such pharmaceutical compositions can take a variety of forms depending on the anticipated mode of administration. Thus, compositions for oral administration may be, for example, solid preparations such as tablets, sugar-coated tablets, hard capsules, soft capsules, granules, powders and the like, with suitable carriers and additives being starches, sugars, binders, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, disintegrating agents and the like. Because of their ease of use and higher patient compliance, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage forms for many medical conditions.\n\n\nSimilarly, compositions for liquid preparations include solutions, emulsions, dispersions, suspensions, syrups, elixirs, and the like with suitable carriers and additives being water, alcohols, oils, glycols, preservatives, flavoring agents, coloring agents, suspending agents, and the like. Typical preparations for parenteral administration comprise the active ingredient with a carrier such as sterile water or parenterally acceptable oil including polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, lecithin, arachis oil or sesame oil, with other additives for aiding solubility or preservation may also be included. In the case of a solution, it can be lyophilized to a powder and then reconstituted immediately prior to use. For dispersions and suspensions, appropriate carriers and additives include aqueous gums, celluloses, silicates or oils.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions according to embodiments of the present invention include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, inhalation (e.g., via an aerosol) buccal (e.g., sub-lingual), vaginal, topical (i.e., both skin and mucosal surfaces, including airway surfaces), transdermal administration and parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, intraarticular, intrapleural, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intracerebral, intracranially, intraarterial, or intravenous), although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature of the particular active agent which is being used.\n\n\nCompositions for injection will include the active ingredient together with suitable carriers including propylene glycol-alcohol-water, isotonic water, sterile water for injection (USP), emulPhorm™-alcohol-water, cremophor-EL™ or other suitable carriers known to those skilled in the art. These carriers may be used alone or in combination with other conventional solubilizing agents such as ethanol, propylene glycol, or other agents known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nWhere the macrocyclic compounds of the present invention are to be applied in the form of solutions or injections, the compounds may be used by dissolving or suspending in any conventional diluent. The diluents may include, for example, physiological saline, Ringer's solution, an aqueous glucose solution, an aqueous dextrose solution, an alcohol, a fatty acid ester, glycerol, a glycol, an oil derived from plant or animal sources, a paraffin and the like. These preparations may be prepared according to any conventional method known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nCompositions for nasal administration may be formulated as aerosols, drops, powders and gels. Aerosol formulations typically comprise a solution or fine suspension of the active ingredient in a physiologically acceptable aqueous or non-aqueous solvent. Such formulations are typically presented in single or multidose quantities in a sterile form in a sealed container. The sealed container can be a cartridge or refill for use with an atomizing device. Alternatively, the sealed container may be a unitary dispensing device such as a single use nasal inhaler, pump atomizer or an aerosol dispenser fitted with a metering valve set to deliver a therapeutically effective amount, which is intended for disposal once the contents have been completely used. When the dosage form comprises an aerosol dispenser, it will contain a propellant such as a compressed gas, air as an example, or an organic propellant including a fluorochlorohydrocarbon or fluorohydrocarbon.\n\n\nCompositions suitable for buccal or sublingual administration include tablets, lozenges and pastilles, wherein the active ingredient is formulated with a carrier such as sugar and acacia, tragacanth or gelatin and glycerin.\n\n\nCompositions for rectal administration include suppositories containing a conventional suppository base such as cocoa butter.\n\n\nCompositions suitable for transdermal administration include ointments, gels and patches.\n\n\nOther compositions known to those skilled in the art can also be applied for percutaneous or subcutaneous administration, such as plasters.\n\n\nFurther, in preparing such pharmaceutical compositions comprising the active ingredient or ingredients in admixture with components necessary for the formulation of the compositions, other conventional pharmacologically acceptable additives may be incorporated, for example, excipients, stabilizers, antiseptics, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, lubricants, sweetening agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, isotonicity agents, buffering agents, antioxidants and the like. As the additives, there may be mentioned, for example, starch, sucrose, fructose, dextrose, lactose, glucose, mannitol, sorbitol, precipitated calcium carbonate, crystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, dextrin, gelatin, acacia, EDTA, magnesium stearate, talc, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium metabisulfite, and the like.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the composition is provided in a unit dosage form such as a tablet or capsule.\n\n\nIn further embodiments, the present invention provides kits including one or more containers comprising pharmaceutical dosage units comprising an effective amount of one or more compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides prodrugs comprising the compounds described herein. The term “prodrug” is intended to mean a compound that is converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis or metabolically to a specified compound that is pharmaceutically active. The “prodrug” can be a compound of the present invention that has been chemically derivatized such that, (i) it retains some, all or none of the bioactivity of its parent drug compound, and (ii) it is metabolized in a subject to yield the parent drug compound. The prodrug of the present invention may also be a “partial prodrug” in that the compound has been chemically derivatized such that, (i) it retains some, all or none of the bioactivity of its parent drug compound, and (ii) it is metabolized in a subject to yield a biologically active derivative of the compound. Known techniques for derivatizing compounds to provide prodrugs can be employed. Such methods may utilize formation of a hydrolyzable coupling to the compound.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides that the compounds of the present invention may be administered in combination with a therapeutic agent used to prevent and/or treat metabolic and/or endocrine disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disorders, obesity and obesity-associated disorders, central nervous system disorders, genetic disorders, hyperproliferative disorders and inflammatory disorders.

Standard Procedure for the Synthesis of Tether T9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep T9-1: To a solution of 2-iodophenol (9-0, 200 g, 0.91 mol, 1.0 eq) in DMF (DriSolv®, 560 mL) is added \nsodium hydride\n 60% in mineral oil (3.64 g, 0.091 mol, 0.1 eq) by portions (hydrogen is seen to evolve). The reaction is heated for 1 h at 100° C. under nitrogen, then ethylene carbonate is added and the reaction mixture heated O/N at 100° C. The reaction is monitored by TLC (conditions: 25/75 EtOAc/hex; R\nf\n: 0.15. detection: UV, CMA). The reaction mixture is allowed to cool, then the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The residual oil is diluted in Et\n2\nO (1.5 L), then washed sequentially with 1 N sodium hydroxide (3×) and brine (2×), dried with MgSO\n4\n, filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product is distilled under vacuum (200 μm Hg) at 110-115° C. to provide 9-1.\n\n\nStep T9-2: A solution of 9-1 (45.1 g, 0.171 mol, 1.0 eq) and Ddz-propargylamine (9-A, synthesized by standard protection procedures, 59.3 g, 0.214 mol, 1.25 eq) in acetonitrile (DriSolv®, 257 mL) was degassed by passing argon through the solution for 10-15 min. To this was added Et\n3\nN (85.5 mL, stirred O/N with CaH\n2\n, then distilled) and the mixture was again purged by bubbling with argon, this time for 5 min. Recrystallized copper (I) iodide (1.14 g, 0.006 mol, 0.035 eq) and trans-dichloro-bis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (II) (Strem Chemicals, 3.6 g, 0.0051 mol, 0.03 eq) are added and the reaction mixture stirred for 4 h under argon at rt. After 5-10 min, the reaction mixture turned black. The reaction was monitored by TLC (conditions: 55/45 EtOAc/hex). When complete, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure until dryness, then the residual oil diluted with 1 L of a 15% DCM in Et\n2\nO solution. The organic phase is washed with citrate buffer pH 4-5 (3×), saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (2×), and brine (1×), then dried with MgSO\n4\n, filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product thus obtained is purified by a dry pack column starting with 30% EtOAc/Hex (4-8 L) then increasing by 5% EtOAc increments until 55% EtOAc/Hex to give 9-2 as a brown syrup (yield: 65.8 g, 93.2%).\n\n\nStep T9-3: To a solution of Ddz-amino-alcohol 9-2 (65.8 g, 0.159 mol, 1.0 eq) in 95% ethanol under nitrogen was added Platinum (IV) oxide (3.6 g, 0.016 mol, 0.1 eq) and then hydrogen gas bubbled into the solution for 2 h.

To a suspension of MePPh\n3\nBr (30.2 g, 84.5 mmol, 2.2 eq) in THF (200 mL) was added t-BuOK in portions (9.5 g, 84.5 mmol, 2.2 eq) and the resulting mixture stirred at rt for 2 h during which time the solution became yellow. The reaction mixture was cooled to −78° C., B4-2 [6.3 g, 38.4 mmol, 1.0 eq (based on the theoretical yield)] added over 10 min, then the mixture stirred O/N at rt. The reaction was monitored by TLC [EtOAc/hexanes (50:50); detection: UV, CMA; R\nf\n=0.33]. A saturated NH\n4\nCl (aq) solution was added and the resulting aqueous phase extracted with EtOAc (3×). The combined organic phase was dried over MgSO\n4\n, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (EtOAc/hexanes, 40:60) to give T\nB4 \nas a yellow oil.

For solid phase methods, all yields are reported starting from 300-325 mg of PS-aminomethyl resin (loading 2.0 mmol/g) unless otherwise noted. Attachment of the first building block, BB\n3\n, varies from 100% to 55% for the more difficult residues, typically sterically crowded structures such as Ile or Val. The remaining couplings for BB\n2 \nand BB, proceed in an average yield of 80-90%. Attachment of the tether using the Mitsunobu reaction yields from 50-90% of the desired linear precursor. The macrocyclization itself proceeds in an average yield of 20-50%. Minimal loss of yield occurs in post-cyclization processing.\n\n\nAll the retention time values presented herein are based on the UV portion of the HPLC data. In the HPLC procedure, ELSD and CLND data (not listed) were also procured to further assess purity of the final products, and for quantification (CLND).

To a solution of macrocyclic precursor LS3-13 (78.4 mmol based on LS3-12, 1.0 eq) in anhydrous THF (1.57 L, 50 mM) were added DIPEA (68.0 mL, 392 mmol, 7.0 eq) and DEPBT (25.8 g, 86.2 mmol, 1.1 eq). The mixture was stirred at room temperature 16-18 h. The reaction was monitored by TLC [MeOH/AcOEt (1:9); R\nf\n=0.38; detection: UV and CMA]. At the end of the reaction, significant quantities of DIPEA salts were in suspension in the solution. Prior to evaporation, these salts were filtered and washed with THF to avoid excessive bumping of the solution during evaporation. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the residue taken up in an aqueous solution of Na\n2\nCO\n3 \n(1 M, 500 mL) and AcOEt (250 mL). The separated basic aqueous phase was extracted with AcOEt (2×250 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with brine (2×250 mL), dried over MgSO\n4\n, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude material so obtained was purified by flash chromatography [AcOEt:MeOH, gradient (100:0) to (90:10)] to give \nmacrocycle compound\n 298 as a pale yellow solid (35.0 g. 83%, 2 steps).\n\n\nLC/MS (Grad_A4): t\nR\n=6.19 min\n\n\nStep LS3-15.

The separated basic aqueous phase was extracted with AcOEt (2×50 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with brine (1×50 mL), dried over MgSO\n4\n, filtered and evaporated under vacuum. The oily residue was dissolved in a minimum amount of AcOEt, then hexanes was added until a white precipitate formed.

Similar procedures can be applied for other compounds of the invention.\n\n\nAs an alternative, the t-butyl ester of Cpg (LS3-14), produced under standard conditions, can be utilized as was described in Step LS3-4 to provide alkylated Cpg LS3-15 by reaction with Cbz-T33a. This species, without protection of the secondary amine on LS3-16 (produced by standard acid deprotection of the t-butyl ester of LS3-15), then undergoes chemoselective coupling with dipeptide LS3-10 to prepare LS3-17. Straightforward simultaneous hydrogenolysis of both Cbz and benzyl protecting groups then leads to intermediate LS3-13 in a more efficient approach that avoids two steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep LS3-17. To the hydrochloride salt of carboxylic acid LS3-16 (2.1 g, 4.41 mmol, 1.0 eq) and LS3-10 (1.7 g, 4.59 mmol, 1.05 eq) in anhydrous THF/CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(1:1, 22 mL) at 0° C. were added DIPEA (5.3 mL, 30.6 mmol, 7.0 eq) and HATU (1.7 g, 4.59 mmol, 1.05 eq).

To measure the potency of \ncompound\n 298 agonist activity at hGHS-R1a.\n\n\nKey Aspects of Method\n\n\n\n1. Assay performed on CHO—Kl cells expressing the transfected, cloned human ghrelin receptor (hGHS-R1a) and G\nα16\n.\n\n\n2. Suspended cells incubated O/N with coelenterazine.\n\n\n3. Stimulation of hGHS-R1a activates G\nα16\n, causing intercellular Ca2+ release which ultimately leads to the oxidation of coelenterazine and the emission of a quantitative luminescent signal.\n\n\n4.

Compound 298 (i.v.) Effect on Growth Hormone (GH) Release in Conscious, Freely-Moving Rats.\n\n\nGhrelin (and analogues thereof) is known to potently stimulate GH release from the pituitary in various species including rat following intravenous dosing.\n\n\nObjectives\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. To determine whether \ncompound\n 298 stimulates GH release in rat.\n\n\n2. To determine whether \ncompound\n 298 modulates ghrelin-induced GH release in rat.\n\n\nMethod\n\n\n\n1. Model adapted from Tannenbaum et al. (2003), Endocrinology 144:967-974.\n\n\n2. Rats implanted with chronic, intravenous (i.v.) cannulae.\n\n\n3. Rats allowed to move freely even while dosing drug or sampling blood to minimize stress-induced changes in GH release.\n\n\n4. \nCompound\n 298 administered at GH peak and trough levels to measure:\n        \n \na. Stimulatory effect, if any, on GH release; and\n \nb. Whether any stimulatory effect is sustained with repeated dosing.\n \n\n\n\n\n5. Blood samples are drawn at defined, 15-minute intervals throughout the test day and growth hormone (GH) measured directly by radioimmunoassay.\n\n\n6. \nCompound\n 298 tested at 3, 30, 300, 1000 μg/kg (i.v., N=5-6/rats per group).\n\n\n7. Ghrelin (positive control) tested at 5 μg (i.v.).\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCompound\n 298 at doses up to 1000 μg/kg causes no significant difference in pulsatile GH release in comparison to vehicle controls (see \nFIG. 9\n for effects of 30 μg/kg and 300 μg/kg doses). Ghrelin at a dose of 5 μg causes a significant increase in GH release when dosed at both peak and trough levels (positive control). \nCompound\n 298 dosed 10 min. prior to ghrelin neither inhibits nor augments ghrelin-induced GH release (\nFIG. 12\n). As a secondary indicator of GH release, the effects of \ncompound\n 298 on the levels of IGF-1 were also examined at the 1000 μg/kg dose. No appreciable changes in IGF-1 levels from control upon treatment with \ncompound\n 298 were observed.\n\n\n4. \nCompound\n 298 Effect on hGHS-R1a Receptor Desensitization\n\n\nG-protein coupled receptors can undergo receptor desensitization upon agonist stimulation, where the degree of receptor desensitization is partly characteristic of the agonist. Lesser receptor desensitization is desirable because this correlates with lesser development of tolerance with chronic use of drug. This factor, among others, has been implicated in the poor clinical performance of GHS.\n\n\nObjective\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. To determine the extent to which \nCompound\n 298 causes desensitization of the ghrelin receptor (human clone, hGHS-R1a).\n\n\nMethod\n\n\n\n1. Studies by FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader, Molecular Devices).\n\n\n2. Assay performed on HEK293 cells expressing hGHS-R1a.\n\n\n3. \nCompound\n 298 agonist potency was measured using duplicate samples over a 12-point concentration curve; EC\n50 \nfor \ncompound\n 298 established.\n\n\n4. In a separate experiment, cells expressing hGHS-R1a are exposed to a range of concentrations of compound 298 (1, 10, 100, 1000 nM) for 3 minutes. \nCompound\n 298 washed out, then cells treated with a concentration of ghrelin (EC\n100\n) that elicits maximal stimulation at non-desensitized receptors.\n\n\n5. A DC\n50 \nvalue is calculated. The DC\n50 \nvalue is defined as the pre-treatment concentration of \ncompound\n 298 that desensitizes the ghrelin (EC\n100\n) response by 50%.\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCompound\n 298 is a full agonist (EC\n50\n=5 nM; \nFIG. 13A\n). Increasing pre-treatment concentrations of \ncompound\n 298 desensitize the maximal response to EC\n100 \nghrelin (DC\n50\n=32 nM; \nFIG. 13B\n). The DC\n50 \nvalue is >6-fold less potent than the EC\n50 \nvalue, thus compound 298 stimulates the receptor more potently than it desensitizes the receptor. \nCompound\n 298 desensitizes the receptor ˜10-fold less potently than other ghrelin agonists (i.e. ghrelin peptide and the GHS capromorelin [Pfizer]; \nFIG. 13C\n).\n\n\n \nCompound\n 298 has a favorable desensitization profile since it (1) stimulates the receptor 6-fold more potently that it desensitizes the receptor and (2) elicits desensitization at a 10-fold lower potency than the endogenous ligand (i.e. ghrelin) and alternate, small-molecule ghrelin agonists. Accordingly, \ncompound\n 298 may elicit less tolerance than alternate ghrelin agonists with chronic dosing.\n\n\n5. \nCompound\n 298 Effect on Gastric Emptying of a Solid Meal in Naïve Rat\n\n\nObjectives\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. To ascertain data for \ncompound\n 298 as a prokinetic agent with potent effects on gastric emptying, a model for gastroparesis.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n1. Overnight-fasted rats (male, Wistar, ˜200 g, N=5/group) were given a meal of methylcellulose (2%) by intragastric gavage. The meal was labeled with phenol red (0.05%).\n\n\n2. Test articles (i.e, vehicle, \ncompound\n 298, metoclopramide, etc.) were administered by intravenous injection immediately after meal.\n\n\n3. Animals were sacrificed 15 minutes later; the stomach was immediately removed and homogenized in 0.1 N NaOH and centrifuged.\n\n\n4. Total phenol red remaining in the stomach was quantified by a colorimetric method at 560 nm.\n\n\n5. A >30% increase in gastric emptying, detected based on the phenol red concentration in comparison to the control group, is considered significant.\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetoclopramide (marketed gastroparesis product), ghrelin and GHRP-6 (reference peptide agonists at hGHS-R1a) all demonstrated significant gastric emptying (\nFIG. 14A\n). \nCompound\n 298 caused significant gastric emptying in a dose-dependent manner with ˜100-fold superior potency to metoclopramide (\nFIG. 14B\n). \nCompound\n 298 potently stimulated gastric emptying of a solid meal in naïve rats with a 100-fold superior potency to metoclopramide, a currently used drug with prokinetic activity.\n\n\n6. Effect of \nCompound\n 298 in the Treatment of Post-Operative Ileus in Rat\n\n\nObjective\n\n\nTo measure the therapeutic utility of \ncompound\n 298 in a rat model of post-operative ileus (POI).\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Model adapted from Kälff et al. (1998), Ann Surg 228: 652-63.\n\n\n2. Rats (male, Sprague-Dawley, 250-300 g) were implanted with jugular vein catheters to accommodate dosing of test articles.\n\n\n3. Rats were fasted O/N, anesthetized with isofluorane and subjected to abdominal surgery.\n\n\n4. Following an abdominal incision, the small intestine caecum and large intestine were eviscerated for a period of 15 min and kept moist with saline.\n\n\n5. A “running of the bowel” was performed, a clinically-relevant manipulation of the intestines characterized by first pinching the upper small intestine and continuing this manipulation down through the large intestine.\n\n\n6. Rats are allowed a 15 min recovery beginning after the disappearance of any effects of the isofluorane anesthesia.\n\n\n7. Rats are dosed with vehicle or compound 298 (30, 100, or 300 μg/kg, i.v., N=6/gp) followed by intragastric gavage of \n99m\nTc methylcellulose (2%) meal.\n\n\n8. After 15 min, the rats were euthanized and the stomach and consecutive 10 cm segments of the intestine were isolated. Radioactivity (\n99m\nTc) in each tissue isolate was measured as a means of measuring the transit of the meal.\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \nFIG. 15\n, the distribution of the bars indicates the distribution of the meal in the stomach (‘ST’) and consecutive 10 cm segments of the small intestine at 15 min post-oral gavage. Abdominal surgery coupled with a running of the bowel caused a significant ileus in rats as determined by comparison of the naïve (i.e. unoperated) and POI treatment groups. \nCompound\n 298 significantly increased gastric emptying and intestinal transit at test concentrations of 100 and 300 μg/kg (i.v.). The data corresponding to the 100 μg/kg dose is presented in \nFIG. 15\n. At 100 μg/kg (i.v.). compound 298 significantly promoted GI transit by 2.7× as measured by the geometric center of the meal in comparison to the POI+vehicle treatment group. \nCompound\n 298 significantly improved gastric emptying and intestinal transit in rats with post-operative ileus. \nCompound\n 298 can effectively treat an existing, post-surgical ileus; thus, prophylactic use prior to surgery is not required as is the case for opioid antagonists in clinical development.\n\n\n7. The Effect of Compounds of the Invention on Gastric Emptying and Gastrointestinal Transit in a Model of Opioid-Delayed Gastric Emptying\n\n\nOpioid analgesics, such as morphine, are well known to delay gastrointestinal transit which is an important side-effect for this class of drugs. The clinical term for this syndrome is opioid bowel dysfunction (OBD). Importantly, patients recovering from abdominal surgery experience post-operative ileus that is further exacerbated by concomitant opioid therapy for post-surgical pain.\n\n\nObjective\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1. To determine whether compounds of the invention may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of OBD.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n1. Rats (male, Sprague-Dawley, 250-300 g) are implanted with jugular vein catheters to accommodate dosing of test articles.\n\n\n2. Overnight-fasted rats are administered morphine (3 mg/kg s.c.).\n\n\n3. After 30 min, rats are to be dosed with vehicle or compound 298 (300 or 1000 μg/kg, i.v., n=4-to-6/gp) followed by intragastric gavage of \n99m\nTc methylcellulose (2%) meal,\n\n\n4. After 15 min, the rats are euthanized and the stomach and consecutive 10 cm segments of the intestine are isolated, Radioactivity (\n99m\nTc) in each tissue isolate is measured as a means of measuring the transit of the meal.\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\nMorphine (3 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly delayed gastric emptying and intestinal transit in rats (\nFIG. 16A\n). Opioid-delayed gastrointestinal transit was effectively reversed in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with compound 298 (i.v.) (\nFIG. 16B\n).\n\n\n8. Metabolic Stability in Human Plasma\n\n\nDrugs are susceptible to enzymatic degradation in plasma through the action of various proteinases and esterases. Thus, plasma stability is often performed as a metabolic screen in the early phases of drug discovery. The aim of this study was to measure the metabolic stability of compounds of the invention in human plasma.\n\n\nExperimental Method\n\n\nThe stability of \ncompound\n 298 in human plasma at 37° C. has been measured at 2 and 24 h. Two forms of \ncompound\n 298 have been studied: free amine and corresponding HCl salt. Also, the stability of \ncompound\n 298 has been established in plasma alone and in plasma buffered with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) where the ratio of plasma to phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) is 20:1. Assays were both performed and analyzed in triplicate samples. \nCompound\n 298 was extracted from plasma matrix using an SPE technique (Oasis MCX cartridge). Sample analysis is done using LC-MS in APCI\n+ \nmode. The level of \ncompound\n 298 in plasma samples is compared to the level of \ncompound\n 298 in a spiked sample stored at −60° C. from the same pool of plasma. Results are presented as a percent recovery of \ncompound\n 298.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent Recovery of \nCompound\n 298 Following Incubation in Human\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasma (37° C.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFree Amine +\n\n\n \n\n\nHCl Salt +\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFree amine\n\n\nPBS\n\n\n \nHCl Salt\n \n \nPBS\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n24\n\n\n2\n\n\n24\n\n\n2\n\n\n24\n\n\n2\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHours\n\n\nHours\n\n\nHours\n\n\nHours\n\n\nHours\n\n\nHours\n\n\nHours\n\n\nHours\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTriplicates\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAssay #\n1\n\n\n101.0\n\n\n105.5\n\n\n98.3\n\n\n97.9\n\n\n100.2\n\n\n96.6\n\n\n102.9\n\n\n97.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAssay #\n2\n\n\n100.3\n\n\n95.6\n\n\n100.4\n\n\n100.8\n\n\n99.1\n\n\n104.3\n\n\n97.4\n\n\n101.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAssay #\n3\n\n\n101.3\n\n\n100.9\n\n\n98.3\n\n\n101.9\n\n\n101.6\n\n\n102.3\n\n\n99.4\n\n\n98.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean\n\n\n100.9\n\n\n100.7\n\n\n99.0\n\n\n100.2\n\n\n100.3\n\n\n101.1\n\n\n99.9\n\n\n99.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeviation\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSD\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Table 8, \ncompound\n 298 is stable in human plasma at 37° C. for at least 24 hours independent of compound form (i.e. free amine or salt) or whether or not the plasma samples are pH buffered with PBS.\n\n\n9. \nCompound\n 298 Interaction Profile at Nine Human Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Subtypes\n\n\nCompound 298 (0.0457 to 100 μM) has minimal inhibitory activity at all cyp450 enzymes tested, except cyp3A4, and has moderate inhibitory activity at cyp3A4. The inhibitory activity observed for \ncompound\n 298 at cyp3A4 was not anticipated to be physiologically relevant based on the low doses of \ncompound\n 298 required for therapeutic activity. Also, there was no indication that \ncompound\n 298 would undergo a drug-drug interaction with opioid analgesics that may be co-administered to POI patients.\n\n\n10. \nCompound\n 298 Profile in hERG Channel Inhibition\n\n\nCompound 298 (1, 10 μM) had no significant effect on hERG channel function in comparison to vehicle (0.1% DMSO) controls. E-4031 (positive control) completely inhibited hERG channel currents at 500 nM.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5  \n\n\nGastroparesis Animal Model\n\n\nHigh caloric meals are well known to impede gastric emptying. This observation has recently been exploited by Megens, A. A.; et al. (unpublished) to develop a rat model for delayed gastric emptying as experienced in gastroparesis.\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1. Wistar rats, male, 200-250 g\n\n\n2. Chocolate test meal: 2 mL Clinutren ISO® (1.0 kcal/mL, Nestle S A, Vevey Switzerland)\n\n\nMethod\n\n\n\n\n\nThe test meal is given to the subjects by oral gavage at time=0. After 60 min, the subjects are sacrificed, the stomachs excised and the contents weighed. Untreated animals experienced a significant delay in gastric emptying as denoted by the higher residual stomach content.\n\n\nTest compounds were administered intravenously as aqueous solutions, or solutions in normal saline, at time=0 at three dose levels (0.08 mg/kg; 0.30-0.31 mg/kg, 1.25 mg/kg). When necessary, for example compounds 21, 299 and 415, 10% cyclodextrin (CD) was added to solubilize the material. Test compounds examined utilizing subcutaneous injection are administered at time=−30 min. Four to five (4-5) rats were tested per group, except in the case of the cyclodextrin control in which ten (10) rats comprised the group.\n\n\nResults are reported as percentage relative to the stomach weight for injection only of solvent as a control as shown in \nFIGS. 17A and 17B\n and illustrate the gastric emptying capability of the compounds of the present invention. These results are applicable for the utility of these compounds for the prevention and/or treatment of gastroparesis and/or post-operative ileus.\n\n\nThe foregoing is illustrative of the present invention, and is not to be construed as limiting thereof. The invention is defined by the following claims, with equivalents of the claims to be included therein."

Chromosomal abnormalities involving band 1q21-q23 are among the most frequent genetic lesions in both B cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Among non-Hodgkin's lymphoma subtypes, translocation breakpoints at 1q21-q23, including translocations and duplications, have been reported, often as the single chromosomal abnormality in follicular and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLCL) in marginal-zone B cell lymphoma and in Burkitt lymphoma.\n\n\nBy cloning the breakpoints of a t(1:14)(q21:q32) chromosomal translocation in a myeloma cell line, two genes were identified, termed immunoglobulin superfamily receptor translocation associated (IRTA) 1 and IRTA2. IRTA2 is identical to sequences identified as BXMAS1 (Nakayama et al., \nBiochm. Biophys. Res. Commun. \n285:830-7, 2001) and FcRH5 (Davis et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n98:9772-7, 2001). Both IRTA1 and IRTA2 are members of a family of related genes, the IRTA.\n\n\nIRTA2 is a cell surface receptor with homologies to the Fc receptor families. It is normally expressed in mature B cells, and has a different distribution in peripheral lymphoid organs than IRTA1: IRTA1 is expressed in marginal zone B cells, while IRTA2 is also expressed in germinal center centrocytes and in immunoblasts. IRTA2 expression is deregulated in multiple myeloma and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines with 1q21 abnormalities (see Miller et al., \nBlood \n99:2662-2669, 2002). The high frequency of involvement of 1q21 structural rearrangements in B cell malignancies suggests that IRTA1 and IRTA2 are critical to the pathogenesis of these diseases (see published PCT Application No. WO 01/38490).\n\n\nImmunotherapy is a potent new weapon against cancer. Immunotherapy involves evoking an immune response against cancer cells based on their production of target antigens. Immunotherapy based on cell-mediated immune responses involves generating a cell-mediated response to cells that produce particular antigenic determinants, while immunotherapy based on humoral immune responses involves generating specific antibodies to cells that produce particular antigenic determinants. Recombinant toxins are chimeric proteins in which a cell targeting moiety is fused to a toxin (Pastan et al., \nScience, \n254:1173-1177, 1991). If the cell targeting moiety is the Fv portion of an antibody, the molecule is termed a recombinant immunotoxin (Chaudhary et al. \nNature, \n339:394-397, 1989). The toxin moiety is genetically altered so that it cannot bind to the toxin receptor present on most normal cells. Recombinant immunotoxins selectively kill cells which are recognized by the antigen binding domain. There remains a need for recombinant toxins which can be used to treat cancer, including B cell malignancies.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies that specifically bind the extracellular domain of IRTA2 are disclosed herein. In one embodiment, these antibodies do not specifically bind IRTA1, IRTA3, IRTA4, or IRTA5. Antibodies that bind IRTA2 can be conjugated to effector molecules, including detectable labels, radionucleotides, toxins and chemotherapeutic agents. These antibodies are of use to detect B cell malignancies, such as hairy cell leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These antibodies are also of use to treat B cell malignancies that express IRTA2, such as hairy cell leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n\nThe foregoing and other features and advantages will become more apparent from the following detailed description of several embodiments, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n \nFIG. 1A\n is a schematic representation of the recombinant IRTA proteins and the plasmids construction. A pair of expression plasmids was generated for each IRTA: one encodes full-length protein under cytomegalovirus (CMV)-promoter of pcDNA3, the other encodes the extracellular domain with human IgG1 Fc as a fusion protein in the same vector. IRTAs possess three to nine immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains at the extracellular domains shown by circles. They can be classified into four groups based on their homology (Davis et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n2001; 98:9772-7; Davis et al., \nImmunol Rev \n2002; 190:123-36), which are shown in different patterns of shading of the circles. To construct the plasmids encoding full-length IRTAs, DNA fragments shown as parenthesis with the primer numbers (primers are listed in Table 2) were PCR-amplified from human spleen cDNA or Daudi cells cDNA. They were connected in tandem into pcDNA3 vector using restriction enzymes shown. To make plasmids for Fc-fusion proteins, DNA fragments that code for extracellular domains including their own leader sequences were amplified and inserted into pcDNA3 vector with NotI-XbaI cDNA fragments that code for human Fc. \nFIG. 1B\n is a digital image of an SDS-PAGE of IRTA-Fc fusion proteins. Two μgs of each IRTA-Fc fusion protein was separated on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions. Proteins were visualized with Coomassie-blue staining. Bands of Fc-fusion proteins were seen with expected sizes.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 2A-B\n are a bar graph and a set of plots showing the cross-reactivity of the anti-IRTA2 MAbs to other IRTA family members. \nFIG. 2A\n is a bar graph of the results from an ELISA of anti-IRTA2 MAbs to various Fc-fusion proteins. Each Fc-fusion protein indicated on the top of the column was captured on ELISA plates using secondary antibody (goat anti-human IgG). After washing, 100 ng/50 μl/well of MAbs were added, followed by HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and TMBZ substrate. The signals in ELISA were normalized for the amounts of each Fc-fusion protein on the plates using HRP-goat anti-human Fc. The controls are MAbs 9E10 (anti-myc tag, IgG1), BerH2 (anti-CD30, IgG1), T408 (anti-CD30, IgG2a), T420 (anti-CD30, IgG2b) and HRP-goat anti-human Fc (1/2400 dilution). \nFIG. 2B\n is a set of plots of a FACS analysis of selected anti-IRTA2 MAbs using 293T cells transfected with plasmids coding IRTAs or CD30. Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested and incubated with 200 ng/100 μl of each MAb, followed by PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2. Each panel shows the histogram versus log fluorescence (solid line) with the negative control (shed peak) without 1st antibodies. In the positive control panels, the MAbs cross-reactive to other IRTAs were used. They are F26 (anti-IRTA1 and anti-IRTA2, IgG2b), F109 (anti-IRTA3, IgG2b), F47 (anti-IRTA4, IgG2a), and F69 (anti-IRTA5, IgG2a). BerH2 (anti-CD30, IgG1) was also used. “+” indicates more than 1.5-fold than that of the control; “++” indicates more than 10-fold mean fluorescence intensity than that of the negative control.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 3A-B\n are digital images illustrating the use of the anti-IRTA2 MAbs for immunofluorescence and Western blotting. \nFIG. 3A\n is a digital image showing immunofluorescence by the use of anti-IRTA2 MAb F56. 293T cells that were transfected with IRTA2 or CD30 plasmids were detached, combined in a 1:1 ratio, and seeded into chamber slides. The next day, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and incubated with a mixture of anti-IRTA2 MAb F56 (IgG1) and anti-CD30 MAb Ki-1 (IgG3) at 10 μg/ml. As the secondary reagents, a mixture of Alexa 488-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG1 and Alexa 555-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG3 was used (1:1000 dilution). Nuclei in the field were stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml). CD30 and F56 (anti-IRTA2) staining were observed with 555 nm filter and 488 nm, respectively. DAPI nuclei staining was detected by 460 nm filter. The merged image was created by a computer. \nFIG. 3B\n is a digital image of a Western blot analysis of anti-IRTA2 MAbs. Twenty ng of IRTA2-Fc and CD30-Fc fusion proteins were blotted on each strip after separation on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions. The proteins were probed with 10 μg/ml of each MAb or anti-CD30 MAb BerH-2, followed by alkaline phosphatase anti-mouse IgG. In the left blot, the Fc-fusion proteins were visualized using alkaline phosphatase anti-human Fc. Only the MAbs that reacted to the antigen in the blot (F20 and F25) are shown.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 4A-D\n are graphs, digital images, and a table showing the expression of IRTA2 on cell lines. \nFIG. 4A\n are plots of the results of FACS analysis of 19 human cell lines derived from hematological malignancies. Each cell was stained with anti-IRTA2 MAb F56 or MAb F119, or control mouse IgG1 or PE-labeled CD19. Some cells lines that are negative for CD19, were stained with other CD markers as indicated in each panel. Each panel shows the histogram versus log fluorescence (solid line) with the negative control (shaded peak) without primary antibodies. Eight out of 19 lines were stained with anti-IRTA2 MAbs, six of which were derived from B-NHL. \nFIG. 4B\n is a digital image of a RT-PCR analysis of the cell lines for transmembrane type IRTA2 mRNA expression. Primers in separate exons specific for the transmembrane type of IRTA2 (IRTA2c) and primers for β-actin as the control were used for 26 cycles of PCR reaction with cDNAs of each cell. The cDNAs from the cell lines positive for IRTA2 protein expression in FACS resulted in the expected 432-bp size of IRTA2 and cell lines negative in the FACS showed no band. The actin primers gave the same intensity of PCR product from cDNAs of all cell lines. \nFIG. 4C\n is a digital image of a Western blot analysis of selected cell lines. Total cell lysates of the indicated cell lines or purified IRTA2-Fc protein were separated in 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel under reducing condition. The proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed with F25 anti-IRTA2 MAb. Cell lines positive in the FACS showed the same 150-kDa size of bands as the recombinant IRTA2 expressed in the transfected cells. In contrast, cell lines negative in FACS showed no such bands. \nFIG. 4D\n is a table summarizing the IRTA2 expression verified by FACS, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. The IRTA2 expression detected by each method was well correlated with the other methods.\n\n\n \nFIG. 5A-B\n are plots showing the expression of IRTA2 on HCL cells. PBMCs from two HCL patients were separated by a density gradient using Ficoll-Paque and 3-color staining was performed with CD22-FITC/IRTA2-PE/CD20-PerCPCy5.5 mixture or CD103-FITC/IRTA2-PE/CD20-PerCPCy5.5 mixture. Fluorescence associated with live cells was analyzed by FACS Calibure. \nFIG. 5A\n is a set of plots showing the IRTA2-positive cells detected in the HCL patients were positive for CD20, CD22, and CD103, which are the markers of HCL cells. As shown in the histograms, 27% and 39% of PBMCs of \npatient #\n1 and \npatient #\n2 expressed IRTA2, respectively, when compared to background staining (shaded peaks). Most of IRTA-cells (red region) were CD22-/CD20- or CD103-/Cd20-(red dot-blot panels), whereas most IRTA+ cells (blue region) expressed both CD22 and CD20 or CD103 and CD20 (blue dot-blot panels). \nFIG. 5B\n is a set of plots showing CD20+/CD22+ or CD20+/CD103+ cells in PBMCs from the patient (HCL cells) expressed IRTA2. The cells stained either CD22-FITC/IRTA2-PE/CD20-PerCPCy5.5 or CD103-FITC/IRTA2-PE/CD20-PerCPCy5.5 were gated by CD20+/CD22+ or CD20+/CD103+, respectively (circles). The gated cells were shown in black lines in the histograms with background staining (shaded peaks). The histograms showed significant IRTA2 expression on CD20+/CD22+ or CD20+/CD103+ cells. The IRTA2 staining is inhibited by the presence of IRTA2-Fc antigen (red peak) but not by CD30-Fc (blue peak), indicating that IRTA2 staining is specific.\n\n\n \nFIG. 6\n is the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain of the variable regions of F119 (SEQ ID NO: 1), F56 (SEQ ID NO: 3) and F25 (SEQ ID NO: 5).

Terms\n\n\nUnless otherwise noted, technical terms are used according to conventional usage. Definitions of common terms in molecular biology may be found in Benjamin Lewin, \nGenes V\n, published by Oxford University Press, 1994 (ISBN 0-19-854287-9); Kendrew et al. (eds.), \nThe Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology\n, published by Blackwell Science Ltd., 1994 (ISBN 0-632-02182-9); and Robert A. Meyers (ed.), \nMolecular Biology and Biotechnology: a Comprehensive Desk Reference\n, published by VCH Publishers, Inc., 1995 (ISBN 1-56081-569-8).\n\n\nIn order to facilitate review of the various embodiments of this disclosure, the following explanations of specific terms are provided:\n\n\nAdministration: The introduction of a composition into a subject by a chosen route. For example, if the chosen route is intravenous, the composition is administered by introducing the composition into a vein of the subject.\n\n\nAmplification: Of a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a DNA or RNA molecule) refers to use of a technique that increases the number of copies of a nucleic acid molecule in a specimen. An example of amplification is the polymerase chain reaction, in which a biological sample collected from a subject is contacted with a pair of oligonucleotide primers, under conditions that allow for the hybridization of the primers to a nucleic acid template in the sample. The primers are extended under suitable conditions, dissociated from the template, and then re-annealed, extended, and dissociated to amplify the number of copies of the nucleic acid. The product of amplification may be characterized by electrophoresis, restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns, oligonucleotide hybridization or ligation, and/or nucleic acid sequencing using standard techniques. Other examples of amplification include strand displacement amplification, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,311; transcription-free isothermal amplification, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,881; repair chain reaction amplification, as disclosed in WO 90/01069; ligase chain reaction amplification, as disclosed in EP-A-320 308; gap filling ligase chain reaction amplification, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,930; and NASBA™ RNA transcription-free amplification, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,025,134.\n\n\nAnimal: Living multi-cellular vertebrate organisms, a category that includes, for example, mammals and birds. The term mammal includes both human and non-human mammals. Similarly, the term “subject” includes both human and veterinary subjects.\n\n\nAntibody: A polypeptide ligand comprising at least a light chain or heavy chain immunoglobulin variable region which specifically recognizes and binds an epitope of an antigen, such as IRTA2 or a fragment thereof. This includes intact immunoglobulins and the variants and portions of them well known in the art, such as Fab′ fragments, F(ab)′\n2 \nfragments, single chain Fv proteins (“scFv”), and disulfide stabilized Fv proteins (“dsFv”). A scFv protein is a fusion protein in which a light chain variable region of an immunoglobulin and a heavy chain variable region of an immunoglobulin are bound by a linker, while in dsFvs, the chains have been mutated to introduce a disulfide bond to stabilize the association of the chains. The term also includes genetically engineered forms such as chimeric antibodies (e.g., humanized murine antibodies), heteroconjugate antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies). See also, \nPierce Catalog and Handbook, \n1994-1995 (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill.); Kuby, J., \nImmunology, \n3\nrd \nEd., W.H. Freeman & Co., New York, 1997.\n\n\nTypically, a naturally occurring immunoglobulin has heavy (H) chains and light (L) chains interconnected by disulfide bonds. There are two types of light chain, lambda (λ) and kappa (k). There are five main heavy chain classes (or isotypes) which determine the functional activity of an antibody molecule: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE.\n\n\nEach heavy and light chain contains a constant region and a variable region, (the regions are also known as “domains”). In combination, the heavy and the light chain variable regions specifically bind the antigen. Light and heavy chain variable regions contain a “framework” region interrupted by three hypervariable regions, also called “complementarity-determining regions” or “CDRs”. The extent of the framework region and CDRs have been defined (see, Kabat et al., \nSequences of proteins of Immunological Interest\n, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1991, which is hereby incorporated by reference). The Kabat database is now maintained online. The sequences of the framework regions of different light or heavy chains are relatively conserved within a species. The framework region of an antibody, that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, serves to position and align the CDRs in three-dimensional space.\n\n\nThe CDRs are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of an antigen. The CDRs of each chain are typically referred to as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, numbered sequentially starting from the N-terminus, and are also typically identified by the chain in which the particular CDR is located. Thus, a V\nH \nCDR3 is located in the variable domain of the heavy chain of the antibody in which it is found, whereas a V\nL \nCDR1 is the CDR1 from the variable domain of the light chain of the antibody in which it is found.\n\n\nReferences to “V\nH\n” or “VH” refer to the variable region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain, including that of an Fv, scFv, dsFv or Fab. References to “V\nL\n” or “VL” refer to the variable region of an immunoglobulin light chain, including that of an Fv, scFv, dsFv or Fab.\n\n\nA “monoclonal antibody” is an antibody produced by a single clone of B-lymphocytes or by a cell into which the light and heavy chain genes of a single antibody have been transfected. Monoclonal antibodies are produced by methods known to those of skill in the art, for instance by making hybrid antibody-forming cells from a fusion of myeloma cells with immune spleen cells. These fused cells and their progeny are termed “hybridomas.” Monoclonal antibodies include humanized monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\nA “humanized” immunoglobulin is an immunoglobulin including a human framework region and one or more CDRs from a non-human (such as a mouse, rat, or synthetic) immunoglobulin. The non-human immunoglobulin providing the CDRs is termed a “donor,” and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is termed an “acceptor.” In one embodiment, all the CDRs are from the donor immunoglobulin in a humanized immunoglobulin. Constant regions need not be present, but if they are, they must be substantially identical to human immunoglobulin constant regions, i.e., at least about 85-90%, such as about 95% or more identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized immunoglobulin, except possibly the CDRs, are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human immunoglobulin sequences. A “humanized antibody” is an antibody comprising a humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain immunoglobulin. A humanized antibody binds to the same antigen as the donor antibody that provides the CDRs. The acceptor framework of a humanized immunoglobulin or antibody may have a limited number of substitutions by amino acids taken from the donor framework. Humanized or other monoclonal antibodies can have additional conservative amino acid substitutions which have substantially no effect on antigen binding or other immunoglobulin functions. Humanized immunoglobulins can be constructed by means of genetic engineering (e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089).\n\n\nBinding affinity: Affinity of an antibody for an antigen. In one embodiment, affinity is calculated by a modification of the Scatchard method described by Frankel et al., \nMol. Immunol., \n16:101-106, 1979. In another embodiment, binding affinity is measured by an antigen/antibody dissociation rate. In yet another embodiment, a high binding affinity is measured by a competition radioimmunoassay. In several examples, a high binding affinity is at least about 1×10\n−8 \nM. In other embodiments, a high binding affinity is at least about 1.5×10\n−8\n, at least about 2.0×10\n−8\n, at least about 2.5×10\n−8\n, at least about 3.0×10\n−8\n, at least about 3.5×10\n−8\n, at least about 4.0×10\n−8\n, at least about 4.5×10\n−8\n, or at least about 5.0×10\n−8 \nM.\n\n\nChemotherapeutic agents: Any chemical agent with therapeutic usefulness in the treatment of diseases characterized by abnormal cell growth. Such diseases include tumors, neoplasms, and cancer as well as diseases characterized by hyperplastic growth such as psoriasis. In one embodiment, a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent of use in treating a lymphoma, leukemia, or another tumor. In one embodiment, a chemotherapeutic agent is a radioactive compound. One of skill in the art can readily identify a chemotherapeutic agent of use (e.g. see Slapak and Kufe, \nPrinciples of Cancer Therapy\n, Chapter 86 in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 14th edition; Perry et al., \nChemotherapy\n, Ch. 17 in Abeloff, \nClinical Oncology\n 2\nnd \ned., ©2000 Churchill Livingstone, Inc; Baltzer, L., Berkery, R. (eds): \nOncology Pocket Guide to Chemotherapy, \n2nd ed. St. Louis, Mosby-Year Book, 1995; Fischer, D. S., Knobf, M. F., Durivage, H. J. (eds): \nThe Cancer Chemotherapy Handbook, \n4th ed. St. Louis, Mosby-Year Book, 1993). Combination chemotherapy is the administration of more than one agent to treat cancer. One example is the administration of an antibody that binds IRTA2 or a fragment thereof used in combination with a radioactive or chemical compound.\n\n\nChimeric antibody: An antibody which includes sequences derived from two different antibodies, which typically are of different species. Most typically, chimeric antibodies include human and murine antibody domains, generally human constant regions and murine variable regions, murine CDRs and/or murine SDRs.\n\n\nConservative variants: “Conservative” amino acid substitutions are those substitutions that do not substantially affect or decrease an activity or antigenicity of IRTA2. For example, an IRTA2 polypeptide can include at most about 1, at most about 2, at most about 5, and most about 10, or at most about 15 conservative substitutions and specifically bind an antibody that binds the original IRTA polypeptide. The term conservative variation also includes the use of a substituted amino acid in place of an unsubstituted parent amino acid, provided that antibodies raised antibodies raised to the substituted polypeptide also immunoreact with the unsubstituted polypeptide. Non-conservative substitutions are those that reduce an activity or antigenicity.\n\n\nComplementarity Determining Region (CDR): Amino acid sequences which together define the binding affinity and specificity of the natural Fv region of a native Ig binding site. The light and heavy chains of an Ig each have three CDRs, designated L-CDR1, L-CDR2, L-CDR3 and H-CDR1, H-CDR2, H-CDR3, respectively. By definition, the CDRs of the light chain are bounded by the residues at \npositions\n 24 and 34 (L-CDR1), 50 and 56 (L-CDR2), 89 and 97 (L-CDR3); the CDRs of the heavy chain are bounded by the residues at \npositions\n 31 and 35b (H-CDR1), 50 and 65 (H-CDR2), 95 and 102 (H-CDR3), using the numbering convention delineated by Kabat et al., (1991) \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5\nth \nEdition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (NIH Publication No. 91-3242).\n\n\nContacting: Placement in direct physical association. Includes both in solid and liquid form.\n\n\nCytotoxicity: The toxicity of a molecule, such as an immunotoxin, to the cells intended to be targeted, as opposed to the cells of the rest of an organism. In one embodiment, in contrast, the term “toxicity” refers to toxicity of an immunotoxin to cells other than those that are the cells intended to be targeted by the targeting moiety of the immunotoxin, and the term “animal toxicity” refers to toxicity of the immunotoxin to an animal by toxicity of the immunotoxin to cells other than those intended to be targeted by the immunotoxin.\n\n\nDegenerate variant: A polynucleotide encoding an IRTA2 polypeptide that includes a sequence that is degenerate as a result of the genetic code. There are 20 natural amino acids, most of which are specified by more than one codon. Therefore, all degenerate nucleotide sequences are included as long as the amino acid sequence of the IRTA2 polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence is unchanged.\n\n\nEffector molecule: The portion of a chimeric molecule that is intended to have a desired effect on a cell to which the chimeric molecule is targeted. Effector molecule is also known as an effector moiety (EM), therapeutic agent, or diagnostic agent, or similar terms.\n\n\nTherapeutic agents include such compounds as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, amino acids or derivatives, glycoproteins, radioisotopes, lipids, carbohydrates, or recombinant viruses. Nucleic acid therapeutic and diagnostic moieties include antisense nucleic acids, derivatized oligonucleotides for covalent cross-linking with single or duplex DNA, and triplex forming oligonucleotides. Alternatively, the molecule linked to a targeting moiety, such as an anti-IRTA2 antibody, may be an encapsulation system, such as a liposome or micelle that contains a therapeutic composition such as a drug, a nucleic acid (e.g., an antisense nucleic acid), or another therapeutic moiety that can be shielded from direct exposure to the circulatory system. Means of preparing liposomes attached to antibodies are well known to those of skill in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,957,735; and Connor et al., \nPharm. Ther. \n28:341-365, 1985. Diagnostic agents or moieties include radioisotopes and other detectable labels. Detectable labels useful for such purposes are also well known in the art, and include radioactive isotopes such as \n32\nP, \n125\nI, and \n131\nI, fluorophores, chemiluminescent agents, and enzymes.\n\n\nEpitope: An antigenic determinant. These are particular chemical groups or peptide sequences on a molecule that are antigenic, i.e. that elicit a specific immune response. An antibody specifically binds a particular antigenic epitope on a polypeptide.\n\n\nExpressed: Translation of a nucleic acid into a protein. Proteins may be expressed and remain intracellular, become a component of the cell surface membrane, or be secreted into the extracellular matrix or medium\n\n\nExpression Control Sequences: Nucleic acid sequences that regulate the expression of a heterologous nucleic acid sequence to which it is operatively linked. Expression control sequences are operatively linked to a nucleic acid sequence when the expression control sequences control and regulate the transcription and, as appropriate, translation of the nucleic acid sequence. Thus expression control sequences can include appropriate promoters, enhancers, transcription terminators, a start codon (i.e., ATG) in front of a protein-encoding gene, splicing signal for introns, maintenance of the correct reading frame of that gene to permit proper translation of mRNA, and stop codons. The term “control sequences” is intended to include, at a minimum, components whose presence can influence expression, and can also include additional components whose presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences and fusion partner sequences. Expression control sequences can include a promoter.\n\n\nA promoter is a minimal sequence sufficient to direct transcription. Also included are those promoter elements which are sufficient to render promoter-dependent gene expression controllable for cell-type specific, tissue-specific, or inducible by external signals or agents; such elements may be located in the 5′ or 3′ regions of the gene. Both constitutive and inducible promoters are included (see e.g., Bitter et al., \nMethods in Enzymology \n153:516-544, 1987). For example, when cloning in bacterial systems, inducible promoters such as pL of bacteriophage lambda, plac, ptrp, ptac (ptrp-lac hybrid promoter) and the like may be used. In one embodiment, when cloning in mammalian cell systems, promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the retrovirus long terminal repeat; the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter) can be used. Promoters produced by recombinant DNA or synthetic techniques may also be used to provide for transcription of the nucleic acid sequences.\n\n\nFramework Region: Amino acid sequences interposed between CDRs. Includes variable light and variable heavy framework regions. The framework regions serve to hold the CDRs in an appropriate orientation for antigen binding.\n\n\nHairy Cell Leukemia: A form of chronic leukemia marked by splenomegaly and by an abundance of abnormal large mononuclear cells covered by hair-like villi in the bone marrow, spleen, liver, and peripheral blood. Hairy cell leukemia is also called leukemic reticuloendotheliosis.\n\n\nHost cells: Cells in which a vector can be propagated and its DNA expressed. The cell may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic. The term also includes any progeny of the subject host cell. It is understood that all progeny may not be identical to the parental cell since there may be mutations that occur during replication. However, such progeny are included when the term “host cell” is used.\n\n\nImmune response: A response of a cell of the immune system, such as a B cell, T cell, or monocyte, to a stimulus. In one embodiment, the response is specific for a particular antigen (an “antigen-specific response”). In one embodiment, an immune response is a T cell response, such as a CD4+ response or a CD8+ response. In another embodiment, the response is a B cell response, and results in the production of specific antibodies.\n\n\nImmunoconjugate: A covalent linkage of an effector molecule to an antibody. The effector molecule can be a detectable label or an immunotoxin. Specific, non-limiting examples of toxins include, but are not limited to, abrin, ricin, \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin (PE, such as PE35, PE37, PE38, and PE40), diphtheria toxin (IT), botulinum toxin, or modified toxins thereof, or other toxic agents that directly or indirectly inhibit cell growth or kill cells. For example, PE and DT are highly toxic compounds that typically bring about death through liver toxicity. PE and DT, however, can be modified into a form for use as an immunotoxin by removing the native targeting component of the toxin (e.g., domain Ia of PE and the B chain of DT) and replacing it with a different targeting moiety, such as an antibody. A “chimeric molecule” is a targeting moiety, such as a ligand or an antibody, conjugated (coupled) to an effector molecule. The term “conjugated” or “linked” refers to making two polypeptides into one contiguous polypeptide molecule. In one embodiment, an antibody is joined to an effector molecule (EM). In another embodiment, an antibody joined to an effector molecule is further joined to a lipid or other molecule to a protein or peptide to increase its half-life in the body. The linkage can be either by chemical or recombinant means. In one embodiment, the linkage is chemical, wherein a reaction between the antibody moiety and the effector molecule has produced a covalent bond formed between the two molecules to form one molecule. A peptide linker (short peptide sequence) can optionally be included between the antibody and the effector molecule. Because immunoconjugates were originally prepared from two molecules with separate functionalities, such as an antibody and an effector molecule, they are also sometimes referred to as “chimeric molecules.” The term “chimeric molecule,” as used herein, therefore refers to a targeting moiety, such as a ligand or an antibody, conjugated (coupled) to an effector molecule.\n\n\nImmunogenic peptide: A peptide which comprises an allele-specific motif or other sequence, such as an N-terminal repeat, such that the peptide will bind an MHC molecule and induce a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (“CTL”) response, or a B cell response (e.g. antibody production) against the antigen from which the immunogenic peptide is derived.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, immunogenic peptides are identified using sequence motifs or other methods, such as neural net or polynomial determinations, known in the art. Typically, algorithms are used to determine the “binding threshold” of peptides to select those with scores that give them a high probability of binding at a certain affinity and will be immunogenic. The algorithms are based either on the effects on MHC binding of a particular amino acid at a particular position, the effects on antibody binding of a particular amino acid at a particular position, or the effects on binding of a particular substitution in a motif-containing peptide. Within the context of an immunogenic peptide, a “conserved residue” is one which appears in a significantly higher frequency than would be expected by random distribution at a particular position in a peptide. In one embodiment, a conserved residue is one where the MHC structure may provide a contact point with the immunogenic peptide. In one specific non-limiting example, an immunogenic polypeptide includes a region of IRTA2, or a fragment thereof, wherein the polypeptide that is expressed on the cell surface of a host cell that expresses the full-length IRTA2 polypeptide.\n\n\nImmunogenic composition: A composition comprising an IRTA2 polypeptide that induces a measurable CTL response against cells expressing IRTA2 polypeptide, or induces a measurable B cell response (e.g. production of antibodies) against an IRTA2 polypeptide. It further refers to isolated nucleic acids encoding an IRTA2 polypeptide that can be used to express the IRTA2 polypeptide (and thus be used to elicit an immune response against this polypeptide). For in vitro use, the immunogenic composition may consist of the isolated protein or peptide. For in vivo use, the immunogenic composition will typically comprise the protein or peptide in pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and/or other agents. Any particular peptide, such as an IRTA2 polypeptide, or nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide, can be readily tested for its ability to induce a CTL or B cell response by art-recognized assays. Immunogenic compositions can include adjuvants, which are well known to one of skill in the art.\n\n\nImmunologically reactive conditions: Includes reference to conditions which allow an antibody raised against a particular epitope to bind to that epitope to a detectably greater degree than, and/or to the substantial exclusion of, binding to substantially all other epitopes. Immunologically reactive conditions are dependent upon the format of the antibody binding reaction and typically are those utilized in immunoassay protocols or those conditions encountered in vivo. See Harlow & Lane, supra, for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions. The immunologically reactive conditions employed in the methods are “physiological conditions” which include reference to conditions (e.g., temperature, osmolarity, pH) that are typical inside a living mammal or a mammalian cell. While it is recognized that some organs are subject to extreme conditions, the intra-organismal and intracellular environment normally lies around pH 7 (i.e., from pH 6.0 to pH 8.0, more typically pH 6.5 to 7.5), contains water as the predominant solvent, and exists at a temperature above 0° C. and below 50° C. Osmolarity is within the range that is supportive of cell viability and proliferation.\n\n\nInhibiting or treating a disease: Inhibiting the full development of a disease or condition, for example, in a subject who is at risk for a disease such as a tumor (for example, a leukemia or a lymphoma). “Treatment” refers to a therapeutic intervention that ameliorates a sign or symptom of a disease or pathological condition after it has begun to develop. As used herein, the term “ameliorating,” with reference to a disease or pathological condition, refers to any observable beneficial effect of the treatment. The beneficial effect can be evidenced, for example, by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms of the disease in a susceptible subject, a reduction in severity of some or all clinical symptoms of the disease, a slower progression of the disease, a reduction in the number of metastases, an improvement in the overall health or well-being of the subject, or by other parameters well known in the art that are specific to the particular disease. A “prophylactic” treatment is a treatment administered to a subject who does not exhibit signs of a disease or exhibits only early signs for the purpose of decreasing the risk of developing pathology.\n\n\nImmunoglobulin superfamily receptor translocation associated (IRTA): A receptor in B cells which binds immunoglobulin and is important in B cell development. There are five types of IRTAs, termed IRTA1, IRTA2, IRTA3, IRTA5 and IRTA5. De-regulation of wild-type IRTA2 perturbs B cell immunological responses and is involved in B cell malignancy. The amino acid sequence of these IRTAs, and nucleic acids encoding IRTA polypeptides are disclosed in published PCT Application No. WO 01/38490, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe cytoplasmic domains of the IRTAs contain consensus immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) and/or immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). Expression of IRTAs was investigated in human tissues at the RNA level by Northern blot, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by in situ hybridization; messenger RNAs of IRTAs have been shown to be abundant in lymphoid tissues and each member is differentially expressed by mature B lineage cells in human tonsil (for example, see Hatzivassiliou et al., \nImmunity \n14:277-89, 2001).\n\n\nIsolated: An “isolated” biological component (such as a nucleic acid or protein or organelle) has been substantially separated or purified away from other biological components in the cell of the organism in which the component naturally occurs, i.e., other chromosomal and extra-chromosomal DNA and RNA, proteins and organelles. Nucleic acids and proteins that have been “isolated” include nucleic acids and proteins purified by standard purification methods. The term also embraces nucleic acids and proteins prepared by recombinant expression in a host cell as well as chemically synthesized nucleic acids.\n\n\nLabel: A detectable compound or composition that is conjugated directly or indirectly to another molecule, such as an antibody or a protein, to facilitate detection of that molecule. Specific, non-limiting examples of labels include fluorescent tags, enzymatic linkages, and radioactive isotopes.\n\n\nLigand: Any molecule which specifically binds an IRTA2 protein and includes, inter alia, antibodies that specifically bind an IRTA2 protein. In alternative embodiments, the ligand is a protein or a small molecule (one with a molecular weight less than 6 kiloDaltons).\n\n\nLinker peptide: A peptide within an antibody binding fragment (e.g., Fv fragment) which serves to indirectly bond the variable heavy chain to the variable light chain. “Linker” can also refer to a peptide serving to link a targeting moiety, such as a scFv, to an effector molecule, such as a cytotoxin or a detectable label.\n\n\nThe terms “conjugating,” “joining,” “bonding” or “linking” refer to making two polypeptides into one contiguous polypeptide molecule, or to covalently attaching a radionuclide or other molecule to a polypeptide, such as an scFv. In the specific context, the terms include reference to joining a ligand, such as an antibody moiety, to an effector molecule (“EM”). The linkage can be either by chemical or recombinant means. “Chemical means” refers to a reaction between the antibody moiety and the effector molecule such that there is a covalent bond formed between the two molecules to form one molecule.\n\n\nLymphocytes: A type of white blood cell that is involved in the immune defenses of the body. There are two main types of lymphocytes: B cells and T cells.\n\n\nMammal: This term includes both human and non-human mammals. Similarly, the term “subject” includes both human and veterinary subjects.\n\n\nMajor Histocompatibility Complex or MHC: Generic designation meant to encompass the histocompatibility antigen systems described in different species, including the human leukocyte antigens (“HLA”). The term “motif” refers to the pattern of residues in a peptide of defined length, usually about 8 to about 11 amino acids, which is recognized by a particular MHC allele. The peptide motifs are typically different for each MHC allele and differ in the pattern of the highly conserved residues and negative binding residues.\n\n\nNeoplasia and Tumor: The process of abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells. Neoplasia is one example of a proliferative disorder.\n\n\nThe product of neoplasia is a neoplasm (a tumor), which is an abnormal growth of tissue that results from excessive cell division. A tumor that does not metastasize is referred to as “benign.” A tumor that invades the surrounding tissue and/or can metastasize is referred to as “malignant.” Examples of hematological tumors include leukemias, including acute leukemias (such as acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia and myeloblastic, promyelocytic, myelomonocytic, monocytic and erythroleukemia), chronic leukemias (such as chronic myelocytic (granulocytic) leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia), polycythemia vera, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (indolent and high grade forms), multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, heavy chain disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, hairy cell leukemia and myelodysplasia.\n\n\nExamples of solid tumors, such as sarcomas and carcinomas, include fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, and other sarcomas, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma, lymphoid malignancy, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancers, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, testicular tumor, bladder carcinoma, and CNS tumors (such as a glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyogioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, menangioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma).\n\n\nNon-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: A heterogeneous group of malignant lymphomas (a tumor of the lymphoid tissue), the only common feature being an absence of the giant Reed-Sternberg cells characteristic of Hodgkin's disease. These neoplasias arise from the lymphoid components of the immune system, and present a clinical picture broadly similar to that of Hodgkin's disease except the disease is initially more widespread, with the most common manifestation being painless enlargement of one or more peripheral lymph nodes. There have been numerous classifications of the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas; the most recent system is the Revised European American Lymphoma (REAL) Classification.\n\n\nNucleic acid: A polymer composed of nucleotide units (ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, related naturally occurring structural variants, and synthetic non-naturally occurring analogs thereof) linked via phosphodiester bonds, related naturally occurring structural variants, and synthetic non-naturally occurring analogs thereof. Thus, the term includes nucleotide polymers in which the nucleotides and the linkages between them include non-naturally occurring synthetic analogs, such as, for example and without limitation, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl phosphonates, chiral-methyl phosphonates, 2-O-methyl ribonucleotides, peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs), and the like. Such polynucleotides can be synthesized, for example, using an automated DNA synthesizer. The term “oligonucleotide” typically refers to short polynucleotides, generally no greater than about 50 nucleotides. It will be understood that when a nucleotide sequence is represented by a DNA sequence (i.e., A, T, G, C), this also includes an RNA sequence (i.e., A, U, G, C) in which “U” replaces “T.”\n\n\nConventional notation is used herein to describe nucleotide sequences: the left-hand end of a single-stranded nucleotide sequence is the 5′-end; the left-hand direction of a double-stranded nucleotide sequence is referred to as the 5′-direction. The direction of 5′ to 3′ addition of nucleotides to nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction. The DNA strand having the same sequence as an mRNA is referred to as the “coding strand;” sequences on the DNA strand having the same sequence as an mRNA transcribed from that DNA and which are located 5′ to the 5′-end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “upstream sequences;” sequences on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3′ to the 3′ end of the coding RNA transcript are referred to as “downstream sequences.”\n\n\n“cDNA” refers to a DNA that is complementary or identical to an mRNA, in either single stranded or double stranded form.\n\n\n“Encoding” refers to the inherent property of specific sequences of nucleotides in a polynucleotide, such as a gene, a cDNA, or an mRNA, to serve as templates for synthesis of other polymers and macromolecules in biological processes having either a defined sequence of nucleotides (i.e., rRNA, tRNA and mRNA) or a defined sequence of amino acids and the biological properties resulting therefrom. Thus, a gene encodes a protein if transcription and translation of mRNA produced by that gene produces the protein in a cell or other biological system. Both the coding strand, the nucleotide sequence of which is identical to the mRNA sequence and is usually provided in sequence listings, and non-coding strand, used as the template for transcription, of a gene or cDNA can be referred to as encoding the protein or other product of that gene or cDNA. Unless otherwise specified, a “nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence” includes all nucleotide sequences that are degenerate versions of each other and that encode the same amino acid sequence. Nucleotide sequences that encode proteins and RNA may include introns.\n\n\n“Recombinant nucleic acid” refers to a nucleic acid having nucleotide sequences that are not naturally joined together. This includes nucleic acid vectors comprising an amplified or assembled nucleic acid which can be used to transform a suitable host cell. A host cell that comprises the recombinant nucleic acid is referred to as a “recombinant host cell.” The gene is then expressed in the recombinant host cell to produce, e.g., a “recombinant polypeptide.” A recombinant nucleic acid may serve a non-coding function (e.g., promoter, origin of replication, ribosome-binding site, etc.) as well.\n\n\nA first sequence is an “antisense” with respect to a second sequence if a polynucleotide whose sequence is the first sequence specifically hybridizes with a polynucleotide whose sequence is the second sequence.\n\n\nTerms used to describe sequence relationships between two or more nucleotide sequences or amino acid sequences include “reference sequence,” “selected from,” “comparison window,” “identical,” “percentage of sequence identity,” “substantially identical,” “complementary,” and “substantially complementary.”\n\n\nFor sequence comparison of nucleic acid sequences, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters are used. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith & Waterman, \nAdv. Appl. Math. \n2:482, 1981, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n48:443, 1970, by the search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman, \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA \n85:2444, 1988, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology \n(Ausubel et al., eds 1995 supplement)).\n\n\nOne example of a useful algorithm is PILEUP. PILEUP uses a simplification of the progressive alignment method of Feng & Doolittle, \nJ. Mol. Evol. \n35:351-360, 1987. The method used is similar to the method described by Higgins & Sharp, \nCABIOS \n5:151-153, 1989. Using PILEUP, a reference sequence is compared to other test sequences to determine the percent sequence identity relationship using the following parameters: default gap weight (3.00), default gap length weight (0.10), and weighted end gaps. PILEUP can be obtained from the GCG sequence analysis software package, e.g., version 7.0 (Devereaux et al., \nNuc. Acids Res. \n12:387-395, 1984.\n\n\nAnother example of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and the BLAST 2.0 algorithm, which are described in Altschul et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n215:403-410, 1990 and Altschul et al., \nNucleic Acids Res. \n25:3389-3402, 1977. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a word length (W) of 11, alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=−4, and a comparison of both strands. The BLASTP program (for amino acid sequences) uses as defaults a word length (W) of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff & Henikoff, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n89:10915, 1989).\n\n\nOligonucleotide: A linear polynucleotide sequence of up to about 100 nucleotide bases in length.\n\n\nOperably linked: A first nucleic acid sequence is operably linked with a second nucleic acid sequence when the first nucleic acid sequence is placed in a functional relationship with the second nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter, such as the IRTA2 promoter, is operably linked to a coding sequence if the promoter affects the transcription or expression of the coding sequence. Generally, operably linked DNA sequences are contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein-coding regions, in the same reading frame.\n\n\nORF (open reading frame): A series of nucleotide triplets (codons) coding for amino acids without any termination codons. These sequences are usually translatable into a peptide.\n\n\nPeptide: A chain of amino acids of between 3 and 30 amino acids in length. In one embodiment, a peptide is from about 10 to about 25 amino acids in length. In yet another embodiment, a peptide is from about 11 to about 20 amino acids in length. In yet another embodiment, a peptide is about 12 amino acids in length.\n\n\nAn “IRTA2 peptide” is a series of contiguous amino acid residues from an IRTA2 protein, such as a fragment of IRTA2 protein of about 10 to about 25 amino acids in length, such as about 11 to about 20 amino acid in length, such as about 12 consecutive amino acids of an IRTA2 protein. In one example, with respect to immunogenic compositions comprising an IRTA2 peptide, the term further refers to variations of these peptides in which there are conservative substitutions of amino acids, so long as the variations do not alter by more than about 20% (such as no more than about 1%, about 5%, or about 10%) the ability of the peptide to produce a B cell response, or, when bound to a Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I molecule, to activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes against cells expressing wild-type IRTA2 protein. Induction of CTLs using synthetic peptides and CTL cytotoxicity assays are taught in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,662,907.\n\n\n“Soluble” forms of IRTA2 are secreted and can bind to the antibodies disclosed herein. Soluble IRTA2 may be, for example, a product resulting from alternative splicing of the IRTA2 gene, or a soluble extracellular domain that has been shed from cell surface-expressed full-length IRTA2.\n\n\nPeptide modifications: IRTA2 polypeptides include synthetic embodiments of peptides described herein. In addition, analogs (non-peptide organic molecules), derivatives (chemically functionalized peptide molecules obtained starting with the disclosed peptide sequences) and variants (homologs) of these proteins can be utilized in the methods described herein. Each polypeptide is comprised of a sequence of amino acids, which may be either L- and/or D-amino acids, naturally occurring and otherwise.\n\n\nPeptides may be modified by a variety of chemical techniques to produce derivatives having essentially the same activity as the unmodified peptides, and optionally having other desirable properties. For example, carboxylic acid groups of the protein, whether carboxyl-terminal or side chain, may be provided in the form of a salt of a pharmaceutically-acceptable cation or esterified to form a C\n1\n-C\n16 \nester, or converted to an amide of formula NR\n1\nR\n2 \nwherein R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare each independently H or C\n1\n-C\n16 \nalkyl, or combined to form a heterocyclic ring, such as a 5- or 6-membered ring. Amino groups of the peptide, whether amino-terminal or side chain, may be in the form of a pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salt, such as the HCl, HBr, acetic, benzoic, toluene sulfonic, maleic, tartaric and other organic salts, or may be modified to C\n1\n-C\n16 \nalkyl or dialkyl amino or further converted to an amide.\n\n\nHydroxyl groups of the peptide side chains may be converted to C\n1\n-C\n16 \nalkoxy or to a C\n1\n-C\n16 \nester using well-recognized techniques. Phenyl and phenolic rings of the peptide side chains may be substituted with one or more halogen atoms, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, or with C\n1\n-C\n16 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n16 \nalkoxy, carboxylic acids and esters thereof, or amides of such carboxylic acids. Methylene groups of the peptide side chains can be extended to homologous C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkylenes. Thiols can be protected with any one of a number of well-recognized protecting groups, such as acetamide groups. Those skilled in the art will also recognize methods for introducing cyclic structures into the IRTA2 peptides to select and provide conformational constraints to the structure that result in enhanced stability.\n\n\nPeptidomimetic and organomimetic embodiments are envisioned, whereby the three-dimensional arrangement of the chemical constituents of such peptido- and organomimetics mimic the three-dimensional arrangement of the peptide backbone and component amino acid side chains, resulting in such peptido- and organomimetics of an IRTA2 polypeptide having measurable or enhanced ability to generate an immune response. For computer modeling applications, a pharmacophore is an idealized, three-dimensional definition of the structural requirements for biological activity. Peptido- and organomimetics can be designed to fit each pharmacophore with current computer modeling software (using computer assisted drug design or CADD). See Walters, “Computer-Assisted Modeling of Drugs”, in Klegerman & Groves, eds., 1993\n, Pharmaceutical Biotechnology\n, Interpharm Press, Buffalo Grove, Ill., pp. 165-174 and \nPrinciples of Pharmacology \nMunson (ed.) 1995, Ch. 102, for descriptions of techniques used in CADD. Also included are mimetics prepared using such techniques.\n\n\nPharmaceutical agent: A chemical compound or composition capable of inducing a desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect when properly administered to a subject or a cell.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers: The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers of use are conventional. \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\n, by E. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 15th Edition, 1975, describes compositions and formulations suitable for pharmaceutical delivery of the fusion proteins herein disclosed.\n\n\nIn general, the nature of the carrier will depend on the particular mode of administration being employed. For instance, parenteral formulations usually comprise injectable fluids that include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as water, physiological saline, balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like as a vehicle. For solid compositions (e.g., powder, pill, tablet, or capsule forms), conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate. In addition to biologically neutral carriers, pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, and pH buffering agents and the like, for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.\n\n\nPolynucleotide: The term polynucleotide or nucleic acid sequence refers to a polymeric form of nucleotide at least 10 bases in length. A recombinant polynucleotide includes a polynucleotide that is not immediately contiguous with both of the coding sequences with which it is immediately contiguous (one on the 5′ end and one on the 3′ end) in the naturally occurring genome of the organism from which it is derived. The term therefore includes, for example, a recombinant DNA which is incorporated into a vector; into an autonomously replicating plasmid or virus; or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote, or which exists as a separate molecule (e.g., a cDNA) independent of other sequences. The nucleotides can be ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, or modified forms of either nucleotide. The term includes single- and double-stranded forms of DNA. An IRTA2 polynucleotide is a nucleic acid encoding an IRTA2 polypeptide.\n\n\nPolypeptide: Any chain of amino acids, regardless of length or post-translational modification (e.g., glycosylation or phosphorylation). In one embodiment, the polypeptide is IRTA2 polypeptide. A “residue” refers to an amino acid or amino acid mimetic incorporated in a polypeptide by an amide bond or amide bond mimetic. A polypeptide has an amino terminal (N-terminal) end and a carboxy terminal end.\n\n\nProbes and primers: A probe comprises an isolated nucleic acid attached to a detectable label or reporter molecule. Primers are short nucleic acids, and can be DNA oligonucleotides 15 nucleotides or more in length. Primers may be annealed to a complementary target DNA strand by nucleic acid hybridization to form a hybrid between the primer and the target DNA strand, and then extended along the target DNA strand by a DNA polymerase enzyme. Primer pairs can be used for amplification of a nucleic acid sequence, e.g., by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other nucleic-acid amplification methods known in the art. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the specificity of a particular probe or primer increases with its length. Thus, for example, a primer comprising 20 consecutive nucleotides will anneal to a target with a higher specificity than a corresponding primer of only 15 nucleotides. Thus, in order to obtain greater specificity, probes and primers may be selected that comprise 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50 or more consecutive nucleotides.\n\n\nPromoter: A promoter is an array of nucleic acid control sequences that directs transcription of a nucleic acid. A promoter includes necessary nucleic acid sequences near the start site of transcription, such as, in the case of a polymerase II type promoter, a TATA element. A promoter also optionally includes distal enhancer or repressor elements which can be located as much as several thousand base pairs from the start site of transcription. Both constitutive and inducible promoters are included (see e.g., Bitter et al., \nMethods in Enzymology \n153:516-544, 1987).\n\n\nSpecific, non-limiting examples of promoters include promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the retrovirus long terminal repeat; the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter) may be used. Promoters produced by recombinant DNA or synthetic techniques may also be used. A polynucleotide can be inserted into an expression vector that contains a promoter sequence which facilitates the efficient transcription of the inserted genetic sequence of the host. The expression vector typically contains an origin of replication, a promoter, as well as specific nucleic acid sequences that allow phenotypic selection of the transformed cells.\n\n\nProtein purification: The IRTA2 polypeptides disclosed herein can be purified by any of the means known in the art. See, e.g., \nGuide to Protein Purification\n, ed. Deutscher, \nMeth. Enzymol. \n185, Academic Press, San Diego, 1990; and Scopes, \nProtein Purification: Principles and Practice\n, Springer Verlag, New York, 1982. Substantial purification denotes purification from other proteins or cellular components. A substantially purified protein is at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 98% pure. Thus, in one specific, non-limiting example, a substantially purified protein is 90% free of other proteins or cellular components.\n\n\nPurified: The term purified does not require absolute purity; rather, it is intended as a relative term. Thus, for example, a purified peptide preparation is one in which the peptide or protein is more enriched than the peptide or protein is in its natural environment within a cell. In one embodiment, a preparation is purified such that the protein or peptide represents at least 50% of the total peptide or protein content of the preparation.\n\n\nRecombinant: A recombinant nucleic acid is one that has a sequence that is not naturally occurring or has a sequence that is made by an artificial combination of two otherwise separated segments of sequence. This artificial combination is often accomplished by chemical synthesis or, more commonly, by the artificial manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acids, e.g., by genetic engineering techniques.\n\n\nSelectively hybridize: Hybridization under moderately or highly stringent conditions that excludes non-related nucleotide sequences.\n\n\nIn nucleic acid hybridization reactions, the conditions used to achieve a particular level of stringency will vary, depending on the nature of the nucleic acids being hybridized. For example, the length, degree of complementarity, nucleotide sequence composition (e.g., GC versus AT content), and nucleic acid type (e.g., RNA versus DNA) of the hybridizing regions of the nucleic acids can be considered in selecting hybridization conditions. An additional consideration is whether one of the nucleic acids is immobilized, for example, on a filter.\n\n\nA specific, non-limiting example of progressively higher stringency conditions is as follows: 2×SSC/0.1% SDS at about room temperature (hybridization conditions); 0.2×SSC/0.1% SDS at about room temperature (low stringency conditions); 0.2×SSC/0.1% SDS at about 42° C. (moderate stringency conditions); and 0.1×SSC at about 68° C. (high stringency conditions). One of skill in the art can readily determine variations on these conditions (e.g., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, \n2nd ed., Vol. 1-3, ed. Sambrook et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989). Washing can be carried out using only one of these conditions, e.g., high stringency conditions, or each of the conditions can be used, e.g., for 10-15 minutes each, in the order listed above, repeating any or all of the steps listed. However, as mentioned above, optimal conditions will vary, depending on the particular hybridization reaction involved, and can be determined empirically.\n\n\nSequence identity: The similarity between amino acid sequences is expressed in terms of the similarity between the sequences, otherwise referred to as sequence identity. Sequence identity is frequently measured in terms of percentage identity (or similarity or homology); the higher the percentage, the more similar the two sequences are. Homologs or variants of an IRTA2 polypeptide will possess a relatively high degree of sequence identity when aligned using standard methods.\n\n\nMethods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Various programs and alignment algorithms are described in: Smith and Waterman, \nAdv. Appl. Math. \n2:482, 1981; Needleman and Wunsch, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n48:443, 1970; Pearson and Lipman, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n85:2444, 1988; Higgins and Sharp, \nGene \n73:237, 1988; Higgins and Sharp, \nCABIOS \n5:151, 1989; Corpet et al., \nNucleic Acids Research \n16:10881, 1988; and Pearson and Lipman, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n85:2444, 1988. Altschul et al., \nNature Genet. \n6:119, 1994, presents a detailed consideration of sequence alignment methods and homology calculations.\n\n\nThe NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (Altschul et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n215:403, 1990) is available from several sources, including the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, Bethesda, Md.) and on the internet, for use in connection with the sequence analysis programs blastp, blastn, blastx, tblastn and tblastx. A description of how to determine sequence identity using this program is available on the NCBI website on the internet.\n\n\nHomologs and variants of a V\nL \nor a V\nH \nof an antibody that specifically binds an IRTA2 polypeptide are typically characterized by possession of at least about 75%, for example at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence identity counted over the full length alignment with the amino acid sequence of IRTA2 using the NCBI Blast 2.0, gapped blastp set to default parameters. For comparisons of amino acid sequences of greater than about 30 amino acids, the \nBlast\n 2 sequences function is employed using the default BLOSUM62 matrix set to default parameters, (gap existence cost of 11, and a per residue gap cost of 1). When aligning short peptides (fewer than around 30 amino acids), the alignment should be performed using the \nBlast\n 2 sequences function, employing the PAM30 matrix set to default parameters (\nopen gap\n 9, \nextension gap\n 1 penalties). Proteins with even greater similarity to the reference sequences will show increasing percentage identities when assessed by this method, such as at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98%, or at least 99% sequence identity. When less than the entire sequence is being compared for sequence identity, homologs and variants will typically possess at least 80% sequence identity over short windows of 10-20 amino acids, and may possess sequence identities of at least 85% or at least 90% or 95% depending on their similarity to the reference sequence. Methods for determining sequence identity over such short windows are available at the NCBI website on the internet. One of skill in the art will appreciate that these sequence identity ranges are provided for guidance only; it is entirely possible that strongly significant homologs could be obtained that fall outside of the ranges provided.\n\n\nSpecific binding agent: An agent that binds substantially only to a defined target. Thus an IRTA2 specific binding agent is an agent that binds substantially to an IRTA2 polypeptide. In one embodiment, the specific binding agent is a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody that specifically binds the IRTA2 polypeptide.\n\n\nThe term “specifically binds” refers, with respect to an antigen such as IRTA2, to the preferential association of an antibody or other ligand, in whole or part, with a cell or tissue bearing that antigen and not to cells or tissues lacking that antigen. It is, of course, recognized that a certain degree of non-specific interaction may occur between a molecule and a non-target cell or tissue. Nevertheless, specific binding may be distinguished as mediated through specific recognition of the antigen. Although selectively reactive antibodies bind antigen, they may do so with low affinity. On the other hand, specific binding results in a much stronger association between the antibody (or other ligand) and cells bearing the antigen than between the bound antibody (or other ligand) and cells lacking the antigen. Specific binding typically results in greater than 2-fold, such as greater than 5-fold, greater than 10-fold, or greater than 100-fold increase in amount of bound antibody or other ligand (per unit time) to a cell or tissue bearing the IRTA2 polypeptide as compared to a cell or tissue lacking the polypeptide. Specific binding to a protein under such conditions requires an antibody that is selected for its specificity for a particular protein. A variety of immunoassay formats are appropriate for selecting antibodies or other ligands specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein. See Harlow & Lane, \nAntibodies, A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor Publications, New York (1988), for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity.\n\n\nSubject: Living multi-cellular vertebrate organisms, a category that includes both human and veterinary subjects, including human and non-human mammals.\n\n\nT Cell: A white blood cell critical to the immune response. T cells include, but are not limited to, CD4\n+\n T cells and CD8\n+\n T cells. A CD4\n+\n T lymphocyte is an immune cell that carries a marker on its surface known as “cluster of \ndifferentiation\n 4” (CD4). These cells, also known as helper T cells, help orchestrate the immune response, including antibody responses as well as killer T cell responses. CD8\n+\n T cells carry the “cluster of \ndifferentiation\n 8” (CD8) marker. In one embodiment, CD8 T cells are cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In another embodiment, a CD8 cell is a suppressor T cell.\n\n\nTargeting moiety: A portion of a chimeric molecule intended to provide the molecule with the ability to bind specifically to the IRTA2 polypeptide. A “ligand” is a targeting molecule specific for the IRTA2 polypeptide and is generally synonymous with “targeting moiety.” An antibody is one version of a ligand.\n\n\nTherapeutically effective amount: A quantity of a specific substance sufficient to achieve a desired effect in a subject being treated. For instance, this can be the amount necessary to inhibit or suppress growth of a tumor. In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount is the amount necessary to eliminate a tumor. When administered to a subject, a dosage will generally be used that will achieve target tissue concentrations (for example, in tumors) that has been shown to achieve a desired in vitro effect.\n\n\nToxin: A molecule that is cytotoxic for a cell. Toxins include abrin, ricin, \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin (PE), diphtheria toxin (DT), botulinum toxin, saporin, restrictocin or gelonin, or modified toxins thereof. For example, PE and DT are highly toxic compounds that typically bring about death through liver toxicity. PE and DT, however, can be modified into a form for use as an immunotoxin by removing the native targeting component of the toxin (e.g., domain Ia of PE or the B chain of DT) and replacing it with a different targeting moiety, such as an antibody.\n\n\nTransduced: A transduced cell is a cell into which has been introduced a nucleic acid molecule by molecular biology techniques. As used herein, the term transduction encompasses all techniques by which a nucleic acid molecule might be introduced into such a cell, including transfection with viral vectors, transformation with plasmid vectors, and introduction of naked DNA by electroporation, lipofection, and particle gun acceleration.\n\n\nVector: A nucleic acid molecule as introduced into a host cell, thereby producing a transformed host cell. A vector may include nucleic acid sequences that permit it to replicate in a host cell, such as an origin of replication. A vector may also include one or more selectable marker genes and other genetic elements known in the art.\n\n\nUnless otherwise explained, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. The singular terms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural referents unless context clearly indicates otherwise. Similarly, the word “or” is intended to include “and” unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It is further to be understood that all base sizes or amino acid sizes, and all molecular weight or molecular mass values, given for nucleic acids or polypeptides are approximate, and are provided for description. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of this disclosure, suitable methods and materials are described below.

In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.\n\n\nMonoclonal Antibodies that Bind IRTA2\n\n\nAntibodies are disclosed herein that bind IRTA2. The immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily receptor translocation associated 2 (IRTA2) gene is a gene targeted by one of the 1q21 abnormalities that occurs in B cell malignancies (Hatzivassiliou et al., \nImmunity \n14:277-89, 2001). This gene has also been identified as BXMAS1 (Nakayama et al., \nBiochem Biophys Res Commun \n285:830-7, 2001, herein incorporated by reference) and Fc receptor homolog 5 (FcRH5) (Miller et al., \nBlood \n99:2662-9, 2002, herein incorporated by reference).\n\n\nA series of genes homologous to IRTA2/BXMAS1/FcRH5 have been identified in the same locus of the human genome. A total of five IRTA family members have been identified (for example, see Davis et al., \nImmunol Rev \n190:123-36, 2002). These genes, termed immunoglobulin superfamily translocation associated (IRTA) genes code for individual members of the Ig receptor family with three to nine Ig-like extracellular domains.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are disclosed herein that specifically bind the extracellular domain of IRTA2. In one example, IRTA2 has an amino acid sequence set forth as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMLLWVILLVLAPVSGQFARTPRPIIFLQPPWTTVFQGERVTLTCKGFRFY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

For example, humanized antibodies can be routinely produced. The antibody or antibody fragment can be a humanized immunoglobulin having complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from a donor monoclonal antibody that binds IRTA2 (such as those from F1, F44 or F54, produced by the above-described hybridomas deposited with ATCC, or F25, F56 or F119, see the above table) and immunoglobulin and heavy and light chain variable region frameworks from human acceptor immunoglobulin heavy and light chain frameworks. Generally, the humanized immunoglobulin specifically binds to IRTA2 with an affinity constant of at least 10\n7 \nM\n−1\n, such as at least 10\n8 \nM\n−1 \nat least 5×10\n8 \nM\n−1 \nor at least 10\n9 \nM\n−1\n.\n\n\nHumanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by transferring donor complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from heavy and light variable chains of the donor mouse immunoglobulin (such as F1, F25, F44, F54, F56 or F119) into a human variable domain, and then substituting human residues in the framework regions when required to retain affinity. The use of antibody components derived from humanized monoclonal antibodies obviates potential problems associated with the immunogenicity of the constant regions of the donor antibody. Techniques for producing humanized monoclonal antibodies are described, for example, by Jones et al., \nNature \n321:522, 1986; Riechmann et al., \nNature \n332:323, 1988; Verhoeyen et al., \nScience \n239:1534, 1988; Carter et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n89:4285, 1992; Sandhu, \nCrit. Rev. Biotech. \n12:437, 1992; and Singer et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n150:2844, 1993. The antibody may be of any isotype, but in several embodiments the antibody is an IgG, including but not limited to, IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3 \nand IgG\n4\n.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the sequence of the humanized immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework can be at least about 65% identical to the sequence of the donor immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework. Thus, the sequence of the humanized immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework can be at least about 75%, at least about 85%, at least about 99% or at least about 95%, identical to the sequence of the donor immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework. Human framework regions, and mutations that can be made in a humanized antibody framework regions, are known in the art (see, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089, which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nExemplary human antibodies are LEN and 21/28 CL. The sequences of the heavy and light chain frameworks are known in the art.

These antibody fragments retain some ability to selectively bind with their antigen or receptor. These fragments include:\n\n\n(1) Fab, the fragment which contains a monovalent antigen-binding fragment of an antibody molecule, can be produced by digestion of whole antibody with the enzyme papain to yield an intact light chain and a portion of one heavy chain;\n\n\n(2) Fab′, the fragment of an antibody molecule can be obtained by treating whole antibody with pepsin, followed by reduction, to yield an intact light chain and a portion of the heavy chain; two Fab′ fragments are obtained per antibody molecule;\n\n\n(3) (Fab′)\n2\n, the fragment of the antibody that can be obtained by treating whole antibody with the enzyme pepsin without subsequent reduction; F(ab′)\n2 \nis a dimer of two Fab′ fragments held together by two disulfide bonds;\n\n\n(4) Fv, a genetically engineered fragment containing the variable region of the light chain and the variable region of the heavy chain expressed as two chains; and\n\n\n(5) Single chain antibody (such as scFv), defined as a genetically engineered molecule containing the variable region of the light chain, the variable region of the heavy chain, linked by a suitable polypeptide linker as a genetically fused single chain molecule.\n\n\nMethods of making these fragments are known in the art (see for example, Harlow and Lane, \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, 1988). In several examples, the variable region included in the immunotoxin is an F1, F54, F44, F119, F56 or F25 Fv, which includes the variable region of the light chain and the variable region of the heavy chain expressed as individual polypeptides. In one group of embodiments, the antibodies have V\nL \nand V\nH \nregions having the amino acid sequences shown above (for example, see SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2; SEQ ID NO; 3 and SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6, or the sequences for V\nL \nand V\nH \nregions for antibodies F1, F44, or F54 (see above). Fv antibodies are typically about 25 kDa and contain a complete antigen-binding site with three CDRs per each heavy chain and each light chain. To produce these antibodies, the V\nH \nand the V\nL \ncan be expressed from two individual nucleic acid constructs in a host cell. If the V\nH \nand the V\nL \nare expressed non-contiguously, the chains of the Fv antibody are typically held together by noncovalent interactions. However, these chains tend to dissociate upon dilution, so methods have been developed to crosslink the chains through glutaraldehyde, intermolecular disulfides, or a peptide linker. Thus, in one example, the Fv can be a disulfide stabilized Fv (dsFv), wherein the heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region are chemically linked by disulfide bonds.\n\n\nIn an additional example, the Fv fragments comprise V\nH \nand V\nL \nchains connected by a peptide linker. These single-chain antigen binding proteins (sFv) are prepared by constructing a structural gene comprising DNA sequences encoding the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains connected by an oligonucleotide. The structural gene is inserted into an expression vector, which is subsequently introduced into a host cell such as \nE. coli\n. The recombinant host cells synthesize a single polypeptide chain with a linker peptide bridging the two V domains. Methods for producing sFvs are known in the art (see Whitlow et al., \nMethods: a Companion to Methods in Enzymology\n, Vol. 2, page 97, 1991; Bird et al., \nScience \n242:423, 1988; U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Pack et al., \nBio/Technology \n11:1271, 1993; and Sandhu, supra).\n\n\nAntibody fragments can be prepared by proteolytic hydrolysis of the antibody or by expression in \nE. coli \nof DNA encoding the fragment. Antibody fragments can be obtained by pepsin or papain digestion of whole antibodies by conventional methods. For example, antibody fragments can be produced by enzymatic cleavage of antibodies with pepsin to provide a 5S fragment denoted F(ab′)\n2\n. This fragment can be further cleaved using a thiol reducing agent, and optionally a blocking group for the sulfhydryl groups resulting from cleavage of disulfide linkages, to produce 3.5S Fab′ monovalent fragments. Alternatively, an enzymatic cleavage using pepsin produces two monovalent Fab′ fragments and an Fc fragment directly (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,036,945 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,647, and references contained therein; Nisonhoff et al., \nArch. Biochem. Biophys. \n89:230, 1960; Porter, \nBiochem. J. \n73:119, 1959; Edelman et al., \nMethods in Enzymology\n, Vol. 1, page 422, Academic Press, 1967; and Coligan et al. at sections 2.8.1-2.8.10 and 2.10.1-2.10.4).\n\n\nOther methods of cleaving antibodies, such as separation of heavy chains to form monovalent light-heavy chain fragments, further cleavage of fragments, or other enzymatic, chemical, or genetic techniques may also be used, so long as the fragments bind to the antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody.\n\n\nOne of skill will realize that conservative variants of the antibodies can be produced. Such conservative variants employed in antibody fragments, such as dsFv fragments or in scFv fragments, will retain critical amino acid residues necessary for correct folding and stabilizing between the V\nH \nand the V\nL \nregions, and will retain the charge characteristics of the residues in order to preserve the low pI and low toxicity of the molecules. Amino acid substitutions (such as at most one, at most two, at most three, at most four, or at most five amino acid substitutions) can be made in the V\nH \nand the V\nL \nregions to increase yield. Conservative amino acid substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The following six groups are examples of amino acids that are considered to be conservative substitutions for one another:\n\n\n1) Alanine (A), Serine (S), Threonine (T);\n\n\n2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E);\n\n\n3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q);\n\n\n4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K);\n\n\n5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); and\n\n\n6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W).\n\n\nThus, one of skill in the art can readily review SEQ ID NOs: 1-6, or the sequences of the F1, F44 and/or F54 antibody, locate one or more of the amino acids in the brief table above, identify a conservative substitution, and produce the conservative variant using well-known molecular techniques.\n\n\nEffector molecules, such as therapeutic, diagnostic, or detection moieties can be linked to an antibody that specifically binds IRTA2, using any number of means known to those of skill in the art. Both covalent and noncovalent attachment means may be used. The procedure for attaching an effector molecule to an antibody varies according to the chemical structure of the effector. Polypeptides typically contain a variety of functional groups; e.g., carboxylic acid (COOH), free amine (—NH\n2\n) or sulfhydryl (—SH) groups, which are available for reaction with a suitable functional group on an antibody to result in the binding of the effector molecule. Alternatively, the antibody is derivatized to expose or attach additional reactive functional groups. The derivatization may involve attachment of any of a number of linker molecules such as those available from Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Ill. The linker can be any molecule used to join the antibody to the effector molecule. The linker is capable of forming covalent bonds to both the antibody and to the effector molecule. Suitable linkers are well known to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, straight or branched-chain carbon linkers, heterocyclic carbon linkers, or peptide linkers. Where the antibody and the effector molecule are polypeptides, the linkers may be joined to the constituent amino acids through their side groups (e.g., through a disulfide linkage to cysteine) or to the alpha carbon amino and carboxyl groups of the terminal amino acids.\n\n\nIn some circumstances, it is desirable to free the effector molecule from the antibody when the immunoconjugate has reached its target site. Therefore, in these circumstances, immunoconjugates will comprise linkages that are cleavable in the vicinity of the target site. Cleavage of the linker to release the effector molecule from the antibody may be prompted by enzymatic activity or conditions to which the immunoconjugate is subjected either inside the target cell or in the vicinity of the target site. When the target site is a tumor, a linker which is cleavable under conditions present at the tumor site (e.g. when exposed to tumor-associated enzymes or acidic pH) may be used.\n\n\nIn view of the large number of methods that have been reported for attaching a variety of radiodiagnostic compounds, radiotherapeutic compounds, label (e.g. enzymes or fluorescent molecules) drugs, toxins, and other agents to antibodies one skilled in the art will be able to determine a suitable method for attaching a given agent to an antibody or other polypeptide.\n\n\nTherapeutic agents include various drugs such as vinblastine, daunomycin and the like, and effector molecules such as cytotoxins such as native or modified \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin or Diphtheria toxin, encapsulating agents, (e.g., liposomes) which themselves contain pharmacological compositions, target moieties and ligands. The choice of a particular therapeutic agent depends on the particular target molecule or cell and the biological effect desired to be evoked. Thus, for example, the therapeutic agent may be an effector molecule that is cytotoxin which is used to bring about the death of a particular target cell. Conversely, where it is merely desired to invoke a non-lethal biological response, a therapeutic agent can be conjugated to a non-lethal pharmacological agent or a liposome containing a non-lethal pharmacological agent.\n\n\nToxins can be employed with antibodies that specifically bind IRTA2 and fragments of these antibodies, such as a svFv or a dsFv, to yield chimeric molecules, which are of use as immunotoxins. Exemplary toxins include \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin (PE), ricin, abrin, diphtheria toxin and subunits thereof, ribotoxin, ribonuclease, saporin, and calicheamicin, as well as botulinum toxins A through F. These toxins are well known in the art and many are readily available from commercial sources (for example, Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.).\n\n\nDiphtheria toxin is isolated from \nCorynebacterium diphtheriae\n. Typically, diphtheria toxin for use in immunotoxins is mutated to reduce or to eliminate non-specific toxicity. A mutant known as CRM107, which has full enzymatic activity but markedly reduced non-specific toxicity, has been known since the 1970's (Laird and Groman, \nJ. Virol. \n19:220, 1976), and has been used in human clinical trials. See, U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,458 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,021. As used herein, the term “diphtheria toxin” refers as appropriate to native diphtheria toxin or to diphtheria toxin that retains enzymatic activity but which has been modified to reduce non-specific toxicity.\n\n\nRicin is the lectin RCA60 from \nRicinus communis \n(Castor bean). The term “ricin” also references toxic variants thereof. For example, see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,079,163 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,401. \nRicinus communis \nagglutinin (RCA) occurs in two forms designated RCA\n60 \nand RCA\n120 \naccording to their molecular weights of approximately 65 and 120 kD, respectively (Nicholson & Blaustein, \nJ. Biochim. Biophys. Acta \n266:543, 1972). The A chain is responsible for inactivating protein synthesis and killing cells. The B chain binds ricin to cell-surface galactose residues and facilitates transport of the A chain into the cytosol (Olsnes et al., \nNature \n249:627-631, 1974 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,060,165).\n\n\nRibonucleases have also been conjugated to targeting molecules for use as immunotoxins (see Suzuki et al., \nNat Biotech \n17:265-70, 1999). Exemplary ribotoxins such as α-sarcin and restrictocin are discussed in, e.g., Rathore et al., \nGene \n190:31-5, 1997; and Goyal and Batra, \nBiochem \n345 Pt 2:247-54, 2000. Calicheamicins were first isolated from \nMicromonospora echinospora \nand are members of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic family that cause double strand breaks in DNA that lead to apoptosis (see, e.g., Lee et al., \nJ. Antibiot \n42:1070-87. 1989). The drug is the toxic moiety of an immunotoxin in clinical trials (see, e.g., Gillespie et al., \nAnn Oncol \n11:73541, 2000).\n\n\nAbrin includes toxic lectins from \nAbrus precatorius\n. The toxic principles, abrin a, b, c, and d, have a molecular weight of from about 63 and 67 kD and are composed of two disulfide-linked polypeptide chains A and B. The A chain inhibits protein synthesis; the B chain (abrin-b) binds to D-galactose residues (see, Funatsu et al., \nAgr. Biol. Chem. \n52:1095, 1988; and Olsnes, \nMethods Enzymol. \n50:330-335, 1978).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the toxin is \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin (PE). Native \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin A (“PE”) is an extremely active monomeric protein (\nmolecular weight\n 66 kD), secreted by \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n, which inhibits protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The native PE sequence and the sequence of modified PE are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,095, incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, native PE has a sequence set forth as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 18)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAEEAFDLWNE CAKACVLDLK DGVRSSRMSV DPAIADTNGQ GVLHYSMVLE GGNDALKLAI\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDNALSITSDG LTIRLEGGVE PNKPVRYSYT RQARGSWSLN WLVPIGHEKP SNIKVFIHEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNAGNQLSHMS PIYTIEMGDE LLAKLARDAT FFVRAHESNE MQPTLAISHA GVSVVMAQTQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRREKRWSEW ASGKVLCLLD PLDGVYNYLA QQRCNLDDTW EGKIYRVLAG NPAKHDLDIK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPTVISHRLHP PEGGSLAALT AHQACHLPLE TFTRHRQPRG WEQLEQCGYP VQRLVALYLA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nARLSWNQVDQ VIRNALASPG SGGDLGEATR EQPEQARLAL TLAAAESERF VRQGTGNDEA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGAANADVVSL TCPVATGECA GPADSGDALL ERNYPTGAEF LGDGGDVSFS TRGTQNWTVE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRLLQAHRQLE ERGYVFVGYH GTFLEAAQSI VFGGVRARSQ DLDAIWRGFY IAGDPALAYG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYAQDQEPDAR GRIRNGALLR VYVPRSSLPG FYRTSLTLAA PEAAGEVERL IGHPLPLRLD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAITGPEEEGG RLETILGWPL AERTVVIPSA IPTDPRNVGG DLDPSSIPDK EQAISALPDY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nASQPGKPPRE DLK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe method of action of PE is inactivation of the ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2). The exotoxin contains three structural domains that act in concert to cause cytotoxicity. Domain Ia (amino acids 1-252) mediates cell binding. Domain II (amino acids 253-364) is responsible for translocation into the cytosol and domain III (amino acids 400-613) mediates ADP ribosylation of \nelongation factor\n 2. The function of domain Ib (amino acids 365-399) remains undefined, although a large part of it, amino acids 365-380, can be deleted without loss of cytotoxicity. See Siegall et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n264:14256-14261, 1989.\n\n\nThe term “\nPseudomonas \nexotoxin” (“PE”) as used herein refers as appropriate to a full-length native (naturally occurring) PE or to a PE that has been modified. Such modifications may include, but are not limited to, elimination of domain Ia, various amino acid deletions in domains Ib, II and III, single amino acid substitutions and the addition of one or more sequences at the carboxyl terminus, such as KDEL (SEQ ID NO: 19) and REDL (SEQ ID NO: 20), see Siegall et al., supra and SEQ ID NO: 55 and SEQ ID NO: 56. In several examples, the cytotoxic fragment of PE retains at least 50%, preferably 75%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably 95% of the cytotoxicity of native PE. In one embodiment, the cytotoxic fragment is more toxic than native PE.\n\n\nThus, the PE used in the immunotoxins disclosed herein includes the native sequence, cytotoxic fragments of the native sequence, and conservatively modified variants of native PE and its cytotoxic fragments. Cytotoxic fragments of PE include those which are cytotoxic with or without subsequent proteolytic or other processing in the target cell (e.g., as a protein or pre-protein). Cytotoxic fragments of PE known in the art include PE40, PE38, and PE35.\n\n\nIn several embodiments, the PE has been modified to reduce or eliminate non-specific cell binding, typically by deleting domain Ia (PE40; SEQ ID NO: 53), as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,892,827, although this can also be achieved, for example, by mutating certain residues of domain Ia. U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,658, for instance, discloses that a mutated PE in which Domain Ia is present but in which the basic residues of domain Ia at \npositions\n 57, 246, 247, and 249 are replaced with acidic residues (glutamic acid, or “E”) exhibits greatly diminished non-specific cytotoxicity. This mutant form of PE is sometimes referred to as PE4E (SEQ ID NO: 57).\n\n\nPE40 is a truncated derivative of PE (see, Pai et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n88:3358-62, 1991; and Kondo et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n263:9470-9475, 1988). PE35 is a 35 kD carboxyl-terminal fragment of PE in which amino acid residues 1-279 have been deleted and the molecule commences with a met at position 280 followed by amino acids 281-364 and 381-613 of native PE. PE35 and PE40 are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,095 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,892,827.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the cytotoxic fragment PE38 (SEQ ID NO: 54) is employed. PE38 is a truncated PE pro-protein composed of amino acids 253-364 and 381-613 of SEQ ID NO: 18 which is activated to its cytotoxic form upon processing within a cell (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,608,039, and Pastan et al., \nBiochim. Biophys.

Nucleic acids encoding the amino acid sequences of the antibodies produced by F1, F44 and F54 can be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In addition, one of skill can readily construct a variety of clones containing functionally equivalent nucleic acids, such as nucleic acids which differ in sequence but which encode the same effector molecule (“EM”) or antibody sequence. Thus, nucleic acids encoding antibodies, conjugates and fusion proteins are provided herein.\n\n\nNucleic acid sequences encoding the antibodies and/or immunotoxins can be prepared by any suitable method including, for example, cloning of appropriate sequences or by direct chemical synthesis by methods such as the phosphotriester method of Narang et al., \nMeth. Enzymol. \n68:90-99, 1979; the phosphodiester method of Brown et al., \nMeth. Enzymol. \n68:109-151, 1979; the diethylphosphoramidite method of Beaucage et al., \nTetra. Lett. \n22:1859-1862, 1981; the solid phase phosphoramidite triester method described by Beaucage & Caruthers, \nTetra. Letts. \n22(20):1859-1862, 1981, e.g., using an automated synthesizer as described in, for example, Needham-VanDevanter et al., \nNucl. Acids Res. \n12:6159-6168, 1984; and, the solid support method of U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,066. Chemical synthesis produces a single stranded oligonucleotide. This can be converted into double stranded DNA by hybridization with a complementary sequence, or by polymerization with a DNA polymerase using the single strand as a template. One of skill would recognize that while chemical synthesis of DNA is generally limited to sequences of about 100 bases, longer sequences may be obtained by the ligation of shorter sequences.\n\n\nExemplary nucleic acids encoding sequences encoding an antibody that specifically binds IRTA2, such as an immunotoxin, can be prepared by cloning techniques. Examples of appropriate cloning and sequencing techniques, and instructions sufficient to direct persons of skill through many cloning exercises are found in Sambrook et al., supra, Berger and Kimmel (eds.), supra, and Ausubel, supra. Product information from manufacturers of biological reagents and experimental equipment also provide useful information. Such manufacturers include the SIGMA Chemical Company (Saint Louis, Mo.), R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.), Pharmacia Amersham (Piscataway, N.J.), CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, Calif.), Chem Genes Corp., Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, Wis.), Glen Research, Inc., GIBCO BRL Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, Md.), Fluka Chemica-Biochemika Analytika (Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland), Invitrogen (San Diego, Calif.), and Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.), as well as many other commercial sources known to one of skill.\n\n\nNucleic acids can also be prepared by amplification methods. Amplification methods include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the ligase chain reaction (LCR), the transcription-based amplification system (TAS), the self-sustained sequence replication system (3SR). A wide variety of cloning methods, host cells, and in vitro amplification methodologies are well known to persons of skill.\n\n\nIn one example, an antibody of use is prepared by inserting the cDNA which encodes a variable region from an antibody that specifically binds IRTA2 into a vector which comprises the cDNA encoding an effector molecule (EM). The insertion is made so that the variable region and the EM are read in frame so that one continuous polypeptide is produced. Thus, the encoded polypeptide contains a functional Fv region and a functional EM region. In one embodiment, cDNA encoding a cytotoxin is ligated to a scFv so that the cytotoxin is located at the carboxyl terminus of the scFv. In one example, cDNA encoding a \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin (“PE”), mutated to eliminate or to reduce non-specific binding, is ligated to a scFv so that the toxin is located at the amino terminus of the scFv. In another example, PE38 is located at the amino terminus of the scFv. In a further example, cDNA encoding a cytotoxin is ligated to a heavy chain variable region of an antibody that specifically binds IRTA2, so that the cytoxin is located at the carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain variable region. The heavy chain-variable region can subsequently be ligated to a light chain variable region of the antibody that specifically binds IRTA2 using disulfide bonds. In a yet another example, cDNA encoding a cytotoxin is ligated to a light chain variable region of an antibody that binds IRTa2, so that the cytotoxin is located at the carboxyl terminus of the light chain variable region. The light chain-variable region can subsequently be ligated to a heavy chain variable region of the antibody that specifically binds IRTA2 using disulfide bonds.\n\n\nOnce the nucleic acids encoding the immunotoxin, antibody, or fragment thereof are isolated and cloned, the protein can be expressed in a recombinantly engineered cell such as bacteria, plant, yeast, insect and mammalian cells. One or more DNA sequences encoding the immunotoxin, antibody, or fragment thereof can be expressed in vitro by DNA transfer into a suitable host cell. The cell may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic. The term also includes any progeny of the subject host cell. It is understood that all progeny may not be identical to the parental cell since there may be mutations that occur during replication. Methods of stable transfer, meaning that the foreign DNA is continuously maintained in the host, are known in the art.\n\n\nPolynucleotide sequences encoding the immunotoxin, antibody, or fragment thereof, can be operatively linked to expression control sequences. An expression control sequence operatively linked to a coding sequence is ligated such that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the expression control sequences. The expression control sequences include, but are not limited to appropriate promoters, enhancers, transcription terminators, a start codon (i.e., ATG) in front of a protein-encoding gene, splicing signal for introns, maintenance of the correct reading frame of that gene to permit proper translation of mRNA, and stop codons.\n\n\nThe polynucleotide sequences encoding the immunotoxin, antibody, or fragment thereof can be inserted into an expression vector including, but not limited to a plasmid, virus or other vehicle that can be manipulated to allow insertion or incorporation of sequences and can be expressed in either prokaryotes or eukaryotes. Hosts can include microbial, yeast, insect and mammalian organisms. Methods of expressing DNA sequences having eukaryotic or viral sequences in prokaryotes are well known in the art. Biologically functional viral and plasmid DNA vectors capable of expression and replication in a host are known in the art.\n\n\nTransformation of a host cell with recombinant DNA may be carried out by conventional techniques as are well known to those skilled in the art. Where the host is prokaryotic, such as \nE. coli\n, competent cells which are capable of DNA uptake can be prepared from cells harvested after exponential growth phase and subsequently treated by the CaCl\n2 \nmethod using procedures well known in the art. Alternatively, MgCl\n2 \nor RbCl can be used. Transformation can also be performed after forming a protoplast of the host cell if desired, or by electroporation.\n\n\nWhen the host is a eukaryote, such methods of transfection of DNA as calcium phosphate coprecipitates, conventional mechanical procedures such as microinjection, electroporation, insertion of a plasmid encased in liposomes, or virus vectors may be used. Eukaryotic cells can also be cotransformed with polynucleotide sequences encoding the immunotoxin, antibody, or fragment thereof, and a second foreign DNA molecule encoding a selectable phenotype, such as the herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene. Another method is to use a eukaryotic viral vector, such as simian virus 40 (SV40) or bovine papilloma virus, to transiently infect or transform eukaryotic cells and express the protein (see for example, \nEukaryotic Viral Vectors\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Gluzman ed., 1982). One of skill in the art can readily use an expression systems such as plasmids and vectors of use in producing proteins in cells including higher eukaryotic cells such as the COS, CHO, HeLa and myeloma cell lines.\n\n\nIsolation and purification of recombinantly expressed polypeptide can be carried out by conventional means including preparative chromatography and immunological separations. Once expressed, the recombinant immunotoxins can be purified according to standard procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity columns, column chromatography, and the like (see, generally, R. Scopes, \nProtein Purification\n, Springer-Verlag, N.Y., 1982). Substantially pure compositions of at least about 90 to 95% homogeneity are disclosed herein, and 98 to 99% or more homogeneity can be used for pharmaceutical purposes. Once purified, partially or to homogeneity as desired, if to be used therapeutically, the polypeptides should be substantially free of endotoxin.\n\n\nMethods for expression of single chain antibodies and/or refolding to an appropriate active form, including single chain antibodies, from bacteria such as \nE. coli \nhave been described and are well-known and are applicable to the antibodies disclosed herein. See, Buchner et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n205:263-270, 1992; Pluckthun, \nBiotechnology \n9:545, 1991; Huse et al., \nScience \n246:1275, 1989 and Ward et al., \nNature \n341:544, 1989, all incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nOften, functional heterologous proteins from \nE. coli \nor other bacteria are isolated from inclusion bodies and require solubilization using strong denaturants, and subsequent refolding. During the solubilization step, as is well known in the art, a reducing agent must be present to separate disulfide bonds. An exemplary buffer with a reducing agent is: 0.1 \nM Tris pH\n 8, 6 M guanidine, 2 mM EDTA, 0.3 M DTE (dithioerythritol). Reoxidation of the disulfide bonds can occur in the presence of low molecular weight thiol reagents in reduced and oxidized form, as described in Saxena et al., \nBiochemistry \n9: 5015-5021, 1970, incorporated by reference herein, and especially as described by Buchner et al., supra.\n\n\nRenaturation is typically accomplished by dilution (e.g., 100-fold) of the denatured and reduced protein into refolding buffer. An exemplary buffer is 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 M \nL\n-arginine, 8 mM oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and 2 mM EDTA.\n\n\nAs a modification to the two chain antibody purification protocol, the heavy and light chain regions are separately solubilized and reduced and then combined in the refolding solution. An exemplary yield is obtained when these two proteins are mixed in a molar ratio such that a 5 fold molar excess of one protein over the other is not exceeded. It is desirable to add excess oxidized glutathione or other oxidizing low molecular weight compounds to the refolding solution after the redox-shuffling is completed.\n\n\nIn addition to recombinant methods, the immunotoxins, EM, and antibodies disclosed herein can also be constructed in whole or in part using standard peptide synthesis. Solid phase synthesis of the polypeptides of less than about 50 amino acids in length can be accomplished by attaching the C-terminal amino acid of the sequence to an insoluble support followed by sequential addition of the remaining amino acids in the sequence. Techniques for solid phase synthesis are described by Barany & Merrifield, \nThe Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology. Vol. \n2\n: Special Methods in Peptide Synthesis, Part A\n. pp. 3-284; Merrifield et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n85:2149-2156, 1963, and Stewart et al., \nSolid Phase Peptide Synthesis, \n2nd ed., Pierce Chem. Co., Rockford, Ill., 1984. Proteins of greater length may be synthesized by condensation of the amino and carboxyl termini of shorter fragments. Methods of forming peptide bonds by activation of a carboxyl terminal end (e.g., by the use of the coupling reagent N,N′-dicycylohexylcarbodiimide) are well known in the art.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions and Therapeutic Methods\n\n\nCompositions are provided that include one or more of the antibodies that specifically bind IRTA2 (for example, an immunotoxin) that are disclosed herein in a carrier. The compositions can be prepared in unit dosage forms for administration to a subject. The amount and timing of administration are at the discretion of the treating physician to achieve the desired purposes. The antibody can be formulated for systemic or local (such as intra-tumor) administration. In one example, the antibody that specifically binds IRTA2 is formulated for parenteral administration, such as intravenous administration. Any of the antibodies disclosed herein, variants thereof and humanized forms thereof can be used in these methods.\n\n\nThe compositions for administration can include a solution of the antibody that specifically binds IRTA2 dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as an aqueous carrier. A variety of aqueous carriers can be used, e.g., buffered saline and the like. These solutions are sterile and generally free of undesirable matter. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional, well known sterilization techniques. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, toxicity adjusting agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium lactate and the like. The concentration of antibody in these formulations can vary widely, and will be selected primarily based on fluid volumes, viscosities, body weight and the like in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected and the subject's needs.\n\n\nA typical pharmaceutical composition for intravenous administration includes about 0.1 to 10 mg of antibody per subject per day. Dosages from 0.1 up to about 100 mg per subject per day may be used, particularly if the agent is administered to a secluded site and not into the circulatory or lymph system, such as into a body cavity or into a lumen of an organ. Actual methods for preparing administrable compositions will be known or apparent to those skilled in the art and are described in more detail in such publications as \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Science, \n19th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1995).\n\n\nAntibodies may be provided in lyophilized form and rehydrated with sterile water before administration, although they are also provided in sterile solutions of known concentration. The antibody solution is then added to an infusion bag containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride, USP, and typically administered at a dosage of from 0.5 to 15 mg/kg of body weight. Considerable experience is available in the art in the administration of antibody drugs, which have been marketed in the U.S. since the approval of Rituxan® in 1997. Antibody drugs can be administered by slow infusion, rather than in an intravenous push or bolus. In one example, a higher loading dose is administered, with subsequent, maintenance doses being administered at a lower level. For example, an initial loading dose of 4 mg/kg may be infused over a period of some 90 minutes, followed by weekly maintenance doses for 4-8 weeks of 2 mg/kg infused over a 30 minute period if the previous dose was well tolerated.\n\n\nThe antibody that specifically binds IRTA2 can be administered to slow or inhibit the growth of cells, such as tumor cells. In one embodiment, a method is provided for inhibiting the growth of a B cell of a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or a hairy cell leukemia. The method includes contacting the cell with an effective amount of at least one antibody disclosed herein conjugated to an effector molecule.\n\n\nMethods for measuring cell growth are well known in the art (see, for example, Lewis et al. (1996) \nCancer Res. \n56:1457-65; Tian et al. (2001) \nNutrition and Cancer \n40:180-184). The method may be performed in vivo or in vitro.\n\n\nA method is also provided for treating a hairy cell leukemia or a B cell lymphoma in a subject, including administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of at least one antibody disclosed herein conjugated to an effector molecule. In these applications, a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody-effector molecule conjugate, such as an immunotoxin, is administered to a subject in an amount sufficient to inhibit growth of antigen-expressing cells. Suitable subjects include those with a tumor, such as a B cell malignancy (such as a lymphoma or leukemia). These malignancies include B cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Burkitt's lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, diffuse large cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and hairy cell leukemia and follicular lymphoma. Thus, suitable subjects include subjects that have hairy cell leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n\nAmounts effective for this use will depend upon the severity of the disease and the general state of the patient's health. A therapeutically effective amount of the antibody is that which provides either subjective relief of a symptom(s) or an objectively identifiable improvement as noted by the clinician or other qualified observer. These compositions can be administered in conjunction with another chemotherapeutic agent, either simultaneously or sequentially.\n\n\nSingle or multiple administrations of the compositions are administered depending on the dosage and frequency as required and tolerated by the patient. In any event, the composition should provide a sufficient quantity of at least one of the antibodies disclosed herein, such as an immunotoxin, to effectively treat the patient. The dosage can be administered once but may be applied periodically until either a therapeutic result is achieved or until side effects warrant discontinuation of therapy. In one example, a dose of the antibody, such as an immunotoxin, is infused for thirty minutes every other day. In this example, about one to about ten doses can be administered, such as three or six doses can be administered every other day. In a further example, a continuous infusion is administered for about five to about ten days. The subject can be treated with the immunotoxin at regular intervals, such as monthly, until a desired therapeutic result is achieved. Generally, the dose is sufficient to treat or ameliorate symptoms or signs of disease without producing unacceptable toxicity to the patient.\n\n\nControlled release parenteral formulations can be made as implants, oily injections, or as particulate systems. For a broad overview of protein delivery systems see, Banga, A. J., \nTherapeutic Peptides and Proteins: Formulation, Processing, and Delivery Systems\n, Technomic Publishing Company, Inc., Lancaster, Pa., (1995) incorporated herein by reference. Particulate systems include microspheres, microparticles, microcapsules, nanocapsules, nanospheres, and nanoparticles. Microcapsules contain the therapeutic protein, such as a cytotoxin or a drug, as a central core. In microspheres the therapeutic is dispersed throughout the particle. Particles, microspheres, and microcapsules smaller than about 1 μm are generally referred to as nanoparticles, nanospheres, and nanocapsules, respectively. Capillaries have a diameter of approximately 5 μm so that only nanoparticles are administered intravenously. Microparticles are typically around 100 μm in diameter and are administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. See, e.g., Kreuter, J., \nColloidal Drug Delivery Systems\n, J. Kreuter, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., pp. 219-342 (1994); and Tice & Tabibi, \nTreatise on Controlled Drug Delivery\n, A. Kydonieus, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York, N.Y., pp. 315-339, (1992) both of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nPolymers can be used for ion-controlled release of the antibody compositions disclosed herein. Various degradable and nondegradable polymeric matrices for use in controlled drug delivery are known in the art (Langer, \nAccounts Chem. Res. \n26:537-542, 1993). For example, the block copolymer, polaxamer 407, exists as a viscous yet mobile liquid at low temperatures but forms a semisolid gel at body temperature. It has been shown to be an effective vehicle for formulation and sustained delivery of recombinant interleukin-2 and urease (Johnston et al., \nPharm. Res. \n9:425-434, 1992; and Pec et al., \nJ. Parent. Sci. Tech. \n44(2):58-65, 1990). Alternatively, hydroxyapatite has been used as a microcarrier for controlled release of proteins (Ijntema et al., \nInt. J. Pharm. \n112:215-224, 1994). In yet another aspect, liposomes are used for controlled release as well as drug targeting of the lipid-capsulated drug (Betageri et al., Liposome \nDrug Delivery Systems\n, Technomic Publishing Co., Inc., Lancaster, Pa. (1993)). Numerous additional systems for controlled delivery of therapeutic proteins are known (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,055,303; U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,837; U.S. Pat. No. 4,235,871; U.S. Pat.

No. 5,534,496).\n\n\nAmong various uses of the antibodies disclosed herein are disease conditions caused by specific human cells that may be eliminated by the toxic action of an immunotoxin, such as the treatment of malignant cells, including hairy cell leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, expressing IRTA2.\n\n\nDiagnostic Methods and Kits\n\n\nIt is disclosed herein that IRTA2 is expressed in hairy leukemia cells and by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells. Thus, expression of IRTA2 can be used to diagnose hairy cell leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or can be used to stage these cancers. Thus, methods are provided for detecting B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or hairy cell leukemia in a subject. The method includes contacting a biological sample from the subject with at least one antibody that specifically binds IRTA2, and detecting the presence of bound antibody. In one example, soluble IRTA2 is detected.\n\n\nA method is also provided herein for detecting IRTA2 in a biological sample. The method includes contacting the sample with one or more of an antibody that specifically binds IRTA2, such as F1, F25, F44, F54 or F119 (or a variant thereof) to form an antibody-IRTA2 complex. The presence or absence of the complex is detected. In one example, the method detects the presence of soluble IRTA2. It should be noted that the method can also include the use of any antibody disclosed in Table 4 or listed in \nFIG. 8\n, or a humanized form thereof, or a variant thereof, wherein the antibody binds an epitope of IRTA2.\n\n\nThe sample can be any sample, including, but not limited to, tissue from biopsies, autopsies and pathology specimens. Biological samples also include sections of tissues, such as frozen sections taken for histological purposes. Biological samples further include body fluids, such as blood, serum, spinal fluid or urine. A biological sample is typically obtained from a mammal, such as a rat, mouse, cow, dog, guinea pig, rabbit, or primate. In one embodiment, the primate is macaque, chimpanzee, or a human. In a further embodiment, the subject has a B cell malignancy, such as hairy cell leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or is suspected of having such a B cell malignancy.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a method is provided for detecting IRTA2 in a biological sample, such as a blood, serum, or plasma sample. Kits for detecting a polypeptide will typically comprise an antibody that specifically binds IRTA2, as disclosed herein.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, an antibody fragment, such as an Fv fragment is included in the kit. For in vivo uses, the antibody can be a scFv fragment. In a further embodiment, the antibody is labeled (such as with a fluorescent, radioactive, or an enzymatic label).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a kit includes instructional materials disclosing means of use of an antibody that specifically binds IRTA2. The instructional materials may be written, in an electronic form (e.g. computer diskette or compact disk) or may be visual (e.g. video files). The kits may also include additional components to facilitate the particular application for which the kit is designed. Thus, for example, the kit may additionally contain means of detecting a label (such as enzyme substrates for enzymatic labels, filter sets to detect fluorescent labels, appropriate secondary labels such as a secondary antibody, or the like). The kits may additionally include buffers and other reagents routinely used for the practice of a particular method. Such kits and appropriate contents are well known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the diagnostic kit comprises an immunoassay. Although the details of the immunoassays may vary with the particular format employed, the method of detecting a IRTA2 in a biological sample generally includes the steps of contacting the biological sample with an antibody which specifically reacts, under immunologically reactive conditions, to an IRTA2 polypeptide. The antibody is allowed to specifically bind under immunologically reactive conditions to form an immune complex, and the presence of the immune complex (bound antibody) is detected directly or indirectly.\n\n\nMethods of determining the presence or absence of a cell surface marker are well known in the art. For example, the antibodies can be conjugated to other compounds including, but not limited to, enzymes, magnetic beads, colloidal magnetic beads, haptens, fluorochromes, metal compounds, radioactive compounds or drugs. The antibodies can also be utilized in immunoassays such as but not limited to radioimmunoassays (RIAs), enzyme linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA), or immunohistochemical assays. The antibodies can also be used for fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A FACS employs a plurality of color channels, low angle and obtuse light-scattering detection channels, and impedance channels, among other more sophisticated levels of detection, to separate or sort cells (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,620).\n\n\nThe antibodies of use in the methods provided include any of the antibodies described above. These antibodies include, but are not limited to, an F1, F44, or F54 antibody (produced by a hybridoma or progeny thereof deposited as ATCC Deposit No. PTA-7047; ATCC Deposit No. PTA-7046, or ATCC Deposit No. PTA-7048) or a humanized form thereof. The antibodies of use in the methods disclosed herein also include an antibody that includes both a light and heavy chain with CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3, wherein L-CDR1 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 31 to 35 of SEQ ID NO:5, L-CDR2 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 50 to 66 of SEQ ID NO:5, and L-CDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as amino acids NO:5, and L-CDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 96 to 101 SEQ ID NO:5, and wherein H-CDR1 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 24 to 34 of SEQ ID NO:6, H-CDR2 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 50 to 56 of SEQ ID NO:6, and H-CDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as amino acids 89-97 of SEQ ID NO:6. The antibodies of use in the methods disclosed herein also include an antibody that includes both a light and heavy chain with CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3, wherein L-CDR1 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 31 to 35 of SEQ ID NO:1, L-CDR2 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 50 to 65 of SEQ ID NO:1, and L-CDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 95 to 105 of SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein H-CDR1 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 24 to 35 of SEQ ID NO:2, H-CDR2 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 51 to 57 of SEQ ID NO:2, and H-CDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as amino acids 90 to 98 of SEQ ID NO:2. The antibodies of use in the methods disclosed herein also include an antibody that includes antibody comprises both a light and heavy chain with CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3, wherein H-CDR1 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 31 to 35 of SEQ ID NO:3, H CDR2 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 50 to 65 of SEQ ID NO:3, and H-CDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as amino acids 100-107 of SEQ ID NO:3, and wherein L-CDR1 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 24 to 34 of SEQ ID NO:4, L-CDR2 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 50 to 56 of SEQ ID NO:4 and L-CDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as amino acids 89 to 97 of SEQ ID NO:4. One or more of these antibodies may be used in the methods provided herein.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the method is a sandwich ELISA. A sandwich ELISA requires two antibodies that bind to epitopes that do not overlap on the antigen. This can be accomplished with either two monoclonal antibodies that recognize discrete sites on the antigen of interest, such as IRTA2. To utilize this assay, one antibody (the “capture” antibody) is bound to a solid phase, such as but not limited to the bottom of a well on a microtiter plate, such as a 24, 48 or 96 well plate of polyvinylchloride (PVC). A sample, possibly including the antigen of interest (IRTA2 or a soluble form thereof) is then added and allowed to complex with the bound antibody. Unbound material is then removed with a wash, and a labeled second antibody (the “detection” antibody) is allowed to bind to the antigen, thus completing the “sandwich.” The assay can be quantitated by measuring the amount of labeled second antibody bound to the matrix, through the use of a substrate, such as a colorimetric substrate. Exemplary non-limiting enzymes are those that convert a colorless substrate to a colored product, such as p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP), which is converted to the yellow p-nitrophenol by alkaline phosphatase. Substrates used with peroxidase include 2,2′-azo-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), o-phenylenediamine (OPD) and 3,3′5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine base (TMB), which yield green, orange and blue colors, respectively.\n\n\nWithout being bound by theory, it is believed that an advantage of this method is that the antigen does not need to be purified prior to use, and that these assays are very specific. It should be noted that monoclonal antibody combinations must be paired, indicating that each monoclonal antibody that binds the antigen of interest (IRTA2) specifically binds a distinct epitopes on the antigen (IRTA2) in order to maximize sensitivity.\n\n\nProtocols for sandwich ELISAs are well known in the art. One exemplary non-limiting protocol includes binding a purified unlabeled antibody to the bottom of each well on a plate by adding approximately 50 μL of antibody solution to each well (20 μg/mL in PBS). Generally, PVC will bind approximately 100 ng/well (300 ng/cm\n2\n); at least 1 μg/well can be utilized. The plates are incubated for a sufficient time to allow the antibody to bind, such as overnight at 4° C. The wells are then washed with a buffer, such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove unbound antibody. Any remaining sites for protein binding on the microtiter plate are saturated by incubating with blocking buffer. For example, for assays that do not utilize horseradish peroxidase, the wells are 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS with 0.02% sodium azide, and incubated for 2 hours to overnight in a humid atmosphere at room temperature. The sample of interest is then added, such as in a volume of about 50 μL. If dilution is required, dilutions can be made in the blocking buffer (3% BSA/PBS). Incubate for at least 2 hours at room temperature in a humid atmosphere. The wells are then washed, and the labeled second antibody is added. Generally, for accurate quantitation, the second antibody diluted in blocking buffer and is used in excess. The wells are incubated for about 2 hours (or more) and the unbound labeled second antibody is removed by washing with buffer, such as PBS. A commercially available substrate, such as those listed above is then added to the wells and incubated according the manufacturer's instructions. Optical densities at target wavelengths can be measured on a commercially available ELISA plate reader.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the method includes contacting a first antibody adhered to a solid support with a sample to form an antibody-IRTA2 complex; washing the solid surface to remove any unbound material and contacting the complex with a second antibody. The method includes contacting a second antibody that binds a different epitope of IRTA2 to the sample, washing to remove any unbound second antibody, and detecting the presence of bound second antibody. In one specific, non-limiting example, the antibody is labeled with an enzyme. In another specific non-limiting example, the second antibody is labeled with avidin or biotin. The binding of the second antibody is then detected using biotinylated or avidinated enzyme, respectively. In one example, the enzyme is horseradish perioxidase. In one embodiment, F1 and F25 are utilized in the assay. For example, F1 can be attached to a solid substrate. In another embodiment, F44 and F54 are utilized in the assay. For example, F44 can be attached to a solid substrate.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the method includes using a solid surface comprising a first antibody produced by a hybridoma or a progeny thereof deposited as ATCC Deposit No. XXX, or a humanized form of this antibody. The sample is incubated with the solid surface, and after washing, the solid surface is incubated with a second antibody including both a light and heavy chain with CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3, wherein L-CDR1 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 31 to 35 of SEQ ID NO:5, L-CDR2 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 50 to 66 of SEQ ID NO:5, and L-CDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 96 to 101 SEQ ID NO:5, and wherein H-CDR1 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 24 to 34 of SEQ ID NO:6, H-CDR2 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as \namino acids\n 50 to 56 of SEQ ID NO:6, and H-CDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence set forth as amino acids 89-97 of SEQ ID NO:6. In one example, the second antibody is labeled with biotin. Detection of bound IRTA2 is performed by incubating enzyme bound streptavidin such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) strepavidin, with the solid surface. After washing, a substrate is incubated with the solid surface to detect the presence of bound second antibody, thereby detecting soluble IRTA2.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the method includes using a solid surface comprising an antibody produced by a hybridoma or a progeny thereof deposited as ATCC Deposit No. PTA-7046 or a humanized form thereof. The sample is incubated with the solid surface, and after washing, the solid surface is incubated with a second antibody. The second antibody is produced by a hybridoma or a progeny thereof deposited as ATCC) Deposit No. PTA-7048, or is a humanized form of this antibody. In one example, the second antibody is labeled with biotin. Detection of bound IRTA2 is performed by incubating enzyme bound strepavidin with the solid surface. Detection of bound IRTA2 is performed by incubating enzyme bound streptavidin such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) strepavidin, with the solid surface. After washing a substrate is incubated with the solid surface to detect the presence of bound second antibody, thereby detecting soluble IRTA2.\n\n\nThe disclosure is illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nCells: Nineteen human hematologic cell lines were used in this study (Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Hematological Cell Lines Used in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nReference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEBV\n\n\nor ATCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nOrigin\n\n\nstatus\na\n \n\n\nnumber\nb\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJD38\n\n\nB-NHL\nc\n(undifferentiated)\n\n\n−\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarpas 1106\n\n\nB-NHL (mediastinal lymphoblastic)\n\n\n−\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOCI-Ly2\n\n\nB-NHL (diffuse large cell type)\n\n\n−\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOCI-Ly7\n\n\nB-NHL (diffuse large cell type)\n\n\n−\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOCI-Ly10\n\n\nB-NHL (immunoblastic)\n\n\n−\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSU-DHL-5\n\n\nB-NHL (diffuse large cell,\n\n\n−\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nnoncleaved cell type)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSU-DHL-6\n\n\nB-NHL (diffuse, mixed small\n\n\n−\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nand large cell type)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCA46\n\n\nBurkitt's lymphoma\n\n\n−\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaudi\n\n\nBurkitt's lymphoma\n\n\n+\n\n\nCCL-213\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMALWA\n\n\nBurkitt's lymphoma\n\n\n+\n\n\nCRL-1432\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNC-37\n\n\nBurkitt's lymphoma\n\n\n+\n\n\nCCL-214\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaji\n\n\nBurkitt's lymphoma\n\n\n+\n\n\nCCL-86\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRamos\n\n\nBurkitt's lymphoma\n\n\n−\n\n\nCRL-1596\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCRF-SB\n\n\nLymphoblastic leakemia\n\n\n+\n\n\nCCL-120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \narpas\n 299\n\n\nAnaplastic large cell lymphoma\n\n\n−\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL540\n\n\nHodgkin's disease\n\n\n−\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOLT-4\n\n\nT-cell lymphoma\n\n\n−\n\n\nCRL-1582\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRPMI\n 6666\n\n\nHodgkin's disease\n\n\n+\n\n\nCCL-113\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU-937\n\n\nHistiocytic lymphoma\n\n\n−\n\n\nCRL-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1593.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nEBV, Epstein-Barr virus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\nATCC, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA 20208, http://www.atcc.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nC\nB-NHL, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCA46, CCRF-SB, JD38, MOLT-4, NAMALWA, NC-37, Raji, Ramos, \nRPMI\n 6666, SU-DHL-5, SU-DHL-6 and U-937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, Utah).

The primers used for PCR are listed in Table 2. The cDNA fragments were digested with the restriction enzymes listed in the table and ligated into the multicloning site of the pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen). For IRTA2, IRTA3, and IRTA4, two or three DNA fragments were cloned into the vector and connected in tandem in the same vector. Finally, full-length cDNAs of 5 different IRTAs were cloned under a CMV-promoter in pcDNA3.\n\n\nFor Fc-fusion proteins, a Not I-Xba I fragment of pRB-2k1-CD30 (Nagata et al., \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n280:59-72, 2003), which contains the hinge and Fc portion of IgG1 with three introns, was subcloned into pcDNA3. To prevent its possible interaction with IRTAs, the first 8 amino acids of the \nconstant region\n 2 of the Fc (amino acids 231-238) were changed from APELLGGP (SEQ ID NO: X) to APPVAGP (SEQ ID NO: X) by a PCR-based method. These mutations (E233P, L234V, L235V and deletion of G237) reduce the affinity of IgG1 for FcγRI to a non-detectable level (Chappel et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n88:9036-40, 1991). DNA fragments that encode the extracellular domains of the IRTAs, including the signal peptides, were amplified by PCR, and then inserted upstream of the human Fc in pcDNA3. The plasmids for the expression of human CD30 (pHRm30c) (Diehl et al., \nJ Cancer Res Clin Oncol \n101:11-124, 1981) or the extracellular domain of the CD30-Fc fusion protein (pRB-2k1-CD30) (Nagata et al., \nClin Cancer Res \n8:2345-55, 2002) were used as controls in some experiments.\n\n\nTransfection of 293T Cells with the Plasmids. In a typical experiment, 5×10\n5 \nof 293T cells were seeded in a 10-cm dish (BD Biosciences, Bedford, Mass.) 24 hours prior to the transfection. Four μg of plasmid DNA was transfected by Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 48-72 hour transfection, the cells transfected with the plasmids encoding full-length IRTAs or CD30 were used for fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, cell-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cell-ELISA), Western blot or immunofluorescence.\n\n\nPreparation of the Fc-fusion Proteins. The 293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding Fc-fusion proteins secreted the Fc-fusion proteins in the supernatants. From \nday\n 2 to \nday\n 8 after transfection, the Fc-fusion proteins in the media were harvested daily. The concentration of the Fc-fusion proteins was measured by a human IgG-specific sandwich ELISA using purified CD30-Fc as the standard. Several of the Fc-fusion proteins were purified with \nprotein A Sepharose\n 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.).\n\n\nProduction of MAbs. A 6-week-old female Balb/c mouse was DNA-immunized 5 times with the IRTA2 plasmid as previously described (Nagata et al., \nJ Immunol Methods \n280:59-72, 2003). The mouse was boosted with 293T cells transfected with the same plasmid, and 3 days later the spleen cells were fused with SP2/0-neo myeloma cells as described previously (Nagata et al., \nJ Immunol Methods \n280:59-72, 2003). The hybridomas were screened for secretion of specific MAbs in an ELISA using IRTA2-Fc antigen. After multiple rounds of cell cloning by limiting dilution, the established hybridomas were grown to a high density to harvest the MAbs in the culture supernatants. The isotype of the MAbs was determined by mouse MAb isotyping reagents (ISO2; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.). Ig concentrations in the culture supernatants were determined by a sandwich ELISA as previously described (Nagata et al., \nHybridoma \n10:369-78, 1991).\n\n\nELISA. In a typical indirect ELISA for the screening of hybridomas, microtiter plates (MaxiSorp; Nalge Nunc, Rochester, N.Y.) were coated with 100 ng/50 μl/well of goat anti-human IgG in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2 hours at room temperature. Next, 50 ng/100 μl/well of IRTA2-Fc in blocking buffer (25% DMEM, 5% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing with PBS containing 0.05\n% Tween\n 20, 50 μl of the hybridoma supernatants were added and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing, the bound MAbs were detected by a 2-hour incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Grove, Pa.) followed by tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). In some experiments, other IRTA-Fc fusion proteins were used instead of IRTA2-Fc.\n\n\nAffinity Determination. Affinities (dissociation constant, Kd) of the anti-IRTA2 MAbs to IRTA2-Fc were determined by ELISA as previously described (Friguet et al., \nJ Immunol Methods \n77:305-19, 1985). Briefly, each MAb was incubated with various concentrations of IRTA2-Fc at room temperature for 20 hours to reach equilibrium; then the amount of MAb that remains unbound at equilibrium was measured by the indirect ELISA as described above.\n\n\nCell-ELISA. 293T cells that had been transfected with the IRTA2 expression plasmid or a CD30 expression plasmid 48 hours prior to use were seeded into 96 well plates (2×10\n4\n/well). After overnight culture, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formalin in the culture medium at room temperature overnight. Incubation with a dilution of MAbs, secondary antibody and substrate was performed as described in the ELISA protocol except that 1% FBS in PBS was used for washing.\n\n\nFACS Analysis. Various lymphoma cell lines and transfected 293T cells were used in the FACS analysis. Typically, 4×10\n5 \ncells were incubated with 250 ng of MAb in 100 μl of PBS containing 5% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide. After incubation for 1 hour at 4° C., the cells were washed twice with the same buffer and incubated with 1:100 dilution of R-phycoerythrin (R-PE)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)\n2 \n(BioSource, Camarillo, Calif.) for 1 hour. After washing twice, the cells were suspended in 1 ml buffer, and the fluorescence associated with the live cells was measured using a FACS Caliber Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.).\n\n\nFor blood samples of patients with HCL or normal donors, whole peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) and stained with mixtures of F56-R-PE (200 ng/ml, specially made by Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg., CD20 PerCP-Cy5.5, and CD22-FITC or CD103-FITC (Becton Dickinson). In some experiments, IRTA2-Fc or CD30-Fc was added at 20 μg/ml with the antibodies as the competitors. Compensations of fluorescence were set prior to each analysis using calibrated beads (CaliBRITE beads, Becton Dickinson).\n\n\nImmunofluorescence Antibody. 293T cells were transfected with an IRTA2 or a CD30 plasmid; 48 hours after transfection, the cells were detached, counted, and combined in a 1:1 ratio. A total 5×10\n4 \ncells were seeded in each well of a 4-well chamber slide (Nalge Nunc). After 24 hours, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 5 minutes. After washing with PBS twice and blocking with 5% normal goat serum, the cells were incubated with a mixture of anti-IRTA2 MAb F56 (IgG1) and anti-CD30 MAb Ki-1 (IgG3) at 10 μg/ml each. After washing, a mixture of Alexa 488-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG1 (1:1000 dilution; Molecular Probes) and Alexa 555-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG3 (1:1000 dilution; Molecular Probes) was added to the cells. The primary antibodies, F56 and Ki-1, on the slides were probed by the different secondary reagents with different wave lengths of the emission based on the different subclass. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind.). Negative controls were performed without antibodies.\n\n\nWestern Blotting. Typically, 40 μg of cell lysates or 20 ng of Fc-fusion proteins for each well or strip were separated onto 4-20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.) under reducing condition. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.2 μm; Immuno-Blot; Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 192 mM glycine, 30% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.3) at 4° C. for 1 hour at 250 mA. After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS, the membrane was incubated with 2.5-10 μg/ml of MAbs. The bound MAbs were detected with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (BioSource) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/p-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride substrate (BCIP/NBT; Pierce).\n\n\nRT-PCR. The RNA expression of IRTA2 in the cell lines was examined by a RT-PCR method. Total RNA was prepared from each cell line using Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was made from 4 μg of the total RNA by Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) with random hexamer priming according to the manufacture's instructions. PCRs were performed using cDNA from 100 ng RNA and 2 sets of primers for β-actin and IRTA2 (c isoform specific) listed in Table 1 with 26 cycles of amplification (95° C., 15 seconds; 55° C., 30 seconds; 72° C., 1 minute).\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nCloning of IRTA cDNAs and Preparation of Fc-Fusion Proteins\n\n\nBecause of the high homology of IRTA2 to other family members, it was important to prepare all possible IRTA proteins to evaluate cross-reactivity of the anti-IRTA2 antibodies. All cDNAs of these IRTAs whose mRNA expression had been reported were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into a pair of vectors: one for the expression of the full-length of the genes under a CMV-promoter and the other for the expression of the extracellular domains as fusion proteins using the Fc portion of human IgG1. \nFIG. 1A\n summarizes the structure of each IRTA and the plasmid construction. All full-length proteins were expressed on 293T cells transiently transfected with each plasmid as shown by cross-reactive MAbs (see below). All the Fc-fusion proteins were secreted into the culture supernatants of 293T cells transiently transfected with each plasmid although the production level varied (0.4-10 μg/ml). The purified Fc-fusion proteins migrated in SDS-PAGE with the expected sizes (\nFIG. 1B\n).\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nProduction of MAbs\n\n\nA Balb/c mouse was DNA-immunized with the full-length IRTA2 expression plasmid and boosted with 293T cells transfected with the same plasmid (Nagata et al., \nJ Immunol Methods \n280:59-72, 2003). The fusion experiment resulted in 36 stable hybridomas secreting MAbs that reacted to the IRTA2 extracellular domain-Fc but not to CD30-Fc (Table 4). Four (11%) IgG1s, 24 (67%) IgG2 as, and 8 (22%) IgG2bs were obtained. All the MAbs reacted to IRTA2-Fc with high affinities (1.1-18.7 nM of Kds, 5.4 nM in average). In addition, all the MAbs reacted to IRTA2 expressed on 293T cells transfected with IRTA2 expression plasmid without background reactivity to 293T cells transfected with a CD30 plasmid. It was concluded that all the MAbs recognize the native conformation of IRTA2 on the plasma membrane with high affinity. Three MAbs (F25, F56 and F119) were initially chosen for further study based on their high affinities, different subclass, no cross-reactivity to other IRTA family members, and reactivity in immunocytochemistry and Western blotting (see below). The characteristics of the three MAbs are summarized in Table 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics of anti-IRTA2 monoclonal antibodies used in this study\na\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nReactiviy to FACS\n\n\n \n\n\nCross\n\n\nReactivity to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(log MFI)\nc\n \n\n\nReactivity to IRTA2-Fc\n\n\nreactivity\n\n\ndenatured antigen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG\n\n\nto IRTA2/\n\n\nto CD30/\n\n\nELISA titer\ne\n \n\n\nAffinity\nf\n \n\n\nto other\n\n\nCell-ELISA\n\n\nWestern\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nSubclass\nb\n \n\n\n293T\n\n\n293T\n\n\n(ml/μg)\n\n\n(Kd, nM)\n\n\nIRTAs\nd\n \n\n\ntiters (ml/μg)\n\n\nblotting\nh\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF25\n\n\n2a\n\n\n2.59\n\n\n0.74\n\n\n320\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n—\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nF56\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n2.56\n\n\n0.66\n\n\n880\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n—\n\n\n250\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nF119\n \n\n\n2b\n\n\n2.54\n\n\n0.85\n\n\n850\n\n\n5.4\n\n\n—\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nMAbs were screened based on the reactivity to IRTA2 in an ELISA.

proteins was tested in an ELISA and to native IRTAs expressed on transfected 293T cells. Overall results indicate that 25 out of 36 MAbs specifically reacted with IRTA2 whereas 11 MAbs showed cross-reactivity to other IRTAs to various extents. As shown in \nFIG. 2\n, the binding of MAbs, F25, F56, and F119 was specific to IRTA2 in both assays.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nReactivity of the MAbs to Denatured IRTA2\n\n\nThe reactivity of the MAbs was examined in a cell-ELISA, by immunocytochemistry and by Western blotting. In these methods, most of the epitopes on IRTA2 protein were probably denatured.\n\n\nFirst, the reactivity of the MAbs to formalin-fixed antigen on transfected 293T cells in a cell ELISA was tested. About two-thirds of MAbs (21 out of 36) lost their reactivity to formalin-fixed IRTA2 (titers were less than 1), but 15 MAbs bound to the formalin-fixed antigen to some extent. MAb F56 specifically reacted to IRTA2 with a good titer (Table 3), and was used in further studies.\n\n\nAn immunofluorescence study was performed using MAb F56 for the detection of IRTA2 in the transfected cells (\nFIG. 3A\n). Two dishes of 293T cells were separately transfected with IRTA2 or CD30 plasmids and were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and reseeded. The cells were fixed in formaldehyde and double-stained with a mixture of anti-IRTA2 MAb F56 (IgG1) and anti-CD30 MAb Ki-1 (IgG3). Four views with different filters of the same field are shown (\nFIG. 3A\n). The cells expressing IRTA2 and stained with F56 showed a green fluorescence signal on the plasma membrane (anti-IRTA2 F56). In contrast, different cells expressing CD30 and stained with anti-CD30 showed a red signal on the plasma membrane (CD30). The nuclei of the cell were visualized with DAPI. The result indicates that MAb F56 can be used in immunofluorescence staining of cells after fixation with formalin to detect recombinant IRTA2 protein expressed on the plasma membrane.\n\n\nNext, the reactivity of the MAbs to SDS-denatured antigen was examined in Western blotting. A mixture of IRTA2-Fc and CD30-Fc fusion proteins were blotted on the membrane and incubated with each MAb. Only with MAbs F25 and F20 was a 160-kDa band of IRTA2-Fc visualized (\nFIG. 3B\n). These MAbs did not react with CD30-Fc on the same blots. The CD30-Fc band around 110-kDa was stained with an anti-human Fc antibody and an anti-CD30 MAb (Ber-H2), but not with F20 or F25. Therefore, the reactivity of F20 and F25 on the Western blot is specific. None of the other 34 MAbs were able to react with IRTA2 in Western blotting, indicating they can detect native but not SDS-denatured IRTA2.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nExpression of IRTA2 on Human Cell Lines\n\n\nIRTA2 expression was surveyed on a variety of human cancer cell lines by FACS using MAbs F56 and F119 (\nFIG. 4A\n). The characteristics of these cell lines are listed in Table 1. IRTA2 was detected on 7 B-cell lymphoma lines; 6 were derived from a different type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Only 1 of 6 Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines was positive and this weakly expressed IRTA2 (\nFIG. 4A\n). All cells were stained with the appropriate CD markers used as the positive controls and were not stained with mouse IgG1 as the negative control. To verify that the staining was specific, a 100-fold excess of IRTA2-Fc or CD30-Fc was used as the competitors of the staining. IRTA2-Fc was able to block staining of SU-DHL-5 and OCI-LY7 cells, whereas CD30-Fc was ineffective.\n\n\nThe expression of IRTA2 mRNA in cells was examined by RT-PCR (\nFIG. 4B\n). A set of primers (2cF and 2cR [Table 2]) for IRTA2 located on separate exons was designed to give a 432-bp PCR fragment. This primer set should detect only the spliced mRNA for the full-length of the transmembrane type of IRTA2 (IRTA2c) that was used as the antigen. As shown in \nFIG. 4B\n, the IRTA2 primers generated DNA fragments with expected size from the RNA of the cells positive for IRTA2 expression in FACS. In contrast, no IRTA2 cDNA was amplified from the RNA of FACS-negative cells, except for the trace amounts of the PCR product in Ramos cells. The actin primers generated similar amounts of the DNA fragment from all cells.\n\n\nNext, IRTA2 protein expression in several cell lines was examined by Western blotting using MAb F25 (\nFIG. 4C\n). The IRTA2 protein was detected in the three B-cell NHL (B-NHL) cell lines tested (SU-DHL-5, SU-DHL-6, and JD38) as bands around 150-kDa, which is the same size as the recombinant IRTA2 protein expressed in 293T cells transfected with an IRTA2 plasmid. MAb F25 also reacted to IRTA2-Fc in the same blot. In contrast, no IRTA2 bands were detected in \nKarpas\n 299 and L540 cell lysates.\n\n\n \nFIG. 4D\n shows a summary of the detection of IRTA2 by different methods in various cell lines. There is a clear correlation in IRTA2 expression detected by FACS, mRNA expression detected by RT-PCR, and IRTA2 protein detected by Western blots.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nExpression of IRTA2 on HCL Cells from Patients\n\n\nTo determine if the MAbs might be useful for examining cells from patients, IRTA2 expression was analyzed in PBMCs of 5 patients with HCL and of 2 normal donors by FACS. In these experiments, the PBMCs were three-color-stained with anti-IRTA2 F56 and CD20 and CD22 or with F56 and CD20 and CD103. It was found that the HCL cells (CD20+, CD22+, and CD103+) from all five patients significantly expressed IRTA2 whereas IRTA2 was not detected on PBMCs of normal donors (CD14+, CD3+ or CD19+). \nFIG. 5\n shows the typical results of a FACS analysis of 2 patients with HCL. Staining with anti-IRTA2 F56 revealed that 27% or 39% of the PBMCs from the 2 patients expressed significant amounts of IRTA2 (\nFIG. 5A\n, histograms). IRTA2 was not detected in PBMCs from normal donors. The IRTA2+ cells also expressed CD20, CD22 and CD103 (\nFIG. 5A\n, blue dot-blots), indicating almost all of IRTA2 positive cells represent HCL cells. On the other hand, almost all HCL-maker positive cells from the same patients (CD20+/CD22+ or CD20+/CD103+) expressed IRTA2 (\nFIG. 5B\n). These data show that all HCL cells in these patients express IRTA2. The IRTA2 signal was inhibited by the addition of a 100-fold excess amount of IRTA2-Fc (red lines in \nFIG. 5B\n) but not by CD30-Fc (blue lines), indicating that IRTA2 staining of the patient samples was antigen-specific.\n\n\nThus, the IRTA2 protein is expressed on the surface of many human lymphoma cell lines and on HCL cells from patients. The MAbs that bind IRTA2 can be used to identify patients with tumors that express IRTA2. These MAbs could be useful for both leukemia diagnosis and IRTA2-targeted immunotherapy. The staining of MAb F56 was always in accordance with that of MAb F119, although these MAbs belong to different subclasses (F56, IgG1; F119, IgG2b) and react with different epitopes (formalin-resistant epitope for F56 and formalin-sensitive epitope for F119). In addition, the staining was specifically inhibited by IRTA2-Fc, confirming the specificity of the staining. By using the highly specific staining, IRTA2 expression was detected on leukemia cells from five out of five HCL patients, whereas no IRTA2-positive cells were detected in PBMC from normal donors. Also, almost all IRTA2-positive cells expressed the markers for HCL (CD20+, CD22+, and CD103+) and almost all HCL cells were positive for IRTA2.\n\n\nIRTA2 expression was detected in eight lymphoma cell lines out of 19 cell lines examined; these are mainly B-NHL cells. The expression profile was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting, indicating that the FACS analysis using the MAbs is highly specific. The expression of IRTA2 in OCI-LY7, OCI-LY10, and \nKarpas\n 1106 is consistent with mRNA expression detected by DNA microarray. Thus, a FACS analysis is of use to screen IRTA2 expression on cells from patients with B cell malignancies.\n\n\nThe production of 36 anti-IRTA2 MAbs is disclosed herein. In this study, a MAb production method was utilized which generates a large number of MAbs in one fusion (see Nagata et al., \nJ Immunol Methods \n280:59-72, 2003). This method involves DNA-immunization followed by a cell boost and generated a large number of anti-IRTA2 MAbs. This method yielded a large number of MAbs, all of which reacted to the native form of IRTA2 on cells with high affinities (5.4 nM of Kd on average).\n\n\nOut of the 36 antibodies, eleven cross-reacted with other IRTA family members. This high ratio of cross-reactive MAbs was expected as the IRTAs are highly homologous. All IRTA recombinant proteins were used to check the cross-reactivity; 25 IRTA2-specific MAbs did not cross-react with other family members. Among the 25 IRTA2-specific MAbs, MAbs F56 (IgG1) and F25 (IgG2a) are detected formalin-fixed antigen in cell-ELISA and immunofluorescence antibody, and SDS-denatured antigen in Western blots, respectively. Using an immunofluorescence technique, F56 specifically stained the plasma membranes of the 293T cells transfected with full-length IRTA2 plasmid (\nFIG. 3A\n). This result directly demonstrates the plasma membrane localization of IRTA2 protein.\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nDesign of Two Independent IRTA2-Specific Sandwich ELISAs\n\n\nIn order to measure soluble IRTA2 in human serum, four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to four different epitopes on the IRTA2 molecule were chosen from the panel of anti-IRTA2 MAbs shown in Table 4, and two independent ELISAs were constructed. \nELISA#\n1 uses antibodies F1 and F25, while \nELISA#\n2 uses antibodies F44 and F54. The performance of the ELISAs using a 1:100 dilution of samples of human serum was characterized.\n\n\nInitially samples were analyzed from normal donors (n=123) to establish a reference interval. When the 95\nth \npercentile values of sIRTA2 level were taken as the cut-off, the reference intervals were <30-375 ng/mL for \nELISA#\n1 and <30-377 ng/mL for \nELISA#\n2. Typical standards curves were obtained from both of the two ELISAs in the range of 0.3-2.1 ng/ml of IRTA2-HFc protein as the standard (\nFIGS. 9A-9B\n). The ELISAs are able to measure 30 ng/ml to 5.2 μg/ml of soluble IRTA2.\n\n\nThe results of the two ELISAs were well correlated to each other, even though they use different sets of the epitopes on IRTA2 (\nFIG. 10\n). No bias and no artifact of the two ELISAs were found.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nElevation of Soluble IRTA2 (CD307) Level in Hematological Malignancies\n\n\nThe sera of patients with hematological malignancies was screened for the presence of sIRTA2 by using the two ELISAs designed above. The ELISAs were performed as follows: MAb F1 (5 μg/ml for ELISA#1) or MAb F44 (5 μg/ml for ELISA#2) was diluted in PBS. 50 ul/well (50 ng/well) was added to Nunc-Immuno™ Plate MaxSorp™ (Nunc 439-454) and the plate was incubated at 4° C. overnight. 100 ul/well of blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Roche 100350, Fraction V, protease-free), 0.1% sodium azide in PBS) was added and the plate was incubated at room temperature for at least 30 min. The serum samples and standards (IRTA2-Hfc) were diluted with blocking buffer containing 0.5% mouse serum (normal mouse serum, Zymed) and the plates were washed once with PBS-0.05% Tween (Tween 20, FisherBiotech 337-500 enzyme grade). 50 μl/well of the samples were added and the plate was incubated at 4° C. overnight. The plates were washed twice with PBS-Tween, and then 50 μl/well of 0.5 μg/ml of biotin-MAb F25 (ELISA#1) or 1 μg/ml of biotin-MAb F54 (ELISA#2) in blocking buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 was added. The plates were incubated at room temperature for at least 60 min. The plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween and 50 μl/well of a 1/3000 dilution of HRP-streptosavidin (Biosource) in blocking buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 was added. The plates were incubated at room temperature for at least 60 min. The plates were washed four times with PBS-Tween and 100 μl/well of TMB-hydrogen peroxide mixture (Pierce TMB substrate kit #34021) was added. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 10-30 min. 50 μl/well of 1M sulfuric acid was added to stop the reaction and the OD was measured at 450 nm with 650 nm as a reference. Standard curves were fitted to the second degree of polynomial curve after log conversion of the concentrations (using SoftMaxPro software, Molecular probes). From the calculated values and the dilutions, the IRTA2 concentrations in the human serum samples were determined. Using \nELISA#\n1, an increase of sIRTA2 levels was found in 34 of 44 HCL (77%), 17 of 21 CLL (81%), 0 of 10 CML (0%), 0 of 9 ALL (0%), 0 of 9 AML (0%) 1 of 4 ATL (25%), 13 of 24 MCL (52%), 0 of 17 DLBCL (0%), 3 of HIV-lymphoma (33%), and 0 of 4 HD (0%). The sIRTA2 levels were confirmed by \nELISA#\n2 which independently detects two different epitopes on sIRTA2. Surface IRTA2 expression was also detected in 4 of 7 CLL cells by a FACS analysis using an anti-IRTA2 MAb. Using these ELISAs, an elevated level of IRTA2 was detected in HCL and CLL patients compared to normal (\nFIG. 11\n).\n\n\nThe finding that sIRTA2 was elevated in various hematological malignancies indicates that sIRTA2 could be a good tumor marker for the prediction and monitoring of these diseases and also suggests that sIRTA2 could be involved in the biology of these malignancies.\n\n\nIt will be apparent that the precise details of the methods or compositions described may be varied or modified without departing from the spirit of the described invention. We claim all such modifications and variations that fall within the scope and spirit of the claims below."
