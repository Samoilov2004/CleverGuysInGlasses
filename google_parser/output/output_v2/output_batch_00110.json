Description\n\n\n\n\nThe present application is a National Phase of International Application No. PCT/EP2006/067713 filed Oct. 24, 2006 and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/730,404, filed Oct. 26, 2005 and European Patent Application No. 05110035.2, filed Oct. 26, 2005. The contents of all these applications are expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is related to sulfonamide derivatives of Formula (I), pharmaceutical composition thereof, methods of preparation thereof and to their use for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of autoimmune disorders and/or inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases and fibrosis. Specifically, the present invention is related to sulfonamide derivatives for the modulation, notably the inhibition of the activity or function of matrix metalloproteinases.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nMetalloproteinases are a superfamily of proteinases (enzymes) named for their dependence on a metal ion (zinc) in the active site.\n\n\nThe matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) form a metalloproteinase sub-family having as one of major biological function to catalyse the breakdown of connective tissue or extracellular matrix through their ability to hydrolyse various components of the tissue or matrix, such as collagens, gelatins, proteoglycans, fibronectins and elastin.\n\n\nThe matrix metalloproteinase family is further divided according to their function and substrates (Visse al., 2003\n, Circ. Res., \n92: 827-839) and comprises collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-13 and MMP-18), gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), stromelysins (MMP-3, MMP-10 and MMP-11), membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMP-1 to MT-MMP-6 and MMP-14, MMP-15, MMP-16, MMP-17, MMP-24 and MMP-25), matrilysins (MMP-7 and MMP-26) and other unclassified MMPs such as metalloelastase (MMP-12), enamelysin (MMP-20), epilysin (MMP-28), MMP-19, MMP-22 and MMP-23.\n\n\nApart from their role in degrading connective tissue, MMPs are involved in the biosynthesis of TNF-alpha and in the post-translational proteolysis processing, or shedding of biologically important membrane proteins (Hooper et al., 1997\n, Biochem J., \n321: 265-279). MMPs for example contribute to the local growth and spread of malignant lesions and therefore have been a target for anti-tumor drug development (Fingleton et al., 2003\n, Expert Opin. Ther. Targets, \n7(3):385-397. Disorders such as inflammatory disorders like arthritis (Clark et al., 2003\n, Expert. Opin. Ther Targets, \n7(1):19-34), respiratory disorders such as emphysema, arteriosclerosis (Galis et al., 2002\n, Circ. Res., \n90:251-262), neurological disorders such as degenerative nervous system diseases, multiple sclerosis (Leppert et al., 2001\n, Brain Res. Rev., \n36:249-257), periodontitis (Ingman et al., 1996\n, J. Clin. Periodontal., \n23:127-1132), pre-term labor (Makratis et al., 2003\n, J. Matern Fetal \n& \nNeonatal Medicine, \n14(3): 170-6) and wound healing have been demonstrated to be associated with MMPs expression and/or activity.\n\n\nA recently defined subset of the metalloproteases, the cell-associated A Desintegrin And zinc Metalloprotease (ADAM) family has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target, notably for cancer. At least twenty-three distinct ADAMs have been identified thus far. ADAM-17, also known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (hereinafter “TACE”), is the most well known ADAM.\n\n\nTACE is responsible for cleavage of cell bound tumor necrosis factor-alpha (“TNF-α). TNF-α is implicated in many infectious and autoimmune diseases. Moreover, TNF-α is the prime mediator in the inflammatory response seen in sepsis and septic shock. Several TACE inhibitors have been developed and reported in Watson, 2002\n, IDrugs, \n5(12):1151-1161.\n\n\nA wide variety of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs) has been developed (Skiles et al., 2001\n, Current Medicinal Chemistry, \n8, 425-474; Henrotin et al, 2002\n, Expert Opin. Ther. Patents, \n12(1):29-43). However, many MMPIs exhibit a muscoskeletal syndrome (tendonitis, fibroplasias, mylasia, arthralasia) as a dose-limiting side effect. It has been proposed that inhibition of MMP-1 or MMP-14 may be responsible for these effects.\n\n\nWO 01/87844 discloses hydroxamic acid and carboxylic acid derivatives with MMP and TNF inhibitory action for use in the treatment of cancer, inflammation, or an autoimmune, infectious or ocular disease.\n\n\nWO 2004/006926 discloses sulphonylpiperidine derivatives containing an aryl or heteroaryl group for use as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors, in particular TACE.\n\n\nTherefore, there is an increasing need to develop matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors with a well-defined specificity profile.\n\n\nSpecific inhibitors, especially towards MMP-1, have been reported, including MMP-13 inhibitors (Stotnicki et al., 2003\n, Current Opinion in Drug Discovery and Development, \n6(5):742-759), MMP-12 inhibitors (\nExpert. Opin. Ther. Patents, \n2004, 14(11):1637-1640), MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibitors (Wada et al., 2002\n, J. Biol. Chem. \n45: 219-232). The high relevance of the metalloproteinase pathway in some widely spread diseases stresses the need to develop inhibitors, including selective inhibitors of MMPs, especially of MMP-12.\n\n\nSince excessive TNF-α production has been noted in several disease conditions also characterized by MMP-mediated tissue degradation, compounds which inhibit MMPs and/or TNF-α production may also have a particular advantage in diseases where both mechanisms are involved.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIt is an object of the invention to provide substances which are suitable for the treatment

paragraphs provide definitions of the various chemical moieties that make up the compounds according to the invention and are intended to apply uniformly through-out the specification and claims unless an otherwise expressly set out definition provides a broader definition.\n\n\nThe term “MMPs” refers to “matrix metalloproteinases”. For recent reviews of MMPs, see Visse et al., 2003 above; Fingleton et al, 2003, above; Clark et al., 2003, above and Doherty et al, 2002\n, Expert Opinion Therapeutic Patents \n12(5):665-707.\n\n\nIllustrative but not limiting examples of such MMPs are:\n\n\nCollagenases: usually associated with diseases linked to breakdown of collagen-based tissue e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis:\n\n\nMMP-1 (also known as collagenase 1, or fibroblast collagenase), substrates collagen I, collagen II, collagen III, gelatin, proteoglycans. Over-expression of this enzyme is believed to be associated with emphysema, with hyperkeratosis and atherosclerosis, overexpressed alone in papillary carcinoma.\n\n\nMMP-8 (also known as collagenase 2, or neutrophil collagenase), substrates collagen I, collagen II, collagen III, collagen V, collagen VII, collagen IX, gelatin over-expression of which can lead to non-healing chronic ulcers.\n\n\nMMP-13 (also known as collagenase 3), substrates collagen I, collagen II, collagen III, collagen IV, collagen IX, collagen X, collagen XIV, fibronectin, gelatin, recently identified as being over-expressed alone in breast carcinoma and involved in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nStromelysins:\n\n\nMMP-3 (also known as stromelysin 1), substrates collagen III, collagen IV, collagen V, collagen IX, collagen X, laminin, nidogen, over-expression believed to be involved in atherosclerosis, aneurysm and restenosis.\n\n\nGelatinases—inhibition believed to exert a favorable effect on cancer, in particular invasion and metastasis.\n\n\nMMP-2 (also known as gelatinase A, 72 kDa gelatinase, basement membrane collagenase, or proteoglycanase), substrates Collagen I, Collagen II, Collagen IV, Collagen V, Collagen VII, Collagen X, Collagen XI, collagen XIV, elastin, fibronectin, gelatin, nidogen, believed to be associated with tumor progression through specificity for type IV Collagen (high expression observed in solid tumors and believed to be associated with their ability to grow, invade, develop new blood vessels and metastasize) and to be involved in acute lung inflammation and in respiratory distress syndrome (Krishna et al., 2004\n, Expert Opin.

MMP-9 is also thought to be involved in stroke (Horstmann et al., 2003\n, Stroke, \n34(9): 2165-70).\n\n\nUnclassified MMPs:\n\n\nMMP-12 (also known as metalloelastase, human macrophage elastase, or HME), substrates fibronectin, laminin, believed to play a role in tumour growth inhibition and regulation of inflammation such as multiple sclerosis (Vos et al, 2003\n, Journal of Neuroimmunology, \n138, 106-114) and to play a pathological role in emphysema, COPD (Belvisi et al., 2003\n, Inflam. Res. \n52: 95-100) and in atherosclerosis, aneurysm and restenosis.\n\n\nThe expression “MMP-associated disorder” refers to a disorder which is treatable according to the invention and that encompasses all disorders in which the expression and/or activity of at least one MMP needs to be decreased irrespective of the cause of such disorders. Such disorders include, for example, those caused by inappropriate extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation.\n\n\nIllustrative but not limiting examples of such MMP-associated disorders are:\n\n\nCancer such as breast cancer and solid tumors; inflammatory disorders such as for example inflammatory bowel diseases and neuroinflammation such as multiple sclerosis; lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), emphysema, asthma, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome; dental diseases such as periodontal disease and gingivitis; joint and bone diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis; liver diseases such as liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and chronic liver disease; fibrotic diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, pancreatitis, lupus, glomerulosclerosis, systemic sclerosis skin fibrosis, post-radiation fibrosis and cystic fibrosis; vascular pathologies such as aortic aneurysm, atherosclerosis, hypertension, cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction; restenosis; opthalmological disorders such as diabetic retinopathy, dry eye syndrome, macula degeneration and corneal ulceration and degenerative diseases of the central nervous system such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\n\nTACE inhibitors according to the invention are useful for the treatment of several disorders such as inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, Crohn's disease and other inflammatory bowel diseases and inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases, and systemic lupus erythematosis; reperfusion injuries; systemic inflammatory response syndromes, including but not limited to sepsis, burn injury, pancreatitis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome; allergic and dermatologic diseases, including but not limited to delayed type hypersensitivity, psoriasis, asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis, and allergic conjunctivitis; cardiovascular diseases, including but not limited to hyperlipidemia, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis and restenosis; metabolic diseases; neurologic diseases, including but not limited to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, aneurism, and stroke; transplant rejection; diseases of cancer and malignancy, including but not limited to colorectal cancer and leukemias; renal diseases, including but not limited to nephrotic syndromes and glomerulonephritis; infectious diseases, including but not limited to HIV infection and neuropathy. Examples of diseases for which TACE inhibitors are useful in the treatment thereof are disclosed in Watson, 2002, above.\n\n\nIn the context of the present invention, the terms “substance” or “substances”, “compound” or “compounds” and “sulphonamide derivative” or “sulphonamide derivatives” are used as substantially having the same meaning.\n\n\n“C\n1\n-C\n6\n-alkyl” refers to monovalent alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms.

An alternative pathway for the preparation of compounds of Formula (IV) could start with the reaction between amines of Formula (XII) wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8 \nand n are defined as above and sulfonyl chloride derivatives of Formula (XI) wherein R\n11 \nand R\n12 \nare defined as above to give sulfonamide derivatives of Formula (XIII) wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8\n, R\n11\n, R\n12 \nand n are defined as above. Then, sulfonamide derivatives of Formula (XIII) could be cyclized in presence of carbonyl derivatives of Formula (XIV) (or precursors of carbonyl derivatives such as acetal) in acidic conditions, such as Lewis acids, to give compounds of Formula (IV) wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8\n, R\n9\n, R\n10\nR\n11\n, R\n12 \nand n are defined as above (Shin et al., \nTetrahedron Lett. \n2001, 42, 6251-6253).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntermediates of Formulae (V), (VII), (X), (XI) and (XII) are commercially available or may be prepared using conditions well known by those skilled in the art. For example, intermediate of Formula (X) may be prepared following procedures described in Cho et al., 2005\n, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., \n185-189 or in Bailey et al., 1973\n, J. Med.

The processes outlined in the above Schemes, in particular Schemes 1 and 2, afford compounds of Formula (I) and its precursors of Formulae (II) and (VI) in racemic form or as mixtures of diastereoisomers, in cases where additional chiral centers are present. Pure stereoisomers can be obtained from stereoisomer mixtures using procedures well known to those skilled in the art, including for example separation of enantiomers by chiral HPLC, or crystallization and/or chromatography for mixture of diastereoisomers. Alternatively, a mixture of enantiomers can be separated by the formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives having convenient optically active auxiliary moiety, followed by separation of the formed diastereoisomers and then cleavage of the chiral auxiliary.\n\n\nIf the above set of general synthetic methods is not applicable to obtain compounds according to Formula (I) and/or necessary intermediates for the synthesis of compounds of Formula (I), suitable methods of preparation known by a person skilled in the art should be used. In general, the synthesis pathways for any individual compound of Formula (I) will depend on the specific substitutents of each molecule and upon the ready availability of intermediates necessary; again such factors being appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. For all the protection and deprotection methods, see Philip J. Kocienski, in “\nProtecting Groups\n”, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, 1994 and, Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts in “\nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis”\n, Wiley Interscience, 3\nrd \nEdition 1999. Those skilled in the art will recognize that certain reactions are best carried out when potentially reactive functionality on the molecule is masked or protected, thus avoiding side reactions and/or increasing the yield of the reaction. Examples of protecting group moieties may be found in Philip J. Kocienski, 1994 above and in Greene et al., 1999, above. The need and choice of protecting groups for a particular reaction is known to those skilled in the art and depends on the nature of the functional group to be protected (hydroxy, amino, carboxy, etc.), the structure and the stability of the molecule of which the substituent is part of the reaction conditions.\n\n\nCompounds of this invention can be isolated in association with solvent molecules by crystallization from evaporation of an appropriate solvent. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of Formula (I), which contain a basic center, may be prepared in a conventional manner. For example, a solution of the free base may be treated with a suitable acid, either neat or in a suitable solution, and the resulting salt isolated either by filtration or by evaporation under vacuum of the reaction solvent. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts may be obtained in an analogous manner by treating a solution of compound of Formula (I) with a suitable base. Both types of salts may be formed or interconverted using ion-exchange resin techniques.\n\n\nIn the following the present invention shall be illustrated by means of some examples, which are not construed to be viewed as limiting the scope of the invention.\n\n\nThe following reagents commercially available were used:\n\n\n1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (Fluka), diisopropylethylamine or DIEA (Fluka), methane sulfonyl chloride (Aldrich), lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide or LiHMDS (Aldrich), diethyl chlorophosphate (Aldrich), 3-phenylpropionaldehyde (Aldrich), hydroxylamine or NH\n2\nOH (Fluka), acetic anhydride (Fluka), 2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-glyceraldehyde (Interchim), hexanal (Aldrich), cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde (Aldrich), 2-thiophene carboxaldehyde (Fluka), isoindoline (Aldrich), 3-thiophenecarboxaldehyde (Aldrich), 2-methyl-2-morpholinopropanal (Bionet), 5-pyrimidinecarboxaldehyde (Apollo), 3-pyridine carboxaldehyde (Fluka), 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrochloride (Aldrich), 6-methoxy-3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (Aldrich), aminoacetaldehyde dimethylacetal (Aldrich), 1-benzyl-piperidine-4-carbaldehyde (J & W Pharmlab), benzyloxyacetaldehyde (Aldrich), boron trifluoride diethyl ether complex (Aldrich), 7-bromo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrochloride (Arch), 4-chlorophenethylamine (Aldrich), cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (Aldrich), cyclopentanone (Fluka), 3,3-dimethylbutyraldehyde (Fluka), 3,4-dichlorophenethylamine (Acros), 2-ethylbutyraldehyde (Aldrich), ethyl isobutyrate (Aldrich), ethyl 2-formyl-1-cyclopropanecarboxylate (Aldrich), 5-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole hydrochloride (Astatech), 4-fluorophenylboronic acid (Aldrich), 7-fluoro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrochloride (Arch), 2-formyl-pyrrolidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (Pharmacore), 3-(2-furyl)acrolein (Acros), 3-furaldehyde (Aldrich), glycolaldehyde (ICN), 3-hydroxyphenylboronic acid (Aldrich), 4-isopropyl benzaldehyde (Aldrich), isobutyraldehyde (Aldrich), isopropyl iodide (Aldrich), isovaleraldehyde (Aldrich), lithium aluminium hydride (Fluka), 7-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrochloride (Arch), 3-(methylthio)propionaldehyde (Aldrich), methyl phenoxyacetate (Aldrich), methyl tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-carboxylate (Fluka), methyl 3-(3-pyridyl)propionate (Lancaster), oxalyl chloride (Aldrich), 2-pentynyl chloride (TCI), phenylboronic acid (Aldrich), propyl iodide (Aldrich), pyridine-4-boronic acid (Aldrich), sodium borohydride (Fluka), 3-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-propanal (Toronto), 4-(tert-butyl)phenethylamine (Emkachem), 3-thienylboronic acid (Aldrich), 1,3,5-trioxane (Fluka), trimethylacetaldehyde (Aldrich), triethylamine (Fluka), 7-trifluoromethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrochloride (Arch), 4,4,4-trifluorobutyraldehyde (ABCR).\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nFormation of N-{1-[(3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-ylsulfonyl)methyl]-3-phenylpropyl}-N-hydroxyformamide (1)\n\n\nStep a) Formation of 2-(methylsulfonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetraisoquinoline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA solution of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (10.0 g, 75 mmol) and DIEA (15.3 ml, 90 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (200 ml) was cooled at 0° C. and methanesulfonyl chloride (7.0 ml, 90 mmol) was added dropwise.

Appropriate concentrations of test compounds dissolved in 10 μL of DMSO are added to the wells, followed by substrate solution (50 μL, 5 μM prepared by dilution of DMSO stock in assay buffer) and enzyme solution (40 μL). For each as say ten concentrations of test compound are examined in triplicate. Control wells lack either enzyme or test compound. The reactions are incubated at room temperature for 1.5 hours. The fluorescence at 405 nm is measured immediately with a fluorometer using 355 nm excitation, without stopping the reaction.\n\n\nThe effect of the test compound is determined from the dose response curve generated by the 10 duplicate concentrations of inhibitor. The IC\n50 \n(the concentration of compound required to give a 50% decrease in enzyme activity) is obtained by fitting data to the equation, Y=a+((b−a)/(1+(c/X)\nd\n)). (Y=inhibition achieved for a particular dose; X=the dose in nM; a=minimum y or zero % inhibition; b=maximum y or 100% inhibition; c=is the IC\n50\n; d=is the slope). The result is rounded to one significant figure.\n\n\nThe results are expressed in terms of IC\n50 \n(the concentration of compound required to give a 50% decrease in enzyme activity) and are presented in Table 1 below.\n\n\nThe results are expressed in terms of IC\n50 \n(the concentration of compound required to give a 50% decrease in enzyme activity) and are presented in Table 1

This is a model for the cellular migration that occurs during inflammation.\n\n\nProtocol\n\n\nC3H/HEN mice (Elevage Janvier, France) were intraperitoneally injected with IL-2 (Serono Pharmaceutical Research Institute, 20 μg/kg, in saline). Compounds of the invention were suspended in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)/0.25% tween-20 and were administered by s.c. or p.o. route (10 ml/kg) 15 min prior to administration of IL-2.\n\n\nTwenty-four hours after administration of IL-2, peritoneal white blood cells were collected by 3 successive lavages of the peritoneal cavity with 5 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-1 mM EDTA (+4° C.). The suspension was centrifuged (1700 g×10 min at +4° C.).

The labels are checked and renewed, if necessary, after every CCl\n4 \ninjection.\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nCCl\n4 \n(Prolabo) in olive oil is administered every 3 days for three weeks by intra-peritoneal injection (0.25 ml CCl\n4\n/kg body weight, diluted in oil 1:1 vol:vol for a total volume of 0.5 ml/kg). Animals are weighed daily. If body weight decreased by more than 10% of the initial weight, the animal is excluded from the study.\n\n\nVehicles and compound are used as follows:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCl\n4 \nwas administered in olive oil (Prolabo) at a 1:1 dilution;\n\n\nThe compound of the invention is suspended in 0.25% Tween-80 and 0.25% carboxymethylcellulose in sterile 0.9% NaCl. The solution is kept at 4° C. throughout the experiment and used each day to prepare the suspensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compound of the invention is administered daily by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection at a volume of administration of 5 ml/kg. Groups 1 and 2 are dosed s.c. with 5 ml/kg of vehicle. Freshly prepared solutions are used on each day of the experiment. Administrations are carried out each day at the same time.\n\n\nThe treatment of groups of this study is started for each animal at the time of the first CCl\n4 \nadministration and is continued for 21 consecutive days. The last administration of test substances or vehicle is done 1 day before the sacrifice of the animals.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nDeath are Reported, Date and Supposed Cause are Reported.\n\n\nSerum Enzyme Levels\n\n\nAnimals are killed 21 days following the first CCl\n4 \nadministration by isofurane inhalation. Blood is withdrawn individually at the time of sacrifice, i.e. one day after the last administration of test substance or vehicle. Blood is centrifuged at 4° C. Plasma is carefully collected and aliquoted in 3 fractions. Plasma aspartate amino transferase (ASAT) and alanine amino transferase (ALAT) levels are measured in order to assess liver necrosis. Increased ASAT and ALAT levels in serum are associated with liver impairment. Average ASAT and ALAT levels for control animals and those treated with the compound of the invention at three different dosages are reported.\n\n\nHistological Evaluation of Liver Fibrosis\n\n\nLiver fibrosis is evaluated by measuring the area of fibrosis in the liver using microchotomy. Results are reported as percentage area that is fibrotic.\n\n\nThe liver is removed, the three lobes are dissected and samples are removed and either fixed in 10% formaldehyde or frozen at −80° C.\n\n\nLiver sections are embedded in paraffin blocks. Sectioning and staining with Sirius red are performed. Quantification of the fibrosis in liver is carried out on a minimum of 3 sections taken from different locations in the liver. The quantitative analysis is performed using an image analyser (Imstar) and the software Morphostar.\n\n\nAverage area percentages of fibrosis in the livers of animals in the different groups are calculated.\n\n\nExample 90\n\n\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Model\n\n\nCompounds of the invention can be evaluated for their ability to prevent cigarette smoke-induced COPD.\n\n\nFemale AJ mice (Harlan, 17-25 g) are exposed daily to cigarette smoke (CS) for 11 consecutive days in groups of 5, in individual clear chambers. Animals are weighed prior to treatment, on day 6 of exposure and on day 12. The CS was generated using 1R1 cigarettes purchased from the Institute of Tobacco Research, University of Kentucky, USA and is allowed to enter the chambers at a flow rate of 100 ml/min.\n\n\nIn order to minimise any potential problems caused by repeated exposure to a high level of daily CS, the exposure of the mice to TS is increased gradually over the time to a maximum of 6 cigarettes from day 5 to day 11 (approximately 48 min exposure).\n\n\nA sham group of mice is also exposed to air on a daily basis for equivalent lengths of time as controls (no CS exposure).\n\n\nTreatment\n\n\nCompounds of the invention are prepared in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose Na salt (CMC, Sigma reference C-4888) as vehicle.\n\n\nAnimals are orally dosed twice daily by gavage in a dose volume of 5 ml/kg, 1 h prior to air or CS exposure and 6 h after the cessation of the exposure.\n\n\nSham animals (n=10) received vehicle and are exposed to air for up to a maximum of 50 minutes per day. The control group (n=10) received vehicle and is exposed to CS (up to a maximum of 6 cigarettes per day). Additional groups are exposed to CS (from up to a maximum of 6 cigarettes per day) and treated with one of the test compounds or the reference compound.\n\n\nBronchoalveolar Lavage and Cytospin Analysis\n\n\nTwenty-four hours after the last CS exposure, bronchoalveolar lavage is performed as follows:\n\n\nThe trachea is dissected under deep anesthesia (sodium pentobarbitone) and cannulated using a Portex nylon intravenous cannula shortened to approximately 8 mm. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Gibco) containing 10 units/ml heparin (0.4 ml) is gently instilled and withdrawn 3 times. The lavage fluid is placed in an Eppendorf tube and kept on ice prior to subsequent determinations. Then, lavage fluid is separated from cells by centrifugation. The supernatant is removed and frozen for subsequent analysis. The cell pellet is resuspended in PBS and total cell numbers are calculated by counting a stained aliquot (Turks stain) under a microscope using a haemocytometer.\n\n\nDifferential cell count is then performed as follows: The residual cell pellet is diluted to approximately 105 cells per ml. A volume of 500 μl is placed in the funnel of a cytospin slide and is centrifuged for 8 min at 800 rpm. The slide is air-dried and stained using ‘Kwik-Diff’ solutions (Shandon) following purchaser instructions. Slides are dried and cover-slipped and differential cell count is done using light microscopy. Up to 400 cells are counted for each slide. Cells were differentiated using standard morphometric techniques.\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\n\nThe mean+/−S.D. is calculated for each experimental group.\n\n\nResults are analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance is considered with p<0.05.\n\n\nExample 91\n\n\nExperimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis (EAE) Model\n\n\nCompounds according to the invention can be evaluated for their activity in a model for multiple sclerosis in mice.\n\n\nAnimals\n\n\nC57BL/6NCrlBR female mice are used. Mice are kept in wire cages (cm 32×14×13 h) with stainless steel feeders and fed on a standard diet (4RF21, Charles River, Italy) and water ad libitum. From day 7, wet pellets are also placed every day on the bottom of the cage. Plastic bottles are used in addition to the automatic water system.\n\n\nExperimental Procedure\n\n\nMice are immunized (day=0) by injecting s.c. in the left flank 0.2 ml of an emulsion composed of 200 μg MOG\n35-55 \npeptide (Neosystem, Strasbourg, France) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA, Difco, Detroit, U.S.A.) containing 0.5 mg of \nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n. Immediately after, they receive an i.p. injection of 500 ng pertussis toxin (List Biological Lab., Campbell, Calif., U.S.A.) dissolved in 400 μL of buffer (0.5 M NaCl, 0.017% Triton X-100, 0.015 M Tris, pH=7.5). On day 2, the animals are given a second injection of 500 ng pertussis toxin.\n\n\nOn day 7, the mice receive a second dose of 200 μg of MOG\n35-55 \npeptide in CFA injected s.c. in the right flank. Starting approximately from day 8-10, this procedure results in a progressing paralysis, arising from the tail and ascending up to the forelimbs.\n\n\nAnimals are individually weighed and are examined for the presence of paralysis that is scored according to the following score-system (1):\n\n\n0=no signs of disease\n\n\n0.5=partial tail paralysis\n\n\n1=tail paralysis\n\n\n1.5=tail paralysis+partial unilateral hindlimb paralysis\n\n\n2=tail paralysis+bilateral hindlimb weakness or partial paralysis\n\n\n2.5=tail paralysis+partial hindlimb paralysis (lowered pelvi)\n\n\n3=tail paralysis+complete hindlimb paralysis\n\n\n3.5=tail paralysis+hindlimb paralysis+incontinence\n\n\n4=tail paralysis+hindlimb paralysis+weakness or partial paralysis of forelimbs\n\n\n5=moribund or dead\n\n\nMortality and clinical signs are monitored daily in each group of treatment, by a technician who is unaware of treatments.\n\n\nDaily treatment with compounds, their vehicle or with a reference compound starts on day 7 and continued for 15 or 21 consecutive days in all groups.\n\n\nHistopathological Examination\n\n\nAt the end of the treatment period, each animal is anesthetised with sodium pentobarbital and is transcardially perfused-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde via the left ventricle. Fixed spinal cords are then carefully dissected out.\n\n\nSpinal cord slices are embedded in paraffin blocks. Sectioning and staining with hematoxylin and eosin and CD45 staining for inflammation, and with Kluver-PAS (Luxol fast blue plus Periodic Acid Schiff staining) and Bielchowski's staining for the detection of demyelination and axonal loss, are performed.\n\n\nIn the spinal cord, the total area of all slices is measured for each animal as points of intersection of a 10×10 grid at a magnification of 0.4×0.4 mm per grid. The perivascular inflammatory infiltrates are counted in each slice in order to obtain a total value for each animal and evaluated as number of infiltrates per mm\n2\n. Demyelination and axonal loss areas are measured for each animal as points of intersection of 10×10 grid at a magnification of 0.1×0.1 mm per grid and are expressed as a percentage of total demyelination area over the total area of the slices.\n\n\nData Evaluation and Statistical Analysis\n\n\nThe results of clinical and histopathological observations are expressed as the mean (±SEM) scores in each treatment group. Values obtained in the test drug-treated groups are compared with that of the positive control group. Significance of differences among groups relating to clinical score are analysed by one-way ANOVA, followed in case of significance (p<0.05) by Fisher test.\n\n\nDifferences among groups for the presence of perivascular inflammatory infiltrates and the extent of demyelination and axonal loss in the spinal cord as well as body weight data are analysed by one-way ANOVA, followed in case of significance (p<0.05) by Fisher test.\n\n\nExample 92\n\n\nPreparation of a Pharmaceutical Formulation\n\n\nThe following formulation examples illustrate representative pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention being not restricted thereto.\n\n\nFormulation 1—Tablets\n\n\nA compound of the invention is admixed as a dry powder with a dry gelatin binder in an approximate 1:2 weight ration.
