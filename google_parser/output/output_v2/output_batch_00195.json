Description\n\n\n\n\n29920-208831\n\n\nGLUCAGON/GLP-1 RECEPTOR CO-AGONI STS\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims priority to the following: U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/073,269 filed on June 17, 2008, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/078,168 filed July 3, 2008, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/090,412 filed on August 20, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/177,476 filed on May 12, 2009. The disclosure of each application is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND Pre-proglucagon is a 158 amino acid precursor polypeptide that is processed in different tissues to form a number of different proglucagon-derived peptides, including glucagon, glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP-I), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP- 2) and oxyntomodulin (OXM), that are involved in a wide variety of physiological functions, including glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, gastric emptying, and intestinal growth, as well as the regulation of food intake. Glucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 33 through 61 of pre-proglucagon, while GLP-I is produced as a 37-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 72 through 108 of pre-proglucagon. GLP-I (7-36) amide or GLP- 1(7-37) acid are biologically potent forms of GLP-I, that demonstrate essentially equivalent activity at the GLP-I receptor.\n\n\nHypoglycemia occurs when blood glucose levels drops too low to provide enough energy for the body's activities. In adults or children older than 10 years, hypoglycemia is uncommon except as a side effect of diabetes treatment, but it can result from other medications or diseases, hormone or enzyme deficiencies, or tumors. When blood glucose begins to fall, glucagon, a hormone produced by the pancreas, signals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose, causing blood glucose levels to rise toward a normal level. Thus, glucagon's most recognized role in glucose regulation is to counteract the action of insulin and maintain blood glucose levels. However for diabetics, this glucagon response to hypoglycemia may be impaired, making it harder for glucose levels to return to the normal range.\n\n\nHypoglycemia is a life threatening event that requires immediate medical attention. The administration of glucagon is an established medication for treating acute hypoglycemia and it can restore normal levels of glucose within minutes of\n\n\n1\n\n\n1 165316vl \n\n 29920-208831 administration. When glucagon is used in the acute medical treatment of hypoglycemia, a crystalline form of glucagon is solubilized with a dilute acid buffer and the solution is injected intramuscularly. While this treatment is effective, the methodology is cumbersome and dangerous for someone that is semi-conscious. Accordingly, there is a need for a glucagon analog that maintains or exceeds the biological performance of the parent molecule but is sufficiently soluble and stable, under relevant physiological conditions, that it can be pre-formulated as a solution, ready for injection.\n\n\nAdditionally, diabetics are encouraged to maintain near normal blood glucose levels to delay or prevent microvascular complications. Achievement of this goal usually requires intensive insulin therapy. In striving to achieve this goal, physicians have encountered a substantial increase in the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia in their diabetic patients. Accordingly, improved pharmaceuticals and methodologies are needed for treating diabetes that are less likely to induce hypoglycemia than current insulin therapies.\n\n\nGLP-I has different biological activities compared to glucagon. Its actions include stimulation of insulin synthesis and secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, and inhibition of food intake. GLP-I has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia (elevated glucose levels) in diabetics. Exendin-4, a peptide from lizard venom that shares about 50% amino acid identity with GLP-I, activates the GLP-I receptor and likewise has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetics.\n\n\nThere is also evidence that GLP-I and exendin-4 may reduce food intake and promote weight loss, an effect that would be beneficial not only for diabetics but also for patients suffering from obesity. Patients with obesity have a higher risk of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal diseases.\n\n\nAccordingly, there remains a need for alternative and preferably improved methods for treating diabetes and obesity.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nAs described herein, high potency glucagon agonists analogs are provided that also exhibit increased activity at the glucagon receptor, and in further embodiments exhibit enhanced biophysical stability and/or aqueous solubility. In addition, in accordance with another aspect of the invention, glucagon agonist analogs are \n\n 29920-208831 provided that have lost native glucagon's selectivity for the glucagon receptor verses the GLP-I receptor, and thus represent co-agonists of those two receptors. Selected amino acid modifications within the glucagon analogs can control the relative activity of the analog at the GLP-I receptor verses the glucagon receptor. Thus, yet another aspect of the invention provides glucagon co-agonist analogs that have higher activity at the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-I receptor, glucagon co-agonist analogs that have approximately equivalent activity at both receptors, and glucagon co-agonist analogs that have higher activity at the GLP-I receptor versus the glucagon receptor. The latter category of co-agonist can be engineered to exhibit little or no activity at the glucagon receptor, and yet retain ability to activate the GLP-I receptor with the same or better potency than native GLP-I. Any of these analogs may also include modifications that confer enhanced biophysical stability and/or aqueous solubility. Glucagon analogs that demonstrate co-agonism at the glucagon and GLP-I receptors are advantageous for several applications. First of all the use of glucagon to treat hypoglycemia may overcompensate for low blood glucose levels and result in excess blood glucose levels. If a glucagon/GLP- 1 receptor co-agonist is administered, the additional GLP-I stimulation may buffer the glucagon agonist effect to prevent excessive glucose blood levels resulting from treatment of hypoglycemia.\n\n\nIn addition as described herein, glucagon co-agonist analogs of the invention may be used to control hyperglycemia, or to induce weight loss or prevent weight gain, when administered alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic or anti- obesity treatments. Another compound that induces weight loss is oxyntomodulin, a naturally occurring digestive hormone found in the small intestine (see Diabetes 2005; 54:2390-2395). Oxyntomodulin is a 37 amino acid peptide that contains the 29 amino acid sequence of glucagon (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 1) followed by an 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA). While the present invention contemplates that glucagon analogs described herein may optionally be joined to this 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension (SEQ ID NO: 27), the invention in some embodiments also specifically contemplates analogs and uses of analogs lacking the 8 contiguous carboxy amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 27.\n\n\nThe compounds can be customized by amino acid modifications to regulate the GLP-I activity of the peptide, and thus the glucagon analogs of the present can be tailored to treat a particular condition or disease. More particularly, glucagon analogs are provided herein wherein each analog displays a characteristic relative level of \n\n 29920-208831 activity at the respective glucagon and GLP-I receptors. For example, modifications can be made to each peptide to produce a glucagon peptide having anywhere from at least about 1% (including at least about 1.5%, 2%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%) to about 200% or higher activity at the GLP-I receptor relative to native GLP-I and anywhere from at least about 1%\n\n\n(including about 1.5%, 2%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, 400%, 450%) to about 500% or higher activity at the glucagon receptor relative to native glucagon. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit no more than about 100%, 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1 ,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit no more than about 100%, 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native GLP-I at the GLP-I receptor. The amino acid sequence of native glucagon is SEQ ID NO: 1, the amino acid sequence of GLP-I (7-36)amide is SEQ ID NO: 52, and the amino acid sequence of GLP-I (7-37)acid is SEQ ID NO: 50. In exemplary embodiments, a glucagon peptide may exhibit at least 10% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least 50% of the activity of native GLP-I at the GLP-I receptor, or at least 40% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least 40% of the activity of native GLP-I at the GLP- 1 receptor, or at least 60% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least 60% of the activity of native GLP-I at the GLP-I receptor.\n\n\nSelectivity of a glucagon peptide for the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-I receptor can be described as the relative ratio of glucagon/GLP- 1 activity (the peptide's activity at the glucagon receptor relative to native glucagon, divided by the peptide's activity at the GLP-I receptor relative to native GLP-I). For example, a glucagon peptide that exhibits 60% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and 60% of the activity of native GLP-I at the GLP- 1 receptor has a 1 : 1 ratio of glucagon/GLP- 1 activity. Exemplary ratios of glucagon/GLP- 1 activity include about 1 : 1, 1.5: 1, 2:1 , 3: 1, 4: 1, 5:1, 6:1, 7: 1, 8:1, 9:1 or 10: 1, or about 1 : 10, 1 :9, 1 :8, 1 :7, 1:6, 1 :5, 1 :4, 1 :3, 1 :2, or 1 :1.5. As an example, a glucagon/GLP- 1 activity ratio of 10: 1 indicates a 10-fold selectivity for the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-I receptor. Similarly, a GLP-I /glucagon activity ratio of 10: 1 indicates a 10- fold selectivity for the GLP-I receptor versus the glucagon receptor. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment, analogs of glucagon are provided that have enhanced potency and optionally improved solubility and stability. In one embodiment, enhanced glucagon potency is provided by an amino acid modification at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1). By way of nonlimiting example, such enhanced potency can be provided by substituting the naturally occurring serine at position 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms. In one embodiment the enhanced potency glucagon agonist comprises a peptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7 or a glucagon agonist analog of SEQ ID NO: 5. In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon analog protein having enhanced potency at the glucagon receptor relative to wild type glucagon is provided wherein the peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10, wherein the glucagon peptide retains its selectivity for the glucagon receptor relative to the GLP-I receptors.\n\n\nGlucagon receptor activity can be reduced, maintained, or enhanced by an amino acid modification at position 3, e.g. substitution of the naturally occurring glutamine at position 3. In one embodiment, substitution of the amino acid at position 3 with an acidic, basic, or hydrophobic amino acid (glutamic acid, ornithine, norleucine) has been shown to substantially reduce or destroy glucagon receptor activity. The analogs that are substituted with, for example, glutamic acid, ornithine, or norleucine have about 10% or less of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, e.g. about 1 - 10%, or about 0.1-10%, or greater than about 0.1% but less than about 10%, while exhibiting at least 20% of the activity of GLP-I at the GLP-I receptor. For example, exemplary analogs described herein have about 0.5%, about 1% or about 7% of the activity of native glucagon, while exhibiting at least 20% of the activity of GLP-I at the GLP-I receptor. In another embodiment, the naturally occurring glutamine at position 3 of the glucagon peptide can be substituted with a glutamine analog without a substantial loss of activity at the glucagon receptor, and in some cases, with an enhancement of glucagon receptor activity. For example, a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at position 3 may exhibit about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 50%, or \n\n 29920-208831 about 85% or greater the activity of native glucagon (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 1) at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at position 3 may exhibit about 20%, about 50%, about 75%, about 100%, about 200% or about 500% or greater the activity of a corresponding glucagon peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at position 3 (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 601 or SEQ ID NO: 602) at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at position 3 exhibits enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor, but the enhanced activity is no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1 ,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon or of a corresponding glucagon peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at position 3.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the glutamine analog is a naturally occurring or a non- naturally occurring amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I, II or III: \n\n\n\n\n\nStructure I\n\n\nO ■|-R\n1\n-CH\n2\n-N-Y\n\n\nStructure II\n\n\nO -|-R\n1\n-CH\n2\n-S-CH\n2\n-R\n4\n Structure III\n\n\nwherein R\n1\n is C\n0-3\n alkyl or C\n0-3\n heteroalkyl; R\n2\n is NHR\n4\n or Ci\n-3\n alkyl; R\n3\n is C\n1-3\n alkyl; R\n4\n is H or C,.\n3\n alkyl; X is NH, O, or S; and Y is NHR\n4\n, SR\n3\n, or OR\n3\n. In some embodiments, X is NH or Y is NHR\n4\n. In some embodiments, R\n1\n is C\n0\n-2 alkyl or Ci heteroalkyl. In some embodiments, R\n2\n is NHR\n4\n or Ci alkyl. In some embodiments, R\n4\n is H or C\n1\n alkyl. In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I is provided where, R\n1\n is CH\n2\n-S, X is NH, and R\n2\n is CH\n3\n (acetamidomethyl-cysteine, C(Acm)); R\n1\n is CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2\n is CH\n3\n (acetyldiaminobutanoic acid, Dab(Ac)); R\n1\n is C\n0\n alkyl, X is NH, R\n2\n is NHR\n4\n, and R\n4\n is H (carbamoyldiaminopropanoic acid, Dap(urea)); or R\n1\n is CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2\n is CH\n3\n (acetylornithine, Om(Ac)). In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid \n\n 29920-208831 comprising a side chain of Structure II is provide where, R\n1\n is CH\n2\n, Y is NHR\n4\n, and R\n4\n is CH\n3\n (methylglutamine, Q(Me)); In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure III is provided where, R\n1\n is CH\n2\n and R\n4\n is H (methionine-sulfoxide, M(O)); In specific embodiments, the amino acid at position 3 is substituted with Dab(Ac) For example, glucagon agonists can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 595, SEQ ID NO: 601 SEQ ID NO: 603, SEQ ID NO: 604, SEQ ID NO: 605, and SEQ ID NO: 606.\n\n\nIn another embodiment analogs of glucagon are provided that have enhanced or retained potency at the glucagon receptor relative to the native glucagon peptide, but also have greatly enhanced activity at the GLP-I receptor. Glucagon normally has about 1% of the activity of native-GLP-1 at the GLP-I receptor, while GLP-I normally has less than about 0.01% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor. Enhanced activity at the GLP- 1 receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester. In one embodiment, these glucagon analogs comprise a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20 wherein the carboxy terminal amino acid has an amide group in place of the carboxylic acid group found on the native amino acid. These glucagon analogs have strong activity at both the glucagon and GLP-I receptors and thus act as co- agonists at both receptors. In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon and GLP- 1 receptor co-agonist is provided wherein the peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein the amino acid at position 28 is Asn or Lys and the amino acid at position 29 is Thr-amide.\n\n\nEnhanced activity at the GLP-I receptor is also provided by stabilizing the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (around amino acids 12- 29), through formation of an intramolecular bridge between the side chains of two amino acids that are separated by three intervening amino acids, i.e., an amino acid at position \"i\" and an amino acid at position \"i+4\", wherein i is any integer between 12 and 25, by two intervening amino acids, i.e., an amino acid at position \"j\" and an amino acid at position \"j+3,\" wherein j is any integer between 12 and 27, or by six intervening amino acids, i.e., an amino acid at position \"k\" and an amino acid at position \"k+7,\" wherein k is any integer between 12 and 22. In exemplary embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 8 (or about 7-9) atoms in length and forms between side chains of amino acids at positions 12 and 16, or at positions 16 and 20, or at positions 20 and 24, or at positions 24 and 28. The side chains of these amino \n\n 29920-208831 acids can be linked to one another through non-covalent bonds, e.g., hydrogen- bonding or ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds.\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment a glucagon agonist is provided comprising a glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein a lactam ring is formed between the side chains of a lysine residue, located at position 12, 20 or 28, and a glutamic acid residue, located at position 16 or 24, wherein the two amino acids of the glucagon peptide whose side chains participate in forming the lactam ring are spaced from one another by three intervening amino acids. In accordance with one embodiment the lactam bearing glucagon analog comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1 1, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17 and SEQ ID NO: 18. In one embodiment the carboxy terminal amino acid of the lactam bearing peptide comprises an amide group or an ester group in place of the terminal carboxylic acid. In one embodiment a glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 1 , SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, and SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17 and SEQ ID NO: 18 further comprises an additional amino acid covalently bound to the carboxy terminus of SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17 or SEQ ID NO: 18. In a further embodiment a glucagon peptide is provided comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 66, SEQ ID NO: 67, SEQ ID NO: 68 and SEQ ID NO: 69 further comprises an additional amino acid covalently bound to the carboxy terminus of SEQ ID NO: 66, SEQ ID NO: 67, SEQ ID NO: 68 and SEQ ID NO: 69. In one embodiment the amino acid at position 28 is asparagine or lysine and the amino acid at position 29 is threonine.\n\n\nIn some specific embodiments, stabilization of the alpha helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon agonist peptide is achieved through the formation of a covalent intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods (i.e., means of forming a covalent intramolecular bridge) include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization are used to stabilize the alpha helix. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nEnhanced activity at the GLP-I receptor is also provided by stabilizing the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29) through introduction of one or more α, α-disubstituted amino acids at positions that retain the desired activity. In some aspects, stabilization of the alpha- helix is accomplished in this manner without purposeful introduction of an intramolecular bridge such as a salt bridge or covalent bond. Such peptides may be considered herein as a peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge. In specific aspects, stabilization of the alpha-helix is accomplished by introducing one or more α, α- disubstituted amino acids without introduction of a covalent intramolecular bridge, e.g., a lactam bridge, a disulfide bridge. Such peptides may be considered herein as a peptide lacking a covalent intramolecular bridge. In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of positions 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 of a glucagon peptide is substituted with an α, α-disubstituted amino acid. For example, substitution of position 16 of the glucagon peptide with amino iso-butyric acid (AIB) enhances GLP- 1 activity, in the absence of a salt bridge or lactam. In some embodiments, one, two, three or more of positions 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with AIB.\n\n\nEnhanced activity at the GLP-I and glucagon receptors for glucagon analog peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge (e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge) is provided by the addition of an acyl or alkyl group to the side chain of the amino acid at position 10 of the peptide. In some aspects, the acyl or alkyl group is not naturally- occurring on an amino acid. In specific aspects, the acyl or alkyl group is non-native to any naturally-occuring amino acid. In some embodiments, the acyl group is a fatty acyl group, e.g., a C4 to C30 fatty acyl group. For example, provided herein is a glucagon analog peptide lacking a covalent intramolecular bridge comprising AIB at position 16 and a C 14, Cl 6, or C 18 fatty acyl group covalently attached to a Lys residue at position 10. Also provided is a glucagon analog peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge (e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge) comprising AIB at positions 2 and 16 and a C 14, C 16, or Cl 8 fatty acyl group covalently attached to a Lys residue at position 10. Such acylated glucagon analog peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge (e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge) may be pegylated as further described herein.\n\n\nA further enhancement in GLP-I activity and glucagon activity for acylated glucagon analog peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge (e.g., an intramolecular bridge) may be achieved by incorporating a spacer between the acyl or alkyl group \n\n 29920-208831 and the side chain of the amino acid at position 10. In accordance with some embodiments, the spacer (e.g., an amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer, or a hydrophobic bifunctional spacer) is 3 to 10 atoms (e.g., 6 to 10 atoms) in length. In accordance with certain specific embodiments, the total length of the spacer and acyl or alkyl group is 14 to 28 atoms, e.g., 17 to 28, 19 to 26 atoms, 19 to 21 atoms. Suitable spacers for purposes of enhancing GLP-I activity and glucagon activity for acylated or alkylated peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge (e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge) are further described herein.\n\n\nFor example, provided herein is a non-native glucagon peptide that differs from SEQ ID NO: 1 by no more than 10 amino acid modifications, comprising an acyl group or alkyl group, wherein the acyl or alkyl group is attached to a spacer and the spacer is attached to the side chain of an amino acid at position 10 of the glucagon peptide, wherein, when said glucagon peptide lacks a hydrophilic moiety, e.g., PEG, said glucagon peptide exhibits at least 20% (e.g., at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90% at least 95%, at least 98%, at least 99%, about 100%, about 150%, about 200%, about 400%, about 500% or more) of the activity of native GLP-I at the GLP-I receptor. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide exhibits at least 0.5% (e.g., at least 1%, at least 2%, at least 3%, at least 4%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%) of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, when the glucagon peptide lacks a hydrophilic moiety, e.g., PEG. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described above may exhibit any of the above indicated activities and no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1 ,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described above may exhibit any of the above indicated activities and no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1 ,000,000% of the activity of native GLP-I at the GLP-I receptor.\n\n\nEnhanced activity at the GLP-I receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at position 20. In one embodiment, the glutamine at position 20 is replaced with another hydrophilic amino acid having a side chain that is either charged or has an ability to hydrogen-bond, and is at least about 5 (or about 4-6) atoms in length, for example, lysine, citrulline, arginine, or ornithine.\n\n\nAny of the modifications described above which increase or decrease glucagon receptor activity and which increase GLP-I receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Combinations of the modifications that increase GLP- \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\n1 receptor activity may provide higher GLP-I activity than any of such modifications taken alone. For example, the invention provides glucagon analogs that comprise modifications at position 16, at position 20, and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at positions 16 and 20; glucagon analogs that comprise modifications at position 16 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; glucagon analogs that comprise modifications at positions 16 and 20, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at positions 16 and 20; and glucagon analogs that comprise modifications at position 20 and at the C- terminal carboxylic acid group; optionally with the proviso that the amino acid at position 12 is not Arg; or optionally with the proviso that the amino acid at position 9 is not GIu.\n\n\nOther modifications at position 1 or 2, as described herein, can increase the peptide's resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleavage. For example, the amino acid at position 2 may be substituted with D-serine, D-alanine, valine, glycine, N-methyl serine, N-methyl alanine, or amino isobutyric acid. Alternatively, or in addition, the amino acid at position 1 may be substituted with D-histidine, desaminohistidine, hydroxyl-histidine, acetyl-histidine, homo-histidine, N-methyl histidine, alpha-methyl histidine, imidazole acetic acid, or alpha, alpha-dimethyl imidiazole acetic acid (DMIA). It was observed that modifications at position 2 (e.g. AIB at position 2) and in some cases modifications at position 1 may reduce glucagon activity, sometimes significantly; surprisingly, this reduction in glucagon activity can be restored by stabilizing the alpha-helix in the C-terminal portion of glucagon, e.g. through a covalent bond between amino acids at positions \"i\" and \"i+4\", e.g., 12 and 16, 16 and 20, or 20 and 24. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is a lactam bridge between a glutamic acid at position 16 and a lysine at position 20. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur- containing bridge formation, the use of α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization.\n\n\nGlucagon peptides with GLP-I activity that contain a non-conservative substitution of His at position 1 with a large, aromatic amino acid (e.g., Tyr) can retain GLP-I activity provided that the alpha-helix is stabilized via an intramolecular \n\n 29920-208831 bridge, e.g. through a covalent bond between amino acids at positions \"i\" and \"i+4\", e.g., 12 and 16, 16 and 20, or 20 and 24. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is a lactam bridge between a glutamic acid at position 16 and a lysine at position 20. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur- containing bridge formation, the use of α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization.\n\n\nIn yet further exemplary embodiments, any of the foregoing compounds can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid at position 15 of SEQ ID NO: 1 to reduce degradation of the peptide over time, especially in acidic or alkaline buffers.\n\n\nIn another embodiment the solubility of the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are enhanced by the covalent linkage of a hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. In one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, optionally linked to the peptide at one or more of positions 16, 17, 21 , 24, 29, within a C- terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid. In some embodiments, the native amino acid at that position is substituted with an amino acid having a side chain suitable for crosslinking with hydrophilic moieties, to facilitate linkage of the hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. In other embodiments, an amino acid modified to comprise a hydrophilic group is added to the peptide at the C-terminal amino acid. In one embodiment the peptide co-agonist comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1 1, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18 and SEQ ID NO: 19 wherein the side chain of an amino acid residue at one of position 16, 17, 21 or 24 of said glucagon peptide further comprises a polyethylene glycol chain, having a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 40,000 Daltons. In one embodiment the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons. In another embodiment the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight of about 10,000 to about 20,000 Daltons. In yet other exemplary embodiments the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight of about 20,000 to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\nIn another embodiment the solubility of any of the preceding glucagon analogs can be improved by amino acid substitutions and/or additions that introduce a charged \n\n 29920-208831 amino acid into the C-terminal portion of the peptide, preferably at a position C- terminal to position 27 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Optionally, one, two or three charged amino acids may be introduced within the C-terminal portion, preferably C-terminal to position 27. In accordance with one embodiment the native amino acid(s) at positions 28 and/or 29 are substituted with a charged amino acids, and/or in a further embodiment one to three charged amino acids are also added to the C-terminus of the peptide. In exemplary embodiments, one, two or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. Additional modifications, e.g. conservative substitutions, may be made to the glucagon peptide that still allow it to retain glucagon activity. In one embodiment an analog of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 20 is provided wherein the analog differs from SEQ ID NO: 20 by 1 to 2 amino acid substitutions at positions 17- 26, and in one embodiment the analog differs from the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 20 by an amino acid substitution at position 20.\n\n\nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are modified by truncation of the C-terminus by one or two amino acid residues.\n\n\nSuch modified glucagon peptides, as shown herein, retain similar activity and potency at the glucagon receptor and GLP- 1 receptor. In this regard, the glucagon peptides can comprise amino acids 1 -27 or 1-28 of the native glucagon peptide (SEQ ID NO: 1), optionally with any of the additional modifications described herein. In accordance with one embodiment the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are modified by the addition of a second peptide to the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide, for example, SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 27 or SEQ ID NO: 28. In one embodiment a glucagon peptide having a peptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1 1 , SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 66, SEQ ID NO: 67, SEQ ID NO: 68, and SEQ ID NO: 69 is covalently bound through a peptide bond to a second peptide, wherein the second peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 27 and SEQ ID NO: 28. In a further embodiment, in glucagon peptides which comprise the C-terminal extension, the threonine at position 29 of the native glucagon peptide is replaced with a glycine. A glucagon analog having a glycine substitution for threonine at position 29 and comprising the carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 26 is four times as potent at the GLP-I receptor as native glucagon modified to comprise the carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 26. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nPotency at the GLP-I receptor can be further enhanced by an alanine substitution for the native arginine at position 18.\n\n\nAny of the glucagon peptides disclosed herein can be modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group, e.g., a C4 to C30 acyl or alkyl group. In some aspects, the acyl group or alkyl group is non-native to any naturally-occurring amino acid. Acylation or alkylation can increase the half-life of the glucagon peptides in circulation. Acylation or alkylation can advantageously delay the onset of action and/or extend the duration of action at the glucagon and/or GLP-I receptors and/or improve resistance to proteases such as DPP-IV. As shown herein, the activity at the glucagon receptor and GLP- 1 receptor of the glucagon peptide is maintained, if not substantially enhanced, after acylation. Further, the potency of the acylated glucagon peptides were comparable to the unacylated versions of the glucagon peptides, if not substantially enhanced. Glucagon peptides may be acylated or alkylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. In some embodiments, the invention provides a glucagon peptide modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group covalently linked to the amino acid at position 10 of the glucagon peptide. The glucagon peptide may further comprise a spacer between the amino acid at position 10 of the glucagon peptide and the acyl group or alkyl group. In some embodiments, the acyl group is a fatty acid or bile acid, or salt thereof, e.g. a C4 to C30 fatty acid, a C8 to C24 fatty acid, cholic acid, a C4 to C30 alkyl, a C8 to C24 alkyl, or an alkyl comprising a steroid moiety of a bile acid. The spacer is any moiety with suitable reactive groups for attaching acyl or alkyl groups. In exemplary embodiments, the spacer comprises an amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer, or a hydrophobic bifunctional spacer. In some embodiments, the spacer is selected from the group consisting of: Tip, GIu, Asp, Cys and a spacer comprising NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)n(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12. Such acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides may also further comprise a hydrophilic moiety, optionally a polyethylene glycol. Any of the foregoing glucagon peptides may comprise two acyl groups or two alkyl groups, or a combination thereof.\n\n\nThus, as disclosed herein high potency glucagon analogs or glucagon co- agonist analogs are provided that also exhibit improved solubility and/or stability. An exemplary high potency glucagon analog exhibits at least about 200% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, and optionally is soluble at a \n\n 29920-208831 concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8, or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide (e.g. 5% or less of the original peptide is degraded or cleaved) after 24 hours at 25°C. As another example, an exemplary glucagon co-agonist analog exhibits greater than about 40% or greater than about 60% activity at both the glucagon and the GLP-I receptors (at a ratio between about 1 :3 and 3: 1 , or between about 1 :2 and 2:1), is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25°C. Another exemplary glucagon co-agonist analog exhibits about 175% or more of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and about 20% or less of the activity of native GLP-I at the GLP-I receptor, is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25°C. Yet another exemplary glucagon co- agonist analog exhibits about 10% or less of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least about 20% of the activity of native GLP- 1 at the GLP- 1 receptor, is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25°C. Yet another exemplary glucagon co-agonist analog exhibits about 10% or less but above 0.1% , 0.5% or 1% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 100% or more of the activity of native GLP-I at the GLP-I receptor, is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25°C. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides exhibit no more than about 100%, 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native GLP-I at the GLP-I receptor. In some embodiments, such glucagon analogs retain at least 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 or 28 of the naturally occurring amino acids at the corresponding positions in native glucagon (e.g. have 1-7, 1-5 or 1-3 modifications relative to naturally occurring glucagon). Any one of the following peptides is excluded from the compounds of the invention, although any of the following peptides comprising one or more further modifications thereto as described herein exhibiting the desired GLP-I or co-agonist activity, pharmaceutical compositions, kits, and treatment methods using such \n\n 29920-208831 compounds may be included in the invention: The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with an [Argl2] substitution and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Argl2,Lys20] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Argl2,Lys24] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Argl2,Lys29] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with a [Glu9] substitution; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 missing Hisl, with [Glu9, GIu 16, Lys29] substitutions and C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Glu9, GIu 16, Lys29] substitutions and with a C- terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Lysl3, Glul7] substitutions linked via lactam bridge and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Lysl7, Glu21] substitutions linked via lactam bridge and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 missing Hisl, with [Glu20, Lys24] substitutions linked via lactam bridge.\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment a pharmaceutical composition is provided comprising any of the novel glucagon peptides disclosed herein, preferably sterile and preferably at a purity level of at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%, and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or excipient. Such compositions may contain a glucagon peptide at a concentration of at least A, wherein A is 0.001 mg/ml, 0.01 mg/ml, 0.1 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, 1 mg/ml, 2 mg/ml, 3 mg/ml, 4 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml, 6 mg/ml, 7 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml, 9 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, 1 1 mg/ml, 12 mg/ml, 13 mg/ml, 14 mg/ml, 15 mg/ml, 16 mg/ml, 17 mg/ml, 18 mg/ml, 19 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml, 21 mg/ml, 22 mg/ml, 23 mg/ml, 24 mg/ml, 25 mg/ml or higher.

In some embodiments, the compositions may contain a glucagon peptide at a concentration range of A to B mg/ml, for example, 0.001 to 30.0 mg/ml. In one embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions comprise aqueous solutions that are sterilized and optionally stored within various containers. The compounds of the present invention can be used in accordance with one embodiment to prepare pre-formulated solutions ready for injection. In other embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions comprise a lyophilized powder. The pharmaceutical compositions can be further packaged as \n\n 29920-208831 part of a kit that includes a disposable device for administering the composition to a patient. The containers or kits may be labeled for storage at ambient room temperature or at refrigerated temperature.\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment a method of rapidly increasing glucose level or treating hypoglycemia using a pre-formulated aqueous composition of glucagon peptides of the invention is provided. The method comprises the step of administering an effective amount of an aqueous solution comprising a novel modified glucagon peptide of the present disclosure. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide is pegylated at position 21 or 24 of the glucagon peptide and the PEG chain has a molecular weight of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons. In one embodiment the modified glucagon solution is prepackaged in a device that is used to administer the composition to the patient suffering from hypoglycemia.\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment an improved method of regulating blood glucose levels in insulin dependent patients is provided. The method comprises the steps of administering insulin in an amount therapeutically effective for the control of diabetes and administering a novel modified glucagon peptide of the present disclosure in an amount therapeutically effective for the prevention of hypoglycemia, wherein said administering steps are conducted within twelve hours of each other. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide and the insulin are co-administered as a single composition, wherein the glucagon peptide is pegylated with a PEG chain having a molecular weight selected from the range of about 5,000 to about 40,000 Daltons In another embodiment a method is provided for inducing the temporary paralysis of the intestinal tract. The method comprises the step of administering one or more of the glucagon peptides disclosed herein to a patient. Metabolic Syndrome, also known as metabolic syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome or Reaven's syndrome, is a disorder that affects over 50 million Americans. Metabolic Syndrome is typically characterized by a clustering of at least three or more of the following risk factors: (1) abdominal obesity (excessive fat tissue in and around the abdomen), (2) atherogenic dyslipidemia (blood fat disorders including high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol that enhance the accumulation of plaque in the artery walls), (3) elevated blood pressure, (4) insulin resistance or glucose intolerance, (5) prothrombotic state (e.g. high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 in blood), and (6) pro-inflammatory state (e.g. \n\n 29920-208831 elevated C-reactive protein in blood). Other risk factors may include aging, hormonal imbalance and genetic predisposition.\n\n\nMetabolic Syndrome is associated with an increased the risk of coronary heart disease and other disorders related to the accumulation of vascular plaque, such as stroke and peripheral vascular disease, referred to as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients with Metabolic Syndrome may progress from an insulin resistant state in its early stages to full blown type II diabetes with further increasing risk of ASCVD. Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, the relationship between insulin resistance, Metabolic Syndrome and vascular disease may involve one or more concurrent pathogenic mechanisms including impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation, insulin resistance-associated reduction in NO availability due to enhanced oxidative stress, and abnormalities in adipocyte-derived hormones such as adiponectin (Lteif and Mather, Can. J. Cardiol. 20 (suppl. B):66B- 76B (2004)). According to the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult\n\n\nTreatment Panel (ATP III), any three of the following traits in the same individual meet the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome: (a) abdominal obesity (a waist circumference over 102 cm in men and over 88 cm in women); (b) serum triglycerides (150 mg/dl or above); (c) HDL cholesterol (40 mg/dl or lower in men and 50 mg/dl or lower in women); (d) blood pressure (130/85 or more); and (e) fasting blood glucose (1 10 mg/dl or above). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an individual having high insulin levels (an elevated fasting blood glucose or an elevated post meal glucose alone) with at least two of the following criteria meets the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome: (a) abdominal obesity (waist to hip ratio of greater than 0.9, a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m\n2\n, or a waist measurement over 37 inches); (b) cholesterol panel showing a triglyceride level of at least 150 mg/dl or an HDL cholesterol lower than 35 mg/dl; (c) blood pressure of 140/90 or more, or on treatment for high blood pressure). (Mathur, Ruchi, \"Metabolic Syndrome,\" ed. Shiel, Jr., William C, MedicineNet.com, May 1 1 , 2009). For purposes herein, if an individual meets the criteria of either or both of the criteria set forth by the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel or the WHO, that individual is considered as afflicted with Metabolic Syndrome. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nWithout being bound to any particular theory, glucagon peptides described herein are useful for treating Metabolic Syndrome. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of preventing or treating Metabolic Syndrome, or reducing one, two, three or more risk factors thereof, in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a glucagon peptide described herein in an amount effective to prevent or treat Metabolic Syndrome, or the risk factor thereof.\n\n\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to a wide spectrum of liver disease ranging from simple fatty liver (steatosis), to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to cirrhosis (irreversible, advanced scarring of the liver). All of the stages of NAFLD have in common the accumulation of fat (fatty infiltration) in the liver cells (hepatocytes). Simple fatty liver is the abnormal accumulation of a certain type of fat, triglyceride, in the liver cells with no inflammation or scarring. In NASH, the fat accumulation is associated with varying degrees of inflammation (hepatitis) and scarring (fibrosis) of the liver. The inflammatory cells can destroy the liver cells (hepatocellular necrosis). In the terms \"steatohepatitis\" and \"steatonecrosis\", steato refers to fatty infiltration, hepatitis refers to inflammation in the liver, and necrosis refers to destroyed liver cells. NASH can ultimately lead to scarring of the liver (fibrosis) and then irreversible, advanced scarring (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis that is caused by NASH is the last and most severe stage in the NAFLD spectrum. (Mendler, Michel, \"Fatty Liver: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH),\" ed. Schoenfield, Leslie J., MedicineNet.com, August 29, 2005).\n\n\nAlcoholic Liver Disease, or Alcohol-Induced Liver Disease, encompasses three pathologically distinct liver diseases related to or caused by the excessive consumption of alcohol: fatty liver (steatosis), chronic or acute hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Alcoholic hepatitis can range from a mild hepatitis, with abnormal laboratory tests being the only indication of disease, to severe liver dysfunction with complications such as jaundice (yellow skin caused by bilirubin retention), hepatic encephalopathy (neurological dysfunction caused by liver failure), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen), bleeding esophageal varices (varicose veins in the esophagus), abnormal blood clotting and coma. Histologically, alcoholic hepatitis has a characteristic appearance with ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, inflammation with neutrophils and sometimes Mallory bodies (abnormal aggregations of cellular intermediate filament proteins). Cirrhosis is characterized anatomically by \n\n 29920-208831 widespread nodules in the liver combined with fibrosis. (Worman, Howard J., \"Alcoholic Liver Disease\", Columbia University Medical Center website).\n\n\nWithout being bound to any particular theory, glucagon peptides described herein are useful for the treatment of Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or any stage thereof, including, for example, steatosis, steatohepatitis, hepatitis, hepatic inflammation, NASH, cirrhosis, or complications thereof. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of preventing or treating Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or any stage thereof, in a subject comprising administering to a subject a glucagon peptide described herein in an amount effective to prevent or treat Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or the stage thereof. Such treatment methods include reduction in one, two, three or more of the following: liver fat content, incidence or progression of cirrhosis, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, signs of inflammation, e.g. abnormal hepatic enzyme levels (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase AST and/or alanine aminotransferase ALT, or LDH), elevated serum ferritin, elevated serum bilirubin, and/or signs of fibrosis, e.g. elevated TGF-beta levels. In preferred embodiments, the glucagon peptides are used treat patients who have progressed beyond simple fatty liver (steatosis) and exhibit signs of inflammation or hepatitis. Such methods may result, for example, in reduction of AST and/or ALT levels. In yet another embodiment a method of treating hyperglycemia, or a method of reducing weight gain or inducing weight loss is provided, which involves administering an effective amount of an aqueous solution comprising a glucagon peptide of the invention. In one embodiment either method comprises administering an effective amount of a composition comprising a glucagon agonist selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1 1 , SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18 and SEQ ID NO: 19. In another embodiment, the method comprises administering an effective amount of a composition comprising a glucagon agonist, wherein the glucagon agonist comprising a glucagon peptide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1 1 , SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 66, SEQ ID NO: 67, SEQ ID NO: 68, and SEQ ID NO: 69, wherein amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide is bound to a second peptide through a peptide bond, and said second peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 27 or SEQ ID NO: 28. In \n\n 29920-208831 further embodiments, methods of treating diabetes involving co-administering a conventional dose or a reduced dose of insulin and a glucagon peptide of the invention are provided. Methods of treating diabetes with a glucagon peptide of the invention, without co-administering insulin are also provided. In yet another aspect, the invention provides novel methods for treating hyperglycemia and novel methods for decreasing appetite or promoting body weight loss that involve administration of a glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist molecule (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof) that activates both the glucagon receptor and the GLP-I receptor. Agonism, i.e., activation, of both the glucagon and GLP-I receptors provides an unexpected improvement compared to GLP-I agonism alone in treating hyperglycemia. Thus, the addition of glucagon agonism provides an unexpected additive or synergistic effect, or other unexpected clinical benefit(s). Administration with a conventional dose of insulin, a reduced dose of insulin, or without insulin is contemplated according to such methods. Agonism of the glucagon receptor also has an unexpected beneficial effect compared to GLP-I agonism alone in promoting weight loss or preventing weight gain.\n\n\nExemplary glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist molecules include glucagon peptides of the invention, GLP-I analogs that activate both GLP-I and glucagon receptors, fusions of glucagon and GLP-I , or fusions of glucagon analogs and GLP-I analogs, or chemically modified derivatives thereof. Alternatively, a compound that activates the glucagon receptor can be co-administered with a compound that activates the GLP-I receptor (such as a GLP-I analog, an exendin-4 analog, or derivatives thereof)- The invention also contemplates co-administration of a glucagon agonist analog with a GLP- 1 agonist analog. Such methods for treating hyperglycemia and/or for decreasing appetite or promoting body weight loss include administration of a glucagon analog with a modification at position 12 (e.g. Argl2), optionally in combination with modifications at position 16 and/or 20. The methods of the invention also include administration of glucagon analogs comprising an intramolecular bridge between the side chains of two amino acids within the region of amino acids 12 and 29 that are separated by three intervening amino acids, e.g. positions 12 and 16, positions 13 and 17 (e.g.. Lysl 3 GIu 17 or GIu 13 Lys 17), positions 16 and 20, positions 17 and 21 (e.g. Lysl 7 Glu 21 or GIu 17 Lys 21 ), positions 20 and 24, or positions 24 and 28, with the optional \n\n 29920-208831 proviso that the amino acid at position 9 is not GIu, and optionally including a C- terminal amide or ester.\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment excluded from such glucagon/GLP- 1 co- agonist molecules are any glucagon analogs or GLP-I analogs in the prior art known to be useful in such a method. In another embodiment peptides described in U.S. Patent No. 6,864,069 as acting as both a GLP-I agonist and a glucagon antagonist for treating diabetes are also excluded as glucagon/GLP- 1 co-agonist molecules.

The term also encompasses any of the agents approved by a regulatory agency of the US Federal government or listed in the US Pharmacopeia for use in animals, including humans.\n\n\nAs used herein the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" refers to salts of compounds that retain the biological activity of the parent compound, and which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Many of the compounds disclosed herein are capable of forming acid and/or base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and/or carboxyl groups or groups similar thereto.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be prepared from inorganic and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases, include by way of example only, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium and magnesium salts.\n\n\nSalts derived from organic bases include, but are not limited to, salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from inorganic and organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Salts derived from organic acids include acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, \n\n 29920-208831 tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluene-sulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"treating\" includes prophylaxis of the specific disorder or condition, or alleviation of the symptoms associated with a specific disorder or condition and/or preventing or eliminating said symptoms. For example, as used herein the term \"treating diabetes\" will refer in general to altering glucose blood levels in the direction of normal levels and may include increasing or decreasing blood glucose levels depending on a given situation.\n\n\nAs used herein an \"effective\" amount or a \"therapeutically effective amount\" of a glucagon peptide refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the peptide to provide the desired effect. For example one desired effect would be the prevention or treatment of hypoglycemia, as measured, for example, by an increase in blood glucose level. An alternative desired effect for the co-agonist analogs of the present disclosure would include treating hyperglycemia, e.g., as measured by a change in blood glucose level closer to normal, or inducing weight loss/preventing weight gain, e.g., as measured by reduction in body weight, or preventing or reducing an increase in body weight, or normalizing body fat distribution. The amount that is \"effective\" will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of the individual, mode of administration, and the like. Thus, it is not always possible to specify an exact \"effective amount.\" However, an appropriate \"effective\" amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.\n\n\nThe term, \"parenteral\" means not through the alimentary canal but by some other route such as subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraspinal, or intravenous. As used herein, the term \"purified\" and like terms relate to the isolation of a molecule or compound in a form that is substantially free of contaminants normally associated with the molecule or compound in a native or natural environment. As used herein, the term \"purified\" does not require absolute purity; rather, it is intended as a relative definition. The term \"purified polypeptide\" is used herein to describe a polypeptide which has been separated from other compounds including, but not limited to nucleic acid molecules, lipids and carbohydrates.\n\n\nThe term \"isolated\" requires that the referenced material be removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally-occurring polynucleotide present in a living animal is not \n\n 29920-208831 isolated, but the same polynucleotide, separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"peptide\" encompasses a sequence of 3 or more amino acids and typically less than 50 amino acids, wherein the amino acids are naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring amino acids. Non-naturally occurring amino acids refer to amino acids that do not naturally occur in vivo but which, nevertheless, can be incorporated into the peptide structures described herein.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms \"polypeptide\" and \"protein\" are terms that are used interchangeably to refer to a polymer of amino acids, without regard to the length of the polymer. Typically, polypeptides and proteins have a polymer length that is greater than that of \"peptides.\"\n\n\nA \"glucagon peptide\" as used herein includes any peptide comprising, either the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or any analog of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, including amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions or post translational modifications (e.g., methylation, acylation, ubiquitination, intramolecular covalent bonding such as lactam bridge formation, PEGylation, and the like) of the peptide, wherein the analog stimulates glucagon or GLP-I receptor activity, e.g., as measured by cAMP production using the assay described in Example 14.\n\n\nThe term \"glucagon agonist\" refers to a complex comprising a glucagon peptide that stimulates glucagon receptor activity, e.g., as measured by cAMP production using the assay described in Example 14.\n\n\nAs used herein a \"glucagon agonist analog\" is a glucagon peptide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 1 1, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14 and SEQ ID NO: 15, or an analog of such a sequence that has been modified to include one or more conservative amino acid substitutions at one or more of positions 2, 5, 7, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29.\n\n\nAs used herein an amino acid \"modification\" refers to a substitution, addition or deletion of an amino acid, and includes substitution with or addition of any of the 20 amino acids commonly found in human proteins, as well as atypical or non- naturally occurring amino acids. Throughout the application, all references to a particular amino acid position by number (e.g. position 28) refer to the amino acid at that position in native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) or the corresponding amino acid position in any analogs thereof. For example, a reference herein to \"position 28\" \n\n 29920-208831 would mean the corresponding position 27 for a glucagon analog in which the first amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 1 has been deleted. Similarly, a reference herein to \"position 28\" would mean the corresponding position 29 for a glucagon analog in which one amino acid has been added before the N-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 1. Commercial sources of atypical amino acids include Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI), ChemPep Inc. (Miami, FL), and Genzyme Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA). Atypical amino acids may be purchased from commercial suppliers, synthesized de novo, or chemically modified or derivatized from other amino acids.\n\n\nAs used herein a \"glucagon co-agonist\" is a glucagon peptide that exhibits activity at the glucagon receptor of at least about 10% to about 500% or more relative to native glucagon and also exhibits activity at the GLP-I receptor of about at least 10% to about 200% or more relative to native GLP-I .\n\n\nAs used herein a \"glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist molecule\" is a molecule that exhibits activity at the glucagon receptor of at least about 10% relative to native glucagon and also exhibits activity at the GLP-I receptor of at least about 10% relative to native GLP-I .\n\n\nAs used herein the term \"native glucagon\" refers to a peptide consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , and the term \"native GLP-I\" is a generic term that designates GLP-l (7-36)amide (consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 52), GLP- l(7-37)acid (consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 50) or a mixture of those two compounds. As used herein, a general reference to \"glucagon\" or \"GLP-I \" in the absence of any further designation is intended to mean native glucagon or native GLP-I , respectively.\n\n\nAs used herein an amino acid \"substitution\" refers to the replacement of one amino acid residue by a different amino acid residue.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"conservative amino acid substitution\" is defined herein as exchanges within one of the following five groups:\n\n\nI. Small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues:\n\n\nAla, Ser, Thr, Pro, GIy; II. Polar, negatively charged residues and their amides and esters:\n\n\nAsp, Asn, GIu, GIn, cysteic acid and homocysteic acid; III. Polar, positively charged residues: His, Arg, Lys; Ornithine (Orn) \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nIV. Large, aliphatic, nonpolar residues:\n\n\nMet, Leu, He, VaI, Cys, Norleucine (NIe), homocysteine\n\n\nV.

Absent any further characterization, the term is intended to include polymers of ethylene glycol with an average total molecular weight selected from the range of 500 to 40,000 Daltons. \"polyethylene glycol chain\" or \"PEG chain\" is, used in combination with a numeric suffix to indicate the approximate average molecular weight thereof. For example, PEG-5,000 refers to polyethylene glycol chain having a total molecular weight average of about 5,000. As used herein the term \"pegylated\" and like terms refers to a compound that has been modified from its native state by linking a polyethylene glycol chain to the compound. A \"pegylated glucagon peptide\" is a glucagon peptide that has a PEG chain covalently bound to the glucagon peptide.\n\n\nAs used herein a general reference to a peptide is intended to encompass peptides that have modified amino and carboxy termini. For example, an amino acid chain comprising an amide group in place of the terminal carboxylic acid is intended to be encompassed by an amino acid sequence designating the standard amino acids. As used herein a \"linker\" is a bond, molecule or group of molecules that binds two separate entities to one another. Linkers may provide for optimal spacing of the two entities or may further supply a labile linkage that allows the two entities to be separated from each other. Labile linkages include photocleavable groups, acid-labile moieties, base-labile moieties and enzyme-cleavable groups.\n\n\nAs used herein a \"dimer\" is a complex comprising two subunits covalently bound to one another via a linker. The term dimer, when used absent any qualifying language, encompasses both homodimers and heterodimers. A homodimer comprises two identical subunits, whereas a heterodimer comprises two subunits that differ, although the two subunits are substantially similar to one another.\n\n\nAs used herein the term \"charged amino acid\" refers to an amino acid that comprises a side chain that is negatively charged (i.e., de-protonated) or positively \n\n 29920-208831 charged (i.e., protonated) in aqueous solution at physiological pH. For example negatively charged amino acids include aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteic acid, homocysteic acid, and homoglutamic acid, whereas positively charged amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. Charged amino acids include the charged amino acids among the 20 amino acids commonly found in human proteins, as well as atypical or non-naturally occurring amino acids.\n\n\nAs used herein the term \"acidic amino acid\" refers to an amino acid that comprises a second acidic moiety, including for example, a carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid group. The term \"alkyl\" refers to a linear or branched hydrocarbon containing the indicated number of carbon atoms. Exemplary alkyls include methyl, ethyl, and linear propyl groups.\n\n\nThe term \"heteroalkyl\" refers to a linear or branched hydrocarbon containing the indicated number of carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom in the backbone of the structure. Suitable heteroatoms for purposes herein include but are not limited to\n\n\nN, S, and O.\n\n\nEMBODIMENTS\n\n\nThe invention provides glucagon peptides with increased or decreased activity at the glucagon receptor, or the GLP-I receptor, or at both receptors. The invention also provides glucagon peptides with altered selectivity for the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-I receptor.\n\n\nIncreased activity at the glucagon receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) as described herein. Maintained or increased activity at the glucagon receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at position 3 of native glucagon with a glutamine analog (e.g. (Dab(Ac)).\n\n\nReduced activity at the glucagon receptor is provided, e.g., by substitution of the amino acid at position 3 with an acidic, basic, or hydrophobic amino acid as described herein.\n\n\nIncreased activity at the GLP-I receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nIncreased activity at the GLP-I receptor is provided by modifications that stabilize the alpha helix in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (e.g. around residues 12-29). In some embodiments, such modifications permit formation of an intramolecular bridge between the side chains of two amino acids that are separated by three intervening amino acids, for example, positions 12 and 16, or 16 and 20, or 20 and 24, as described herein. In other embodiments, such modifications include insertion or substitution modifications that introduce one or more α, α-disubstituted amino acids, e.g. AIB at one or more of positions 16, 20, 21 or 24.\n\n\nIncreased activity at the GLP-I and glucagon receptors for peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a covalent intramolecular brige, is provided by covalently attaching an acyl or alkyl group to to the side chain of the amino acid at position 10 of the peptide, wherein the acyl or alkyl group is non-native to the amino acid at position 10. Further increased activity at the GLP-I and glucagon receptors for such peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge, may be achieved by incorporating a spacer between the acyl or alkyl group and the side chain of the amino acid at position 10. Suitable spacers are described herein and include, but not limited to spacers that are 3 to 10 atoms in length.\n\n\nIncreased activity at the GLP-I receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at position 20 as described herein. Increased activity at the GLP-I receptor is provided in glucagon analogs comprising the C-terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 26. GLP-I activity in such analogs comprising SEQ ID NO: 26 can be further increased by modifying the amino acid at position 18, 28 or 29, or at position 18 and 29, as described herein.\n\n\nRestoration of glucagon activity which has been reduced by amino acid modifications at positions 1 and 2 is provided by a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids that are separated by three intervening amino acids, for example, positions 12 and 16, or 16 and 20, or 20 and 24, as described herein.\n\n\nA further modest increase in GLP-I potency is provided by modifying the amino acid at position 10 to be Trp. Any of the modifications described above which increase or decrease glucagon receptor activity and which increase GLP-I receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Any of the modifications described above can also be combined with other modifications that confer other desirable properties, such as increased solubility and/or stability and/or duration of action. Alternatively, any of \n\n 29920-208831 the modifications described above can be combined with other modifications that do not substantially affect solubility or stability or activity. Exemplary modifications include but are not limited to:\n\n\n(A) Improving solubility, for example, by introducing one, two, three or more charged amino acid(s) to the C-terminal portion of native glucagon, preferably at a position C-terminal to position 27. Such a charged amino acid can be introduced by substituting a native amino acid with a charged amino acid, e.g. at positions 28 or 29, or alternatively by adding a charged amino acid, e.g. after position 27, 28 or 29. In exemplary embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In other embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are positively charged. Such modifications increase solubility, e.g. provide at least 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold or greater solubility relative to native glucagon at a given pH between about 5.5 and 8, e.g., pH 7, when measured after 24 hours at 25°C. (B) Increasing solubility and duration of action or half-life in circulation by addition of a hydrophilic moiety such as a polyethylene glycol chain, as described herein, e.g. at position 16, 17, 20, 21, 24 or 29, or at the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide.\n\n\n(C) Increasing , by modification of the aspartic acid at position 15, for example, by deletion or substitution with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid. Such modifications can reduce degradation or cleavage at a pH within the range of 5.5 to 8, for example, retaining at least 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25°C.\n\n\n(D) Increasing stability by modification of the methionine at position 27, for example, by substitution with leucine or norleucine. Such modifications can reduce oxidative degradation. Stability can also be increased by modification of the GIn at position 20 or 24, e.g. by substitution with Ala, Ser, Thr, or AIB. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through deamidation of GIn. Stability can be increased by modification of Asp at position 21, e.g. by substitution with GIu. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso-aspartate.\n\n\n(E) Increasing resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleavage by modification of the amino acid at position 1 or 2 as described herein. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\n(F) Conservative or non-conservative substitutions, additions or deletions that do not affect activity, for example, conservative substitutions at one or more of positions 2, 5, 7, 10, 1 1 , 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 24, 27, 28 or 29; deletions at one or more of positions 27, 28 or 29; or a deletion of amino acid 29 optionally combined with a C-terminal amide or ester in place of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group;\n\n\n(G) Adding C-terminal extensions as described herein;\n\n\n(H) Increasing half-life in circulation and/or extending the duration of action and/or delaying the onset of action, for example, through acylation or alkylation of the glucagon peptide, as described herein;\n\n\n(I) Homodimerization or heterodimerization as described herein.\n\n\nIn exemplary embodiments, the glucagon peptide may comprise a total of 1 , up to 2, up to 3, up to 4, up to 5, up to 6, up to 7, up to 8, up to 9, or up to 10 amino acid modifications relative to the native glucagon sequence. Other modifications include substitution of His at position 1 with a large, aromatic amino acid (e.g., Tyr, Phe, Trp or amino-Phe);\n\n\nSer at position 2 with Ala; substitution of Tyr at position 10 with VaI or Phe; substitution of Lys at position 12 with Arg; substitution of Asp at position 15 with GIu; substitution of Ser at position 16 with Thr or AIB.\n\n\nOne embodiment disclosed herein is directed to a glucagon agonist that has been modified relative to the wild type peptide of His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe- Thr-Ser- Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser- Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu- Met-Asn-Thr (SEQ ID NO: 1) to enhance the peptide's potency at the glucagon receptor. Surprisingly, applicants have discovered that the normally occurring serine at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) can be substituted with select acidic amino acids to enhance the potency of glucagon, in terms of its ability to stimulate cAMP synthesis in a validated in vitro model assay (see Example 14). More particularly, this substitution enhances the potency of the analog at least 2-fold, 4- fold, 5-fold, and up to 10- fold greater at the glucagon receptor. This substitution also enhances the analog's activity at the GLP-I receptor at least 5-fold, 10-fold, or 15- fold relative to native glucagon, but selectivity is maintained for the glucagon receptor over the GLP-I receptor. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment the serine residue at position 16 of native glucagon is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, glutamine, homoglutamic acid, homocysteic acid, threonine or glycine. In accordance with one embodiment the serine residue at position 16 of native glucagon is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, glutamine, homoglutamic acid and homocysteic acid, and in one embodiment the serine residue is substituted with glutamic acid. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide having enhanced specificity for the glucagon receptor comprises the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 10 or a glucagon agonist analog thereof, wherein the carboxy terminal amino acid retains its native carboxylic acid group. In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon agonist comprising the sequence of NH\n2\n-His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe- Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp- Glu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Tφ-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr-COOH (SEQ ID NO: 10) is provided, wherein the peptide exhibits approximately fivefold enhanced potency at the glucagon receptor, relative to native glucagon as measured by the in vitro cAMP assay of Example 14. Hydrophilic moieties\n\n\nThe glucagon peptides of the present invention can be further modified to improve the peptide's solubility and stability in aqueous solutions at physiological pH, while retaining the high biological activity relative to native glucagon. Hydrophilic moieties such as PEG groups can be attached to the glucagon peptides under any suitable conditions used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Any means known in the art can be used, including via acylation, reductive alkylation, Michael addition, thiol alkylation or other chemoselective conjugation/ligation methods through a reactive group on the PEG moiety (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group) to a reactive group on the target compound (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group). Activating groups which can be used to link the water soluble polymer to one or more proteins include without limitation sulfone, maleimide, sulfhydryl, thiol, triflate, tresylate, azidirine, oxirane, 5-pyridyl, and alpha- halogenated acyl group (e.g., alpha-iodo acetic acid, alpha-bromoacetic acid, alpha- chloroacetic acid). If attached to the peptide by reductive alkylation, the polymer selected should have a single reactive aldehyde so that the degree of polymerization is controlled. See, for example, Kinstler et al., Adv. Drug. Delivery Rev. 54: 477-485 \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\n(2002); Roberts et al., Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 54: 459-476 (2002); and Zalipsky et al., Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 16: 157-182 (1995).\n\n\nIn a specific aspect of the invention, an amino, acid residue on the glucagon peptide having a thiol is modified with a hydrophilic moiety such as PEG. In some embodiments, the thiol is modified with maleimide-activated PEG in a Michael addition reaction to result in a PEGylated peptide comprising the thioether linkage shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the thiol is modified with a haloacetyl-activated PEG in a nucleophilic substitution reaction to result in a PEGylated peptide comprising the thioether linkage shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuitable hydrophilic moieties include polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., POG), polyoxyethylated sorbitol, polyoxyethylated glucose, polyoxyethylated glycerol (POG), polyoxyalkylenes, polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, mono-(C 1 -C 10) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, polyacetals, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1 , 3-dioxolane, poly-l,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, poly (.beta.-amino acids) (either homopolymers or random copolymers), poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone )polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers (PPG) and other polyakylene oxides, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymers, colonic acids or other polysaccharide polymers, Ficoll or dextran and mixtures thereof. Dextrans are polysaccharide polymers of glucose subunits, predominantly linked by αl -6 linkages. Dextran is available in many molecular weight ranges, e.g., about 1 kD to about 100 kD, or from about 5, 10, 15 or 20 kD to about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90 kD. Linear or branched polymers are contemplated. Resulting preparations of conjugates \n\n 29920-208831 may be essentially monodisperse or polydisperse, and may have about 0.5, 0.7, 1 , 1.2, 1.5 or 2 polymer moieties per peptide.\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment, introduction of hydrophilic groups at positions 17, 21 , and 24 of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 are anticipated to improve the solubility and stability of the high potency glucagon analog in solutions having a physiological pH. Introduction of such groups also increases duration of action, e.g. as measured by a prolonged half-life in circulation. Suitable hydrophilic moieties include any water soluble polymers known in the art, including PEG, homo- or co-polymers of PEG, a monomethyl-substituted polymer of PEG (mPEG), or polyoxyethylene glycerol (POG). In accordance with one embodiment the hydrophilic group comprises a polyethylene (PEG) chain. More particularly, in one embodiment the glucagon peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or SEQ ID NO: 7 wherein a PEG chain is covalently linked to the side chains of amino acids present at positions 21 and 24 of the glucagon peptide and the carboxy terminal amino acid of the peptide has the carboxylic acid group.\n\n\nConjugates\n\n\nThe present disclosure also encompasses other conjugates in which glucagon peptides of the invention are linked, optionally via covalent bonding and optionally via a linker, to a conjugate moiety. Linkage can be accomplished by covalent chemical bonds, physical forces such electrostatic, hydrogen, ionic, van der Waals, or hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. A variety of non-covalent coupling systems may be used, including biotin-avidin, ligand/receptor, enzyme/substrate, nucleic acid/nucleic acid binding protein, lipid/lipid binding protein, cellular adhesion molecule partners; or any binding partners or fragments thereof which have affinity for each other.\n\n\nThe peptide can be linked to conjugate moieties via direct covalent linkage by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the peptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues of these targeted amino acids. Reactive groups on the peptide or conjugate moiety include, e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group. Derivatizing agents include, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride or other agents known in the art. Alternatively, the conjugate moieties can be linked to the peptide indirectly through \n\n 29920-208831 intermediate carriers, such as polysaccharide or polypeptide carriers. Examples of polysaccharide carriers include aminodextran. Examples of suitable polypeptide carriers include polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid, co-polymers thereof, and mixed polymers of these amino acids and others, e.g., serines, to confer desirable solubility properties on the resultant loaded carrier.\n\n\nCysteinyl residues are most commonly are reacted with α-haloacetates (and corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid, chloroacetamide to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with bromotrifiuoroacetone, alpha-bromo-β-(5- imidozoyl)propionic acid, chloroacetyl phosphate, N-alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2- pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2-pyridyl disulfide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 2- chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, or chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-l,3-diazole.\n\n\nHistidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5-7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para- bromophenacyl bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.\n\n\nLysinyl and amino-terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing alpha-amino-containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate, pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal, chloroborohydride, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, O- methylisourea, 2,4-pentanedione, and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.\n\n\nArginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1 ,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pK\na\n of the guanidine functional group. Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group. The specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made, with particular interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizole and \n\n 29920-208831 tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively.\n\n\nCarboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides (R-N=C=N-R'), where R and R' are different alkyl groups, such as l-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl) carbodiimide or l-ethyl-3-(4- azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl) carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.\n\n\nOther modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxy 1 groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the alpha-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)), deamidation of asparagine or glutamine, acetylation of the N- terminal amine, and/or amidation or esterification of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group.\n\n\nAnother type of covalent modification involves chemically or enzymatically coupling glycosides to the peptide. Sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO87/05330 published 1 1 Sep. 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306 (1981).\n\n\nExemplary conjugate moieties that can be linked to any of the glucagon peptides described herein include but are not limited to a heterologous peptide or polypeptide (including for example, a plasma protein), a targeting agent, an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region), a diagnostic label such as a radioisotope, fluorophore or enzymatic label, a polymer including water soluble polymers, or other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. In one embodiment a conjugate is provided comprising a glucagon peptide of the present invention and a plasma protein, wherein the plasma protein is selected form the group consisting of albumin, transferin, fibrinogen and globulins. In one embodiment the plasma protein moiety of the conjugate is albumin or transferin. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the linker comprises a chain of atoms from 1 to about 60, or 1 to 30 atoms or longer, 2 to 5 atoms, 2 to 10 atoms, 5 to 10 atoms, or 10 to 20 atoms long. In some embodiments, the chain atoms are all carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the chain atoms in the backbone of the linker are selected from the group consisting of C, O, N, and S. Chain atoms and linkers may be selected according to their expected solubility (hydrophilicity) so as to provide a more soluble conjugate. In some embodiments, the linker provides a functional group that is subject to cleavage by an enzyme or other catalyst or hydrolytic conditions found in the target tissue or organ or cell. In some embodiments, the length of the linker is long enough to reduce the potential for steric hindrance. If the linker is a covalent bond or a peptidyl bond and the conjugate is a polypeptide, the entire conjugate can be a fusion protein. Such peptidyl linkers may be any length. Exemplary linkers are from about 1 to 50 amino acids in length, 5 to 50, 3 to 5, 5 to 10, 5 to 15, or 10 to 30 amino acids in length. Such fusion proteins may alternatively be produced by recombinant genetic engineering methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nAs noted above, in some embodiments, the glucagon peptides are conjugated, e.g., fused to an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region). Known types of immunoglobulins (Ig) include IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD or IgM. The Fc region is a C-terminal region of an Ig heavy chain, which is responsible for binding to Fc receptors that carry out activities such as recycling (which results in prolonged half-life), antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\nFor example, according to some definitions the human IgG heavy chain Fc region stretches from Cys226 to the C-terminus of the heavy chain. The \"hinge region\" generally extends from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgGl (hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgGl sequence by aligning the cysteines involved in cysteine bonding). The Fc region of an IgG includes two constant domains, CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341. The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447. References made to amino acid numbering of immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda, Md. In a related embodiments, the Fc region may comprise one or more native or modified constant regions from an \n\n 29920-208831 immunoglobulin heavy chain, other than CHl , for example, the CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG and IgA, or the CH3 and CH4 regions of IgE.\n\n\nSuitable conjugate moieties include portions of immunoglobulin sequence that include the FcRn binding site. FcRn, a salvage receptor, is responsible for recycling immunoglobulins and returning them to circulation in blood. The region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994, Nature 372:379). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig heavy chain. The major contact sites include amino acid residues 248, 250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-291, 308-31 1, and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues 385-387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain.\n\n\nSome conjugate moieties may or may not include FcγR binding site(s). FcγR are responsible for ADCC and CDC. Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with FcγR are amino acids 234-239 (lower hinge region), amino acids 265-269 (B/C loop), amino acids 297-299 (C'/E loop), and amino acids 327-332 (F/G) loop (Sondermann et al., Nature 406: 267-273, 2000). The lower hinge region of IgE has also been implicated in the FcRI binding (Henry, et al., Biochemistry 36, 15568-15578, 1997). Residues involved in IgA receptor binding are described in Lewis et al., (J Immunol. 175:6694-701, 2005). Amino acid residues involved in IgE receptor binding are described in Sayers et al. (J Biol Chem. 279(34):35320-5, 2004).\n\n\nAmino acid modifications may be made to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. Such variant Fc regions comprise at least one amino acid modification in the CH3 domain of the Fc region (residues 342-447) and/or at least one amino acid modification in the CH2 domain of the Fc region (residues 231-341). Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A (Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Other mutations may reduce binding of the Fc region to FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, and/or FcγRIIIA without significantly reducing affinity for FcRn. For example, substitution of the Asn at position 297 of the Fc region with Ala or another amino acid removes a highly conserved N-glycosylation site and may result in reduced immunogenicity with concomitant prolonged half-life of the Fc region, as well as reduced binding to FcγRs (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632; Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Amino acid modifications at positions 233-236 of IgGl have been made that reduce binding to FcγRs (Ward and \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nGhetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77 and Armour et al. 1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613). Some exemplary amino acid substitutions are described in US Patents 7,355,008 and 7,381,408, each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\nFusion protein and Terminal extension The present disclosure also encompasses glucagon fusion peptides or proteins wherein a second peptide or polypeptide has been fused to a terminus, e.g., the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide. More particularly, the fusion glucagon peptide may comprise a glucagon agonist of SEQ ID NO: 55, SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 further comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26 (GPSSGAPPPS), SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 28 (KRNR) linked to amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide. In one embodiment the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26 (GPSSGAPPPS), SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 28 (KRNR) is bound to amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide through a peptide bond. Applicants have discovered that in glucagon fusion peptides comprising the C-terminal extension peptide of Exendin-4 (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 26 or SEQ ID NO: 29), substitution of the native threonine residue at position 29 with glycine dramatically increases GLP-I receptor activity. This amino acid substitution can be used in conjunction with other modifications disclosed herein to enhance the affinity of the glucagon analogs for the GLP-I receptor. For example, the T29G substitution can be combined with the S16E and N20K amino acid substitutions, optionally with a lactam bridge between amino acids 16 and 20, and optionally with addition of a PEG chain as described herein. In one embodiment a glucagon/GLP-1 receptor cό-agonist is provided, comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 64. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide portion of the glucagon fusion peptide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 55, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, and SEQ ID NO: 5 wherein a PEG chain, when present at positions 17, 21, 24, or the C-terminal amino acid, or at both 21 and 24, is selected from the range of 500 to 40,000 Daltons. More particularly, in one embodiment the glucagon peptide segment is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, and SEQ ID NO: 63, wherein the PEG chain is selected from the range of 500 to 5,000. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide is a fusion peptide comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 55 and SEQ ID NO: 65 wherein the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 65 is linked to the carboxy terminus of SEQ ID NO: 55. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nCharge neutral C-terminus\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment, an additional chemical modification of the glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 10 bestows increased GLP-I receptor potency to a point where the relative activity at the glucagon and GLP-I receptors is virtually equivalent. Accordingly, in one embodiment a glucagon/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist is provided wherein the terminal amino acid of the glucagon peptides of the present invention have an amide group in place of the carboxylic acid group that is present on the native amino acid. The relative activity of the glucagon analog at the respective glucagon and GLP-I receptors can be adjusted by further modifications to the glucagon peptide to produce analogs demonstrating about 40% to about 500% or more of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and about 20% to about 200% or more of the activity of native GLP-I at the GLP-I receptor, e.g. 50- fold, 100-fold or more increase relative to the normal activity of glucagon at the GLP- 1 receptor. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit up to about 100%, 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1 ,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit up to about 100%, 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1 ,000,000% of the activity of native GLP-I at the GLP-I receptor. Stabilization of the alpha helix/Intramolecular bridges In a further embodiment glucagon analogs are provided that exhibit enhanced\n\n\nGLP-I receptor agonist activity wherein an intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acid side chains to stabilize the three dimensional structure of the carboxy terminus of the peptide. The two amino acid side chains can be linked to one another through non-covalent bonds, e.g., hydrogen-bonding, ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds. When the two amino acid side chains are linked to one another through one or more covalent bonds, the peptide may be considered herein as comprising a covlent intramolecular bridge. When the two amino acid side chains are linked to one another through non-covalent bonds, e.g., hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, the peptide may be considered herein as comprising a non-covalent intramolecular bridge.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 3 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions i and i+4, wherein i is any integer between 12 and 25 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 22, 23, 24, and 25). More particularly, the side chains of the amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 16 and \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\n20 , 20 and 24 or 24 and 28 (amino acid pairs in which i = 12, 16, 20, or 24) are linked to one another and thus stabilize the glucagon alpha helix. Alternatively, i can be 17.\n\n\nIn some specific embodiments, wherein the amino acids at positions i and i+4 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 8 atoms, or about 7-9 atoms.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are two amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions j and j+3, wherein j is any integer between 12 and 26 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26). In some specific embodiments, j is 17. In some specific embodiments, wherein amino acids at positions j and j+3 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 6 atoms, or about 5 to 7 atoms.\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 6 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions k and k+7, wherein k is any integer between 12 and 22 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22). In some specific embodiments, k is 12, 13, or 17. In an exemplary embodiment, k is 17.\n\n\nExamples of amino acid pairings that are capable of covalently bonding to form a six-atom linking bridge include Orn and Asp, GIu and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 2, and homoglutamic acid and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 1, wherein Formula I is:\n\n\nH H\n2\nN C COOH\n\n\n(CH\n2\n)-\n\n\nNH\n2\n wherein n = 1 to 4\n\n\n[Formula I]\n\n\nExamples of amino acid pairing that are capable of covalently bonding to form a seven-atom linking bridge include Orn-Glu (lactam ring); Lys-Asp (lactam); or Homoser-Homoglu (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form an eight-atom linker include Lys-Glu (lactam); Homolys-Asp (lactam); Orn-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Asp (lactam); or Tyr-Asp (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form a nine-atom linker include Homolys-Glu (lactam); Lys- \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nHomoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Glu (lactam); or Tyr-Glu (lactone). Any of the side chains on these amino acids may additionally be substituted with additional chemical groups, so long as the three-dimensional structure of the alpha-helix is not disrupted. One of ordinary skill in the art can envision alternative pairings or alternative amino acid analogs, including chemically modified derivatives, that would create a stabilizing structure of similar size and desired effect. For example, a homocysteine- homocysteine disulfide bridge is 6 atoms in length and may be further modified to provide the desired effect. Even without covalent linkage, the amino acid pairings described above or similar pairings that one of ordinary skill in the art can envision may also provide added stability to the alpha-helix through non-covalent bonds, for example, through formation of salt bridges or hydrogen-bonding interactions.\n\n\nFurther exemplary embodiments include the following pairings, optionally with a lactam bridge: GIu at position 12 with Lys at position 16; native Lys at position 12 with GIu at position 16; GIu at position 16 with Lys at position 20; Lys at position 16 with GIu at position 20; GIu at position 20 with Lys at position 24; Lys at position 20 with GIu at position 24; GIu at position 24 with Lys at position 28; Lys at position 24 with GIu at position 28.\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment a glucagon analog is provided that exhibits glucagon/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist activity wherein the analog comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1 1, 47, 48 and 49. In one embodiment the side chains are covalently bound to one another, and in one embodiment the two amino acids are bound to one another to form a lactam ring. The size of the lactam ring can vary depending on the length of the amino acid side chains, and in one embodiment the lactam is formed by linking the side chains of a lysine amino acid to a glutamic acid side chain.\n\n\nThe order of the amide bond in the lactam ring can be reversed (e.g., a lactam ring can be formed between the side chains of a Lys 12 and a GIu 16 or alternatively between a GIu 12 and a Lys 16). In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon analog of SEQ ID NO: 45 is provided wherein at least one lactam ring is formed between the side chains of an amino acid pair selected from the group consisting of amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 16 and 20 , 20 and 24 or 24 and 28. In one embodiment a glucagon/GLP- 1 receptor co-agonist is provided wherein the co-agonist comprises a glucagon peptide analog of SEQ ID NO: 20 wherein the peptide comprises an intramolecular lactam bridge formed between amino acid positions 12 and 16 or \n\n 29920-208831 between amino acid positions 16 and 20. In one embodiment a glucagon/GLP- 1 receptor co-agonist is provided comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein an intramolecular lactam bridge is formed between amino acid positions 12 and 16, between amino acid positions 16 and 20, or between amino acid positions 20 and 24 and the amino acid at position 29 is glycine, wherein the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 29 is linked to the C-terminal amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 20. In a further embodiment the amino acid at position 28 is aspartic acid.\n\n\nIntramolecular bridges other than a lactam bridge can be used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon analog peptides. In one embodiment, the intramolecular bridge is a hydrophobic bridge. In this instance, the intramolecular bridge optionally is between the side chains of two amino acids that are part of the hydrophobic face of the alpha helix of the glucagon analog peptide. For example, one of the amino acids joined by the hydrophobic bridge can be the amino acid at position 10, 14, and 18.\n\n\nIn one specific aspect, olefin metathesis is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide using an all-hydrocarbon cross-linking system. The glucagon peptide in this instance can comprise α-methylated amino acids bearing olefinic side chains of varying length and configured with either R or S stereochemistry at the i and i+4 or i+7 positions. For example, the olefinic side can can comprise (CH\n2\n)n, wherein n is any integer between 1 to 6. In one embodiment, n is 3 for a cross-link length of 8 atoms. Suitable methods of forming such intramolecular bridges are described in the art. See, for example, Schafmeister et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122: 5891-5892 (2000) and Walensky et al., Science 305: 1466- 1470 (2004). Alternatively, the glucagon peptide can comprise O-allyl Ser residues located on adjacent helical turns, which are bridged together via ruthenium-catalyzed ring closing metathesis. Such procedures of cross-linking are described in, for example, Blackwell et al., Angew, Chem., Int. Ed. 37: 3281-3284 (1998).\n\n\nIn another specific aspect, use of the unnatural thio-dialanine amino acid, lanthionine, which has been widely adopted as a peptidomimetic of cystine, is used to cross-link one turn of the alpha helix. Suitable methods of lanthionine-based cyclization are known in the art. See, for instance, Matteucci et al., Tetrahedron Letters ^: 1399-1401 (2004); Mayer et al., ./. Peptide Res. 51 : 432-436 (1998); Polinsky et al., J. Med. Chem. 35: 4185-4194 (1992); Osapay et al., J. Med. Chem. 40: 2241-2251 (1997); Fukase et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 65: 2227-2240 (1992); Harpp et al., J. Org. Chem. 36: 73-80 (1971); Goodman and Shao, Pure Appl. Chem. 68: \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\n1303-1308 (1996); and Osapay and Goodman, J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1599- 1600 (1993).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, e.g., 1 ,4-diaminopropane and 1 ,5-diaminopentane) between two GIu residues at positions i and i+7 are used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Such tethers lead to the formation of a bridge 9-atoms or more in length, depending on the length of the diaminoalkane tether. Suitable methods of producing peptides cross-linked with such tethers are described in the art. See, for example, Phelan et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119: 455-460 (1997). In yet another embodiment of the invention, a disulfide bridge is used to crosslink one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Alternatively, a modified disulfide bridge in which one or both sulfur atoms are replaced by a methylene group resulting in an isosteric macrocyclization is used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Suitable methods of modifying peptides with disulfide bridges or sulfur-based cyclization are described in, for example, Jackson et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113: 9391-9392 (1991) and Rudinger and Jost, Experientia 20: 570-571 (1964).\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide is stabilized via the binding of metal atom by two His residues or a His and Cys pair positioned at i and i+4. The metal atom can be, for example, Ru(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II). Such methods of metal binding-based alpha helix stabilization are known in the art. See, for example, Andrews and Tabor, Tetrahedron 55: 1171 1-11743 (1999); Ghadiri et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1 12: 1630-1632 (1990); and Ghadiri et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119: 9063-9064 (1997). The alpha helix of the glucagon peptide can alternatively be stabilized through other means of peptide cyclizing, which means are reviewed in Davies, J. Peptide. ScL 9: 471-501 (2003). The alpha helix can be stabilized via the formation of an amide bridge, thioether bridge, thioester bridge, urea bridge, carbamate bridge, sulfonamide bridge, and the like. For example, a thioester bridge can be formed between the C-terminus and the side chain of a Cys residue. Alternatively, a thioester can be formed via side chains of amino acids having a thiol (Cys) and a carboxylic acid (e.g., Asp, GIu). In another method, a cross-linking agent, such as a dicarboxylic acid, e.g. suberic acid (octanedioic acid), etc. can introduce a link between two \n\n 29920-208831 functional groups of an amino acid side chain, such as a free amino, hydroxyl, thiol group, and combinations thereof.\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide is stabilized through the incorporation of hydrophobic amino acids at positions i and i+4. For instance, i can be Tyr and i+4 can be either VaI or Leu; i can be Phe and i+4 can be Cys or Met; I can be Cys and i+4 can be Met; or i can be Phe and i+4 can be He. It should be understood that, for purposes herein, the above amino acid pairings can be reversed, such that the indicated amino acid at position i could alternatively be located at i+4, while the i+4 amino acid can be located at the i position. In accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention, the glucagon peptide with enhanced GLP-I activity comprises (a) one or more substitutions within amino acid positions 12-29 with an α, α-disubstituted amino acid and optionally, (b) a C-terminal amide. In some aspects, it is to be appreciated that such glucagon peptides specifically lack an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge, that stabilizes the alpha-helix in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (around positions 12- 29). In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of positions 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 of glucagon is substituted with an α, α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., amino iso-butyric acid (AIB), an amino acid disubstituted with the same or a different group selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, and n-butyl, or with a cyclooctane or cycloheptane (e.g., 1-aminocyclooctane-l-carboxylic acid). For example, substitution of position 16 with AIB enhances GLP- 1 activity, in the absence of an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a non-covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a salt bridge) or a covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a lactam). In some embodiments, one, two, three or more of positions 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with AIB. Such a glucagon peptide may further comprise one or more of the other modifications described herein, including, but not limited to, acylation, alkylation, pegylation, deletion of 1-2 amino acids at the C-terminus, addition of and/or substitution with charged amino acids at the C- terminus, replacement of the C-terminal carboxylate with an amide, addition of a C- terminal extension, and conservative and/or non-conservative amino acid substitutions, such as substitution of Met at position 27 with Leu or NIe, substitution of Asp at position 15 with GIu (or like amino acid), substitution at position 1 and/or 2 with amino acids which achieve DPP-IV protease resistance, substitution of Ser at position 2 with Ala, substitution of Tyr at position 10 with VaI or Phe, substitution of Lys at position 12 with Arg, substitution of Ser at position 16 with Thr or AIB, \n\n 29920-208831 substitution of GIn at position 20 and/or 24 with Asp, GIu, or AIB, substitution of Ser at position 16 with GIu or Thr, Arg at position 18 with Ala, GIn at position 20 with Lys, Asp at position 21 with GIu, and GIn at position 24 with Asn or Cys. In some embodiments, the foregoing glucagon peptide comprises a GIn or GIy at position 29 or addition of a C-terminal extension, e.g., GGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 26) C- terminal to the amino acid at position 28. In a specific aspect, the glucagon peptide comprises one or more of an amide group in place of the C-terminal carboxylate, an acyl group, e.g., a C16 fatty acid, and a hydrophilic moiety, e.g., a polyethylene glycol (PEG). Also, in another specific aspect, the glucagon peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1-25, 30-64, and 66-555 comprising no more than ten modifications relative to SEQ ID NO: 1 and comprising one or more amino acid substitutions with AIB at positions 16, 20, 21 , and/or 24, wherein the peptide lacks an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge, between the side chains of two amino acids of the peptide. Accordingly, in a more specific aspect, the glucagon peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 556- 561.\n\n\nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge comprises one or more substitutions within amino acid positions 12-29 with an α, α-disubstituted amino acid and an acyl or alkyl group covalently attached to the side chain of the amino acid at position 10 of the glucagon peptide. In specific embodiments, the acyl or alkyl group is not naturally occurring on an amino acid. In certain aspects, the acyl or alkyl group is non-native to the amion acid at position 10. In exemplary embodiments, the glucagon peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge comprises the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 556-561 and an acyl or alkyl group covalently attached to the side chain of the amino acid at position 10 of the glucagon peptide. Such acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge exhibit enhanced activity at the GLP-I and glucagon receptors as compared to the non-acylated counterpart peptides. Further enhancement in activity at the GLP-I and glucagon receptors can be achieved by the acylated glucagon peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge by incorporating a spacer between the acyl or alkyl group and the side chain of the amino acid at position 10 of the peptide. Acylation and alkylation, with or without incorporating spacers, are further described herein. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nModification at position 1\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the glucagon peptide with enhanced GLP-I activity comprises (a) an amino acid substitution of His at position 1 with a large, aromatic amino acid and (b) an intramolecular bridge that stabilizes that alpha-helix in the C-terminal portion of the molecule (e.g. around positions 12-29). In a specific embodiment, the amino acid at position 1 is Tyr, Phe, Trp, amino-Phe, nitro-Phe, chloro-Phe, sulfo-Phe, 4-pyridyl-Ala, methyl-Tyr, or 3- amino Tyr. In a specific aspect, the intramolecular bridge is between the side chains of two amino acids that are separated by three intervening amino acids, i.e., between the side chains of amino acids i and i+4. In some embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is a lactam bridge. In a more specific embodiment of the invention, the glucagon peptide comprises a large, aromatic amino acid at position 1 and a lactam bridge between the amino acids at positions 16 and 20 of the peptide. Such a glucagon peptide may further comprise one or more (e.g., two, three, four, five or more) of the other modifications described herein. For example, the glucagon peptide can comprise an amide in place of the C-terminal carboxylate. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the glucagon peptide comprises that amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 555.\n\n\nAcylation In accordance with one embodiment, the glucagon peptide comprises an acyl group, e.g., an acyl group which is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid. The acyl group causes the peptide to have one or more of (i) a prolonged half-life in circulation, (ii) a delayed onset of action, (iii) an extended duration of action, (iv) an improved resistance to proteases, such as DPP-IV, and (v) increased potency at the GLP-I and glucagon receptors. As shown herein, acylated glucagon peptides do not exhibit decreased activity at the glucagon and GLP-I receptors in comparison to the corresponding unacylated glucagon peptide. Rather, in some instances, acylated glucagon peptides actually exhibit increased activity at the GLP-I and glucagon receptors. Accordingly, the potency of the acylated analogs is comparable to the unacylated versions of the glucagon co-agonist analogs, if not enhanced.\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group which is attached to the glucagon peptide via an ester, thioester, or amide linkage for purposes of prolonging half-life in circulation and/or \n\n 29920-208831 delaying the onset of and/or extending the duration of action and/or improving resistance to proteases such as DPP-FV.\n\n\nAcylation can be carried out at any position within the glucagon peptide, including any of positions 1-29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C- terminal amino acid, provided that glucagon and/or GLP- 1 activity is retained, if not enhanced. Nonlimiting examples include positions 5, 7, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28, or 29. In specific embodiments, acylation occurs at position 10 of the glucagon peptide and the glucagon peptide lacks an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a lactam bridge). Such acylated peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge demonstrate enhanced activity at the GLP-I and glucagon receptors as compared to the corresponding non-acylated peptides lacking a covalent intramolecular bridge and in comparison to the corresponding peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge acylated at a position other than position 10. As shown herein, acylation at position 10 can even transform a glucagon analog having little activity at the glucagon receptor to a glucagon analog having activity at both the glucagon and GLP-I receptors. Accordingly, the position at which acylation occurs can alter the overall activity profile of the glucagon analog.\n\n\nGlucagon peptides may be acylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. Nonlimiting examples include acylation at position 10 and pegylation at one or more positions in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g., position 24, 28 or 29, within a C- terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys). The acyl group can be covalently linked directly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, or indirectly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide via a spacer, wherein the spacer is positioned between the amino acid of the glucagon peptide and the acyl group.\n\n\nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by direct acylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is directly acylated through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of an amino acid. In some embodiments, acylation is at position 10, 20, 24, or 29. In this regard, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO : 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n\n 29920-208831 positions 10, 20, 24, and 29 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. In some specific embodiments of the invention, the direct acylation of the glucagon peptide occurs through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of the amino acid at position 10. In some embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine is an amino acid of Formula I:\n\n\nH H\n2\nN C COOH\n\n\n(CHz)\nn\n \n\n\nNH\n2\n wherein n = 1 to 4\n\n\n[Formula I] In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula I, is the amino acid wherein n is 4 (Lys) or n is 3 (Orn).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain hydroxyl is an amino acid of Formula II:\n\n\nH H\n2\nN C COOH\n\n\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\n \n\n\nOH wherein n = 1 to 4\n\n\n[Formula II]\n\n\nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula II is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Ser).\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain thiol is an amino acid of Formula III:\n\n\nH H\n2\nN C COOH\n\n\n(CH\n2\nJ\nn\n \n\n\nSH wherein n = 1 to 4 [Formula III] \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula III is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Cys).\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol is a disubstitυted amino acid comprising the same structure of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III, except that the hydrogen bonded to the alpha carbon of the amino acid of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III is replaced with a second side chain.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the acylated glucagon peptide comprises a spacer between the peptide and the acyl group. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the acyl group.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol, or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. The amino acid to which the spacer is attached can be any amino acid (e.g., a singly or doubly α-substituted amino acid) comprising a moiety which permits linkage to the spacer. For example, an amino acid comprising a side chain NH\n2\n, -OH, or -COOH (e.g., Lys, Om, Ser, Asp, or GIu) is suitable. In this respect, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at positions 10, 20, 24, and 29 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or carboxylate.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol, or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. When acylation occurs through an amine group of a spacer, the acylation can occur through the alpha amine of the amino acid or a side chain amine. In the instance in which the alpha amine is acylated, the amino acid of the spacer can be any amino acid. For example, the amino acid of the spacer can be a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., GIy, Ala, VaI, Leu, He, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr, 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5- aminovaleric acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid. Alternatively, the amino acid of the spacer can be an acidic residue, e.g., Asp and GIu.\n\n\nIn the instance in which the side chain amine of the amino acid of the spacer is acylated, the amino acid of the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, e.g., an amino acid of Formula I (e.g., Lys or Om). In this instance, it is possible for \n\n 29920-208831 both the alpha amine and the side chain amine of the amino acid of the spacer to be acylated, such that the glucagon peptide is diacylated. Embodiments of the invention include such diacylated molecules.\n\n\nWhen acylation occurs through a hydroxyl group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula II. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Ser.\n\n\nWhen acylation occurs through a thiol group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula III.

In yet more specific embodiments, the acyl group is attached to the amino acid at position 10 of the glucagon peptide and the length of the spacer and acyl group is 14 to 28 atoms. The amino acid at position 10, in some aspects, is an amino acid of Formula I, e.g., Lys, or a disubstituted amino acid related to Formula I. In more specific embodiments, the glucagon peptide lacks an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a \n\n 29920-208831 covalent intramolecular bridge. The glucagon peptide, for example, can be a peptide comprising one or more alpha, alpha-disubstituted amino acids, e.g., AIB, for stabilizing the alpha helix of the peptide. Accordingly, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 555-561 and 610-612, the AIB-containing peptides of Tables 20 and 28. As shown herein, such peptides comprising an acylated spacer covalently attached to the side chain of the amino acid at position 10 exhibit enhanced potency at both the GLP-I and glucagon receptors. Suitable methods of peptide acylation via amines, hydroxyls, and thiols are known in the art. See, for example, Example 19 (for methods of acylating through an amine), Miller, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 218: 377-382 (1996); Shimohigashi and Stammer, Int J Pept Protein Res 19: 54-62 (1982); and Previero et al., Biochim Biophys Acta 263: 7-13 (1972) (for methods of acylating through a hydroxyl); and San and Silvius, J Pept Res 66: 169-180 (2005) (for methods of acylating through a thiol); Bioconjugate Chem. \"Chemical Modifications of Proteins: History and Applications\" pages 1 , 2-12 (1990); Hashimoto et al., Pharmacuetical Res. \"Synthesis of Palmitoyl Derivatives of Insulin and their Biological Activity\" Vol. 6, No: 2 pp.171 -176 (1989).\n\n\nThe acyl group of the acylated glucagon peptide can be of any size, e.g., any length carbon chain, and can be linear or branched.

In specific aspects, the long chain alkane comprises an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol group (e.g. octadecylamine, tetradecanol, and hexadecanethiol) which reacts with a carboxyl group, or activated form thereof, of the glucagon peptide. The carboxyl \n\n 29920-208831 group, or activated form thereof, of the glucagon peptide can be part of a side chain of an amino acid (e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid) of the glucagon peptide or can be part of the peptide backbone.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by acylation of the long chain alkane by a spacer which is attached to the glucagon peptide. In specific aspects, the long chain alkane comprises an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol group which reacts with a carboxyl group, or activated form thereof, of the spacer. Suitable spacers comprising a carboxyl group, or activated form thereof, are described herein and include, for example, bifunctional spacers, e.g., amino acids, dipeptides, tripeptides, hydrophilic bifunctional spacers and hydrophobic bifunctional spacers.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"activated form of a carboxyl group\" refers to a carboxyl group with the general formula R(C=O)X, wherein X is a leaving group and R is the glucagon peptide or the spacer. For example, activated forms of a carboxyl groups may include, but are not limited to, acyl chlorides, anhydrides, and esters. In some embodiments, the activated carboxyl group is an ester with a N- hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS) leaving group.\n\n\nWith regard to these aspects of the invention, in which a long chain alkane is acylated by the glucagon peptide or the spacer, the long chain alkane may be of any size and can comprise any length of carbon chain. The long chain alkane can be linear or branched. In certain aspects, the long chain alkane is a C4 to C30 alkane.

In some embodiments, the long chain alkane comprises a C8 to C20 alkane, e.g., a C14 alkane, C16 alkane, or a Cl 8 alkane.\n\n\nAlso, in some embodiments, an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol group of the glucagon peptide is acylated with a cholesterol acid. In a specific embodiment, the glucagon peptide is linked to the cholesterol acid through an alkylated des-amino Cys spacer, i.e., an alkylated 3-mercaptopropionic acid spacer. The alkylated des-amino Cys spacer can be, for example, a des-amino-Cys spacer comprising a dodecaethylene glycol moiety. In one embodiment, the glucagon peptide comprises the structure: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe acylated glucagon peptides described herein can be further modified to comprise a hydrophilic moiety. In some specific embodiments the hydrophilic moiety can comprise a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain. The incorporation of a hydrophilic moiety can be accomplished through any suitable means, such as any of the methods described herein. In this regard, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise SEQ ID NO: 1, including any of the modifications described herein, in which at least one of the amino acids at position 10, 20, 24, and 29 comprise an acyl group and at least one of the amino acids at position 16, 17, 21, 24, or 29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C-terminal amino acid are modified to a Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, or Ac-Phe, and the side chain of the amino acid is covalently bonded to a hydrophilic moiety (e.g., PEG). In some embodiments, the acyl group is attached to position 10, optionally via a spacer comprising Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, or Ac-Phe, and the hydrophilic moiety is incorporated at a Cys residue at position 24.\n\n\nAlternatively, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise a spacer, wherein the spacer is both acylated and modified to comprise the hydrophilic moiety. Nonlimiting examples of suitable spacers include a spacer comprising one or more amino acids selected from the group consisting of Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, and Ac- Phe.\n\n\nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the acylated glucagon peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 534-544 and 546-549. A Iky Ia t ion\n\n\nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group, e.g., an alkyl group which is not naturally-occuring on an amino acid (e.g., an alkyl group which is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid). Without being held to any particular theory, it is believed that alkylation of \n\n 29920-208831 glucagon peptides will achieve similar, if not the same, effects as acylation of the glucagon peptides, e.g., a prolonged half-life in circulation, a delayed onset of action, an extended duration of action, an improved resistance to proteases, such as DPP-IV, and increased potency at the GLP-I and glucagon receptors. Alkylation can be carried out at any positions within the glucagon peptide, including any of positions 1-29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C- terminal amino acid, provided that the glucagon activity is retained. Nonlimiting examples include positions 5, 7, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 24, 27, 28, or 29. The alkyl group can be covalently linked directly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, or indirectly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide via a spacer, wherein the spacer is positioned between the amino acid of the glucagon peptide and the alkyl group. Glucagon peptides may be alkylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. Nonlimiting examples include alkylation at position 10 and pegylation at one or more positions in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g., position 24, 28 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys).\n\n\nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group by direct alkylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments, alkylation is at position 10, 20, 24, or 29. In this regard, the alkylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO : 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at positions 10, 20, 24, and 29 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. In some specific embodiments of the invention, the direct alkylation of the glucagon peptide occurs through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of the amino acid at position 10.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine is an amino acid of Formula I. In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula I, is the amino acid wherein n is 4 (Lys) or n is 3 (Orn).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain hydroxyl is an amino acid of Formula II. In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula II is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Ser). \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain thiol is an amino acid of Formula III. In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula III is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Cys).\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol is a disubstituted amino acid comprising the same structure of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III, except that the hydrogen bonded to the alpha carbon of the amino acid of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III is replaced with a second side chain.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the alkylated glucagon peptide comprises a spacer between the peptide and the alkyl group. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the alkyl group. In some exemplary embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group by alkylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a spacer, which spacer is attached to a side chain of an amino acid at position 10, 20, 24, or 29 of the glucagon peptide. The amino acid to which the spacer is attached can be any amino acid comprising a moiety which permits linkage to the spacer. For example, an amino acid comprising a side chain NH\n2\n, -OH, or -COOH (e.g., Lys, Orn, Ser, Asp, or GIu) is suitable. In this respect, the alkylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at positions 10, 20, 24, and 29 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or carboxylate.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol.\n\n\nWhen alkylation occurs through an amine group of a spacer, the alkylation can occur through the alpha amine of an amino acid or a side chain amine. In the instance in which the alpha amine is alkylated, the amino acid of the spacer can be any amino acid. For example, the amino acid of the spacer can be a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., GIy, Ala, VaI, Leu, lie, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr, 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5- aminovaleric acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid. Alternatively, the amino acid of the spacer can be an acidic residue, e.g., Asp and GIu, provided that the alkylation occurs on the alpha amine of the acidic residue. In the instance in which the side chain amine of the amino acid of the spacer is alkylated, the amino \n\n 29920-208831 acid of the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, e.g., an amino acid of Formula 1 (e.g., Lys or Orn). In this instance, it is possible for both the alpha amine and the side chain amine of the amino acid of the spacer to be alkylated, such that the glucagon peptide is dialkylated. Embodiments of the invention include such dialkylated molecules.\n\n\nWhen alkylation occurs through a hydroxyl group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula II. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Ser.\n\n\nWhen alkylation occurs through a thiol group of spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula III. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Cys.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the spacer is a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer. In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises two or more reactive groups, e.g., an amine, a hydroxyl, a thiol, and a carboxyl group or any combinations thereof.

(Louisville, KY).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the spacer is a hydrophobic bifunctional spacer. In certain embodiments, the hydrophobic bifunctional spacer comprises two or more reactive groups, e.g., an amine, a hydroxyl, a thiol, and a carboxyl group or any combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the hydrophobic bifunctional spacer comprises a hydroxyl group and a carboxylate. In other embodiments, the hydropholic bifunctional spacer comprises an amine group and a carboxylate. In other embodiments, the hydropholic bifunctional spacer comprises a thiol group and a carboxylate. Suitable hydrophobic bifunctional spacers comprising a carboxylate and a hydroxyl group or a thiol group are known in the art and include, for example, 8- hydroxyoctanoic acid and 8-mercaptooctanoic acid. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nThe spacer (e.g., amino acid, dipeptide, tripeptide, hydrophilic bifiinctional spacer, or hydrophobic bifiinctional spacer) in specific embodiments is 3 to 10 atoms (e.g., 6 to 10 atoms, (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 atoms)) in length. In more specific embodiments, the spacer is about 3 to 10 atoms (e.g., 6 to 10 atoms) in length and the alkyl is a C12 to C18 alkyl group, e.g., C14 alkyl group, C16 alkyl group, such that the total length of the spacer and alkyl group is 14 to 28 atoms, e.g., about 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, or 28 atoms. In some embodiments, the length of the spacer and alkyl is 17 to 28 (e.g., 19 to 26, 19 to 21) atoms.\n\n\nIn accordance with certain foregoing embodiments, the bifiinctional spacer can be a synthetic or non-naturally occurring amino acid comprising an amino acid backbone that is 3 to 10 atoms in length (e.g., 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5 -amino valeric acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid). Alternatively, the spacer can be a dipeptide or tripeptide spacer having a peptide backbone that is 3 to 10 atoms (e.g., 6 to 10 atoms) in length. The dipeptide or tripeptide spacer can be composed of naturally-occurring and/or non-naturally occurring amino acids, including, for example, any of the amino acids taught herein. In some embodiments, the spacer comprises an overall negative charge, e.g., comprises one or two negatively charged amino acids. In some embodiments, the dipeptide spacer is selected from the group consisting of: Ala-Ala, β-Ala- β-Ala, Leu-Leu, Pro-Pro, γ-aminobutyric acid- γ- aminobutyric acid, and γ-Glu- γ-Glu.\n\n\nSuitable methods of peptide alkylation via amines, hydroxyls, and thiols are known in the art. For example, a Williamson ether synthesis can be used to form an ether linkage between a hydroxy 1 group of the glucagon peptide and the alkyl group.

Compounds of this invention that encompass non-peptide portions may be synthesized by standard organic chemistry reactions, in addition to standard peptide chemistry reactions when applicable.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nGeneral Synthesis Protocol:\n\n\nGlucagon analogs were synthesized using HBTU-activated \"Fast Boc\" single coupling starting from 0.2mmole of Boc Thr(OBzl)Pam resin on a modified Applied Biosystem 430 A peptide synthesizer. Boc amino acids and HBTU were obtained from Midwest Biotech (Fishers, IN). Side chain protecting groups used were: Arg(Tos), Asn(Xan), Asp(OcHex), Cys(pMeBzl), His(Bom), Lys(2Cl-Z), Ser(OBzl), Thr(OBzl), Tyr(2Br-Z), and Trp(CHO). The side-chain protecting group on the N- terminal His was Boc.\n\n\nEach completed peptidyl resin was treated with a solution of 20% piperdine in dimethylformamide to remove the formyl group from the tryptophan. Liquid hydrogen fluoride cleavages were performed in the presence of p-cresol and dimethyl sulfide. The cleavage was run for 1 hour in an ice bath using an HF apparatus (Penninsula Labs). After evaporation of the HF, the residue was suspended in diethyl ether and the solid materials were filtered. Each peptide was extracted into 30-70ml aqueous acetic acid and a diluted aliquot was analyzed by HPLC [Beckman System Gold, 0.46x5cm Zorbax C8, lml/min, 45C, 214nm, A buffer =0.1%TFA, B=0.1%TFA/90%acetonitrile, gradient of 10% to 80%B over lOmin]. Purification was done on a FPLC over a 2.2 x 25 cm Kromasil Cl 8 column while monitoring the UV at 214nm and collecting 5 minute fractions. The homogeneous fractions were combined and lyophilized to give a product purity of >95%. The correct molecular mass and purity were confirmed using MALDI-mass spectral analysis. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nGeneral Pegylation Protocol: (Cys-maleimido)\n\n\nTypically, the glucagon Cys analog is dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (5-10mg/ml) and 0.0 IM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid is added (10-15% of total volume). Excess (2-fold) maleimido methoxyPEG reagent (Nektar) is added and the reaction stirred at room temp while monitoring reaction progress by HPLC. After 8- 24hrs, the reaction mixture, is acidified and loaded onto a preparative reverse phase column for purification using 0.1%TFA/acetonitrile gradient. The appropriate fractions were combined and lyophilized to give the desired pegylated analogs.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nSynthesis of Glucagon Cys\nπ\n(l-29) and Similar MonoCys Analogs\n\n\n0.2mmole Boc Thr(OBzl) Pam resin (SynChem Inc) in a 60ml reaction vessel and the following sequence was entered and run on a modified Applied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer using FastBoc HBTU-activated single couplings.

The completed peptidyl resin was treated with 20% piperidine/dimethylformamide to remove the Trp formyl protection then transferred to an HF reaction vessel and dried in vacuo. 1.0ml p-cresol and 0.5 ml dimehyl sulfide were added along with a magnetic stir bar. The vessel was attached to the HF apparatus (Pennisula Labs), cooled in a dry ice/methanol bath, evacuated, and aprox. 10ml liquid hydrogen fluoride was condensed in. The reaction was stirred in an ice bath for 1 hr then the HF was removed in vacuo. The residue was suspended in ethyl ether; the solids were filtered, washed with ether, and the peptide extracted into 50 ml aqueous acetic acid. An analytical HPLC was run [0.46 x 5 cm Zorbax C8, 1 ml/min, 45C, 214nm, A buffer of 0.1%TFA, B buffer of 0.1 %TF A/90% ACN, gradients 0%B to 80%B over 1 Omin.] with a small sample of the cleavage extract. The remaining extract was loaded onto a 2.2 x 25cm Kromasil Cl 8 preparative reverse phase column and an acetonitrile gradient was run using a Pharmacia FPLC system. 5min fractions were collected while monitoring the UV at 214nm (2.0A). A=0.1%TFA, B=0.1%TFA/50%acetonitrile. Gradient = 30%B to 100%B over 450min.\n\n\nThe fractions containing the purest product (48-52) were combined frozen, and lyophilized to give 30.1mg. An HPLC analysis of the product demonstrated a \n\n 29920-208831 purity of >90% and MALDI mass spectral analysis demonstrated the desired mass of 3429.7.

The completed peptidyl resin was treated with 20% piperidine/dimethylformamide to remove the Trp formyl protection then transferred to HF reaction vessel and dried in vacuo. 1.0ml p-cresol and 0.5 ml dimehyl sulfide were added along with a magnetic stir bar. The vessel was attached to the HF apparatus (Pennisula Labs), cooled in a dry ice/methanol bath, evacuated, and aprox. 10ml liquid hydrogen fluoride was condensed in. The reaction was stirred in an ice bath for lhr then the HF was removed in vacuo. The residue was suspended in ethyl ether; the solids were filtered, washed with ether, and the peptide extracted into 50 ml aqueous acetic acid. An analytical HPLC was run [0.46 x 5 cm Zorbax C8, 1 ml/min, 45C, 214nm, A buffer of 0.1%TFA, B buffer of 0.1%TFA/90%ACN, gradient=10%B to 80%B over lOmin.] on an aliquot of the cleavage extract. The extract was loaded onto a 2.2 x 25cm Kromasil C18 preparative reverse phase column and an acetonitrile gradient was run for elution using a Pharmacia FPLC system. 5min fractions were collected while monitoring the UV at 214nm (2.0A). A=0.1%TFA, B=0.1%TFA/50%acetonitrile. Gradient = 30%B to 100%B over 450min. Fractions 58-65 were combined, frozen and lyophilized to give 198.1mg.\n\n\nHPLC analysis of the product showed a purity of greater than 95%. MALDI mass spectral analysis showed the presence of the desired theoretical mass of 4316.7 with the product as a C-terminal amide. Oxyntomodulin and oxyntomodulin-KRNR \n\n 29920-208831 were similarly prepared as the C-terminal carboxylic acids starting with the appropriately loaded PAM-resin.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3 Glucagon Cys\n17\n Mal-PEG-5K\n\n\n15.1mg of Glucagon Cys\n17\n(l-29) and 27.3mg methoxy poly(ethyleneglycol) maleimide avg. M.W.5000 (mPEG-Mal-5000,Nektar Therapeutics) were dissolved in 3.5ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 0.5ml 0.01M ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was added. The reaction was stirred at room temperature and the progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC analysis [0.46 x 5 cm Zorbax C8, lml/min,45C, 214nm (0.5A), A=0.1%TFA, B=O.1 %TFA/90%ACN, gradients 0%B to 80%B over lOmin.].\n\n\nAfter 5 hours, the reaction mixture was loaded onto 2.2 x 25 cm Kromasil Cl 8 preparastive reverse phase column. An acetonitrile gradient was run on a Pharmacia FPLC while monitoring the UV wavelength at 214nm and collecting 5 min fractions. A=0.1%TFA, B=O.1%TF A/50% acetonitrile, gradient= 30%B to 100%B over 450 min. The fractions corresponding to the product were combined, frozen and lyophilized to give 25.9 mg.\n\n\nThis product was analyzed on HPLC [0.46 x 5 cm Zorbax C8, 1 ml/min, 45C, 214nm (0.5A), A=0.1%TFA, B=O.1 %TFA/90%ACN, gradient=10%B to 80%B over lOmin.] which showed a purity of aprox. 90%. MALDI (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization) mass spectral analysis showed a broad mass range (typical of PEG derivatives) of 8700 to 9500. This shows an addition to the mass of the starting glucagon peptide (3429) of approximately 5,000 a.m.u.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nGlucagon Cys\n21\n Mal-PEG-5K\n\n\n21.6mg of Glucagon Cys\n2l\n(l-29) and 24mg mPEG-MAL-5000 (Nektar Therapeutics) were dissolved in 3.5ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 0.5ml 0.0 IM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was added. The reaction was stirred at room temp. After 2hrs, another 12.7 mg of mPEG-MAL-5000 was added. After 8hrs, the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 2.2 x 25cm Vydac C18 preparative reverse phase column and an acetonitrile gradient was run on a Pharmacia FPLC at 4 \n\n 29920-208831 ml/min while collecting 5min fractions. A=0.1%TFA, B=0.1%TFA/50%ACN. Gradient= 20% to 80%B over 450min.\n\n\nThe fractions corresponding to the appearance of product were combined frozen and lyophilized to give 34 mg. Analysis of the product by analytical HPLC [0.46 x 5 cm Zorbax C8, 1 ml/min, 45C, 214nm (0.5A), A=0.1%TFA, B=0.1%TFA/90%ACN, gradient 10%B to 80%B over lOmin.] showed a homogeneous product that was different than starting glucagon peptide. MALDI (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization) mass spectral analysis showed a broad mass range (typical of PEG analogs) of 8700 to 9700. This shows an addition to the mass of the starting glucagon peptide (3470) of approximately 5,000 a.m.u.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\nGlucagon Cys\n24\n Mal-PEG-5K\n\n\n20.1mg Glucagon C\n24\n(l-29) and 39.5mg mPEG-Mal-5000 (Nektar Therapeutics) were dissolved in 3.5ml PBS with stirring and 0.5 ml 0.01M EDTA was added. The reaction was stirred at room temp for 7 hrs, then another 40 mg of mPEG- Mal-5000 was added. After approximately 15 hr, the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 2.2 x 25 cm Vydac Cl 8 preparative reverse phase column and an acetontrile gradient was run using a Pharmacia FPLC. 5 min. fractions were collected while monitoring the UV at 214nm (2.0A). A buffer = 0.1 %TFA, B buffer =\n\n\n0.1%TFA/50%ACN, gradient = 30%B to 100%B over 450min. The fractions corresponding to product were combined, frozen and lyophilized to give 45.8mg. MALDI mass spectral analysis showed a typical PEG broad signal with a maximum at 9175.2 which is approximately 5,000 a.m.u. more than Glucagon C\n24\n (3457.8).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nGlucagon Cys\n24\n Mal-PEG-20K\n\n\n25.7mg of Glucagon Cys\n24\n(l-29) and 40.7mg mPEG-Mal-20K (Nektar Therapeutics) were dissolved in 3.5ml PBS with stirring at room temp, and 0.5 ml 0.0 IM EDTA was added. After 6hrs, the ratio of starting material to product was aprox. 60:40 as determined by HPLC. Another 25.1mg of mPEG-Mal-20K was added and the reaction allowed to stir another 16hrs. The product ratio had not significantly improved, so the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 2.2 x 25 cm Kromasil C18 preparative reverse phase column and purified on a Pharmacia FPLC \n\n 29920-208831 using a gradient of 30%B to 100%B over 450min. A buffer =0.1 %TFA, B buffer = 0.1%TFA/50%ACN, flow = 4ml/min, and 5 min fractions were collected while monitoring the UV at 214nm (2.0A). The fractions containing homogeneous product were combined, frozen and lyophilized to give 25.7 mg. Purity as determined by analytical HPLC was ~90%. A MALDI mass spectral analysis showed a broad peak from 23,000 to 27,000 which is approximately 20,000 a.m.u. more than starting Glucagon C\n24\n (3457.8).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 7 Glucagon Cys\n29\n Mal-PEG-5K\n\n\n20.0mg of Glucagon Cys\n29\n( 1 -29) and 24.7 mg mPEG-Mal-5000 (Nektar Therapeutics) were dissolved in 3.5 ml PBS with stirring at room temperature and 0.5 ml 0.01M EDTA was added. After 4 hr, another 15.6 mg of mPEG-Mal-5000 was added to drive the reaction to completion. After 8 hrs, the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 2.2 x 25 cm Vydac Cl 8 preparative reverse phase column and an acetonitrile gradient was run on a Pharmacia FPLC system. 5 min fractions were collected while monitoring the UV at 214nm (2.0A).

Lys(Cl-Z) was used at position 12 if lactams were constructed from 16- 20, 20-24, or 24-28. The completed peptidyl resin was treated with 20% piperidine/dimethylformamide for one hour with rotation to remove the Trp formyl group as well as the Fmoc and OFm protection from Lys 12 and GIu 16. Upon confirmation of removal by a positive ninhydrin test, the resin was washed with dimethylformamide, followed by dichloromethane and than again with dimethylformamide. The resin was treated with 520 mg (1 mmole) Benzotriazole-1- yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) in dimethylformamide and diisopropylethylamine (DIEA). The reaction proceeded for \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\n8-10 hours and the cyclization was confirmed by a negative ninhydrin reaction. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide, followed by dichloromethane and subsequently treated with trifluoroacetic acid for 10 minutes. The removal of the Boc group was confirmed by a positive ninhydrin reaction. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide and dichloromethane and dried before being transferred to a hydrofluoric acid (HF) reaction vessel. 500 μL p-cresol was added along with a magnetic stir bar. The vessel was attached to the HF apparatus (Peninsula Labs), cooled in a dry ice/methanol bath, evacuated, and approximately 10 mL of liquid hydrofluoric acid was condensed into the vessel. The reaction was stirred for 1 hour in an ice bath and the HF was subsequently removed in vacuo. The residue was suspended in ethyl ether; the solids were filtered, washed with ether, and the peptide was solubilized with 150 mL 20% acetonitrile/1% acetic acid.\n\n\nAn analytical HPLC analysis of the crude solubilized peptide was conducted under the following conditions [4.6 X 30 mm Xterra C8, 1.50 mL/min, 220 nm, A buffer 0.1% TF A/10% ACN, B buffer 0.1% TF A/100% ACN, gradient 5-95%B over 15 minutes].

Peptides were synthesized on a solid support resin using either a CS Bio 4886 Peptide Synthesizer or Applied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer. In situ neutralization chemistry was used as described by Schnolzer et al., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 40: 180-193 (1992). For acylated peptides, the target amino acid residue to be acylated (e.g., position ten) was substituted with an N ε -FMOC lysine residue. Treatment of the completed N- terminally BOC protected peptide with 20% piperidine in DMF for 30 minutes removed FMOC/formyl groups. Coupling to the free ε-amino Lys residue was achieved by coupling a ten-fold molar excess of either an FMOC-protected spacer amino acid (ex. FMOC-(N-BOC)-Tryptophan-OH) or acyl chain (ex. C17-COOH) and PyBOP or DEPBT coupling reagent in DMF/DIEA. Subsequent removal of the spacer amino acid's FMOC group is followed by repetition of coupling with an acyl chain. Final treatment with 100% TFA resulted in removal of any side chain protecting groups and the N-terminal BOC group. Peptide resins were neutralized with 5% DIEA/DMF, dried, and then cleaved from the support using HF/p-cresol, 95:5, at 0\n0\nC for one hour. Following ether extraction, a 5% HOAc solution was used to solvate the crude peptide. A sample of the solution was then verified to contain the correct molecular weight peptide by ESI-MS. Correct peptides were purified by RP- HPLC using a linear gradient of 10% CH3CN/0.1% TFA to 0.1% TFA in 100% CH3CN. A Vydac Cl 8 22 mm x 250 mm protein column was used for the purification. Acylated peptide analogs generally completed elution by a buffer ratio of 20:80. Portions were pooled together and checked for purity on an analytical RP- HPLC. Pure fractions were lyophilized yielding white, solid peptides. Yields typically ranged from 10 mg to 100 mg depending on the synthesis.\n\n\nIf a peptide comprises a lactam bridge and target residues to be acylated, acylation is carried out as described above upon addition of that amino acid to the peptide backbone. For peptide pegylation, 40 kDa methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) maleimido- propionamide (Chirotech Technology Ltd.) was reacted with a molar equivalent of peptide in 7M Urea, 5OmM Tris-HCl buffer using the minimal amount of solvent needed to dissolve both peptide and PEG into a clear solution (generally less than 2 mL for a reaction using 2-3 mg peptide). Vigorous stirring at room temperature \n\n 29920-208831 commenced for 4-6 hours and the reaction analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC. PEGylated products appeared distinctly from the starting material with decreased retention times. Purification was performed on a Vydac C4 column with conditions similar to those used for the initial peptide purification. Elution occurred around 5 buffer ratios of 50:50. Fractions of pure PEGylated peptide were found and lyophilized. Yields were above 50%, varying per reaction.\n\n\nPeptides were assayed for biological activity, by co-tranfecting HEK293 cells with either the glucagon receptor (GLUR) or GLP-I receptor (GLP-IR) and a luciferase gene linked to a cAMP responsive element. The transfected cells were0 serum deprived by culturing for 16 hours in DMEM supplemented with 0.25% Bovine Growth Serum and then incubated for 5 hours with serial dilutions of the selected analogs and either Glucagon or GLP-I as standards, respectively. Peptide absorbance readings were obtained from UV Absorbance measurements at 280 nm on a Genesys 6 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron Corporation). Beer's Law was 5 used to calculate solution concentrations based on the number of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in each analog. At the end of the incubation, 100 μL LucLite luminescence substrate reagent was added to each well, the plate sealed and shaken, and placed into a Wallac Trilux luminescence counter for cAMP detection. Effective 50% concentrations (EC50) were calculated using Origin software (OriginLab,0 Northampton, MA).\n\n\nAcylated glucagon-based co-agonist peptides were prepared. In vitro results for a selection of these peptides are shown in Table 13. Although the unacylated peptide, like native glucagon, was insoluble in phosphate-buffered saline solutions at 1 mg/mL concentrations, acylation was observed to enhance solubility of5 the peptide at neutral pH.\n\n\nTABLE 13\n\n\n \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nAll four acylated peptides exhibited increased potency at the GLP-I receptor. Inclusion of the tryptophan spacer provided better potency at the glucagon receptor. An acyl chain length of C18 is slightly preferred.\n\n\nWhile acylation can extend the half-life of a peptide to hours or more, PEGylation with repeats in tens of kDa ranges can do even more. Peptides comprising both types of modifications were prepared. These peptides are expected to exhibit extended half-life in circulation, as well as resistance to DPP-IV and other proteases. In vitro results for a selection of these peptides are shown in Table 14.\n\n\nTABLE 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo of the three peptides retained their high potency at both the GLP-I and glucagon receptors, with an EC50 of less than InM. The K\n10\n-W-Ci\n8\n acylated and PEGylated peptide exhibited about ten-fold potency losses at both receptors. This series of peptides shows that the position ten acylation is compatible with a PEGylation in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g. position 24, 28 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C- terminal Cys).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 20\n\n\nVarious acylated glucagon co-agonist peptides were made as essentially described in Example 19 and tested for in vivo activity. Specifically, Peptide A (SEQ \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nID NO:1 modified to contain AIB at position 2, GIu at position 16, GIn at position 17, Ala at position 18, Lys at position 20, GIu at position 21, He at position 23, Cys at position 24, which Cys is bonded to a 4OK PEG, and C-terminal amide) was further modified to comprise a Lys at position 10. The Lys 10 was acylated with a C8 fatty acid chain, a C 14 fatty acid chain, a C 16 fatty acid chain, or a C 18 fatty acid chain.\n\n\nActivity at the GLP- 1 receptor of each of the acylated peptides was assayed as described in Example 14 and compared to the activity of GLP-I (7-37)acid (SEQ ID NO: 50) as a control. The EC50 of each of the acylated peptides at the GLP-I receptor shown in Table 15 is similar to the EC50 of the GLP-I peptide.\n\n\nTABLE 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe peptides were then tested in vivo by subcutaneously injecting diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice with various acylated and non-acylated peptides, or vehicle alone, QW (70 nmol/kg/week) for 2 weeks. 6 mice per group with initial average body weight of 44 g were tested. Body weight, body composition, food intake, and blood glucose levels were determined periodically.\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 1 1 , the acylated peptides are able to cause weight loss to a similar extent than the non-acylated peptide. As shown in Figure 1 1, between about 7 and 12% weight loss is achieved within the first 3 days of treatment with the acylated peptides. As shown in Figure 12, the acylated peptides caused a decrease in food intake. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 13, the ad libitum blood glucose levels of the acylated peptides were reduced after 1 day of treatment.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21\n\n\nThe following acylated glucagon co-agonist peptides were made as essentially described in Example 19. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\n(A) \"Chimera-2 Aib2 LyslO-C18 Cys24(40K)\": native glucagon amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) comprising the following modifications: GIu at position 16, GIn at position 17, Ala at position 18, Lys at position 20, GIu at position 21 , He at position 23, and Ala at position 24, and a C-terminal amide (\"Chimera 2\"), further modified with AIB at position 2, a Lys 10 acylated with a Cl 8 fatty acid and a Cys at position 24 pegylated with a 4OK PEG group;\n\n\n(B) \"Chimera-2 Aib2 Lys 10-Cl 6 Cys24(40K)\": Chimera 2 further modified with AIB at position 2, a Lys 10 acylated with a C 16 fatty acid and a Cys24 pegylated with a 4OK PEG group;\n'\n (C) \"Glucagon Lys 10-C 18 E 16 K20 Cys24(40K)\": native glucagon amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) comprising the following modifications: GIu at position 16, Lys at position 20, and C-terminal amide (\"E16K20-glucagon-NH2\") was further modified with a Lys 10 acylated with a Cl 8 fatty acid and a Cys24 pegylated with a 4OK PEG group; (D) \"Glucagon LyslO-TrpC16 El 6 K20 Cys24(40K)\": E16K20-glucagon-NH2 was further modified with Lys 10 linked to a Trp spacer which was acylated with a C 16 fatty acid;\n\n\n(E) \"Glucagon LyslO-TrpC18 El 6 K20 Cys24(40K)\": E16K20-glucagon-NH2 was further modified with Lys 10 linked to a Trp spacer which was acylated with a C 18 fatty acid.\n\n\nThe acylated glucagon co-agonist peptides were tested for their activities at the Glucagon and GLP-I receptors generally as described in Example 14.

Specifically, 6 groups of DIO mice (8 mice per group), each group having an average initial body weight of 58 g, were injected intraperitoneally with 10, 20, 40, or 80 nmol/kg of an acylated and pegylated glucagon peptide or a vehicle control once a week for 2 weeks. The acylated and pegylated glucagon peptides used in the study were Chimera-2 AIB\n2\n K\nl0\n-C8 Cys\n24\n-40kD (as described in Example 26) and Peptide A K\nI0\n-Ci\n4\n (as described in Example 20).\n\n\nChanges in body weight of and food intake by the mice were measured 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 14 days after injection. Blood glucose levels of the mice were monitored throughout the 14 days. Glucose tolerance tests were performed by injecting a 25% glucose in saline solution 1 hour or 24 hours after administration of the acylated or pegylated peptide and measuring blood glucose levels at -60, 0, 15, 30, 60, or 120 min after the glucose injection. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 20, the total body weight of mice injected with 40 or 80 nmol/kg of acylated and pegylated Peptide A K\nl0\n-Ci4 was reduced as compared to mice injected with the vehicle control.\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 21, the blood glucose levels of mice injected with 20, 40, or 80 nmol/kg Peptide A K\n10\n-C\nl4\n or with 20 nmol/kg Chimera-2 AIB\n2\n K\nl0\n-C8 Cys\n24\n- 4OkD in response to a glucose injection are lowered in comparison to vehicle control.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 31\n\n\nAcylated glucagon analog peptides comprising or lacking a covalent intramolecular bridge were made by solid-phase synthesis and tested for in vitro activity at the glucagon and GLP-I receptors. The EC50 (nM) at each receptor and the % activity of the peptide relative to the native peptide at the corresponding receptor is shown in Table 21. \n\n\n\n\n29920-208831\n\n\nTABLE 21 \n\n\n \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nSeveral glucagon analogs lacking a covalent intramolecular bridge and comprising an AIB at position 2, an AIB at position 16, and a fatty acyl group attached via a spacer to a Lys residue at position 10 were made as essentially described herein. The acylated glucagon analogs differed by the type of spacer, the presence or absence of pegylation, and/or by the size of the acyl group. The acylated glucagon analogs were tested for in vitro activity at the glucagon receptor and the GLP-I receptor as essentially described in Example 14. A summary of the structure and in vitro activity at the glucagon and GLP-I receptors of each peptide is shown in Tables 22 and 23.\n\n\nTABLE 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* indicates that the peptide comprised a Cys residue at position 24 (in place of GIn) which Cys was covalently attached to a 40 kDa PEG group. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nTABLE 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n♦\n* peptide comprising Cys at position 24 (in place of GIn) which Cys was not covalently attached to a PEG molecule\n\n\nAs shown in Tables 22 and 23, the peptides comprising a fatty acyl group attached via a spacer significantly increased their potency as compared to peptides comprising a fatty acyl group attached directly to the peptide backbone.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 32\n\n\nDIO mice (8 mice per group), each with an average bodyweight of 48.7 g, were subcutaneously injected daily for seven days with vehicle only, with 30 nmol/kg or 100 nmol/kg of an acylated glucagon analog peptide, or with the long-acting GLP- 1 analog, Liraglutide (Novo Nordisk, Denmark). The acylated glucagon analogs were as follows:\n\n\n\"(C 16) Glucagon Amide\" comprised the amino acid sequence of wild-type glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) with the Tyr at position 10 modified to an acylated Lys \n\n 29920-208831 residue, wherein the acylated Lys comprised a C16 fatty acyl group, and the C- terminal carboxylate replaced with an amide group ;\n\n\n\"γE-γE-C16 Glucagon Amide\" comprised the same structure of Cl 6 Glucagon Amide, except that the C16 fatty acyl group was attached to the Lys at position 10 through a gamma-Glu-gamma-Glu dipeptide spacer (see structure of acylated Lys below);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"AA-C 16 Glucagon Amide\" comprised the same structure of C 16 Glucagon Amide, except that the Cl 6 fatty acyl group was attached to the Lys at position 10 through an Ala-Ala dipeptide spacer; and\n\n\n\"βAβA-C 16 Glucagon Amide\" comprised the same structure of C 16 Glucagon Amide, except that the C16 fatty acyl group was attached to the Lys at position 10 through an β-Ala-β-Ala dipeptide spacer.\n\n\nThe body weight of the mice was monitored daily and the total change in body weight (%) is shown in Figure 22. As shown in Figure 22, most of the acylated glucagon peptides at each dose caused a reduction in body weight. While Liraglutide demonstrated an approximate 12% decrease in body weight, the glucagon analog peptide γE-γE-C16 Glucagon Amide exhibited the greatest ability to cause weight loss in mice at the matched dose. Even the lower dose of γE-γE -C 16 Glucagon Amide caused a substantial decrease in body weight.\n\n\nThe fat mass of the mice was measured on Day 7 of the study. As shown in Figure 23, the mice which were administered 100 nmol/kg γE-γE-C16 Glucagon Amide exhibited the lowest fat mass. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nBlood glucose levels of the mice were also monitored during the course of the assay. As shown in Figure 24, the glucagon analog peptide γE-γE-C 16 Glucagon Amide at the higher dose worked as well as Liraglutide to decrease blood glucose levels in mice.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 33\n\n\nAcylation of a glucagon analog peptide having GLP- 1 activity was evalulated as follows.

It also recruited interest and investment in obesity research as a means to identify environmental and pharmacologic approaches to manage what has become a global epidemic of disease. Sufficiently efficacious and safe pharmacologic treatment for obesity has yet to emerge and surgery constitutes the only proven option to sustained weight loss. It is reported herein that the combinatorial efficacy of receptor agonism at two endocrine hormonal receptors to achieve potent satiety inducing and lipolytic effects in a single peptide of sustained duration of action. Two specific glucagon analogs with activity at the GLPl-R comparable to native GLP-I, but differing from each other in their level of glucagon receptor agonism were studied pharmacologically in rodent obesity models. Once weekly administration of these pegylated peptides selected from a series of high potency analogs with differential glucagon and GLP-I activity normalized adiposity and glucose tolerance levels in diet induced obese mice (average body weight ca. 50g) within a month. Body weight loss was a consequence of body fat loss resulting from decreased food intake and increased energy expenditure, which increased with the level of glucagon receptor agonism. These co-agonist compounds also normalized glucose and lipid metabolism including liver steatosis. Effects were dose dependent and successfully repeated in diet induced obese rats. These preclinical studies indicate that when full GLP-I agonism is enhanced with an appropriate degree of glucagon receptor activation, body fat reduction can be substantially and safely accelerated. The findings shown herein establish a basis for clinical testing and suggest an attractive novel treatment option for the metabolic syndrome.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 41\n\n\nThe following materials and methods pertain to the experiments described in Examples 42 to 51.\n\n\nBoc peptide synthesis and cleavage.\n\n\nPeptide syntheses were performed using 0.2 mmol 4-methylbenzhydrylamine (MBHA) resin (Midwest Biotech, Fishers, Indiana) on a modified Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer. Solid-phase peptide syntheses utilized in situ neutralization for Boc-chemistry (Schnolzer, M. et al., International Journal of \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nPeptide Research and Therapeutics, 13:31-44 (2007)). Completed peptidyl-resins were treated with HF/p-cresol (10:0.5 v/v) at 0° C for 1 h. HF was removed in vacuo and the deprotected peptide was precipitated and washed in diethyl ether. The peptide was dissolved in 20% acetonitrile/1% acetic acid and lyophilized. Most peptides were prepared by Boc chemistry. The following side chain protecting groups were used for Boc-amino acids (Midwest Biotech): Arg(Tos), Asp(OcHex), Asn(Xan), Glu(OcHex), His(BOM), Lys(2-Cl-Z), Ser(Bzl), Thr(Bzl), Trp(CHO), Tyr(Br-Z). Peptide molecular weights were confirmed by electrospray ionization or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and purified as described elsewhere.\n\n\nLactam Synthesis.\n\n\nCyclized peptides with i to i + 4 lactam formation were synthesized on resin. GIu(OFm)-OH gamma ester (Peptides International, Louisville, Kentucky) and Lys(Fmoc)-OH (Peptides International) were substituted for Glu(OcHex) and Lys(2- Cl-Z) at positions involved in lactam formation. The fully protected peptidyl-resin was treated with 20% piperidine in DMF for 45 minutes to remove Fmoc and OFm protecting groups. On resin, lactam formation was achieved after treatment with 5 equivalents of benzotriazole- 1 -yloxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) (Fluka) in DMF/DIEA for 5 h. Lactam formation was confirmed by ninhydrin analysis and mass reduction of 18 relative to the open form of the peptide.\n\n\nPeptide Purification.\n\n\nFollowing cleavage from the resin, crude peptide extracts were analyzed by analytical reverse-phase HPLC. Analytical separations were conducted in 0.1% TFA with an acetonitrile gradient on a Zorbax C8 column (0.46 X 5 cm). After analytical analysis, the crude extract was purified by semi-preparative chromatography in 0.1% TFA with an acetonitrile gradient on a Vydac C4 or Cl 8 column (2.2 X 25 cm). Pegylated peptides were purifed using the same conditions. Preparative fractions were analyzed for purity (> 95%) by analytical reverse-phase HPLC utilizing the conditions listed for analytical separations. Peptide masses and purity were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Pegylated \n\n 29920-208831 peptides showed a broad mass range spanning 43400 by MALDI-TOF. Purified peptides were lyophilized and stored at 4° C.\n\n\nPegylation of Peptides.\n\n\nPurified peptides were mixed at a 1 :1 molar ratio with methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) maleimido-propionamide-40K (Chirotech Technology Ltd, Cambridge) in 7M urea/50mM Tris, pH 8.0. Reaction progress was monitored by analytical reverse- phase HPLC and free peptide was consumed within 30 minutes. The reaction was quenched in 0.1% TFA, purified and characterized as described elsewhere.\n\n\nGlucagon and GLP-I Receptor-Mediated cAMP Synthesis.\n\n\nEach peptide analog was tested for its ability to stimulate cAMP production through the glucagon (Gcg) and GLP-I receptors. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the GcgR or GLP- 1 R cDNAs and a luciferase reporter gene-linked to a cAMP response element (CRE). Cells were serum deprived for 16 h by culturing in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and supplemented with 0.25% Bovine Growth Serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Serial dilutions of Glucagon and GLP-I analogs were added to 96-well poly-D-Lysine-coated plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) containing co-transfected HEK293 cells, and plates were incubated for 5 h at 37° C, 5% CO\n2\n. Following incubation, an equivalent volume (100 μL) of Luc Lite luminescence substrate reagent (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA) was added to each well and the plate was shaken for 3 min at 800 rpm. The plate was incubated for 10 min in the dark and light output was quantified on a MicroBetal450 liquid scintillation counter (Perkin- Elmer, Wellesley, MA). Effective 50% concentrations (EC50) were calculated by Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA).\n\n\nCircular dichroism measurements.\n\n\nPeptides were dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 5.9 with increasing concentrations of TFE, and peptide concentrations were quantified. Each sample was diluted to 10 μM for CD measurements. CD data were collected on a JASCO J-715 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter with constant nitrogen stream and temperature control of the 1 mm path length cell set at 25° C. Spectral data were accumulated for 5 scans from 270-190 nm with a scan speed of 100 nm/min and 1 nm wavelength step. Solvent signal was subtracted and data were smoothed (Savitzky and Golay, \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nAnal. Chem. 36: 1627 (1964)); in the JASCO Spectra Manager software. Millidegree values obtained were converted to mean residue ellipticity with units of degcm\n2\n dmor'. Calculated mean residue ellipticity values were input into DICHROWEB (Whitmore and Wallace, Biopolymers 89:392- 400 (2008); Whitmore and Wallace, Nucleic Acids Research 32:W668-W673 (2004) to obtain percent helicity values.\n\n\nAnimals.\n\n\nC57BI/6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and fed a diabetogenic diet from Research Diets, a high sucrose diet with 58% kcal from fat. Mice were single or group-housed on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle at 22° C with free access to food and water. All studies were approved by and performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Cincinnati.\n\n\nBody Composition Measurements.\n\n\nWhole body composition (fat and lean mass) was measured using NMR technology (EchoMRI, Houston, TX).\n\n\nEnergy Balance Physiology Measurements.\n\n\nEnergy intake and expenditure, as well as home-cage activity, were assessed by using a combined indirect calorimetry system (TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany). Oxygen consumption and CO\n2\n production were measured every 45 min for a total of 120 h (including 12 h of adaptation) to determine the respiratory quotient and energy expenditure. Food and water intake and meal patterns were determined continuously for 120 h at the same time as the indirect calorimetry assessments by integration of scales into the sealed cage environment. Meals were defined as food intake events with a minimum duration of 60 s, and a break of 300 s between food intake events. Home-cage locomotor activity was determined using a multidimensional infrared light beam system with beams scanning the bottom and top levels of the cage, and activity being expressed as beam breaks. Stationary motor activity (fidgeting) was defined as consecutive breaks of one single light beam at cage-bottom level, ambulatory movement as breaks of any two different light beams \n\n 29920-208831 at cage-bottom level, and rearing as simultaneous breaks of light beams on both cage- bottom and the top level.\n\n\nBlood Parameters.\n\n\nBlood was collected after a 6-h fast from tail veins using EDTA-coated Microvette tubes (Sarstedt, Nuremberg, Germany) and immediately chilled on ice. After 15 min of centrifugation at 3,000 g and 4° C, plasma was stored at -80° C. Plasma insulin was quantified by a radioimmunoassay from Linco (Sensitive Rat Insulin RlA; Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Plasma TGs and cholesterol levels were measured by enzymatic assay kits (Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA). Samples were analyzed individually with the exception that pooled samples (0.25 ml) from 5 animals/group were subjected to fast-performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) gel filtration on two Superose 6 columns connected in series for lipoprotein separation. All assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nGlucose tolerance test.\n\n\nFor the determination of glucose tolerance, mice were subjected to 6 h of fasting and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 2 g glucose/kg body wt (50% D- glucose (Sigma) in 0.9% saline) for the glucose tolerance test (GTT). Tail blood glucose levels (mg/dl) were measured by using a hand-held glucometer (TheraSense Freestyle) before (0 min) and at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after injection.\n\n\nWestern blot of WA T HSl.\n\n\nAdipose tissue was placed in a 1.5-ml microfuge tube and lysed in ice cold RIPA buffer (IX PBS, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium doxycholate, 0.1% SDS with 50 mM NaF, 0.5 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM Na Vanadate, 20 μg/ml Aprotinin, 10 μg/ml Leupeptin) using a tissue lyser (Retsch, Inc Newtown, PA Cat. # 85210) at 30 hz for 3 min. Samples were spun at 12,000 rpm for 15 min (4° C) at which time the internatant was removed to a new tube and sonicated for 15 sec on ice. Samples were spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min (4° C) and the internatant was collected to a new tube. Samples were again spun at 19,000 rpm for 10 min (4° C) and the internatant collected to a new tube. An aliquot of sample was then taken for protein assay. Samples were then boiled in 4x SDS/DTT buffer for 2 min. 50 μg of protein from cell lysate were subjected to SDS/PAGE on 9% (w/v) acrylamide resolving gels \n\n 29920-208831 and transferred to Hybond ECL nictrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked and probed with primary antibodies of interest (HSL (4107)) from Cell Signaling; Phospho-HSL (ser 660) (4126) from Cell Signaling). After washing, primary antibody detection was performed using either HRP-conjugated anti-(rabbit IgG) or anti-(mouse IgG) (HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Bio-Rad (170-6515 & 170-6516)) and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to CL-Xposure film (Pierce).\n\n\nImmunohistochemistry.\n\n\nParaffin embedded sections of white epididymal adipose tissue (5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin/eosin as described (Ogden, C. L. et al. JAMA 295: 1549- 1555 (2006)). For each individual mouse tissue block, adipocyte size of 100 cells from each of three different high-power fields was quantified as areal measurement using Image Pro Plus 5.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA).\n\n\nOil Red Staining.\n\n\nTo visualize lipid accumulation in liver tissue, 4-8 mm cross-sections of the livers that were harvested at sacrifice were stained with Oil Red O dye. Images at both 2OX and 4OX magnification were acquired using a [compound-lens] microscope.\n\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR procedure.\n\n\nAnimals were sacrificed by decapitation in the fed state (1-4 h after the morning feeding) and various tissues were sampled, freeze-clamped, and stored at - 80° C for subsequent measurement of mRNA expression of PEPCK, G6P, and HPRT (housekeeping) by real-time quantitative PCR (icycler, BioRad).\n\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from frozen tissue samples using a RNeasy Lipid Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Ca# 74804) using the standard protocol. RNA concentrations and purity were determined by spectrophotometry using the Nanodrop. cDNA templates for RT-PCR were obtained using 2 μg of total RNA. Reverse transcription reaction was performed with 1OX DNase I Reaction Buffer, DNase I, Amp Grade, 1 U/μl, depc-H\n2\n0, 25 mM EDTA, 10 mM dNTP Mix, oligo(dT)20 (50 μM), 5X First-Strand Buffer, 0.1 M DTT, RNaseOUT, and Superscript III (Invitrogen). \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nThe synthesized cDNAs were further amplified by PCR using the fluorescent dye SYBR green (BioRad, Ca# 1708882) containing a final concentration of 0.5 μM of forward and reverse primers. Product purity was confirmed by dissociation curves. No-template controls were included in all assays, yielding no consistent amplification. A standard curve was used to obtain the relative concentration of PEPCK or G6P, and the results were corrected according to the concentration of HPRT, used as housekeeping genes. The results are expressed as percent of vehicle, setting the mean of the vehicle group at 100% and then calculating each individual value of the 3 groups of animals studied.\n\n\nPrimer Sequences.\n\n\nPrimer sequences for PEPCK, G6P, and HPRT were taken from the NIH website and primers were generated by IDT DNA.\n\n\nReverse Transcription and Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR.\n\n\nCD68 mRNA expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR as described (Nomiyama, T. et al. Journal of Clinical Investigation 1 17:2877-2888 (2007)). Briefly, upon sacrifice, 100 mg epididymal adipose tissue was homogenized in TRIZOL and total mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA. PCR reactions were performed using an iCycler (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Green I system (Bio-Rad). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate and normalized to values for TFIIB mRNA expression. Mouse primer sequences used were as follows: CD68, 5'-CAAGGTCCAGGGAGGTTGTG-S' (forward) (SEQ ID NO: 638), 5'-CCAAAGGTAAGCTGTCCATAAGGA-S' (reverse) (SEQ ID NO: 639); and TFIIB, S'-CTCTCCCAAGAGTCACATGTCC (SEQ ID NO: 640), 5\"-CAATAACTCGGTCCCCTACAAC-3' (reverse) (SEQ ID NO: 641).\n\n\nStatistical Analyses.\n\n\nUnless indicated otherwise, all statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism one-way ANOVAs and column statistics. Stated P values are for one-way analysis of variance. All results are presented as means ± SE. (Receptor activation data is ± S. D.). \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nEXAMPLE 42\n\n\nTwo glucagon peptides, Peptides X and Y, comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 with amino acid modifications were made as described herein. Both peptides comprised AIB at position 2, GIu at position 16, GIn at position 17, Ala at position 18, Lys at position 20, GIu at position 21 , He at position 23, and Cys at position 24. Site-specific 40-kd pegylation was achieved at Cys at position 24 through reaction with a maleimide-functionalized linear peg to yield Peptide X-PEG and Y-PEG. Peptides Y and Y-PEG differed from Peptides X and X-PEG, respectively, in that a single side-chain lactam bridge was introduced in the middle of Peptide Y or Peptide Y-PEG to stabilize the secondary structure and enhance glucagon agonism. The two side chains of GIu at position 16 and Lys at position 20 were covalently coupled in the course of peptide assembly as a side-chain amide. This macrocyclization of the peptide represents a 21 -atom lactam. Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG were tested for solubility and were found to be soluble in physiological buffers at concentrations that exceed 25 mg/ml, and Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG proved completely resistant to ex vivo incubation with plasma for periods of one week.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 43\n\n\nThe secondary conformation of peptides when solubilized in various concentrations of aqueous trifluoroethanol (TFE) was analyzed by circular dichroism (Figure 25). Glucagon was the least helical peptide tested, and had calculated helicity of 10, 15 and 33% in TFE solutions of 0, 10 and 20%, respectively (Table 29). Under the same experimental conditions, GLP-I had enhanced helicity of 14, 29 and 55%, demonstrating that these two peptides differ in primary as well as secondary structure. There were no significant changes in the helicity of Peptides X and Y when pegylated, despite the fact that the pegylated portions represent more than 90% of the molecule by mass (Table 29). In contrast, the apparent helicity of Peptide Y in phosphate buffer in the absence of TFE was approximately double that of Peptide X, from 17% to 36%. Consequently, the pegylated forms of these two chimeric peptides (Peptide X-PEG and Peptide Y-PEG) differed appreciably in secondary structure (Figure 25) and the differences in biological properties are likely a function of these secondary structural differences. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nTABLE 29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 44\n\n\nThe two peptides (Peptides X and Y) and their 40-kd pegylated derivatives (Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG) were assessed for their ability to stimulate cAMP synthesis in cell-based CRE-luciferase reporter assays (Figure 26). As shown in \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nTable 30, native glucagon activated glucagon receptors half-maximally at an effective concentration (EC50) of 0.055 ± 0.014 nM and the GLP-I receptor (GLP-IR) at a much higher concentration, EC50 of 3.29 ± 0.39 nM. In contrast, GLP-I activated its receptor with an EC50 of 0.028 ± 0.009 nM and proved highly specific in that interaction at the glucagon receptor (GcgR) occurred at an EC50 exceeding 1 μM. The dynamic range in specificity exhibited for the native ligands at their receptors is in excess of a million. The potency of Peptide X-PEG at GLP-IR was twice that of native GLP-I and even more enhanced at GcgR in a relative sense. However, the GcgR activity was only approximately 10% that of native glucagon. The introduction of the lactam restored full glucagon agonism without a change at GLP-I R. Consequently, Peptide Y-PEG is a fully potent, nearly balanced co-agonist relative to the native ligands at the two respective receptors. PEGylation of each peptide reduced potency by as much as ten-fold at GcgR and five-fold at GLP-IR. The slightly enhanced loss in activity at GcgR may be a function of the greater relative importance of the C-terminal sequence to glucagon receptor interaction. The pegylated peptides (Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG) were slightly less potent at GLP-IR than native GLP-I but still had a subnanomolar EC50. Peptide X-PEG is seven-fold more selective than the lactam version of this peptide, i.e., Peptide Y-PEG, at the GLP- 1 R. Therefore, these two DPP-4-resistant peptides are suitable for sustained in vivo time-action experiments and well-matched for GLP-IR agonism, but differ in glucagon agonism. \n\n\n\n\n29920-208831\n\n\nTABLE 30\n\n\n4- \n\n\n\n\n\nό (N \n\n\n \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nEXAMPLE 45\n\n\nThe 40-kd pegylated peptides Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG were used as single weekly subcutaneous (s.c) injections in diet-induced obese (DlO) C57B6 mice. A single injection of 325 nmol/kg of Peptide Y-PEG decreased body weight over one week by 25.8%, from 50.9 ± 1.4 g to 37.8 ± 0.8 g (p < 0.0001, n = 8/group). Comparable administration of Peptide X-PEG was effective but considerably less potent, as the decrease in body weight was 9% (49.1 ± 1.51 g to 44.68 ± 1.38 g). Saline-injected control mice did not change their body weight (before: 50.61 ± 1.32 g, after: 50.87 ± 1.46 g; Figure 27A). The body weight changes were a result of a decrease in fat mass (41.9% for the lactam peptide, 22.2% for open form, 2.3% for controls, p < 0.001 ; Figure 27B) and were paralleled by a significant decrease in average daily food intake (Peptide Y-PEG: 0.40 ± 0.29 g/day, Peptide X-PEG: 1.83 ± 0.81 g/day, saline: 2.70 ± 0.78 g/day, p < 0.0001, Figure 27C). Blood glucose was significantly decreased for both peptides when compared to control, and slightly more so in Peptide Y-PEG (Peptide Y-PEG: -90.1 mg/dL, Peptide X-PEG: -79.6 mg/dL, control: -23.9 g,/dL, p=0.0433; Figure 27D). The relative difference between the two peptides (Peptide X-PEG and Peptide Y-PEG) was not statistically significant.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 46\n\n\nIn a separate experiment, single s.c. injections of six different doses (0, 7, 14, 35, 70, 140 and 350 nmol/kg) of Peptide Y-PEG and Peptide X-PEG demonstrated linearly responsive, dose-dependent decreases in body weight and blood glucose (Figure 28A, 28B, 28C and 28D). This suggests that the observed effects are pharmacologically relevant with no apparent toxicity, other than the indirect effects of rapid, excessive loss in body weight. The magnitude of the effect was more prominent with Peptide Y-PEG and indicates that the additional element of glucagon agonism improves the potency of the peptide.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 47\n\n\nIn a separate experiment, weekly s.c. injections of 70 nmol/kg of Peptide Y- PEG or Peptide X-PEG decreased body weight of DIO mice by 28.1 % and 20.1 %, respectively (p < 0.0001 , n= 7-8/group; Figure 29A). The body weight changes were associated with a decrease in fat mass (-62.9% for Peptide Y-PEG, -52.2% for Peptide X-PEG, and 5.1% for controls, p < 0.0001 ; Figure 29B). Long-term effects of these \n\n 29920-208831 lower doses on food intake (p = 0.95; Figure 29C) were less impressive than short- term effects with a higher dose (Figure 27C). Energy expenditure was increased with Peptide Y-PEG (14.60 ± 0.69 kcal/[kg*h]) and Peptide X-PEG (17.19 ± 1.49 kcal/[kg*h]) compared to vehicle (12.71 ± 0.45 kcal/[kg*h]), p = 0.0187), whereas the respiratory quotient tended to be decreased (Figure 29D and 29E; 0.719 ± 0.01 for Peptide Y-PEG\n1\n 0.725 ± 0.01 for Peptide X-PEG, and 0.755 ± 0.01 for vehicle, p = 0.1028), indicating that increased thermogenesis and altered nutrient partitioning may explain the overall negative energy balance. Increased energy expenditure was not associated with a change in spontaneous physical activity induced thermogenesis (NEAT) since locomotor activity did not differ between treatment groups and controls (p = 0.4281 ; Figure 29F). Neither automated online monitoring of acute feeding nor chronic monitoring of food intake revealed any differences in caloric intake (automated p = 0.667, chronic p = 0.9484; Figure 30A).\n\n\nBlood glucose levels were markedly decreased over the treatment period starting at Day 3 after the first injection (mean decrease: Peptide Y-PEG -32%, Peptide X-PEG -24.5%, controls: -2.7%, p < 0.0001 ; Figure 29G). In response to an intraperitoneally (i.p.) glucose challenge on Day 3, blood glucose peaks (Figure 29H) and profiles (AUC) (Figure 30F) were markedly lower in the two treated groups (Peptide Y-PEG 14183 ± 1072, Peptide X-PEG 13794 ± 824.1) compared to the vehicle-treated controls (34125 ± 3142, p < 0.0001). After one month of treatment with Peptide Y-PEG or Peptide X-PEG, plasma insulin was lower in the treatment groups (1 194 pg/ml, 1034 pg/ml , p=0.0244) compared to controls (2675 pg/ml), suggesting improved insulin sensitivity (Figure 291). Plasma C- peptide levels tended to be decreased after one month of treatment with Peptide Y-PEG or Peptide X-PEG (738.8 pg/ml, 624.7 pg/ml) versus vehicle (1077 pg/ ml) (p = 0.108) ( Figure 30G).\n\n\nTo determine if the principal phenomenon generalizes across species, both compounds were administered to diet-induced obese rats (mean weight 777.4 +/- 2.1 g, dose 70 nmol/kg/week, once-a-week injection, 3-week treatment). Peptide Y-PEG and Peptide X-PEG each decreased body weight (Peptide X-PEG: -11.15 +/- 0.88%; Peptide Y-PEG: -20.58 +/- 2.26%, vehicle: 1.09 +/- 0.56%) (p < 0.0001) and fat mass of the DIO rats (Peptide X-PEG: -19.17 +/- 2.03%; Peptide Y-PEG: - 33.76 +/- 4.76%, vehicle: 0.65 +/- 1.20%; p < 0.0001), confirming a species-independent applicability of this anti-obesity treatment approach. \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\nEXAMPLE 48\n\n\nChronic s.c. treatment over 27 days with Peptide X-PEG and Peptide Y-PEG decreased total cholesterol in DIO mice (106.9 ± 6.3 mg/dL and 200.8 ± 29.58 mg/dL, respectively) relative to vehicle (254.0 25.33 mg/dL, p = 0.0441 ; Figure 31A). In a separate experiment, DIO mice received 70 nmol/kg s.c. of Peptide X-PEG, Peptide Y-PEG or vehicle on Days 0 and 7 and were evaluated on Day 9. Peptide Y-PEG decreased plasma triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol (total cholesterol 63.0 2.49 mg/dL compared to vehicle 177.7 ± 1 1.8 mg/dL) (p < 0.0001), while potentially causing a switch from LDL to HDL cholesterol (Figure 31B). Peptide X-PEG decreased both LDL and HDL cholesterol but had no significant effect on triglycerides (Figure 31C). There was a significant decrease in leptin (3343 ± 723.3 pg/ml for Peptide Y-PEG; 7308 ± 2927 for Peptide X-PEG, and 18,642 ± 6124 for vehicle; p=0.0426; Figure 3 ID, 3 IE, 31F). Chronic treatment for 27 days also normalized liver lipid content while control DIO mice maintained significant liver steatosis (data not shown).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 49\n\n\nOne month treatment with Peptide X-PEG or Peptide Y-PEG resulted in increased phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) in white adipose tissue (WAT) of DIO mice (Peptide X-PEG: 1.135 ± 0.315; Peptide Y-PEG: 1.625 ± 0.149; vehicle: 0.597 ± 0.204; p = 0.0369; Figure 32B), implying a glucagon-specific direct effect on WAT lipolysis. Concomitant with the decrease in fat mass of mice treated for two weeks at a dose of 35 nmol/kg/week with the Peptide Y-PEG and Peptide X-PEG, there was a significant reduction of adipocyte size in epididymal adipose tissues when compared to control mice (data not shown). However, despite having decreased fat mass and smaller adipocytes, this short term treatment of two weeks with the Peptide Y-PEG and Peptide X-PEG was not associated with a significant reduction of adipose tissue macrophage content as quantified by real-time RT-PCR for CD68 (Figure 33C). Uncoupling protein I (UCPl) levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) were increased by Peptide X-PEG, but not by Peptide Y-PEG treatment (Peptide X-PEG 2.167 ± 0.429, Peptide Y-PEG 1.287 ± 0.1558, and vehicle 1.0 ± 0.1 18; p = 0.0264; Figure 32A), consistent with a GLP-I -specific action on BAT resting thermogenesis. Hepatic gene expression reflective of hepatic gluconeogenesis was not affected by either Peptide X-PEG or Peptide Y-PEG (Figure \n\n 29920-208831\n\n\n3OH and 301). Histology indicated that pancreatic islets tended to be smaller following Peptide X-PEG treatment (data not shown).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 50\n\n\nIn order to dissect the contributions of the GLP-IR and the GcgR agonist components of Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG, each was administered for one month to GLP-I receptor knock out (GLP-IR -/-) mice maintained on high-fat diet. Peptide X- PEG caused a reduction of body weight (p > 0.05; Figures 34 A and 34B) and fat mass (p > 0.05; Figure 34C) compared to saline. Peptide Y-PEG caused a significant decrease in body weight (p = 0.0025) and fat mass (p = 0.0025) in the GLP-IR -/- mice (Figures 34A- 34C). Peptide X-PEG had no effect on food intake in GLP-IR -/- mice, while Peptide Y-PEG suppressed food intake significantly (p = 0.017) (Figure 34D). Peptide Y-PEG (but not Peptide X-PEG) had a tendency to increase blood glucose in a glucose tolerance test in the absence of a functional GLP-IR (p = 0.03) (Figures 34E and 34F), implying that the GLP-I component of the co-agonist is needed to protect against glucagon-induced hyperglycemia.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 51\n\n\nAs an independent assessment of the effect of Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG that can be attributable to glucagon agonism, two additional peptide agonists with comparable GLP- 1 R potency but markedly different GcgR activity were studied. The two peptides (Peptides U and V) are related to the Peptides X-PEG and Y-PEG. Peptides U and V comprised the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 with the following modifications: GIu at position 16, GIn at position 17, Ala at position 18, Lys at position 20, GIu at position 21, He at position 23, and Cys at position 24, but comprised a 20-kd pegylation at the Cys at position 24 and did not comprise AIB at position 2. Peptide V additionally comprised a substitution of Gln3 with GIu which selectively reduced glucagon agonism by more than ten-fold. Neither Peptide U nor Peptide V comprised a lactam bridge. Treatment of DIO mice each day for one week at 50 nmol/kg s.c. with Peptide V revealed a reduced effect on body weight lowering relative to the Peptide U (-9.09 ± 0.80 vs. -13.71 ± 0.92 g, respectively (p < 0.0001; Figure 35A). \n\n 29920-208831 EXAMPLE 52\n\n\nGlucagon peptides comprising a Cl 6 fatty acyl group attached to a Lys residue via a γ-Glu spacer or a γ-Glu-γ-Glu dipeptide spacer, wherein the Lys residue is located at position 10 or at the C-terminus (at position 29), were made as essentially described herein.
