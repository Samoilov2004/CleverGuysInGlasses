Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions as defined in \nclaim\n 1 which are administered by inhalation.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPolypeptide therapeutics and in particular antibody-based therapeutics have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity. However, in order to be effective as therapeutic agent, their pharmacokinetic profile should be optimized. The majority of current antibody applications are for acute disorders. There are however significant opportunities to develop antibody therapeutics for chronic conditions. This will require large doses of protein over a long period of time. Since the cost of antibody production in mammalian cells is high, the development of traditional antibody therapeutics for these applications has been discouraged. An alternative approach has been to express fragments of antibodies such as Fab's or single-chain Fv's in microbial expression systems such as yeast and bacteria. These fragments however have very short circulation times \nin vivo.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the initial approaches to increase the circulation in the bloodstream of proteins and peptides were based on chemical modification, such as pegylation (\n \nUS 4,179,337\n \n). Examples of such products are PEG-Intron, i.e. pegylated interferon alpha-2b for the treatment of HCV, and treatment of chronic disorder with PEG-modified antibodies (\nA.P Chapman, Adv.Drug Delivery Reviews (2002), 54, 531-545\n). Such chemical methods, however, suffer from a number of disadvantages, such as inactivation of the target protein or peptide due to the chemical modification of certain amino acid side chains, instability of the target protein/peptide during the chemical reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo overcome these limitations, alternative approaches have been developed, first of all by using non-conventional or modified proteins, secondly by using alternative methods to increase half-life \nin vivo.\n Stabilisation of the protein drug can therefore be carried out by choosing an inherently stable protein scaffold and providing methods to bind such scaffold to plasma proteins which occur in high concentrations, such as immunoglobulins or albumin. Binding to plasma protein can be an effective means to improving the pharmacokinetic properties of molecules in general. More precisely, binding to albumin to improve the half-life of proteins has been described: \nM.S. Dennis et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 33, 2383-90, 2002\n) isolated peptides having affinity for serum albumin. When bound to a Fab molecule, half-lives comparable to pegylated Fab's were obtained. Peptide ligands having affinity for IgG or serum albumin have been disclosed (\n \nWO 01/45746\n \n). Cemu Bioteknik (\n \nNygren, Wigzell, Uhlen, EP 486525 B1\n \n; \n \nUS 6,267,964\n \n) described fusions of active proteins or peptides to polypeptides from bacterial origin that bind to serum albumin (e.g. Staph A). The drawback of these peptide-based approaches is that the peptides have to fold properly and be accessible to binding to serum albumin when fused to the therapeutic protein. Therefore, these peptides are inherently unstable and have affinities in the submicromolar range rather than subnanomolar or low nanomolar range, as is the case with conventional antibodies. As part of a larger protein, such as a conventional antibody molecule, binding of these peptides to albumin may be sterically hindered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative hybrid molecule with two functional units is based on a heterospecific antibody. Such a hybrid would consist of a bifunctional or heterospecific antibody construct with one entity having specificity and affinity for the target, the second entity having specificity and affinity for a serum protein, such as albumin. However, such heterospecific constructs based on conventional antibodies or Fab fragments have several important drawbacks: these are complex, large molecules composed of two polypeptide chains (VH and VL) and therefore difficult and expensive to produce in high amounts in mammalian expression systems. Furthermore, producing bifunctional antibodies composed of 4 chains (2 VH's and 2 VL's) have the inherent risk of resulting in molecules with the unproductive VH-VL combinations and consequent loss of activity. Several alternatives have been tried with mixed results based on peptide derivatives of conventional antibodies, such as diabodies and bifunctional scFv's (\n \nWO0220615\n \n; \n \nWO9413804\n \n; \n \nWO9119739\n \n; \n \nWO9409131\n \n) .\nHolliger et al (Nature Biotech. 15, 632-636, 1979\n) suggests that binding one of the antibody fragments of a diabody (bispecific construct derived from a conventional antibody) to serum immunoglobulin (IgG) may prolong serum residence time of such diabodies but no suggestion is made that bispecific diabodies may be stabilised using antibodies against a serum protein other than serum IgG. Diabodies are known to be inherently difficult to produce due to stickiness of their exposed surface and due to non-productive associations between the four different V-regions (2 VH+2 VL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCovalent binding to serum proteins as disclosed in, for example, \n \nEP0793506B1\n \n, \n \nUS 5,612,034\n \n, \n \n6,103,233\n \n, and \n \nUS20020009441\n \n using reactive groups forming stable covalent bonds to a serum protein or a cell have the inherent disadvantage of unwanted target modification through the reactive groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusions to large, long lived proteins such as albumin (\nSyed et al, Blood 89, 3243-3252 (1997\n), \nYeh et al, PNAS 89, 1904-1908 (1992\n); Celltech (\n \nWO0027435\n \n)) or N-terminal fusions of albumin polypeptides (Delta Biotech/HGS, \n \nUS 5,380,712\n \n, \n \nUS 5,766,883\n \n) or the Fc portion of IgG (\nCapon et al, Nature 337, 525-531(1989\n); \nAshkenazi et al, Curr. Op.Immunol. 9, 195-200 (1997\n)) have been described. Such fusions have the disadvantage of inefficient production and causing unwanted immunological reactions .\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA complex of interferon with a monoclonal antibody to increase the serum half-life of interferon has been described in \n \nUS 5,055,289\n \n. Such approach has the inherent risk of impairing the biological activity of the interferon since the size of the construct raises the problem of steric hindrance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nEP 095 221 A\n \n describes heterospecific antibodies. Camel-derived single immunoglobulin variable domains have been described in \n \nWO 99/23221\n \n and \nConrath et al. (J. Biochem. 276 (10), p. 7346\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nTHE AIMS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is an aim of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising therapeutic heterospecific antibody polypeptide constructs which overcome the problems of therapeutic antibodies of the art namely, low half-life \nin vivo,\n poor folding, low expression, and poor stability. It is a further aim of the present invention to provide methods for providing said heterospecific antibodies.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for use in therapy comprising:\n\n \n \n \none or more Camelidae VHH or humanized Camelidae VHH each directed against a serum protein of a subject, and\n \none or more single domain antibodies each directed against a therapeutic and/or diagnostic target\n \n\nand a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle\n\ncharacterized in that it is administered by inhalation.\n    \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, wherein the single domain antibodies directed against a target molecule are anti-IgE single domain antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, which is formulated in the form a nasal spray (e.g. aerosol), inhaler, pump-type sprayer or aerosol sprayer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, which is a lyophilized VHH formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, comprising a solid carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, wherein the solid carrier is selected from talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica and alumina.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, comprising a liquid carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, wherein the liquid carrier is selected from water, hydroxyalkyls, glycols and water-alcohol/glycol blends.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, wherein the single domain antibodies are single domain antibodies derived from a conventional 4-chain antibody (VH) or derived from a heavy chain antibody naturally devoid of light chain (VHH).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, wherein the single domain antibody is humanized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, wherein\n\n \n \n \nthe number of anti-target single domain antibodies is at least two, and\n \nat least two anti-target single domain antibodies do not share the same sequence, or all anti-target single domain antibodies share the same sequence.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, wherein the single domain antibodies that are directed against a target have the same sequence or wherein at least two anti-target single domain antibodies have a different sequence but are directed against the same epitopes or different epitopes on the same target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, wherein\n\n \n \n \nthe number of anti-serum protein single domain antibodies is at least two, and\n \nat least two anti-serum protein single domain antibodies do not share the same sequence, or all anti-serum protein single domain antibodies share the same sequence.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, wherein the single domain antibodies that are directed against a serum protein have the same sequence or wherein at least two anti-serum protein single domain antibodies have a different sequence but are directed against the same epitopes or different epitopes on the same serum protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, wherein the serum protein is selected from serum albumin, serum immunoglobulins, thyroxine-binding protein, transferrin and, fibrinogen or fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition according to the above, wherein the anti-serum protein single domain antibody corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 4 and 28 to 40;

Examples include, but are not limited to, heavy chain antibodies, antibodies naturally devoid of light chains, single domain antibodies derived from conventional 4-chain antibodies, engineered antibodies and single domain scaffolds other than those derived from antibodies. Single domain antibodies may be any of the art, or any future single domain antibodies. Single domain antibodies may be derived from any species including, but not limited to mouse, human, camel, llama, goat, rabbit, bovine. According to one aspect of the invention, a single domain antibody as used herein is a naturally occurring single domain antibody known as heavy chain antibody devoid of light chains. Such single domain antibodies are disclosed in \n \nWO 9404678\n \n for example. For clarity reasons, this variable domain derived from a heavy chain antibody naturally devoid of light chain is known herein as a VHH or nanobody to distinguish it from the conventional VH of four chain immunoglobulins. Such a VHH molecule can be derived from antibodies raised in \nCamelidae\n species, for example in camel, dromedary, alpaca and guanaco. Other species besides \nCamelidae\n may produce heavy chain antibodies naturally devoid of light chain; such VHHs are within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe one or more single domain antibodies of the polypeptide construct which are directed against a target may be of the same sequence. Alternatively they may not all have the same sequence. It is within the scope of the invention that a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprises anti-target single domain antibodies which do not all share the same sequence, but which are directed against the same target, or fragment thereof, one or more antigens thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso described are methods for the utilization of a plurality of anti-target and /or anti-serum protein single domain antibodies to increase the avidity and/or affinity of the heterospecific molecule. In this manner, serum half-lives of molecules modified in accordance with the description can be extended. Such modification will modify and/or extend the therapeutic window of a specific therapeutic molecule. This flexibility cannot be achieved with alternative methods in the art, such as when using peptides with specificity to serum proteins, diabodies which are difficult to produce in a multivalent form, chemical modifications (such as pegylation, acylation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe one or more single domain antibodies of the polypeptide construct which are directed against a serum protein may be of the same sequence. Alternatively they may not all have the same sequence. It is within the scope of the invention that a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprises anti-serum protein single domain antibodies which do not all share the same sequence, but which are directed against serum protein, or fragment thereof, one or more antigens thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, one or more anti-target single domain antibodies of the polypeptide construct may be directed to more than one target (\ne.g\n. vWF and collagen). Similarly, the anti-serum protein single domain antibodies of the polypeptide construct may be directed against more than one serum protein (\ne.g\n. serum albumin and fibrinogen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVHHs, according to the present invention, and as known to the skilled addressee are heavy chain variable domains derived from immunoglobulins naturally devoid of light chains such as those derived from \nCamelids\n as described in \n \nW09404678\n \n (and referred to hereinafter as VHH domains or nanobodies). VHH molecules are about 10x smaller than IgG molecules. They are single polypeptides and very stable, resisting extreme pH and temperature conditions. Moreover, they are resistant to the action of proteases which is not the case for conventional antibodies. Furthermore, \nin vitro\n expression of VHHs produces high yield, properly folded functional VHHs. In addition, antibodies generated in \nCamelids\n will recognize epitopes other than those recognised by antibodies generated \nin vitro\n through the use of antibody libraries or via immunisation of mammals other than \nCamelids\n (\n \nWO 9749805\n \n). As such, anti-albumin VHH's may interact in a more efficient way with serum albumin which is known to be a carrier protein, As a carrier protein some of the epitopes of serum albumin may be inaccessible by bound proteins, peptides and small chemical compounds. Since VHH's are known to bind into 'unusual' or non-conventional epitopes such as cavities (\n \nWO9749805\n \n), the affinity of such VHH's to circulating albumin may be increased.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to the finding that a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more VHHs directed against one or more serum proteins of a subject, and one or more VHHs directed against one or more target molecule of said subject surprisingly has significantly prolonged half-life in the circulation of said subject compared with the half-life of the anti-target VHH when not part of said construct. Furthermore, such prolonged half-life is in the range of several days due to the high affinity anti-serum albumin VHH's compared to several hours when using low affinity peptides specific for albumin (\nDennis et al, JBC, 277, 35035\n). The extension of the half-life is demonstrated by the inventors herein, for example, in Example 16, and by the polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NO: 5. Furthermore, the said construct was found to exhibit the same favourable properties of VHHs such as high stability remaining intact in mice for at least 19 days (Example 16), extreme pH resistance, high temperature stability and high target affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA target is any biological substance capable of binding to a heterospecific polypeptide construct of the invention. Targets may be, for example, proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, oligonucleic acids, saccharides, polysaccharides, glycoproteins. Examples include, but are not limited to therapeutic targets, diagnostic targets, receptors, receptor ligands, viral coat proteins, immune system proteins, hormones, enzymes, antigens, cell signaling proteins, or a fragment thereof. Targets may be native protein or a fragment thereof, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, or a functional portion of an homologous sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe properties of single domain antibodies, in particular VHHs, compare favourably with those of antibodies derived from sources such as mouse, sheep, goat, rabbit etc. (\ni.e\n. traditional antibodies), and humanised derivatives thereof. Traditional antibodies are not stable at room temperature, and have to be refrigerated for preparation and storage, requiring necessary refrigerated laboratory equipment, storage and transport, which contribute towards time and expense. Refrigeration is sometimes not feasible in developing countries. Furthermore, the manufacture or small-scale production of said antibodies is expensive because the mammalian cellular systems necessary for the expression of intact and active antibodies require high levels of support in terms of time and equipment, and yields are very low. Furthermore, traditional antibodies have a binding activity which depends upon pH, and hence are unsuitable for use in environments outside the usual physiological pH range such as, for example, in treating gastric bleeding, gastric surgery. Furthermore, traditional antibodies are unstable at low or high pH and hence are not suitable for oral administration. However, it has been demonstrated that VHHs resist harsh conditions, such as extreme pH, denaturing reagents and high temperatures (\nEwert S et al, Biochemistry 2002 Mar 19;41 (11):3628-36\n), so making them suitable for delivery by oral administration. Furthermore, traditional antibodies have a binding activity which depends upon temperature, and hence are unsuitable for use in assays or kits performed at temperatures outside biologically active-temperature ranges (\ne.g\n. 37 ± 20°C).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore VHHs are more soluble, meaning they may be stored and/or administered in higher concentrations compared with conventional antibodies. The polypeptides of the present invention also retain binding activity at a pH and temperature outside those of usual physiological ranges, which means they may be useful in situations of extreme pH and temperature which require a modulation of platelet-mediated aggregation, such as in gastric surgery, control of gastric bleeding, assays performed at room temperature etc. The polypeptides of the present invention also exhibit a prolonged stability at extremes of pH, meaning they would be suitable for delivery by oral administration. The polypeptides of the present invention may be cost-effectively produced through fermentation in convenient recombinant host organisms such as \nEscherichia coli\n and yeast; unlike conventional antibodies which also require expensive mammalian cell culture facilities, achievable levels of expression are high. Examples of yields of the polypeptides of the present invention are 1 to 10 mg/ml (\nE\n. \ncoli\n) and up to 1g/l (yeast). The polypeptides of the present invention also exhibit high binding affinity for a broad range of different antigen types, and ability to bind to epitopes not recognised by conventional antibodies; for example they display long CDR-based loop structures with the potential to penetrate into cavities and exhibit enzyme function inhibition. Furthermore, since binding often occurs through the CDR3 loop only, it is envisaged that peptides derived from CDR3 could be used therapeutically (\nDesmyter et al., J Biol Chem, 2001, 276: 26285-90\n). The polypeptides of the invention are also able to retain full binding capacity as fusion protein with an enzyme or toxin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more VHHs each directed against one or more serum proteins of a subject, and one or more VHH each directed against one or more target molecules wherein the VHHs belong to the traditional class of \nCamelidae\n single domain heavy chain antibodies. The present invention also relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more VHH each directed against one or more serums protein of a subject, and one or more VHH each directed against one or more target molecules wherein the VHHs belong to a class of \nCamelidae\n single domain heavy chain antibodies that have human-like sequences. A VHH sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 12 which binds to TNF-alpha and a second VHH which binds to mouse albumin, belongs to this class of VHH peptides. As such, peptides belonging to this class show a high amino acid sequence homology to human VH framework regions and said peptides might be administered to patients directly without expectation of an unwanted immune response therefrom, and without the burden of further humanization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA human-like class of \nCamelidae\n single domain antibodies represented by SEQ ID No.1, 3 and 4 have been described in \n \nWO03035694\n \n and contain the hydrophobic FR2 residues typically found in conventional antibodies of human origin or from other species, but compensating this loss in hydrophilicity by other substitutions at position 103 that substitutes the conserved tryptophan residue present in VH from double-chain antibodies. As such, peptides belonging to these two classes show a high amino acid sequence homology to human VH framework regions and said peptides might be administered to a human directly without expectation of an unwanted immune response therefrom, and without the burden of further humanisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, one aspect of the present invention allows for the direct administration of an anti-serum albumin polypeptide, wherein the single domain antibodies belong to the humanized class of VHH, and comprise a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3 or 4 to a patient in need of the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA subject as used herein is any mammal having a circulatory system in which the fluid therein comprises serum proteins. Examples of circulatory system include blood and lymphatic systems. Examples of animals include, but are not limited to, rabbits, humans, goats, mice, rats, cows, calves, camels, llamas, monkeys, donkeys, guinea pigs, chickens, sheep, dogs, cats, horses etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising at least one single domain antibody directed against a therapeutic target, and at least one single domain antibodies each directed against one or more serum proteins or polypeptides. As already mentioned, the anti-target single domain antibodies may have the same sequence. Alternatively, at least two anti-target single domain antibodies may have the different sequences, but are directed against the same epitope or different epitopes on the same target, fragments thereof, or antigen thereof. Similarly, the anti-serum protein single domain antibodies may have the same sequence. Alternatively, at least two anti-serum protein single domain antibodies may have the different sequences, but are directed against the same epitope or different epitopes on the same serum protein, fragments thereof, or antigen thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, where more than one anti-target single domain antibodies is present in the heterospecific polypeptide construct, each anti-target single domain antibody may be directed to a different target (\ne.g\n. one to vWF and one to collagen). Similarly, where more than one anti-serum protein single domain antibody is present, each anti-serum single domain antibody may be directed to a different serum protein (\ne.g\n. one to serum albumin and one to fibrinogen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the invention, is a heterospecific polypeptide, wherein an anti-serum protein single domain antibody corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs:1 to 4 and 28 to 40.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe constructs disclosed herein retain the advantageous properties of single domain antibodies (\ne.g\n. VHHs) and have a prolonged lifetime in the circulation of an individual. Thus, such constructs are able to circulate in the subject's serum for several days, reducing the frequency of treatment, the inconvenience to the subject and resulting in a decreased cost of treatment. Furthermore, it is an aspect of the invention that the half-life of the heterospecific polypeptide constructs may be controlled by the number of anti-serum protein single domain antibodies present in the construct. A controllable half-life is desirable in several circumstances, for example, in the application of a timed dose of a therapeutic heterospecific polypeptide construct, or to obtain a desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to an aspect of the invention a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a homologous sequence of a full-length heterospecific polypeptide construct. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a full-length heterospecific polypeptide construct. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a homologous sequence of a full-length heterospecific polypeptide construct. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a homologous sequence of a full-length heterospecific polypeptide construct. According to an aspect of the invention a heterospecific polypeptide construct may comprise a sequence of a heterospecific polypeptide construct.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to an aspect of the invention a single domain antibody used to form a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a complete single domain antibody (\ne.g\n. a VHH) or a homologous sequence thereof. According to another aspect of the invention, a single domain antibody used to form the heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a complete single domain antibody. According to another aspect of the invention, a single domain antibody used to form the heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a homologous sequence of a complete single domain antibody. According to another aspect of the invention, a single domain antibody used to form the heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a homologous sequence of a complete single domain antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA heterospecific polypeptide construct may be an homologous sequence of the parent sequence. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion parent sequence. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a homologous sequence of the parent sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an homologous sequence may comprise additions, deletions or substitutions of one or more amino acids, which do not substantially alter the functional characteristics of the polypeptides of the invention. The number of amino acid deletions or substitutions is preferably up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 or 70 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA homologous sequence of the present invention may include a single domain antibody of the invention which has been humanised.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy humanised is meant mutated so that immunogenicity upon administration in human patients is minor or nonexistent. Humanising a single domain antibody, according to the present invention, comprises a step of replacing one or more of amino acids by their human counterpart as found in the human consensus sequence, without that polypeptide losing its typical character, \ni.e\n. the humanisation does not significantly affect the antigen binding capacity of the resulting polypeptide. Such methods are known by the skilled addressee. A humanisation technique applied to \nCamelidae\n VHHs may also be performed by a method comprising the replacement of any of the following residues either alone or in combination: some VHH contain typical \nCamelidae\n hallmark residues at position 37, 44, 45 and 47 with hydrophilic characteristics. Replacement of the hydrophilic residues by human hydrophobic residues at positions 44 and 45 (E44G and R45L) did not have an effect on binding and/or inhibition. Further humanization may be required by substitution of residues in \nFR\n 1 , such as \n \nposition\n \n 1, 5, 28 and 30; FR3, such as positions 74, 75, 76, 83, 84, 93 and 94; and FR4, such as position 103, 104, 108 and 111 (all numbering according to the Kabat).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment is a method for humanizing a VHH comprising the steps of replacing of any of the following residues either alone or in combination:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFR1 position\n \n 1, 5, 28 and 30,\n \nthe hallmark amino acid at position 44 and 45 in FR2,\n \nFR3 residues 74, 75, 76, 83, 84, 93 and 94,\n \nand positions 103, 104, 108 and 111 in FR4 ;\n \n\n(numbering according to the Kabat numbering).\n    \n \n \n \nSome \nCamelidae\n VHH sequences display a high sequence homology to human VH framework regions and therefore said VHH might be administered to patients directly without expectation of an immune response therefrom, and without the additional burden of humanisation. Therefore, one aspect of the present invention allows for the formation of a heterospecific polypeptide construct without humanisation of the VHH, when said VHH exhibit high homology to human VH framework regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA homologous sequence of the present invention may be a sequence of the invention derived from another species such as, for example, camel, llama, dromedary, alpaca, guanaco etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere homologous sequence indicates sequence identity, it means a sequence which presents a high sequence identity (more than 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 98% sequence identity) with a single domain antibody of the invention, and is preferably characterised by similar properties of the parent sequence, namely affinity, said identity calculated using known methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA homologous sequence may refer to nucleotide sequences of more than 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800 or 1000 nucleotides able to hybridise to the reverse-complement of the nucleotide sequence capable of encoding a native sequence under stringent hybridisation conditions (such as the ones described by \nSAMBROOK et al., Molecular Cloning, Laboratory Manuel, Cold Spring, Harbor Laboratory press, New York\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a functional portion refers to a single domain antibody of sufficient length such that the interaction of interest is maintained with affinity of 1 x 10\n-6\n M or better.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively a functional portion of a single domain antibody of the invention comprises a partial deletion of the complete amino acid sequence and still maintains the binding site(s) and protein domain(s) necessary for the binding of and interaction with the target or serum protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a functional portion of a single domain antibody of the invention refers to less than 100% of the sequence (\ne.g\n., 99%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, etc.), but comprising 5 or more amino acids or 15 or more nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA portion of a single domain antibody of the invention refers to less than 100% of the sequence (\ne.g\n., 99%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, etc.), but comprising 5 or more amino acids or 15 or more nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTargets as mentioned herein such as TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma receptor, serum proteins (\ne.g\n. serum albumin, serum immunoglobulins, thyroxine-binding protein, transferrin, fibrinogen) and IFN-gamma may be fragments of said targets. Thus a target is also a fragment of said target, capable of eliciting an immune response. A target is also a fragment of said target, capable of binding to a single domain antibody raised against the full length target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fragment as used herein refers to less than 100% of the sequence (e.g., 99%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% etc.), but comprising 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or more amino acids. A fragment is of sufficient length such that the interaction of interest is maintained with affinity of 1 x 10\n-6\n M or better.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fragment as used herein also refers to optional insertions, deletions and substitutions of one or more amino acids which do not substantially alter the ability of the target to bind to a single domain antibody raised against the wild-type target. The number of amino acid insertions deletions or substitutions is preferably up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 or 70 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe serum protein may be any suitable protein found in the serum of subject, or fragment thereof. In one aspect of the invention, the serum protein is serum albumin, serum immunoglobulins, thyroxine-binding protein, transferrin, or fibrinogen. Depending on the intended use such as the required half-life for effective treatment and/or compartimentalisation of the target antigen, the VHH-partner can be directed to one of the above serum proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA single domain antibody directed against a target means single domain antibody that it is capable of binding to its target with an affinity of better than 10\n-6\n M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heterospecific polypeptide constructs disclosed herein may be made by the skilled artisan according to methods known in the art or any future method. For example, VHHs may be obtained using methods known in the art such as by immunising a camel and obtaining hybridomas therefrom, or by cloning a library of single domain antibodies using molecular biology techniques known in the art and subsequent selection by using phage display.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-serum protein single domain antibody may be directed against a polypeptide of a serum protein or a whole protein. The anti-target single domain antibody may be directed against a polypeptide of said target of the whole target. Methods for scanning a protein for immunogenic polypeptides are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe single domain antibodies may be joined using methods known in the art or any future method. For example, they may be fused by chemical cross-linking by reacting amino acid residues with an organic derivatising agent such as described by \nBlattler et al, \n; \n \nEP294703\n \n. Alternatively, the single domain antibody may be fused genetically at the DNA level \ni.e\n. a polynucleotide construct formed which encodes the complete polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies and one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies. A method for producing bivalent or multivalent VHH polypeptide constructs is disclosed in \n \nPCT patent application WO 96/34103\n \n. One way of joining multiple single domain antibodies is via the genetic route by linking single domain antibody coding sequences either directly or \nvia\n a peptide linker. For example, the C-terminal end of the first single domain antibody may be linked to the N-terminal end of the next single domain antibody. This linking mode can be extended in order to link additional single domain antibodies for the construction and production of tri-, tetra-, etc. functional constructs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is the administration of heterospecific polypeptide constructs according to the invention by inhalation which avoids the need for injection. Conventional antibody-based therapeutics have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity, however, they have one important drawback: these are complex, large molecules and therefore relatively unstable, and they are sensitive to breakdown by proteases. This means that conventional antibody drugs cannot be administered by inhalation because they are not resistant to the low pH at these sites, the action of proteases at these sites and in the blood and/or because of their large size. They have to be administered by injection (intravenously, subcutaneously, etc.) to overcome some of these problems. Administration by injection requires specialist training in order to use a hypodermic syringe or needle correctly and safely. It further requires sterile equipment, a liquid formulation of the therapeutic polypeptide, vial packing of said polypeptide in a sterile and stable form and, of the subject, a suitable site for entry of the needle. Furthermore, subjects commonly experience physical and psychological stress prior to and upon receiving an injection. The present invention overcomes these problems of the prior art, by providing the heterospecific polypeptides constructs in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Said constructs are sufficiently small, resistant and stable to be delivered by inhalation substantial without loss of activity. The heterospecific polypeptides constructs of the present invention avoid the need for injections, are not only cost/time savings, but are also more convenient and more comfortable for the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising at least one single domain antibody directed against a target comprising at least one single domain antibody directed against a target, for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound delivered to the nose, upper respiratory tract and/or lung by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a non-limiting example, a formulation according to the invention, comprises a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein directed against one or more targets in the form of a nasal spray (e.g. an aerosol) or inhaler. For administration by inhalation. Since the construct is small, it can reach its target much more effectively than therapeutic IgG molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by a therapeutic compound delivered to the upper respiratory tract and lung, by administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein wherein one or more single domain antibodies are specific for an antigen related to the disorder, by inhalation through the mouth or nose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a dispersible VHH composition, in particular dry powder dispersible VHH compositions, such as those described in \n \nUS 6514496\n \n. These dry powder compositions comprise a plurality of discrete dry particles with an average particle size in the range of 0.4-10 mm. Such powders are capable of being readily dispersed in an inhalation device. VHH's are particularly suited for such composition as lyophilized material can be readily dissolved (in the lung subsequent to being inhaled) due to its high solubilisation capacity (\nMuyldermans, S., Reviews in Molecular Biotechnology, 74, 277-303, (2001\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein for the preparation of a medicament for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound delivered to the nose, upper respiratory tract and/or lung by inhalation without being inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the nose, upper respiratory tract and lung, by administering to the nose, upper respiratory tract and/or lung of a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the nose, upper respiratory tract and/or lung by inhalation without being inactivated, by administering to the nose, upper respiratory tract and/or lung of a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the bloodstream of a subject without being inactivated by administering to the nose, upper respiratory tract and/or lung of a subject by inhalation a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct further comprises a carrier single domain antibody (e.g. VHH) which acts as an active transport carrier for transport said heterospecific polypeptide construct, the lung lumen to the blood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA polypeptide construct further comprising a carrier binds specifically to a receptor present on the mucosal surface (bronchial epithelial cells) resulting in the active transport of the polypeptide from the lung lumen to the blood. The carrier single domain antibody may be fused to the polypeptide construct. Such fusion constructs made using methods known in the art and are describe herein. The \"carrier\" single domain antibody binds specifically to a receptor on the mucosal surface which induces an active transfer through the surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect is a method to determine which single domain antibodies (e.g. VHHs) are actively transported into the bloodstream upon nasal administration. Similarly, a naive or immune VHH phage library can be administered nasally, and after different time points after administration, blood or organs can be isolated to rescue phages that have been actively transported to the bloodstream. A non-limiting example of a receptor for active transport from the lung lumen to the bloodstream is the Fc receptor N (FcRn). One aspect of the invention includes the VHH molecules identified by the method. Such VHH can then be used as a carrier VHH for the delivery of a therapeutic VHH to the corresponding target in the bloodstream upon nasal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder requiring a therapeutic or diagnostic compound which is not rapidly cleared from the circulation. An aspect of the invention is the use of a said construct for the preparation of a medicament for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder requiring a therapeutic or diagnostic compound which is not rapidly cleared from the circulation. Another aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder requiring a therapeutic or diagnostic compound which is not rapidly cleared from the circulation by administering a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein to an individual. According to the present invention, the anti-target single domain antibody of said heterospecific polypeptide is directed against a target involved in a cause or a manifestation of said disorder, or involved in causing symptoms thereof. By using a heterospecific polypeptide construct of the present invention to treat or diagnose an aforementioned disorder, the depletion of said construct is retarded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder requiring a therapeutic or diagnostic compound which remains active in the circulation for extended periods of time. An aspect of the invention is the use of said construct for the preparation of a medicament for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder requiring a therapeutic or diagnostic compound which remains active in the circulation for extended periods of time. Another aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder requiring a therapeutic or diagnostic compound that is able to circulate in the patients serum for several days, by administering a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein to an individual. According to the present invention, the anti-target single domain antibody of said heterospecific polypeptide is directed against a target involved in a cause or a manifestation of said disorder, or involved in causing symptoms thereof. By using a heterospecific polypeptide construct of the present invention to treat or diagnose an aforementioned disorder, the frequency of treatment is reduced, so resulting in a decreased cost of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder relating to allergies. An aspect of the invention is the use of said construct for the preparation of a medicament for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder relating to allergies. Another aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder relating to allergies, by administering a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein to an individual. According to the present invention, the anti-target single domain antibody of said heterospecific polypeptide is directed against a target involved in a cause or a manifestation of said disorder, or involved in causing symptoms thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments of the invention also apply when an anti-serum single domain antibody of the aforementioned heterospecific polypeptide constructs corresponds to a sequence represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 4, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, or a homologous sequence of a functional portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments of the invention also apply when a heterospecific polypeptide construct of the invention corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 18, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, or a homologous sequence of a functional portion. Said sequences comprise an anti-TNF-alpha \nCamelidae\n VHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments of the invention also apply when an heterospecific polypeptide constructs of the invention corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 19 to 21 a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, or a homologous sequence of a functional portion. Said sequences comprise an anti-vWF \nCamelidae\n VHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments of the invention also apply when an heterospecific polypeptide constructs of the invention corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 22 to 24 a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof. Said sequences comprise an anti-IgE \nCamelidae\n VHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments of the invention also apply when an heterospecific polypeptide construct according to the invention corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs:25 to 27, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, or a homologous sequence of a functional portion. Said sequences comprise an anti-Interferon-gamma \nCamelidae\n VHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA non-limiting example, in relation to allergies, of a target against which an anti-target single domain antibody may be directed is IgE. During their lifetime, subjects can develop an allergic response to harmless parasites such as \nDermatophagoides pteronyssinus,\n the house dust mite or to substances such as clumps, plastics, metals. This results in an induction of IgE molecules that initiates a cascade of immunological responses. One aspect of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IgE single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies. In one aspect of the invention, said anti-IgE single domain antibodies prevents the interaction of IgE with their receptor(s) on mast cells and basophils, so blocking initiation of the immunological cascade and a subsequent allergic reaction. In another aspect an anti-serum protein single domain antibody is directed to one of the subject's serum proteins. A heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein thus reduces or prevents an allergic response due to common or unusual allergens. Furthermore, the construct has a prolonged lifetime in the blood so increasing the therapeutic window.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is believed to play an important role in various diseases, for example in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis. Both TNF-alpha and the receptors (CD120a, CD120b) have been studied in great detail. TNF-alpha in its bioactive form is a trimer and the groove formed by neighboring subunits is important for the cytokine-receptor interaction. Several strategies to antagonize the action of the cytokine have been developed and are currently used to treat various disease states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA TNF inhibitor which has sufficient specificity and selectivity to TNF may be an efficient prophylactic or therapeutic pharmaceutical compound for preventing or treating inflammatory diseases. However, it is extremely difficult and a lengthy process to develop a small chemical entitiy (NCE) with sufficient potency and selectivity to such target sequence. Antibody-based therapeutics on the other hand have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity. In addition, the development time can be reduced considerably when compared to the development of new chemical entities (NCE's). However, conventional antibodies are difficult to elicit against multimeric proteins where the receptor-binding domain of the ligand is embedded in a groove, as is the case with TNF-alpha.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heterospecific polypeptide constructs of the present invention, wherein the anti-target single domain antibody is directed against TNF-alpha overcome the problems experienced using peptide therapeutics of the art because of the properties such as stability, size, and reliable expressioin. Furthermore, the inventiors have found that, despite presence of a groove in multimeric TNF-alpha, the heterospecific polypeptide constructs are still able to achieve strong binding to TNF-alpha\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment is a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder mediated by inflammatory molecules. An aspect of the invention is the use of said construct for the preparation of a medicament for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder mediated by inflammatory molecules. Another aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder mediated by inflammatory molecules, by administering a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein to an individual. According to the present invention, an anti-target single domain antibody of said heterospecific polypeptide is directed against a target involved in a cause or a manifestation of said disorder, or involved in causing symptoms thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA target against which a single domain antibody of a heterospecific polypeptide construct is directed is tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is believed to play an important role in various disorders, for example in inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-target single domain antibodies may be directed against whole TNF-alpha or a fragment thereof, or a fragment of a homologous sequence thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibody fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibody, the sequences of said heterospecific polypeptide corresponding to any of SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 18. The anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies therein are derived from \nCamelidae\n heavy chain antibodies (VHHs), which bind to TNF-alpha.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of inflammatory disorders. TNF-alpha is involved in inflammatory processes, and the blocking of TNF-alpha action can have an anti-inflammatory effect, which is highly desirable in certain disorder states such as, for example, Crohn's disease. Oral delivery of these heterospecific polypeptide construct results in the delivery of such molecules in an active form in the colon at sites that are affected by the disorder. These sites are highly inflamed and contain TNF-alpha producing cells. These heterospecific polypeptide constructs can neutralise the TNF-alpha locally, avoiding distribution throughout the whole body and thus limiting negative side-effects. Genetically modified microorganisms such as \nMicrococcus lactis\n are able to secrete antibody fragments. Such modified microorganisms can be used as vehicles for local production and delivery of antibody fragments in the intestine. By using a strain which produces a TNF-alpha-neutralising heterospecific polypeptide construct, inflammatory bowel disorder could be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to inflammatory processes, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide construct is administered by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect is the use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to inflammatory processes, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide construct is administered by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a method of treating, preventing and/or alleviating disorders relating to inflammatory processes, comprising administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to inflammatory processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to inflammatory processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is an aspect of the invention that the anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies of the present invention may be derived from VHHs of any class. For example, they may be derived from a class of VHHs with high homology to the human VH sequence, or may be derived from any of the other classes of VHHs, including the major class of VHH. These VHHs include the full length \nCamelidae\n VHHs, domains and may comprise a human Fc domain if effector functions are needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 18, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof. SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 18 comprise anti-TNF alpha \nCamelidae\n VHH and anti-mouse serum albumin \nCamelidae\n VHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies wherein said anti-serum protein single domain antibodies correspond to any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 4 (anti-serum protein \nCamelidae\n VHHs), a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors have found that a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising a sequence corresponding to any of SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 18 surprisingly exhibits higher than expected affinity towards its target and prolonged half-life in the circulatory system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlatelet-mediated aggregation is the process wherein von Willebrand Factor (vWF)-bound collagen adheres to platelets and/or platelet receptors (examples of both are gpIa/IIa, gplb, or collagen), ultimately resulting in platelet activation. Platelet activation leads to fibrinogen binding, and finally to platelet aggregation. The ability to disrupt platelet-mediated aggregation has many applications including the treatment of disease as mentioned below. Since the heterospecific polypeptide constructs of the invention effective prevent clotting, and the half-life thereof is controllable, they may be used for surgical procedures, for example, which require an inhibition of platelet-mediated aggregation for a limited time period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonovalent single domain antibodies such as VHHs show surprisingly high platelet aggregation inhibition in experiments to measure platelet aggregation inhibition under high shear: 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation was obtained at a concentration between 4 and 25 nM. In comparison, the Fab fragment derived from a vWF-specific antibody inhibiting the interaction with collagen, 82D6A3, inhibits 50% of platelet aggregation at approximately a twenty-fold higher concentration (\nVanhoorelbeke K. et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2003, 278: 37815-37821\n). These results were unexpected given that the IC50 values for the monovalent VHH's are up to 225 times fold worse in ELISA then the IC50 value of the IgG of 82D6A3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis clearly shows that IgG antibodies is not suited to interaction with macromolecules which are starting, or are in the process of aggregating, such as those involved in platelet-mediated aggregation. vWF makes multimers of up to 60 monomers (final multimers of up to 20 million dalton in size). Indeed, it has been shown that not all A3 domains are accessible to 82D6A3 (\nDongmei WU, Blood, 2002, 99, 3623 to 3628\n). Furthermore the large size of conventional antibodies, would restrict tissue penetration, for example, during platelet-mediated aggregation at the site of a damaged vessel wall.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure of single domain antibodies, in particular is unique. For example VHH molecules derived from \nCamelidae\n antibodies are among the smallest intact antigen-binding domains known (approximately 15 kDa, or 10 times smaller than a conventional IgG) and hence are well suited towards delivery to dense tissues and for accessing the limited space between macromolecules participating in or starting the process of platelet mediated aggregation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that experiments show, that the small size of a VHH is advantageous over a large intact antibody for inhibition of interactions between such large macromolecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite the small size of nanobodies, and thus advantages for penetration, it is still surprising that such a small molecule can inhibit interactions between large polymers such as vWF (up to 60 monomers) and collagen and with such a high efficiency. It has been described that only the large multimeric forms of vWF are hemostatically active (\nFurlan, M,. 1996, Ann. Hematol. 72:341-348\n). Binding of multimeric vWF to collagen occurs with ~100-fold higher affinitythan binding of monomeric vWF fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results from the high shear experiments indicate that a lower dose will be needed for administration to patients. Therefore, fewer side effects are expected (such as immunogenicity or bleeding problems).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is an aspect to provide heterospecific polypeptide constructs which modulate processes which comprise platelet-mediated aggregation such as, for example, vWF-collagen binding, vWF-platelet receptor adhesion, collagen-platelet receptor adhesion, platelet activation, fibrinogen binding and/or platelet aggregation. Said heterospecific polypeptide constructs are derived from single domain antibodies directed towards vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains, gplb or collagen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-target single domain antibodies may be directed against whole vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains, gplb or collagen or a fragment thereof, or a fragment of a homologous sequence thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA target against which a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies is directed is von Willebrand factor (vWF). According to another aspect of the invention, the target is vWF A1 or A3 domains. According to another aspect of the invention, the target is gplb. According to another aspect of the invention, the target is gpla/IIA. According to another aspect of the invention, the target is collagen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-vWF single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein VHHs, the sequences of said heterospecific polypeptide corresponding to any of SEQ ID NOs: 19 to 21. The anti-vWF single domain antibodies therein are derived from \nCamelidae\n heavy chain antibodies (VHHs), which bind to vWF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies target, wherein the target is any of vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains, gplb or collagen for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders or conditions relating to platelet-mediated aggregation or dysfunction thereof.

For example, they may be derived from the class of VHHs with high homology to the human VH sequence, or may be derived from any of the other classes of VHHs, including the major class of VHH. These VHHs include the full length \nCamelidae\n VHHs, domains and may comprise a human Fc domain if effector functions are needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-vWF single domain antibodies wherein said heterospecific polypeptide corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 19 to 21, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof.

This results in the induction of IgE molecules that initiate a cascade of immunological responses. One aspect of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IgE single domain antibodies, said heterospecific polypeptide construct preventing the interaction of IgEs with their receptor(s) on mast cells and basophils.

Furthermore, the construct has a prolonged lifetime in the blood so increasing the therapeutic window.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is believed to play an important role in various disorders, for example in inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis and hyperimmune reactions in the eye. IFN-gamma has also been shown to play a significant role in the pathology of autoimmune diseases. For example, the presence of IFN-gamma has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (\nBrennan et al, Brit. J. Rheum., 31, 293-8 (1992\n)) . Several strategies to antagonize the action of these cytokines have been developed and are currently used to treat various disease states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIFN-gamma in its bioactive form is a dimer and the groove formed by the two subunits is important for its biological activity through interaction with the IFN-gamma receptor. An IFN-gamma inhibitor which has sufficient specificity and selectivity to IFN-gamma may be an efficient prophylactic or therapeutic pharmaceutical compound for preventing or treating inflammatory disorders. Diseases associated with IFN-gamma include multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis (\n \nUS6,333,032\n \n Advanced Biotherapy Concepts, Inc.). Other diseases include Crohn's disease and psoriasis (\n \nUS6,329,511\n \n Protein Design Labs). Yet other diseases are bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (\n \nEP0695189\n \n Genentech).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNone of the presently available drugs are completely effective for the treatment of autoimmune disease, and most are limited by severe toxicity. In addition, it is extremely difficult and a lengthy process to develop a new chemical entitiy (NCE) with sufficient potency and selectivity to such target sequence. Antibody-based therapeutics on the other hand have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity. In addition, the development time can be reduced considerably when compared to the development of new chemical entities (NCE's). However, conventional antibodies are difficult to raise against multimeric proteins where the receptor-binding domain of the ligand is embedded in a groove, as is the case with IFN-gamma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heterospecific polypeptide constructs of the present invention, wherein the anti-target single domain antibody is directed against TNF-alpha overcome the problems experienced using peptide therapeutics of the art because of the properties thereof such as stability, size, and reliable expression. Furthermore, the inventors have found that, despite presence of a groove in multimeric IFN-gamma, the heterospecific polypeptide constructs are still able to achieve strong binding to IFNA-gamma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, a target against which one or more anti-target single domain antibodies of a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies is directed is interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). IFN-gamma is secreted by some T cells. In addition to its anti-viral activity, IFN-gamma stimulates natural killer (NK) cells and T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and activates macrophages and stimulates the expression of MHC molecules on the surface of cells. Hence, IFN-gamma generally serves to enhance many aspects of immune function, and is a candidate for treatment of disorders where the immune system is over-active \ne.g\n. Crohn's disease, autoimmune disorders and organ plant rejection in addition inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IFN-gamma single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies, the sequences of said heterospecific polypeptide corresponding to any of SEQ ID NOs: 25 to 27.

As already mentioned above, methods for joining are known in the art or may be any future method, for example, they may be fused by chemical coupling, fused at the DNA level etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of one or more of the disorders mentioned herein generally involves administering to a subject a \"therapeutically effective amount\" of heterospecific polypeptide construct. By \"therapeutically effective amount\", \"therapeutically effective dose\" and \"effective amount\" means the amount needed to achieve the desired result or results. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognise that the potency and, therefore, an \"effective amount\" can vary for the various compounds that inhibit a disorder pathway used in the invention. One skilled in the art can readily assess the potency of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"compound\" refers to a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein, a polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 27, a homologous sequence thereof, or a homologue thereof, or a nucleic acid capable of encoding said polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material may be administered to an individual along with the compound without causing any undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the pharmaceutical composition in which it is contained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention disclosed herein is useful for treating or preventing a condition relating to a disorder as mentioned herein (\ne.g.\n allergy and/or inflammation), in a subject and comprising administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound or composition that binds to a component involved in the disorder pathway (e.g. to IgE and/or TNF-alpha in the blood stream), so inhibiting the disorder pathway and the disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention is the use of compounds of the invention for treating or preventing a condition relating to a disorder as mentioned herein (\ne.g.\n allergy and/or inflammation), in a subject and comprising administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound in combination with another, such as, for example, aspirin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is not limited to the administration of formulations comprising a single compound of the invention. It is within the scope of the invention to provide combination treatments wherein a formulation is administered to a patient in need thereof that comprises more than one compound of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well known in the art how to determine the inhibition of a disorder pathway using the standard tests described herein, or using other similar tests. Preferably, the method would result in at least a 10% reduction in an indicator of the disorder, including, for example, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%,60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, or any amount in between, more preferably by 90%. For example, an inhibition of an allergic pathway by inhibition of IgE by a peptide of the invention might result in a 10% reduction in food-specific IgE levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound useful in the present invention are formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient or any animal in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, \ni,e.\n, by inhalation. .\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the present invention can also be administered using gene therapy methods of delivery. See, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,399,346\n \n, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Using a gene therapy method of delivery, primary cells transfected with the gene for the compound of the present invention can additionally be transfected with tissue specific promoters to target specific organs, tissue, grafts, tumors, or cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful dosages of the compound can be determined by comparing their \nin vitro\n activity, and \nin vivo\n activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the concentration of the compound(s) in a liquid composition, will be from about 0.1-25 wt-%, preferably from about 0.5-10 wt-%. The concentration in a semisolid or solid composition such as a powder will be about 0.1-5 wt-%, preferably about 0.5-2.5 wt-%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. Also the dosage of the compound varies depending on the target cell, tumor, tissue, graft, or organ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator. .\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn administration regimen could include long-term, daily treatment. By \"long-term\" is meant at least two weeks and preferably, several weeks, months, or years of duration. Necessary modifications in this dosage range may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein. See \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Martin, E.W., ed. 4), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA\n. The dosage can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1: Immunization of llamas\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOne Ilama was immunized with human serum albumin (HSA). The immunization scheme is summarized in Table 1.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2: Repertoire cloning\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPeripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were isolated by centrifugation on a density gradient (Ficoll-Paque Plus Amersham Biosciences). PBLs were used to extract total RNA (Chomczynski and Sacchi 1987). cDNA was prepared on 100 µg total RNA with MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (Gibco BRL) using oligo d(T) oligonucleotides. The cDNA was purified with a phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by an ethanol precipitation and subsequently used as template to amplify the VHH repertoire.\n\nIn a frst PCR, the repertoire of both conventional (1.6 kb). and heavy-chain (1.3 kb) antibody gene segments were amplified using a leader specific primer (5' - GGCTGAGCTCGGTGGTCCTGGCT- 3') (SEQ ID N° 41) and the oligo d(T) primer (5'-AACTGGAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCAGGAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3') (SEQ ID N° 42). The resulting DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and the 1.3 kb fragment, encoding heavy-chain antibody segments was purified from the agarose gel. A second PCR was performed using a mixture of FR1 reverse primers and the same oligo d(T) forward primer. The PCR products were digested with \nSfi\nI (introduced in the FR1 primer) and \nBstE\nII (naturally occurring in FR4). Following gel electrophoresis, the DNA fragment of approximately 400 basepairs were purified from gel and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of phagemid pAX004 to obtain a library of cloned VHHs after etectroporation of \nEscherichia coli\n TG1. The size of the library was 1.4 x 10\n7\n cfu, and all clones contained insert of the correct size.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 3: Rescue of the library, phage preparation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe library was grown at 37°C in 10 ml 2xTY medium containing 2% glucose, and 100 µg/ml ampicillin, until the OD600nm reached 0.5. M13KO7 phages (10\n12\n) were added and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 x 30 minutes, first without shaking, then with shaking at 100 rpm. Cells were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4500 rpm at room temperature. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 2xTY medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 25 µg/ml kanamycin, and incubated overnight at 37°C with vigorously shaking at 250 rpm. The overnight cultures were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4°C. Phages were PEG precipitated (20% poly-ethylene-glycol and 1.5 M NaCl) and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 10,000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml PBS. Phages were again PEG precipitated and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 20,000 rpm and 4°C. The pellet was dissolved in 5 ml PBS-1% casein. Phages were titrated by infection of TG1 cells at OD600nm= 0.5 and plating on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. The number of transformants indicates the number of phages (= pfu). The phages were stored at -80°C with 15% glycerol.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 4: Phage ELISA\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate (Maxisorp) was coated overnight at 4°C with PBS-1 % casein or with 5 µg/ml HSA (human serum albumin). The plate was washed 3 times with PBS-Tween (0.05% Tween20) and blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with 200 µl PBS-1% casein. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween. Phages were prepared as described above and applied to the wells in consecutive twofold dilutions. Plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween. Bound phage were detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody anti-M13 conjugated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP) diluted 1/2000 in PBS. The plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween. Staining was performed with ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2\n and signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. Results are shown in \nFigure 1\n and indicate the presence of HSA-specific nanobodies in the library.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5: Selection: first and second round of biopanning\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA well in a microtiterplate was coated with 10 µg/ml mouse serum albumin (MSA), or with PBS containing 1% casein. After overnight incubation at 4°C, the wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% casein, for 3 hours at room temperature (RT). 200 µl phages was added to the wells. After 2 hours incubation at RT, the wells were washed 10x with PBS-Tween and 10x with PBS. Bound phages were eluted with 100 µl 0.2 M glycin buffer pH= 2.4. Elutions were performed for 20 minutes at room temperature. Eluted phages were allowed to infect exponentially growing E.Coli TG1 cells, and were then plated on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. A second round was performed with the same conditions as described above. Results are summarized in Table 2.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 6: Screening of individual clones after biopanning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nELISA: binding to human serum albumin (HSA) and mouse serum albumin (MSA)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA single colony was used to start an overnight culture in LB containing 2% glucose and 100 g/ml ampicillin. This overnight culture was diluted 100-fold in TB medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin, and incubated at 37°C until OD600nm= 0.5. 1 mM IPTG was added and the culture was incubated for 3 more hours at 37°C or overnight at 28°C. Cultures were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4°C. The pellet was frozen overnight or for 1 hour at -20°C. Next, the pellet was thawed at room temperature for 40 minutes, re-suspended in PBS and shaken on ice for 1 hour. Periplasmic fraction was isolated by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 4°C at 20,000 rpm. The supernatant containing the VHH was used for further analysis.\n\nA microtiter plate was coated with 5 µg/ml HSA, with 5 µg/ml mouse serum albumin (MSA) or with PBS-1% casein, overnight at 4°C. Plates were blocked for two hours at room temperature with 300 \nµl\n 1% casein in PBS. The plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween. Periplasmic fraction was prepared for 23 individual clones after the first and second round of selection, and allowed to bind to the wells of the microtiterplate. Plates were washed six times with PBS-Tween, after which binding of nanobody was detected by incubation with mouse anti-Histidine monoclonal antibody Serotec MCA 1396 (1/1000 dilution) in PBS for 1 hour at RT followed by anti-mouse-\nalkaline phosphatase conjugate\n 1/2000 in PBS, also for 1 hour at RT. Staining was performed with the substrate PNPP (p-nitrophenyl-phosphate, 2 mg/ml in 1 M diethanolamine, 1mM Mg\n2\nSO\n4\n, pH9.8) and the signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. Results are summarized in Table 3.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 7: Hinfl patern and sequencing\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA PCR was performed on positive clones after the second round of panning, with a set of primers binding to a sequence in the vector. The PCR product was digested with the restriction enzyme Hinfl and loaded on a agarose gel. 4 clones were selected with a different Hinfl-pattern for further evaluation. Those clones were sequenced, and results are summarized in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 1, 2 ,3 and 4).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 8: Test cross-reactivity with albumin of different species\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA SDS-PAGE was run for plasma (1/10 dilution) from different species (baboon, pig, hamster, human, rat. mouse and rabbit) and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. Phages were prepared for \nclones MSA\n 21, \nMSA\n 24, \nMSA\n 210, MSA212 and a control nanobody as described in Example 3. Phages were allowed to bind to the nitrocellulose blotted serum albumins and unbound phages were washed away. Binding was detected with an anti-M13 polyclonal antibody coupled to HRP. DAP was used as a substrate for detection. Results are shown in \nFigure 2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom these results we can conclude that all 4 binders are cross-reactive between pig, human, mouse (less for MSA212) and hamster serum albumin. \nMSA\n 21 is also cross-reactive with rabbit serum albumin. With the irrelevant nanobody no binding was observed (not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a control experiment, a SDS-PAGE was run with the different plasma samples diluted 1/100 in PBS. The gel was stained with coomassie. We can conclude from \nFigure 3\n that albumin levels in all plasma samples are high except for rabbit plasma, with low levels of albumin.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 9: Expression and purification\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmid was prepared for the binders and was transformed into WK6 electrocompetent cells. A single colony was used to start an overnight culture in LB containing 2% glucose and 100 µg/ml ampicillin. This overnight culture was diluted 100-fold in 300 ml TB medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin, and incubated at 37°C until OD600nm= 0.5. 1 mM IPTG was added and the culture was incubated for 3 more hours at 37°C or overnight at 28°C.\n\nCultures were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4°C. The pellet was frozen overnight or for 1 hour at -20°C. Next, the pellet was thawed at room temperature for 40 minutes, re-suspended in 20 ml PBS and shaken on ice for 1 hour. Periplasmic fraction was isolated by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 4°C at 20,000 rpm. The supernatant containing the nanobody was loaded on Ni-NTA and purified to homogeneity.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 10: ELISA on MSA of the purified nanobodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiterplate was coated with 5 µg/ml MSA overnight at 4C. After washing, the plate was blocked for 2 hours at RT with PBS-1 % casein. Samples were applied in duplicate starting at a concentration of 2500 nM at 1/3 dilutions and allowed to bind for 2 hours at RT. A polyclonal rabbit anti-nanobody serum was added at 1/1000 (K208) for one hour at RT. Detection was with anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate at 1/1000 and staining with PNPP as described in Example 6. Results are shown in \nFigure 4\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 11: Construction of bispecific constructs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe \nE. coli\n production vector pAX11 was constructed to allow the two-step cloning of bivalent or bispecific VHH (\nFigure 5\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe carboxy terminal VHH was cloned first with PstI and BstEII, while in the second step the other VHH was inserted by Sfil and NotI, which do not cut within the first gene fragment. The procedure avoids the enforcement of new sites by amplification and thus the risk of introducing PCR errors. The middle hinge of llama was used as a linker between the nanobodies. A VHH against human TNF alpha was cloned at the COOH terminal of MSA specific nanobodies. Sequences are summarized in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 5, 6, 7 and 8). Plasmid was prepared and was transformed into WK6 electrocompetent cells. A single colony was used to start an overnight culture in LB containing 2% glucose and 100 µg/ml ampicillin. This overnight culture was diluted 100-fold in 300 µl TB medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin, and incubated at 37°C until OD600nm= 0.5. 1 mM IPTG was added and the culture was incubated for 3 more hours at 37°C.\n\nCultures were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4°C. The pellet was frozen overnight at -20C. The next morning, the pellet was thawed in the cold room for 40 minutes, re-suspended in 20 ml PBS and shaken on ice for 1 hour. Periplasmic fraction was isolated by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 4°C at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was loaded on Ni-NTA and purified to homogeneity. Sequences are shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 5, 6, 7 and 8). A extra purification step was needed to remove some degradation product (5%) on gelfiltration.\n\nAnother bispecific VHH against human TNF-alpha (MP7 12b) is listed in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 15, 16,17 and 18).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 12: Test bispecific construct in sandwich ELISA\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated with 5 µg/ml MSA overnight at 4°C. Plates were blocked for two hours at room temperature with 300 \nµl\n 1% casein in PBS. The plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween. Purified protein for the bispecific constructs was allowed to bind to the wells of the microtiterplate at a concentration of 0.4, 0.5, 2.5 and 2.5 µg/ml for MSA21, MSA24, MSA210 and MSA212 respectively. Plates were washed six times with PBS-Tween, Biotinilated TNF was added at a concentration of 10 µg/ml and diluted 3 fold, and allowed to bind for 2 hours at room temperature. Binding was detected by incubation with mouse extravidin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) 1/2000 in PBS, for 1 hour at RT. Staining was performed with the substrate PNPP (p-nitrophenyl-phosphate, 2 mg/ml in 1 M diethanolamine, 1 mM Mg\n2\nSO\n4\n, pH9.8) and the signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. Results are shown in \nFigure 6\n and indicate that the bispecific construct can bind both antigens simultaneously.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 13: Determine affinity of albumin binders in BIACORE\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAffinities for mouse albumin were determined in BIACORE by immobilization of mouse albumin on a CM5 BIAcore chip using EDC-NHS covalent coupling and are summarized in Table 5. The results indicate that the affinity for albumin is retained in the bispecific construct.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 14: Optimization of ELISA in plasma or blood\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPharamcokinetic experiments were initiated to compare half life in mice of the TNF-alpha binder TNF3E with MSA21/VHH#3E and MSA24/ VHH#3E. Therefore our ELISA had to be optimized to obtain low background values when the samples are in blood or in plasma. A microtiterplate was coated with neutravidin. After overnight incubation at 4C, the plates were washed and blocked for 2 hours at RT with PBS-1% casein. 1 µg/ml biotinylated TNF-alpha was allowed to bind for 30 minutes at RT and the plate was washed. Samples (monovalent VHH#3E and MSA21/VHH#3E) were applied starting at a concentration of 1 µg/ml, diluted in PBS, 10% plasma or 10% blood and allowed to bind for 2 hours. After washing the plates, a rabbit antiserum was added at a dilution of 1/2000 either recognizing the heavy chain class (K208) or recognizing the conventional class (URL49). After 1 hour incubation, the plates were washed and an anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate was added (Sigma) at a dilution of 1/1000. After 1 hour incubation at RT, plates were washed and binding was detected with substrate. Results are shown in \nFigure 7\n. The results clearly show that background values with the rabbit antisera (K208 and URL49) are very low when the samples are diluted in 10% blood or 10% plasma as compared to PBS. The URL49 antiserum only recognizes the MSA21/VHH#3E bispecific nanobody and not monovalent VHH#3E, therefore, this antiserum can be used to test the integrity of our bispecific nanobody upon administration to the mice.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 15: Large scale expression and purification of VHH#3E, MSA21NHH#3E and MSA24/VHH#3E for pharmacokinetic studies in mice\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n3 liter culture was started for monovalent TNF3E and for bispecific MSA21NHH#3E or MSA24NHH#3E and purified as described in Example 11. An extra purification step was needed for the removal of endotoxins. Therefore, samples were purified on a Polymyxin column (BIO-RAD). Samples were analyzed for bacterial endotoxin concentration with the LAL-assay (Limulus Amebocyte Lysate, Bio Whittaker). Results are summarized in Table 6.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 16: Pharmacokinetics in mice\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n9 mice (CB57/B16) for each construct were injected intravenously in the tail with 100 µg nanobody. Blood was retrieved at different time points (3 mice per time point) and serum was prepared. Samples were analyzed by ELISA for the presence of monovalent or bispecific nanobody as described in example 14. K208 was also compared to URL49 for the bispecific constructs to verify the integrity of the molecule. Results are shown in \nFigures 8 to 11\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe can conclude from the results that the half life of the monovalent nanobody (40-45 minutes) is dramatically improved by making a bispecific nanobody with specificity for albumin MSA21NHH#3E and MSA24NHH#3E (half-life 2.5 to 3 days). The bispecific nanobody MSA21/VHH#3E remains intact even after 19 days in the mice as shown in ELISA with URL49 (\nFigure 11\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 17: Further extension of half-life of nanobodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to increase the half-life of MSA21/TNF3E and MSA24/TNF3E even further, a trivalent nanobody was prepared by fusing the bivalent MSA21-MSA21 construct to target-specific nanobody TNF3E. The resulting MSA21/MSA21/TNF3E (Table 7, and SEQ ID NO: 9) was tested \nin vivo\n according to the method of Example 16.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 18: Immunization of Ilama002\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n1 Ilama was immunized with vWF. The immunization scheme is summarized in Table 7.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 19: Repertoire cloning and phage preparation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe library was prepared as described in Example 2. The size of the library was 1.4 x 10\n7\n cfu, and >90% of the clones contained insert of the correct size. Phages were prepared as described in Example 3.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 20: Selection for binders for vWF inhibiting the interaction with collagen: first and second round of panning\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA well in a microtiterplate was coated with 2 µg/ml vWF or with PBS containing 1% casein. After overnight incubation at 4°C, the wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% casein, for 3 hours at RT. 200 µl phages was added to the wells. After 2 hours incubation at RT, the wells were washed 10x with PBS-Tween and 10x with PBS. Phages were specifically eluted with 100 µl of 100 µg/ml collagen type III. Elutions were performed for overnight at room temperature. Eluted phages were allowed to infect exponentially growing TG1 cells, and were then plated on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. This experiment was repeated for a second round of panning, under the same conditions as described above. The results from the panning are presented in Tables 8 and 9.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 21: Functional characterization of vWF binders: Inhibition of binding of vWF to collagen by VHH\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated overnight at 4°C with collagen type III at 25 µg/ml in PBS. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween and blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with PBS containing 1% casein. The plate was washed five times with PBS-tween. 100 µl of 2 µg/ml vWF (vWF is pre-incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes) was mixed with 20 µl periplasmic extract containing a VHH antibody (described in Example 6) and incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature in the wells of the microtiterplate. The plate was washed five times with PBS-tween. An anti-vWF-HRP monoclonal antibody (DAKO) was diluted 3,000-fold in PBS and incubated for 1 hour. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween and vWF-binding was detected with ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2\n. Signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. The results are presented in Table 10, showing that inhibitors are obtained after the first and second round of panning.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 22: Expression and purification of VHH\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein was prepared and purified as described in Example 9.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 23: ELISA: binding to vWF\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated with 2 µg/ml vWF, overnight at 4°C. Plates were blocked for two hours at room temperature with 300 \nµl\n 1% casein in PBS. The plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween. Dilution series of all purified samples were incubated for 2 hours at RT. Plates were washed six times with PBS-Tween, after which binding of VHH was detected by incubation with \nmouse anti-myc mAB\n 1/2000 in PBS for 1 hour at RT followed by anti-mouse-\nHRP conjugate\n 1/1000 in PBS, also for 1 hour at RT. Staining was performed with the substrate ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2\n and the signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. The binding as a function of concentration of purified VHH is indicated in \nFigure 12\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 24: Inhibition ELISA with purified VHH\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition ELISA was performed as described in Example 20 but with decreasing concentrations of VHH and with human plasma at a dilution of 1/60 instead of with purified vWF. Results are represented in \nFigure 13\n. The concentration of VHH resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50) is given in table 10.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 25: Construction and sequence of bispecific constructs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBispecific constructs were prepared with the first VHH specific for albumin (MSA21) and the second VHH specific for vWF. Constructs were made as described in Example 11. Sequences are shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 19 to 21)\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 26: Expression and purification of bispecific constructs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein was expressed and purified as described in Example 9. An extra purification step was needed on superdex 75 for removal of some monovalent degradation product (5-10%).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 27: Functionality of both VHHs in the bispecific construct\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiterplate was coated with 5 µg/ml mouse serum albumin overnight at 4°C. After washing the plate, wells were blocked for 2 hours with PBS-1% casein. The bispecific proteins were allowed to bind to the wells for 2 hours at RT. After washing, human, dog and pig plasma was added at different dilutions and allowed to bind for 2 hours at RT. Binding of vWF was detected with anti-vWF-HRP from DAKO at 1/3000 dilution. Staining was performed with ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2\n. Results are shown in \nFigure 14\n and indicate that functionality of both VHHs is retained in the bispecific construct.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 28: Inhibition of binding of vWF to collagen by the bispecific constructs as compared to the monovalent VHHs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition for binding of vWF to collagen was tested for monovalent as compared to bispecific constructs as described in Example 20. IC50 values are summarized in Table 11. Results indicate that the inhibitory properties of the VHH are retained in the bispecific construct.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 29: Construction of a bispecific construct containing a VHH-CDR3 fragment fused to an anti-serum albumin VHH\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA functional portion, the CDR3 region of MP2F6SR, was amplified by using a sense primer located in the \nframework\n 4 region (F6 CRD3 Forward:CTGGCCCCAGAAGTCATACC) (SEQ ID N° 43) and an anti-sense primer located in the \nframework\n 3 region (F6 CDR3 Reverse primer:TGTGCATGTGCAGCAAACC) (SEQ ID N° 44).\n\nIn order to fuse the CDR-3 fragment with the anti-serum albumin VHH MSA-21, a second round PCR amplification was performed with following primers:\n\n \n \n \nF6 CDR3 Reverse primer Sfi1:\n \nGTCCTCGCAACTGCGGCCCAGCCGGCCTGTGCATGTGCAGCAAACC (SEQ ID N° 45)\n \nF6 CDR3 Forward primer Not1:\n \nGTCCTCGCAACTGCGCGGCCGCCTGGCCCCAGAAGTCATACC (SEQ ID N° 46)\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe PCR reactions was performed in 50 ml reaction volume using 50pmol of each primer. The reaction conditions for the primary PCR were 11 min at 94 °C, followed by 30/60/120 sec at 94/55172 °C for 30 cycles, and 5 min at 72°C. All reaction were performed wit 2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 mM dNTP and 1.25U AmpliTaq God DNA Polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Brussels, Belgium).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter cleavage of the VHH gene of MSA clones with restriction enzymes Pst1/BstEII the digested products were cloned in pAX11 to obtain clones with a VHH at the C-terminus of the multicloning site. The clones were examined by PCR using vector based primers. From clones yielding a 650 bp product, DNA was prepared and used as acceptor vector to clone the CDR3 of MP2F6SR after cleavage of the PCR product with restriction enzymes Sfi1/Not1 to allow N-terminal expression of CDR3 in fusion with a MSA VHH.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 30: Calculation of homologies between anti-target single domain antibodies of the invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe degree of amino acid sequence homology between anti-target single domain antibodies of the invention was calculated using the Bioedit Sequence Alignment Editor. The calculations indicate the proportion of identical residues between all of the sequences as they are aligned by ClustalW. (\nThompson, J.D., Higgins, D.G. and Gibson, T.J.

No. 60/425,073, filed Nov. 8, 2002, and U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/425,063, filed Nov. 8, 2002; all of the applications are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides heterospecific polypeptide constructs comprising one or more single domain antibodies, said constructs having improved stability in vivo and their use in diagnosis and therapy.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nPolypeptide therapeutics and in particular antibody-based therapeutics have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity. However, in order to be effective as therapeutic agent, their pharmacokinetic profile should be optimized. The majority of current antibody applications are for acute disorders. There are however significant opportunities to develop antibody therapeutics for chronic conditions. This will require large doses of protein over a long period of time. Since the cost of antibody production in mammalian cells is high, the development of traditional antibody therapeutics for these applications has been discouraged. An alternative approach has been to express fragments of antibodies such as Fab's or single-chain Fv's in microbial expression systems such as yeast and bacteria. These fragments however have very short circulation times in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the initial approaches to increase the circulation in the bloodstream of proteins and peptides were based on chemical modification, such as pegylation (U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337). Examples of such products are PEG-Intron, i.e. pegylated interferon alpha-2b for the treatment of HCV, and treatment of chronic disorder with PEG-modified antibodies (A. P Chapman, Adv. Drug Delivery Reviews (2002), 54, 531-545). Such chemical methods, however, suffer from a number of disadvantages, such as inactivation of the target protein or peptide due to the chemical modification of certain amino acid side chains, instability of the target protein/peptide during the chemical reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo overcome these limitations, alternative approaches have been developed, first of all by using non-conventional or modified proteins, secondly by using alternative methods to increase half-life in vivo. Stabilisation of the protein drug can therefore be carried out by choosing an inherently stable protein scaffold and providing methods to bind such scaffold to plasma proteins which occur in high concentrations, such as immunoglobulins or albumin. Binding to plasma protein can be an effective means to improving the pharmacokinetic properties of molecules in general. More precisely, binding to albumin to improve the half-life of proteins has been described: M. S. Dennis et al. (\nJ. Biol. Chem. \n33, 2383-90, 2002) isolated peptides having affinity for serum albumin. When bound to a Fab molecule, half-lives comparable to pegylated Fab's were obtained. Peptide ligands having affinity for IgG or serum albumin have been disclosed (WO 01/45746). Cemu Bioteknik (Nygren, Wigzell, Uhlen, EP 486525 B1; U.S. Pat. No. 6,267,964) described fusions of active proteins or peptides to polypeptides from bacterial origin that bind to serum albumin (e.g. \nStaph \nA). The drawback of these peptide-based approaches is that the peptides have to fold properly and be accessible to binding to serum albumin when fused to the therapeutic protein. Therefore, these peptides are inherently unstable and have affinities in the submicromolar range rather than subnanomolar or low nanomolar range, as is the case with conventional antibodies. As part of a larger protein, such as a conventional antibody molecule, binding of these peptides to albumin may be sterically hindered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative hybrid molecule with two functional units is based on a heterospecific antibody. Such a hybrid would consist of a bifunctional or heterospecific antibody construct with one entity having specificity and affinity for the target, the second entity having specificity and affinity for a serum protein, such as albumin. However, such heterospecific constructs based on conventional antibodies or Fab fragments have several important drawbacks: these are complex, large molecules composed of two polypeptide chains (VH and VL) and therefore difficult and expensive to produce in high amounts in mammalian expression systems. Furthermore, producing bifunctional antibodies composed of 4 chains (2 VH's and 2 VL's) have the inherent risk of resulting in molecules with the unproductive VH-VL combinations and consequent loss of activity. Several alternatives have been tried with mixed results based on peptide derivatives of conventional antibodies, such as diabodies and bifunctional scFv's (WO0220615; WO9413804; WO9119739; WO9409131). Holliger et al (Nature Biotech. 15, 632-636, 1979) suggests that binding one of the antibody fragments of a diabody (bispecific construct derived from a conventional antibody) to serum immunoglobulin (IgG) may prolong serum residence time of such diabodies but no suggestion is made that bispecific diabodies may be stabilised using antibodies against a serum protein other than serum IgG. Diabodies are known to be inherently difficult to produce due to stickiness of their exposed surface and due to non-productive associations between the four different V-regions (2 VH+2 VL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCovalent binding to serum proteins as disclosed in, for example, EP0793506B1, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,034, 6,103,233, and US20020009441 using reactive groups forming stable covalent bonds to a serum protein or a cell have the inherent disadvantage of unwanted target modification through the reactive groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusions to large, long lived proteins such as albumin (Syed et al, Blood 89, 3243-3252 (1997), Yeh et al, PNAS 89, 1904-1908 (1992); Celltech (WO0027435)) or N-terminal fusions of albumin polypeptides (Delta Biotech/HGS, U.S. Pat. No. 5,380,712, U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,883) or the Fc portion of IgG (Capon et al, Nature 337, 525-531 (1989); Ashkenazi et al, Curr. Op. Immunol. 9, 195-200 (1997)) have been described. Such fusions have the disadvantage of inefficient production and causing unwanted immunological reactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA complex of interferon with a monoclonal antibody to increase the serum half-life of interferon has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,055,289. Such approach has the inherent risk of impairing the biological activity of the interferon since the size of the construct raises the problem of steric hindrance.\n\n\n \nTHE AIMS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is an aim of the present invention to provide therapeutic heterospecific antibody polypeptide constructs which overcome the problems of therapeutic antibodies of the art namely, low half-life in vivo, poor folding, low expression, and poor stability.

Examples include, but are not limited to, heavy chain antibodies, antibodies naturally devoid of light chains, single domain antibodies derived from conventional 4-chain antibodies, engineered antibodies and single domain scaffolds other than those derived from antibodies. Single domain antibodies may be any of the art, or any future single domain antibodies. Single domain antibodies may be derived from any species including, but not limited to mouse, human, camel, llama, goat, rabbit, bovine. According to one aspect of the invention, a single domain antibody as used herein is a naturally occurring single domain antibody known as heavy chain antibody devoid of light chains. Such single domain antibodies are disclosed in WO 9404678 for example. For clarity reasons, this variable domain derived from a heavy chain antibody naturally devoid of light chain is known herein as a VHH or nanobody to distinguish it from the conventional VH of four chain immunoglobulins. Such a VHH molecule can be derived from antibodies raised in \nCamelidae \nspecies, for example in camel, dromedary, alpaca and guanaco. Other species besides \nCamelidae \nmay produce heavy chain antibodies naturally devoid of light chain; such VHHs are within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe one or more single domain antibodies of the polypeptide construct which are directed against a target may be of the same sequence. Alternatively they may not all have the same sequence. It is within the scope of the invention that a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprises anti-target single domain antibodies which do not all share the same sequence, but which are directed against the same target, or fragment thereof, one or more antigens thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention there are provided methods for the utilization of a plurality of anti-target and/or anti-serum protein single domain antibodies to increase the avidity and/or affinity of the heterospecific molecule. In this manner, serum half-lives of molecules modified in accordance with the invention can be extended. Such modification will modify and/or extend the therapeutic window of a specific therapeutic molecule. This flexibility cannot be achieved with alternative methods in the art, such as when using peptides with specificity to serum proteins, diabodies which are difficult to produce in a multivalent form, chemical modifications (such as pegylation, acylation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe one or more single domain antibodies of the polypeptide construct which are directed against a serum protein may be of the same sequence. Alternatively they may not all have the same sequence. It is within the scope of the invention that a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprises anti-serum protein single domain antibodies which do not all share the same sequence, but which are directed against serum protein, or fragment thereof, one or more antigens thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, one or more anti-target single domain antibodies of the polypeptide construct may be directed to more than one target (e.g. vWF and collagen). Similarly, the anti-serum protein single domain antibodies of the polypeptide construct may be directed against more than one serum protein (e.g. serum albumin and fibrinogen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVHHs, according to the present invention, and as known to the skilled addressee are heavy chain variable domains derived from immunoglobulins naturally devoid of light chains such as those derived from \nCamelids \nas described in WO9404678 (and referred to hereinafter as VHH domains or nanobodies). VHH molecules are about 10× smaller than IgG molecules. They are single polypeptides and very stable, resisting extreme pH and temperature conditions. Moreover, they are resistant to the action of proteases which is not the case for conventional antibodies. Furthermore, in vitro expression of VHHs produces high yield, properly folded functional VHHs. In addition, antibodies generated in \nCamelids \nwill recognize epitopes other than those recognised by antibodies generated in vitro through the use of antibody libraries or via immunisation of mammals other than \nCamelids \n(WO 9749805). As such, anti-albumin VHH's may interact in a more efficient way with serum albumin which is known to be a carrier protein. As a carrier protein some of the epitopes of serum albumin may be inaccessible by bound proteins, peptides and small chemical compounds. Since VHH's are known to bind into ‘unusual’ or non-conventional epitopes such as cavities (WO9749805), the affinity of such VHH's to circulating albumin may be increased.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to the finding that a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more VHHs directed against one or more serum proteins of a subject, and one or more VHHs directed against one or more target molecule of said subject surprisingly has significantly prolonged half-life in the circulation of said subject compared with the half-life of the anti-target VHH when not part of said construct. Furthermore, such prolonged half-life is in the range of several days due to the high affinity anti-serum albumin VHH's compared to several hours when using low affinity peptides specific for albumin (Dennis et al, JBC, 277, 35035). The extension of the half-life is demonstrated by the inventors herein, for example, in Example 16, and by the polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NO: 5. Furthermore, the said construct was found to exhibit the same favourable properties of VHHs such as high stability remaining intact in mice for at least 19 days (Example 16), extreme pH resistance, high temperature stability and high target affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA target according to the invention is any biological substance capable of binding to a heterospecific polypeptide construct of the invention. Targets may be, for example, proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, oligonucleic acids, saccharides, polysaccharides, glycoproteins. Examples include, but are not limited to therapeutic targets, diagnostic targets, receptors, receptor ligands, viral coat proteins, immune system proteins, hormones, enzymes, antigens, cell signaling proteins, or a fragment thereof. Targets may be native protein or a fragment thereof, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, or a functional portion of an homologous sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe properties of single domain antibodies, in particular VHHs, compare favourably with those of antibodies derived from sources such as mouse, sheep, goat, rabbit etc. (i.e. traditional antibodies), and humanised derivatives thereof. Traditional antibodies are not stable at room temperature, and have to be refrigerated for preparation and storage, requiring necessary refrigerated laboratory equipment, storage and transport, which contribute towards time and expense. Refrigeration is sometimes not feasible in developing countries. Furthermore, the manufacture or small-scale production of said antibodies is expensive because the mammalian cellular systems necessary for the expression of intact and active antibodies require high levels of support in terms of time and equipment, and yields are very low. Furthermore, traditional antibodies have a binding activity which depends upon pH, and hence are unsuitable for use in environments outside the usual physiological pH range such as, for example, in treating gastric bleeding, gastric surgery. Furthermore, traditional antibodies are unstable at low or high pH and hence are not suitable for oral administration. However, it has been demonstrated that VHHs resist harsh conditions, such as extreme pH, denaturing reagents and high temperatures (Ewert S et al, Biochemistry 2002 Mar. 19; 41(11):3628-36), so making them suitable for delivery by oral administration. Furthermore, traditional antibodies have a binding activity which depends upon temperature, and hence are unsuitable for use in assays or kits performed at temperatures outside biologically active-temperature ranges (e.g. 37±20° C.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore VHHs are more soluble, meaning they may be stored and/or administered in higher concentrations compared with conventional antibodies. The polypeptides of the present invention also retain binding activity at a pH and temperature outside those of usual physiological ranges, which means they may be useful in situations of extreme pH and temperature which require a modulation of platelet-mediated aggregation, such as in gastric surgery, control of gastric bleeding, assays performed at room temperature etc. The polypeptides of the present invention also exhibit a prolonged stability at extremes of pH, meaning they would be suitable for delivery by oral administration. The polypeptides of the present invention may be cost-effectively produced through fermentation in convenient recombinant host organisms such as \nEscherichia coli \nand yeast; unlike conventional antibodies which also require expensive mammalian cell culture facilities, achievable levels of expression are high. Examples of yields of the polypeptides of the present invention are 1 to 10 mg/ml (\nE. coli\n) and up to 1 g/l (yeast). The polypeptides of the present invention also exhibit high binding affinity for a broad range of different antigen types, and ability to bind to epitopes not recognised by conventional antibodies; for example they display long CDR-based loop structures with the potential to penetrate into cavities and exhibit enzyme function inhibition. Furthermore, since binding often occurs through the CDR3 loop only, it is envisaged that peptides derived from CDR3 could be used therapeutically (Desmyter et al., \nJ Biol Chem, \n2001, 276: 26285-90). The polypeptides of the invention are also able to retain full binding capacity as fusion protein with an enzyme or toxin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more VHHs each directed against one or more serum proteins of a subject, and one or more VHH each directed against one or more target molecules wherein the VHHs belong to the traditional class of \nCamelidae \nsingle domain heavy chain antibodies. The present invention also relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more VHH each directed against one or more serums protein of a subject, and one or more VHH each directed against one or more target molecules wherein the VHHs belong to a class of \nCamelidae \nsingle domain heavy chain antibodies that have human-like sequences. A VHH sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 12 which binds to TNF-alpha and a second VHH which binds to mouse albumin, belongs to this class of VHH peptides. As such, peptides belonging to this class show a high amino acid sequence homology to human VH framework regions and said peptides might be administered to patients directly without expectation of an unwanted immune response therefrom, and without the burden of further humanization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA human-like class of \nCamelidae \nsingle domain antibodies represented by SEQ ID No. 1, 3 and 4 have been described in WO03035694 and contain the hydrophobic FR2 residues typically found in conventional antibodies of human origin or from other species, but compensating this loss in hydrophilicity by other substitutions at position 103 that substitutes the conserved tryptophan residue present in VH from double-chain antibodies. As such, peptides belonging to these two classes show a high amino acid sequence homology to human VH framework regions and said peptides might be administered to a human directly without expectation of an unwanted immune response therefrom, and without the burden of further humanisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, one aspect of the present invention allows for the direct administration of an anti-serum albumin polypeptide, wherein the single domain antibodies belong to the humanized class of VHH, and comprise a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3 or 4 to a patient in need of the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA subject as used herein is any mammal having a circulatory system in which the fluid therein comprises serum proteins. Examples of circulatory system include blood and lymphatic systems. Examples of animals include, but are not limited to, rabbits, humans, goats, mice, rats, cows, calves, camels, llamas, monkeys, donkeys, guinea pigs, chickens, sheep, dogs, cats, horses etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising at least one single domain antibody directed against a therapeutic and/or diagnostic target, and at least one single domain antibodies each directed against one or more serum proteins or polypeptides. As already mentioned, the anti-target single domain antibodies may have the same sequence. Alternatively, at least two anti-target single domain antibodies may have the different sequences, but are directed against the same epitope or different epitopes on the same target, fragments thereof, or antigen thereof. Similarly, the anti-serum protein single domain antibodies may have the same sequence. Alternatively, at least two anti-serum protein single domain antibodies may have the different sequences, but are directed against the same epitope or different epitopes on the same serum protein, fragments thereof, or antigen thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, where more than one anti-target single domain antibodies is present in the heterospecific polypeptide construct, each anti-target single domain antibody may be directed to a different target (e.g. one to vWF and one to collagen). Similarly, where more than one anti-serum protein single domain antibody is present, each anti-serum single domain antibody may be directed to a different serum protein (e.g. one to serum albumin and one to fibrinogen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the invention, is a heterospecific polypeptide, wherein an anti-serum protein single domain antibody corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs:1 to 4 and 28 to 40.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe constructs disclosed herein retain the advantageous properties of single domain antibodies (e.g. VHHs) and have a prolonged lifetime in the circulation of an individual. Thus, such constructs are able to circulate in the subject's serum for several days, reducing the frequency of treatment, the inconvenience to the subject and resulting in a decreased cost of treatment. Furthermore, it is an aspect of the invention that the half-life of the heterospecific polypeptide constructs may be controlled by the number of anti-serum protein single domain antibodies present in the construct. A controllable half-life is desirable in several circumstances, for example, in the application of a timed dose of a therapeutic heterospecific polypeptide construct, or to obtain a desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to an aspect of the invention a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a homologous sequence of a full-length heterospecific polypeptide construct. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a full-length heterospecific polypeptide construct. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a homologous sequence of a full-length heterospecific polypeptide construct. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a homologous sequence of a full-length heterospecific polypeptide construct. According to an aspect of the invention a heterospecific polypeptide construct may comprise a sequence of a heterospecific polypeptide construct.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to an aspect of the invention a single domain antibody used to form a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a complete single domain antibody (e.g. a VHH) or a homologous sequence thereof. According to another aspect of the invention, a single domain antibody used to form the heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a complete single domain antibody. According to another aspect of the invention, a single domain antibody used to form the heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a homologous sequence of a complete single domain antibody. According to another aspect of the invention, a single domain antibody used to form the heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a homologous sequence of a complete single domain antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect of the invention a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be an homologous sequence of the parent sequence. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion parent sequence. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a homologous sequence of the parent sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an homologous sequence of the present invention may comprise additions, deletions or substitutions of one or more amino acids, which do not substantially alter the functional characteristics of the polypeptides of the invention. The number of amino acid deletions or substitutions is preferably up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 or 70 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA homologous sequence of the present invention may include a single domain antibody of the invention which has been humanised.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy humanised is meant mutated so that immunogenicity upon administration in human patients is minor or nonexistent. Humanising a single domain antibody, according to the present invention, comprises a step of replacing one or more of amino acids by their human counterpart as found in the human consensus sequence, without that polypeptide losing its typical character, i.e. the humanisation does not significantly affect the antigen binding capacity of the resulting polypeptide. Such methods are known by the skilled addressee. A humanisation technique applied to \nCamelidae \nVHHs may also be performed by a method comprising the replacement of any of the following residues either alone or in combination: some VHH contain typical \nCamelidae \nhallmark residues at position 37, 44, 45 and 47 with hydrophilic characteristics. Replacement of the hydrophilic residues by human hydrophobic residues at positions 44 and 45 (E44G and R45L) did not have an effect on binding and/or inhibition. Further humanization may be required by substitution of residues in \nFR\n 1, such as \n \nposition\n \n 1, 5, 28 and 30; FR3, such as positions 74, 75, 76, 83, 84, 93 and 94; and FR4, such as position 103, 104, 108 and 111 (all numbering according to the Kabat).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a method for humanizing a VHH comprising the steps of replacing of any of the following residues either alone or in combination:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFR1 position\n \n 1, 5, 28 and 30,\n \nthe hallmark amino acid at position 44 and 45 in FR2,\n \nFR3 residues 74, 75, 76, 83, 84, 93 and 94,\n \nand positions 103, 104, 108 and 111 in FR4;\n\n\n(numbering according to the Kabat numbering).\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nSome \nCamelidae \nVHH sequences display a high sequence homology to human VH framework regions and therefore said VHH might be administered to patients directly without expectation of an immune response therefrom, and without the additional burden of humanisation. Therefore, one aspect of the present invention allows for the formation of a heterospecific polypeptide construct without humanisation of the VHH, when said VHH exhibit high homology to human VH framework regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA homologous sequence of the present invention may be a sequence of the invention derived from another species such as, for example, camel, llama, dromedary, alpaca, guanaco etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere homologous sequence indicates sequence identity, it means a sequence which presents a high sequence identity (more than 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 98% sequence identity) with a single domain antibody of the invention, and is preferably characterised by similar properties of the parent sequence, namely affinity, said identity calculated using known methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA homologous sequence according to the present invention may refer to nucleotide sequences of more than 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800 or 1000 nucleotides able to hybridise to the reverse-complement of the nucleotide sequence capable of encoding a native sequence under stringent hybridisation conditions (such as the ones described by SAMBROOK et al., Molecular Cloning, Laboratory Manuel, Cold Spring, Harbor Laboratory press, New York).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a functional portion refers to a single domain antibody of sufficient length such that the interaction of interest is maintained with affinity of 1×10\n−6 \nM or better.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively a functional portion of a single domain antibody of the invention comprises a partial deletion of the complete amino acid sequence and still maintains the binding site(s) and protein domain(s) necessary for the binding of and interaction with the target or serum protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a functional portion of a single domain antibody of the invention refers to less than 100% of the sequence (e.g., 99%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, etc.), but comprising 5 or more amino acids or 15 or more nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA portion of a single domain antibody of the invention refers to less than 100% of the sequence (e.g., 99%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, etc.), but comprising 5 or more amino acids or 15 or more nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTargets as mentioned herein such as TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma receptor, serum proteins (e.g. serum albumin, serum immunoglobulins, thyroxine-binding protein, transferrin, fibrinogen) and IFN-gamma may be fragments of said targets. Thus a target is also a fragment of said target, capable of eliciting an immune response. A target is also a fragment of said target, capable of binding to a single domain antibody raised against the full length target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fragment as used herein refers to less than 100% of the sequence (e.g., 99%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% etc.), but comprising 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or more amino acids. A fragment is of sufficient length such that the interaction of interest is maintained with affinity of 1×10\n−6 \nM or better.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fragment as used herein also refers to optional insertions, deletions and substitutions of one or more amino acids which do not substantially alter the ability of the target to bind to a single domain antibody raised against the wild-type target. The number of amino acid insertions deletions or substitutions is preferably up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 or 70 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe serum protein may be any suitable protein found in the serum of subject, or fragment thereof. In one aspect of the invention, the serum protein is serum albumin, serum immunoglobulins, thyroxine-binding protein, transferrin, or fibrinogen. Depending on the intended use such as the required half-life for effective treatment and/or compartimentalisation of the target antigen, the VHH-partner can be directed to one of the above serum proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA single domain antibody directed against a target means single domain antibody that it is capable of binding to its target with an affinity of better than 10\n−6 \nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heterospecific polypeptide constructs disclosed herein may be made by the skilled artisan according to methods known in the art or any future method. For example, VHHs may be obtained using methods known in the art such as by immunising a camel and obtaining hybridomas therefrom, or by cloning a library of single domain antibodies using molecular biology techniques known in the art and subsequent selection by using phage display.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-serum protein single domain antibody may be directed against a polypeptide of a serum protein or a whole protein. The anti-target single domain antibody may be directed against a polypeptide of said target of the whole target. Methods for scanning a protein for immunogenic polypeptides are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe single domain antibodies may be joined using methods known in the art or any future method. For example, they may be fused by chemical cross-linking by reacting amino acid residues with an organic derivatising agent such as described by Blattler et al, \nBiochemistry\n 24, 1517-1524; EP294703. Alternatively, the single domain antibody may be fused genetically at the DNA level i.e. a polynucleotide construct formed which encodes the complete polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies and one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies. A method for producing bivalent or multivalent VHH polypeptide constructs is disclosed in PCT patent application WO 96/34103. One way of joining multiple single domain antibodies is via the genetic route by linking single domain antibody coding sequences either directly or via a peptide linker. For example, the C-terminal end of the first single domain antibody may be linked to the N-terminal end of the next single domain antibody. This linking mode can be extended in order to link additional single domain antibodies for the construction and production of tri-, tetra-, etc. functional constructs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the present invention is the administration of heterospecific polypeptide constructs according to the invention which avoids the need for injection. Conventional antibody-based therapeutics have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity, however, they have one important drawback: these are complex, large molecules and therefore relatively unstable, and they are sensitive to breakdown by proteases. This means that conventional antibody drugs cannot be administered orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation because they are not resistant to the low pH at these sites, the action of proteases at these sites and in the blood and/or because of their large size. They have to be administered by injection (intravenously, subcutaneously, etc.) to overcome some of these problems. Administration by injection requires specialist training in order to use a hypodermic syringe or needle correctly and safely. It further requires sterile equipment, a liquid formulation of the therapeutic polypeptide, vial packing of said polypeptide in a sterile and stable form and, of the subject, a suitable site for entry of the needle. Furthermore, subjects commonly experience physical and psychological stress prior to and upon receiving an injection. An aspect of the present invention overcomes these problems of the prior art, by providing the heterospecific polypeptides constructs of the present invention. Said constructs are sufficiently small, resistant and stable to be delivered orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation substantial without loss of activity. The heterospecific polypeptides constructs of the present invention avoid the need for injections, are not only cost/time savings, but are also more convenient and more comfortable for the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising at least one single domain antibody directed against a target for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound that is able pass through the gastric environment without being inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs known by persons skilled in the art, once in possession of said polypeptide construct, formulation technology may be applied to release a maximum amount of VHHs in the right location (in the stomach, in the colon, etc.). This method of delivery is important for treating, prevent and/or alleviate the symptoms of disorder whose targets that are located in the gut system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder susceptible to modulation by a therapeutic compound that is able pass through the gastric environment without being inactivated, by orally administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies specific for antigen related to the disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein for the preparation of a medicament for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound that is able pass through the gastric environment without being inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the gut system without being inactivated, by orally administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the bloodstream of a subject without being inactivated, by orally administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising at least one single domain antibody directed against a target herein for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound delivered to the vaginal and/or rectal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a non-limiting example, a formulation according to the invention comprises a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein comprising one or more VHHs directed against one or more targets in the form of a gel, cream, suppository, film, or in the form of a sponge or as a vaginal ring that slowly releases the active ingredient over time (such formulations are described in EP 707473, EP 684814, U.S. Pat. No. 5,629,001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by a therapeutic compound to the vaginal and/or rectal tract, by vaginally and/or rectally administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies specific for antigen related to the disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein for the preparation of a medicament for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound delivered to the vaginal and/or rectal tract without being inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the vaginal and/or rectal tract without being inactivated, by administering to the vaginal and/or rectal tract of a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the bloodstream of a subject without being inactivated, by administering to the vaginal and/or rectal tract of a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising at least one single domain antibody directed against a target comprising at least one single domain antibody directed against a target, for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound delivered to the nose, upper respiratory tract and/or lung.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a non-limiting example, a formulation according to the invention, comprises a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein directed against one or more targets in the form of a nasal spray (e.g. an aerosol) or inhaler. Since the construct is small, it can reach its target much more effectively than therapeutic IgG molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by a therapeutic compound delivered to the upper respiratory tract and lung, by administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein wherein one or more single domain antibodies are specific for an antigen related to the disorder, by inhalation through the mouth or nose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a dispersible VHH composition, in particular dry powder dispersible VHH compositions, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,514,496. These dry powder compositions comprise a plurality of discrete dry particles with an average particle size in the range of 0.4-10 mm. Such powders are capable of being readily dispersed in an inhalation device. VHH's are particularly suited for such composition as lyophilized material can be readily dissolved (in the lung subsequent to being inhaled) due to its high solubilisation capacity (Muyldermans, S., Reviews in Molecular Biotechnology, 74, 277-303, (2001)). Alternatively, such lyophilized VHH formulations can be reconstituted with a diluent to generate a stable reconstituted formulation suitable for subcutaneous administration.

During their lifetime, subjects can develop an allergic response to harmless parasites such as \nDermatophagoides pteronyssinus\n, the house dust mite or to substances such as clumps, plastics, metals. This results in an induction of IgE molecules that initiates a cascade of immunological responses. One aspect of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IgE single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies. In one aspect of the invention, said anti-IgE single domain antibodies prevents the interaction of IgE with their receptor(s) on mast cells and basophils, so blocking initiation of the immunological cascade and a subsequent allergic reaction. In another aspect an anti-serum protein single domain antibody is directed to one of the subject's serum proteins. A heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein thus reduces or prevents an allergic response due to common or unusual allergens. Furthermore, the construct has a prolonged lifetime in the blood so increasing the therapeutic window.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is believed to play an important role in various diseases, for example in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis. Both TNF-alpha and the receptors (CD120a, CD120b) have been studied in great detail. TNF-alpha in its bioactive form is a trimer and the groove formed by neighboring subunits is important for the cytokine-receptor interaction. Several strategies to antagonize the action of the cytokine have been developed and are currently used to treat various disease states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA TNF inhibitor which has sufficient specificity and selectivity to TNF may be an efficient prophylactic or therapeutic pharmaceutical compound for preventing or treating inflammatory diseases. However, it is extremely difficult and a lengthy process to develop a small chemical entity (NCE) with sufficient potency and selectivity to such target sequence. Antibody-based therapeutics on the other hand have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity. In addition, the development time can be reduced considerably when compared to the development of new chemical entities (NCE's). However, conventional antibodies are difficult to elicit against multimeric proteins where the receptor-binding domain of the ligand is embedded in a groove, as is the case with TNF-alpha.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heterospecific polypeptide constructs of the present invention, wherein the anti-target single domain antibody is directed against TNF-alpha overcome the problems experienced using peptide therapeutics of the art because of the properties such as stability, size, and reliable expression. Furthermore, the inventors have found that, despite presence of a groove in multimeric TNF-alpha, the heterospecific polypeptide constructs are still able to achieve strong binding to TNF-alpha.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder mediated by inflammatory molecules. An aspect of the invention is the use of said construct for the preparation of a medicament for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder mediated by inflammatory molecules. Another aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder mediated by inflammatory molecules, by administering a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein to an individual. According to the present invention, an anti-target single domain antibody of said heterospecific polypeptide is directed against a target involved in a cause or a manifestation of said disorder, or involved in causing symptoms thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, a target against which a single domain antibody of a heterospecific polypeptide construct is directed is tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is believed to play an important role in various disorders, for example in inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-target single domain antibodies may be directed against whole TNF-alpha or a fragment thereof, or a fragment of a homologous sequence thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibody fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibody, the sequences of said heterospecific polypeptide corresponding to any of SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 18. The anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies therein are derived from Camelidae heavy chain antibodies (VHHs), which bind to TNF-alpha.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of inflammatory disorders. TNF-alpha is involved in inflammatory processes, and the blocking of TNF-alpha action can have an anti-inflammatory effect, which is highly desirable in certain disorder states such as, for example, Crohn's disease. Oral delivery of these heterospecific polypeptide construct results in the delivery of such molecules in an active form in the colon at sites that are affected by the disorder. These sites are highly inflamed and contain TNF-alpha producing cells. These heterospecific polypeptide constructs can neutralise the TNF-alpha locally, avoiding distribution throughout the whole body and thus limiting negative side-effects. Genetically modified microorganisms such as \nMicrococcus lactis \nare able to secrete antibody fragments. Such modified microorganisms can be used as vehicles for local production and delivery of antibody fragments in the intestine. By using a strain which produces a TNF-alpha-neutralising heterospecific polypeptide construct, inflammatory bowel disorder could be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to inflammatory processes, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide construct is administered intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is the use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to inflammatory processes, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide construct is administered intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a method of treating, preventing and/or alleviating disorders relating to inflammatory processes, comprising administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to inflammatory processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to inflammatory processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is an aspect of the invention that the anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies of the present invention may be derived from VHHs of any class. For example, they may be derived from a class of VHHs with high homology to the human VH sequence, or may be derived from any of the other classes of VHHs, including the major class of VHH. These VHHs include the full length \nCamelidae \nVHHs, domains and may comprise a human Fc domain if effector functions are needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 18, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof. SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 18 comprise anti-TNF alpha \nCamelidae \nVHH and anti-mouse serum albumin \nCamelidae \nVHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies wherein said anti-serum protein single domain antibodies correspond to any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 4 (anti-serum protein \nCamelidae \nVHHs), a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors have found that a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising a sequence corresponding to any of SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 18 surprisingly exhibits higher than expected affinity towards its target and prolonged half-life in the circulatory system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlatelet-mediated aggregation is the process wherein von Willebrand Factor (vWF)-bound collagen adheres to platelets and/or platelet receptors (examples of both are gpIa/IIa, gpIb, or collagen), ultimately resulting in platelet activation. Platelet activation leads to fibrinogen binding, and finally to platelet aggregation. The ability to disrupt platelet-mediated aggregation has many applications including the treatment of disease as mentioned below. Since the heterospecific polypeptide constructs of the invention effective prevent clotting, and the half-life thereof is controllable, they may be used for surgical procedures, for example, which require an inhibition of platelet-mediated aggregation for a limited time period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonovalent single domain antibodies such as VHHs show surprisingly high platelet aggregation inhibition in experiments to measure platelet aggregation inhibition under high shear: 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation was obtained at a concentration between 4 and 25 nM. In comparison, the Fab fragment derived from a vWF-specific antibody inhibiting the interaction with collagen, 82D6A3, inhibits 50% of platelet aggregation at approximately a twenty-fold higher concentration (Vanhoorelbeke K. et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2003, 278: 37815-37821). These results were unexpected given that the IC50 values for the monovalent VHH's are up to 225 times fold worse in ELISA then the IC50 value of the IgG of 82D6A3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis clearly shows that IgG antibodies is not suited to interaction with macromolecules which are starting, or are in the process of aggregating, such as those involved in platelet-mediated aggregation. vWF makes multimers of up to 60 monomers (final multimers of up to 20 million dalton in size). Indeed, it has been shown that not all A3 domains are accessible to 82D6A3 (Dongmei W U, Blood, 2002, 99, 3623 to 3628). Furthermore the large size of conventional antibodies, would restrict tissue penetration, for example, during platelet-mediated aggregation at the site of a damaged vessel wall.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure of single domain antibodies, in particular is unique. For example VHH molecules derived from \nCamelidae \nantibodies are among the smallest intact antigen-binding domains known (approximately 15 kDa, or 10 times smaller than a conventional IgG) and hence are well suited towards delivery to dense tissues and for accessing the limited space between macromolecules participating in or starting the process of platelet mediated aggregation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that experiments show, that the small size of a VHH is advantageous over a large intact antibody for inhibition of interactions between such large macromolecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite the small size of nanobodies, and thus advantages for penetration, it is still surprising that such a small molecule can inhibit interactions between large polymers such as vWF (up to 60 monomers) and collagen and with such a high efficiency. It has been described that only the large multimeric forms of vWF are hemostatically active (Furlan, M. 1996\n, Ann. Hematol. \n72:341-348). Binding of multimeric vWF to collagen occurs with ˜100-fold higher affinity than binding of monomeric vWF fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results from the high shear experiments indicate that a lower dose will be needed for administration to patients. Therefore, fewer side effects are expected (such as immunogenicity or bleeding problems).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is an aspect of the present invention to provide heterospecific polypeptide constructs which modulate processes which comprise platelet-mediated aggregation such as, for example, vWF-collagen binding, vWF-platelet receptor adhesion, collagen-platelet receptor adhesion, platelet activation, fibrinogen binding and/or platelet aggregation. Said heterospecific polypeptide constructs are derived from single domain antibodies directed towards vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains, gpIb or collagen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-target single domain antibodies may be directed against whole vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains, gpIb or collagen or a fragment thereof, or a fragment of a homologous sequence thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, a target against which a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies is directed is von Willebrand factor (vWF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect of the invention, the target is vWF A1 or A3 domains. According to another aspect of the invention, the target is gpIb. According to another aspect of the invention, the target is gpIa/IIA. According to another aspect of the invention, the target is collagen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-vWF single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein VHHs, the sequences of said heterospecific polypeptide corresponding to any of SEQ ID NOs: 19 to 21.

For example, they may be derived from the class of VHHs with high homology to the human VH sequence, or may be derived from any of the other classes of VHHs, including the major class of VHH. These VHHs include the full length \nCamelidae \nVHHs, domains and may comprise a human Fc domain if effector functions are needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-vWF single domain antibodies wherein said heterospecific polypeptide corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 19 to 21, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof. SEQ ID NOs: 19 to 21 comprise anti-vWF VHH and anti-mouse serum albumin VHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies, wherein the target is any of vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains, gpIb or collagen and wherein said anti-serum protein single domain antibodies correspond to any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 4, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring their lifetime, subjects may develop an allergic response to harmless parasites (e.g. \nDermatophagoides pteronyssinus\n, house dust mite) or substances (clumps, plastics, metals). This results in the induction of IgE molecules that initiate a cascade of immunological responses. One aspect of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IgE single domain antibodies, said heterospecific polypeptide construct preventing the interaction of IgEs with their receptor(s) on mast cells and basophils. As such they prevent the initiation of the immunological cascade, an allergic reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, a target against which a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies is directed is IgE.

Said disorders comprise a wide range of IgE-mediated diseases such as hay fever, asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic skin reactions, allergic eye reactions and food allergies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IgE single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to allergies, wherein said VHH is administered intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is the use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IgE single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to allergies, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide construct is administered intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a method of treating, preventing and/or alleviating disorders relating to allergies, comprising administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IgE single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IgE single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to allergies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IgE single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to allergies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is an aspect of the invention that the anti-IgE single domain antibodies of the present invention may be derived from VHHs of any class. For example, they may be derived from a class of VHHs with high homology to the human VH sequence, or may be derived from any of the other classes of VHHs, including the major class of VHH. Said VHHs may be derived from \nCamelidae\n. These VHHs include the full length \nCamelidae \nVHHs, domains and may comprise a human Fc domain if effector functions are needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IgE single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies, wherein the heterospecific polypeptides correspond to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 22 to 24, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof. SEQ ID NOs: 22 to 24 comprise anti-IgE \nCamelidae \nVHH and anti-mouse serum albumin \nCamelidae \nVHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IgE single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies wherein said anti-serum protein single domain antibodies correspond to any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 4 (anti-protein serum \nCamelidae \nVHHs), a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein prevents thus reduces or prevents an allergic response due to common or unusual allergens. Furthermore, the construct has a prolonged lifetime in the blood so increasing the therapeutic window. Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is believed to play an important role in various disorders, for example in inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis and hyperimmune reactions in the eye. IFN-gamma has also been shown to play a significant role in the pathology of autoimmune diseases. For example, the presence of IFN-gamma has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (Brennan et al, Brit. J. Rheum., 31, 293-8 (1992)). Several strategies to antagonize the action of these cytokines have been developed and are currently used to treat various disease states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIFN-gamma in its bioactive form is a dimer and the groove formed by the two subunits is important for its biological activity through interaction with the IFN-gamma receptor. An IFN-gamma inhibitor which has sufficient specificity and selectivity to IFN-gamma may be an efficient prophylactic or therapeutic pharmaceutical compound for preventing or treating inflammatory disorders. Diseases associated with IFN-gamma include multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis (U.S. Pat. No. 6,333,032 Advanced Biotherapy Concepts, Inc.). Other diseases include Crohn's disease and psoriasis (U.S. Pat. No. 6,329,511 Protein Design Labs). Yet other diseases are bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (EP0695189 Genentech).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNone of the presently available drugs are completely effective for the treatment of autoimmune disease, and most are limited by severe toxicity. In addition, it is extremely difficult and a lengthy process to develop a new chemical entity (NCE) with sufficient potency and selectivity to such target sequence. Antibody-based therapeutics on the other hand have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity. In addition, the development time can be reduced considerably when compared to the development of new chemical entities (NCE's). However, conventional antibodies are difficult to raise against multimeric proteins where the receptor-binding domain of the ligand is embedded in a groove, as is the case with IFN-gamma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heterospecific polypeptide constructs of the present invention, wherein the anti-target single domain antibody is directed against TNF-alpha overcome the problems experienced using peptide therapeutics of the art because of the properties thereof such as stability, size, and reliable expression. Furthermore, the inventors have found that, despite presence of a groove in multimeric IFN-gamma, the heterospecific polypeptide constructs are still able to achieve strong binding to IFNA-gamma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, a target against which one or more anti-target single domain antibodies of a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies is directed is interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). IFN-gamma is secreted by some T cells. In addition to its anti-viral activity, IFN-gamma stimulates natural killer (NK) cells and T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and activates macrophages and stimulates the expression of MHC molecules on the surface of cells. Hence, IFN-gamma generally serves to enhance many aspects of immune function, and is a candidate for treatment of disorders where the immune system is over-active e.g. Crohn's disease, autoimmune disorders and organ plant rejection in addition inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IFN-gamma single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies, the sequences of said heterospecific polypeptide corresponding to any of SEQ ID NOs: 25 to 27. The anti-IFN-gamma single domain antibodies therein are derived from Camelidae heavy chain antibodies (VHHs), which bind to IFN-gamma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-target single domain antibodies may be directed against whole IFN-gamma or a fragment thereof, or a fragment of a homologous sequence thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IFN-gamma single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of the disorders wherein the immune system is overactive, as mentioned above. Current therapy consists of intravenous administration of anti-IFN-gamma antibodies. Oral delivery of these heterospecific polypeptide constructs results in the delivery of such molecules in an active form in the colon at sites that are affected by the disorder. These sites are highly inflamed and contain IFN-gamma producing cells. These heterospecific polypeptide constructs can neutralise the IFN-gamma locally, avoiding distribution throughout the whole body and thus limiting negative side-effects. Genetically modified microorganisms such as \nMicrococcus lactis \nare able to secrete antibody fragments. Such modified microorganisms can be used as vehicles for local production and delivery of antibody fragments in the intestine. By using a strain which produces a IFN-gamma neutralising heterospecific polypeptide construct, inflammatory bowel disorder could be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IFN-gamma single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders wherein the immune system is overactive, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide construct is administered intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is the use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IFN-gamma single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders wherein the immune system is over active, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide construct is administered intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a method of treating, preventing and/or alleviating disorders wherein the immune system is overactive, comprising administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IFN-gamma single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IFN-gamma single domain antibodies joined to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders wherein the immune system is overactive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IFN-gamma single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders wherein the immune system is over active.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is an aspect of the invention that the anti-IFN-gamma single domain antibodies of the present invention may be derived from VHHs of any class. For example, they may be derived from a class of VHHs with high homology to the human VH sequence, or may be derived from any of the other classes of VHHs, including the major class of VHH. These VHHs include the full length \nCamelidae \nVHHs, domains and may comprise a human Fc domain if effector functions are needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspect and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IFN-gamma VHHs fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies wherein said heterospecific polypeptide corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 25 to 27, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion.

In one aspect of the invention, said nucleic acid encodes one or more single domain antibodies each directed to a therapeutic or diagnostic target antigen and one or more single domain antibodies directed to a serum protein, said single domain antibodies linked without intervening linkers, or with one or more peptide linker sequences. According to one aspect of the invention, a linker sequence is any suitable linker sequence known in the art. According to another aspect of the invention, a linker sequence is a naturally occurring sequence. Preferred properties of linkers sequences are that they are not immunogenic or not significantly immunogenic, they can provide sufficient flexibility to the heterospecific polypeptide construct, and are resistant to proteolytic degradation. An example of a linker according to the invention is that disclosed in PCT/EP96/01725 which is derived from the hinge region of VHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect of the invention, a clone comprises nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 4, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, or a homologous sequence of a functional portion, and nucleic acid encoding one or more anti-target single domain antibodies, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, or a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect of the invention, a clone comprises nucleic acid capable of encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs:5 to 27, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, or a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is within the scope of the invention that nucleic acid encoding multiple anti-target and/or multiple anti-serum VHHs are present in a clone of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy transforming a compatible host with a clone encoding a heterospecific polypeptide construct of the invention, the heterospecific polypeptide construct can be produced in sufficient quantities for use in therapy. Examples of organisms into which said clone may be transformed include, but are not limited to \nE. coli \nor \nSacchoromyces cerevisiae. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a method for prolonging the half-life of an anti-target-VHH comprising the step of joining thereto one or more anti-serum albumin single domain antibodies. As already mentioned above, methods for joining are known in the art or may be any future method, for example, they may be fused by chemical coupling, fused at the DNA level etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of one or more of the disorders mentioned herein generally involves administering to a subject a “therapeutically effective amount” of heterospecific polypeptide construct. By “therapeutically effective amount”, “therapeutically effective dose” and “effective amount” means the amount needed to achieve the desired result or results. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognise that the potency and, therefore, an “effective amount” can vary for the various compounds that inhibit a disorder pathway used in the invention. One skilled in the art can readily assess the potency of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “compound” refers to a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein, a polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 27, a homologous sequence thereof, or a homologue thereof, or a nucleic acid capable of encoding said polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “pharmaceutically acceptable” is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material may be administered to an individual along with the compound without causing any undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the pharmaceutical composition in which it is contained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention disclosed herein is useful for treating or preventing a condition relating to a disorder as mentioned herein (e.g. allergy and/or inflammation), in a subject and comprising administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound or composition that binds to a component involved in the disorder pathway (e.g. to IgE and/or TNF-alpha in the blood stream), so inhibiting the disorder pathway and the disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention is the use of compounds of the invention for treating or preventing a condition relating to a disorder as mentioned herein (e.g. allergy and/or inflammation), in a subject and comprising administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound in combination with another, such as, for example, aspirin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is not limited to the administration of formulations comprising a single compound of the invention. It is within the scope of the invention to provide combination treatments wherein a formulation is administered to a patient in need thereof that comprises more than one compound of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well known in the art how to determine the inhibition of a disorder pathway using the standard tests described herein, or using other similar tests. Preferably, the method would result in at least a 10% reduction in an indicator of the disorder, including, for example, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, or any amount in between, more preferably by 90%. For example, an inhibition of an allergic pathway by inhibition of IgE by a peptide of the invention might result in a 10% reduction in food-specific IgE levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound useful in the present invention can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient or any animal in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, i.e., orally or parenterally, by intranasally by inhalation, intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the present invention can also be administered using gene therapy methods of delivery. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,346, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Using a gene therapy method of delivery, primary cells transfected with the gene for the compound of the present invention can additionally be transfected with tissue specific promoters to target specific organs, tissue, grafts, tumors, or cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present compound may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compound may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form must be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical administration, the present compound may be applied in pure form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, hydroxyalkyls or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the present compound can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the compound to the skin are known to the art; for example, see Jacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful dosages of the compound can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the concentration of the compound(s) in a liquid composition, such as a lotion, will be from about 0.1-25 wt-%, preferably from about 0.5-10 wt-%. The concentration in a semi-solid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder will be about 0.1-5 wt-%, preferably about 0.5-2.5 wt-%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. Also the dosage of the compound varies depending on the target cell, tumor, tissue, graft, or organ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn administration regimen could include long-term, daily treatment. By “long-term” is meant at least two weeks and preferably, several weeks, months, or years of duration. Necessary modifications in this dosage range may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein. See Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Martin, E. W., ed. 4), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. The dosage can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nImmunization of Llamas\n\n\n \n \n \nOne llama was immunized with human serum albumin (HSA). The immunization scheme is summarized in Table 1.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nRepertoire Cloning\n\n\n \n \n \nPeripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were isolated by centrifugation on a density gradient (Ficoll-Paque Plus Amersham Biosciences). PBLs were used to extract total RNA (Chomczynski and Sacchi 1987). cDNA was prepared on 100 μg total RNA with MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (Gibco BRL) using oligo d(T) oligonucleotides. The cDNA was purified with a phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by an ethanol precipitation and subsequently used as template to amplify the VHH repertoire.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a first PCR, the repertoire of both conventional (1.6 kb) and heavy-chain (1.3 kb) antibody gene segments were amplified using a leader specific primer (5′-GGCTGAGCTCGGTGGTCCTGGCT-3′) and the oligo d(T) primer (5′-AACTGGAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCAGGAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′). The resulting DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and the 1.3 kb fragment, encoding heavy-chain antibody segments was purified from the agarose gel. A second PCR was performed using a mixture of FR1 reverse primers and the same oligo d(T) forward primer. The PCR products were digested with SfiI (introduced in the FR1 primer) and BstEII (naturally occurring in FR4). Following gel electrophoresis, the DNA fragment of approximately 400 basepairs were purified from gel and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of phagemid pAX004 to obtain a library of cloned VHHs after electroporation of \nEscherichia coli \nTG1. The size of the library was 1.4×10\n7 \ncfu, and all clones contained insert of the correct size.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nRescue of the Library, Phage Preparation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe library was grown at 37° C. in 10 \nml\n 2×TY medium containing 2% glucose, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin, until the OD600 nm reached 0.5. M13KO7 phages (10\n12\n) were added and the mixture was incubated at 37° C. for 2×30 minutes, first without shaking, then with shaking at 100 rpm. Cells were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4500 rpm at room temperature. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 2×TY medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin, and incubated overnight at 37° C. with vigorously shaking at 250 rpm. The overnight cultures were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4° C. Phages were PEG precipitated (20% poly-ethylene-glycol and 1.5 M NaCl) and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 10,000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml PBS. Phages were again PEG precipitated and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 20,000 rpm and 4° C. The pellet was dissolved in 5 ml PBS-1% casein. Phages were titrated by infection of TG1 cells at OD600 nm=0.5 and plating on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. The number of transformants indicates the number of phages (=pfu). The phages were stored at −80° C. with 15% glycerol.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nPhage ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate (Maxisorp) was coated overnight at 4° C. with PBS-1% casein or with 5 μg/ml HSA (human serum albumin). The plate was washed 3 times with PBS-Tween (0.05% Tween20) and blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with 200 μl PBS-1% casein. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween. Phages were prepared as described above and applied to the wells in consecutive twofold dilutions. Plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween. Bound phage were detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody anti-M13 conjugated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP) diluted 1/2000 in PBS. The plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween. Staining was performed with ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2 \nand signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. Results are shown in \nFIG. 1\n and indicate the presence of HSA-specific nanobodies in the library.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nSelection: First and Second Round of Biopanning\n\n\n \n \n \nA well in a microtiterplate was coated with 10 μg/ml mouse serum albumin (MSA), or with PBS containing 1% casein. After overnight incubation at 4° C., the wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% casein, for 3 hours at room temperature (RT). 200 μl phages was added to the wells. After 2 hours incubation at RT, the wells were washed 10× with PBS-Tween and 10× with PBS. Bound phages were eluted with 100 μl 0.2 M glycin buffer pH=2.4. Elutions were performed for 20 minutes at room temperature. Eluted phages were allowed to infect exponentially growing \nE. Coli \nTG1 cells, and were then plated on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. A second round was performed with the same conditions as described above. Results are summarized in Table 2.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nScreening of Individual Clones after Biopanning\n\n\nELISA: Binding to Human Serum Albumin (HSA) and Mouse Serum Albumin (MSA)\n\n\n \n \n \nA single colony was used to start an overnight culture in LB containing 2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. This overnight culture was diluted 100-fold in TB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and incubated at 37° C. until OD600 nm=0.5. 1 mM IPTG was added and the culture was incubated for 3 more hours at 37° C. or overnight at 28° C. Cultures were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4° C. The pellet was frozen overnight or for 1 hour at −20° C. Next, the pellet was thawed at room temperature for 40 minutes, re-suspended in PBS and shaken on ice for 1 hour. Periplasmic fraction was isolated by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 4° C. at 20,000 rpm. The supernatant containing the VHH was used for further analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated with 5 μg/ml HSA, with 5 μg/ml mouse serum albumin (MSA) or with PBS-1% casein, overnight at 4° C. Plates were blocked for two hours at room temperature with 300 \nμl\n 1% casein in PBS. The plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween. Periplasmic fraction was prepared for 23 individual clones after the first and second round of selection, and allowed to bind to the wells of the microtiterplate. Plates were washed six times with PBS-Tween, after which binding of nanobody was detected by incubation with mouse anti-Histidine monoclonal antibody Serotec MCA 1396 (1/1000 dilution) in PBS for 1 hour at RT followed by anti-mouse-\nalkaline phosphatase conjugate\n 1/2000 in PBS, also for 1 hour at RT. Staining was performed with the substrate PNPP (p-nitrophenyl-phosphate, 2 mg/ml in 1M diethanolamine, 1 mM Mg\n2\nSO\n4\n, pH9.8) and the signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. Results are summarized in Table 3.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nHinfI Pattern and Sequencing\n\n\n \n \n \nA PCR was performed on positive clones after the second round of panning, with a set of primers binding to a sequence in the vector. The PCR product was digested with the restriction enzyme HinfI and loaded on a agarose gel. 4 clones were selected with a different HinfI-pattern for further evaluation. Those clones were sequenced, and results are summarized in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 1, 2, 3 and 4).\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nTest Cross-Reactivity with Albumin of Different Species\n\n\n \n \n \nA SDS-PAGE was run for plasma (1/10 dilution) from different species (baboon, pig, hamster, human, rat. mouse and rabbit) and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. Phages were prepared for \nclones MSA\n 21, \nMSA\n 24, \nMSA\n 210, MSA212 and a control nanobody as described in Example 3. Phages were allowed to bind to the nitrocellulose blotted serum albumins and unbound phages were washed away. Binding was detected with an anti-M13 polyclonal antibody coupled to HRP. DAP was used as a substrate for detection. Results are shown in \nFIG. 2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom these results we can conclude that all 4 binders are cross-reactive between pig, human, mouse (less for MSA212) and hamster serum albumin. \nMSA\n 21 is also cross-reactive with rabbit serum albumin. With the irrelevant nanobody no binding was observed (not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a control experiment, a SDS-PAGE was run with the different plasma samples diluted 1/100 in PBS. The gel was stained with coomassie. We can conclude from \nFIG. 3\n that albumin levels in all plasma samples are high except for rabbit plasma, with low levels of albumin.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nExpression and Purification\n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmid was prepared for the binders and was transformed into WK6 electrocompetent cells. A single colony was used to start an overnight culture in LB containing 2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. This overnight culture was diluted 100-fold in 300 ml TB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and incubated at 37° C. until OD600 nm=0.5. 1 mM IPTG was added and the culture was incubated for 3 more hours at 37° C. or overnight at 28° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCultures were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4° C. The pellet was frozen overnight or for 1 hour at −20° C. Next, the pellet was thawed at room temperature for 40 minutes, re-suspended in 20 ml PBS and shaken on ice for 1 hour. Periplasmic fraction was isolated by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 4° C. at 20,000 rpm. The supernatant containing the nanobody was loaded on Ni-NTA and purified to homogeneity.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nELISA on MSA of the Purified Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiterplate was coated with 5 μg/ml MSA overnight at 4 C. After washing, the plate was blocked for 2 hours at RT with PBS-1% casein. Samples were applied in duplicate starting at a concentration of 2500 nM at 1/3 dilutions and allowed to bind for 2 hours at RT. A polyclonal rabbit anti-nanobody serum was added at 1/1000 (K208) for one hour at RT. Detection was with anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate at 1/1000 and staining with PNPP as described in Example 6. Results are shown in \nFIG. 4\n.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nConstruction of Bispecific Constructs\n\n\n \n \n \nThe \nE. coli \nproduction vector pAX11 was constructed to allow the two-step cloning of bivalent or bispecific VHH (\nFIG. 5\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe carboxy terminal VHH was cloned first with PstI and BstEII, while in the second step the other VHH was inserted by SfiI and NotI, which do not cut within the first gene fragment. The procedure avoids the enforcement of new sites by amplification and thus the risk of introducing PCR errors. The middle hinge of llama was used as a linker between the nanobodies. A VHH against human TNF alpha was cloned at the COOH terminal of MSA specific nanobodies. Sequences are summarized in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 5, 6, 7 and 8). Plasmid was prepared and was transformed into WK6 electrocompetent cells. A single colony was used to start an overnight culture in LB containing 2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. This overnight culture was diluted 100-fold in 300 μl TB medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin, and incubated at 37° C. until OD600 nm=0.5. 1 mM IPTG was added and the culture was incubated for 3 more hours at 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCultures were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4° C. The pellet was frozen overnight at −20 C. The next morning, the pellet was thawed in the cold room for 40 minutes, re-suspended in 20 ml PBS and shaken on ice for 1 hour. Periplasmic fraction was isolated by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 4° C. at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was loaded on Ni-NTA and purified to homogeneity. Sequences are shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 5, 6, 7 and 8). A extra purification step was needed to remove some degradation product (5%) on gelfiltration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother bispecific VHH against human TNF-alpha (MP7 12b) is listed in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 15, 16, 17 and 18).\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nTest Bispecific Construct in Sandwich ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated with 5 μg/ml MSA overnight at 4° C. Plates were blocked for two hours at room temperature with 300 \nμl\n 1% casein in PBS. The plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween. Purified protein for the bispecific constructs was allowed to bind to the wells of the microtiterplate at a concentration of 0.4, 0.5, 2.5 and 2.5 μg/ml for MSA21, MSA24, MSA210 and MSA212 respectively. Plates were washed six times with PBS-Tween, Biotinilated TNF was added at a concentration of 10 μg/ml and diluted 3 fold, and allowed to bind for 2 hours at room temperature. Binding was detected by incubation with mouse extravidin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) 1/2000 in PBS, for 1 hour at RT. Staining was performed with the substrate PNPP (p-nitrophenyl-phosphate, 2 mg/ml in 1M diethanolamine, 1 mM Mg\n2\nSO\n4\n, pH9.8) and the signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. Results are shown in \nFIG. 6\n and indicate that the bispecific construct can bind both antigens simultaneously.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nDetermine Affinity of Albumin Binders in BIACORE\n\n\n \n \n \nAffinities for mouse albumin were determined in BIACORE by immobilization of mouse albumin on a CM5 BIAcore chip using EDC-NHS covalent coupling and are summarized in Table 5. The results indicate that the affinity for albumin is retained in the bispecific construct.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nOptimization of ELISA in Plasma or Blood\n\n\n \n \n \nPharamcokinetic experiments were initiated to compare half life in mice of the TNF-alpha binder TNF3E with MSA21/VHH#3E and MSA24/VHH#3E. Therefore our ELISA had to be optimized to obtain low background values when the samples are in blood or in plasma. A microtiterplate was coated with neutravidin. After overnight incubation at 4 C, the plates were washed and blocked for 2 hours at RT with PBS-1% casein. 1 μg/ml biotinylated TNF-alpha was allowed to bind for 30 minutes at RT and the plate was washed. Samples (monovalent VHH#3E and MSA21/VHH#3E) were applied starting at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, diluted in PBS, 10% plasma or 10% blood and allowed to bind for 2 hours. After washing the plates, a rabbit antiserum was added at a dilution of 1/2000 either recognizing the heavy chain class (K208) or recognizing the conventional class (URL49). After 1 hour incubation, the plates were washed and an anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate was added (Sigma) at a dilution of 1/1000. After 1 hour incubation at RT, plates were washed and binding was detected with substrate. Results are shown in \nFIG. 7\n. The results clearly show that background values with the rabbit antisera (K208 and URL49) are very low when the samples are diluted in 10% blood or 10% plasma as compared to PBS. The URL49 antiserum only recognizes the MSA21/VHH#3E bispecific nanobody and not monovalent VHH#3E, therefore, this antiserum can be used to test the integrity of our bispecific nanobody upon administration to the mice.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nLarge scale expression and purification of VHH#3E, MSA21/VHH#3E and MSA24/VHH#3E for pharmacokinetic studies in mice\n\n\n \n \n \n3 liter culture was started for monovalent TNF3E and for bispecific MSA21/VHH#3E or MSA24/VHH#3E and purified as described in Example 11. An extra purification step was needed for the removal of endotoxins. Therefore, samples were purified on a Polymyxin column (BIO-RAD). Samples were analyzed for bacterial endotoxin concentration with the LAL-assay (\nLimulus Amebocyte \nLysate, Bio Whittaker). Results are summarized in Table 6.\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nPharmacokinetics in Mice\n\n\n \n \n \n9 mice (CB57/B16) for each construct were injected intravenously in the tail with 100 μg nanobody. Blood was retrieved at different time points (3 mice per time point) and serum was prepared. Samples were analyzed by ELISA for the presence of monovalent or bispecific nanobody as described in example 14. K208 was also compared to URL49 for the bispecific constructs to verify the integrity of the molecule. Results are shown in \nFIGS. 8 to 11\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe can conclude from the results that the half life of the monovalent nanobody (40-45 minutes) is dramatically improved by making a bispecific nanobody with specificity for albumin MSA21/VHH#3E and MSA24/VHH#3E (half-life 2.5 to 3 days). The bispecific nanobody MSA21/VHH#3E remains intact even after 19 days in the mice as shown in ELISA with URL49 (\nFIG. 11\n).\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nFurther Extension of Half-Life of Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to increase the half-life of MSA21/TNF3E and MSA24/TNF3E even further, a trivalent nanobody was prepared by fusing the bivalent MSA21-MSA21 construct to target-specific nanobody TNF3E. The resulting MSA21/MSA21/TNF3E (Table 7, and SEQ ID NO: 9) was tested in vivo according to the method of Example 16.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\nImmunization of Ilama002\n\n\n \n \n \n1 llama was immunized with vWF. The immunization scheme is summarized in Table 7.\n\n\n \nExample 19\n\n\nRepertoire Cloning and Phage Preparation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe library was prepared as described in Example 2. The size of the library was 1.4×10\n7 \ncfu, and >90% of the clones contained insert of the correct size. Phages were prepared as described in Example 3.\n\n\n \nExample 20\n\n\nSelection for Binders for vWF Inhibiting the Interaction with Collagen: First and Second Round of Panning\n\n\n \n \n \nA well in a microtiterplate was coated with 2 μg/ml vWF or with PBS containing 1% casein. After overnight incubation at 4° C., the wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% casein, for 3 hours at RT. 200 μl phages was added to the wells. After 2 hours incubation at RT, the wells were washed 10× with PBS-Tween and 10× with PBS. Phages were specifically eluted with 100 μl of 100 μg/ml collagen type III. Elutions were performed for overnight at room temperature. Eluted phages were allowed to infect exponentially growing TG1 cells, and were then plated on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. This experiment was repeated for a second round of panning, under the same conditions as described above. The results from the panning are presented in Tables 8 and 9.\n\n\n \nExample 21\n\n\nFunctional Characterization of vWF Binders: Inhibition of Binding of vWF to Collagen by VHH\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated overnight at 4° C. with collagen type III at 25 μg/ml in PBS. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween and blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with PBS containing 1% casein. The plate was washed five times with PBS-tween. 100 μl of 2 μg/ml vWF (vWF is pre-incubated at 37° C. for 15 minutes) was mixed with 20 μl periplasmic extract containing a VHH antibody (described in Example 6) and incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature in the wells of the microtiterplate. The plate was washed five times with PBS-tween. An anti-vWF-HRP monoclonal antibody (DAKO) was diluted 3,000-fold in PBS and incubated for 1 hour. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween and vWF-binding was detected with ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2\n. Signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. The results are presented in Table 10, showing that inhibitors are obtained after the first and second round of panning.\n\n\n \nExample 22\n\n\nExpression and Purification of VHH\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein was prepared and purified as described in Example 9.\n\n\n \nExample 23\n\n\nELISA: Binding to vWF\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated with 2 μg/ml vWF, overnight at 4° C. Plates were blocked for two hours at room temperature with 300 \nμl\n 1% casein in PBS. The plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween. Dilution series of all purified samples were incubated for 2 hours at RT. Plates were washed six times with PBS-Tween, after which binding of VHH was detected by incubation with \nmouse anti-myc mAB\n 1/2000 in PBS for 1 hour at RT followed by anti-mouse-\nHRP conjugate\n 1/1000 in PBS, also for 1 hour at RT. Staining was performed with the substrate ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2 \nand the signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. The binding as a function of concentration of purified VHH is indicated in \nFIG. 12\n.\n\n\n \nExample 24\n\n\nInhibition ELISA with Purified VHH\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition ELISA was performed as described in Example 20 but with decreasing concentrations of VHH and with human plasma at a dilution of 1/60 instead of with purified vWF. Results are represented in \nFIG. 13\n. The concentration of VHH resulting in 50% inhibition (1050) is given in table 10.\n\n\n \nExample 25\n\n\nConstruction and Sequence of Bispecific Constructs\n\n\n \n \n \nBispecific constructs were prepared with the first VHH specific for albumin (MSA21) and the second VHH specific for vWF. Constructs were made as described in Example 11. Sequences are shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 19 to 21)\n\n\n \nExample 26\n\n\nExpression and Purification of Bispecific Constructs\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein was expressed and purified as described in Example 9. An extra purification step was needed on superdex 75 for removal of some monovalent degradation product (5-10%).\n\n\n \nExample 27\n\n\nFunctionality of Both VHHs in the Bispecific Construct\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiterplate was coated with 5 μg/ml mouse serum albumin overnight at 4° C. After washing the plate, wells were blocked for 2 hours with PBS-1% casein. The bispecific proteins were allowed to bind to the wells for 2 hours at RT. After washing, human, dog and pig plasma was added at different dilutions and allowed to bind for 2 hours at RT. Binding of vWF was detected with anti-vWF-HRP from DAKO at 1/3000 dilution. Staining was performed with ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2\n. Results are shown in \nFIG. 14\n and indicate that functionality of both VHHs is retained in the bispecific construct.\n\n\n \nExample 28\n\n\nInhibition of Binding of vWF to Collagen by the Bispecific Constructs as Compared to the Monovalent VHHs\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition for binding of vWF to collagen was tested for monovalent as compared to bispecific constructs as described in Example 20. IC50 values are summarized in Table 11. Results indicate that the inhibitory properties of the VHH are retained in the bispecific construct.\n\n\n \nExample 29\n\n\nConstruction of a Bispecific Construct Containing a VHH-CDR3 Fragment Fused to an Anti-Serum Albumin VHH\n\n\n \n \n \nA functional portion, the CDR3 region of MP2F6SR, was amplified by using a sense primer located in the \nframework\n 4 region (F6 CRD3 Forward:CTGGCCCCAGAAGTCATACC) and an anti-sense primer located in the \nframework\n 3 region (F6 CDR3Reverse primer:TGTGCATGTGCAGCAAACC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to fuse the CDR-3 fragment with the anti-serum albumin VHH MSA-21, a second round PCR amplification was performed with following primers:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nF6 CDR3 Reverse primer Sfi1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGTCCTCGCAACTGCGGCCCAGCCGGCCTGTGCATGTGCAGCAAACC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nF6 CDR3 Forward primer Not1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGTCCTCGCAACTGCGCGGCCGCCTGGCCCCAGAAGTCATACC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PCR reactions was performed in 50 ml reaction volume using 50 μmol of each primer. The reaction conditions for the primary PCR were 11 min at 94° C., followed by 30/60/120 sec at 94/55/72° C. for 30 cycles, and 5 min at 72° C. All reaction were performed with 2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 mM dNTP and 1.25U AmpliTaq God DNA Polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Brussels, Belgium).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter cleavage of the VHH gene of MSA clones with restriction enzymes Pst1/BstEII the digested products were cloned in pAX11 to obtain clones with a VHH at the C-terminus of the multicloning site. The clones were examined by PCR using vector based primers. From clones yielding a 650 bp product, DNA was prepared and used as acceptor vector to clone the CDR3 of MP2F6SR after cleavage of the PCR product with restriction enzymes Sfi1/Not1 to allow N-terminal expression of CDR3 in fusion with a MSA VHH.\n\n\n \nExample 30\n\n\nCalculation of Homologies Between Anti-Target Single Domain Antibodies of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe degree of amino acid sequence homology between anti-target single domain antibodies of the invention was calculated using the Bioedit Sequence Alignment Editor. The calculations indicate the proportion of identical residues between all of the sequences as they are aligned by ClustalW. (Thompson, J. D., Higgins, D. G. and Gibson, T. J.

As used herein, “short interfering nucleic acid”, “siNA”, or “short interfering nucleic acid molecule” has the meaning described in more detail elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “complementary” means that a nucleic acid can form hydrogen bond(s) with another nucleic acid sequence by either traditional Watson-Crick or other non-traditional types. In reference to the nucleic molecules disclosed herein, the binding free energy for a nucleic acid molecule with its complementary sequence is sufficient to allow the relevant function of the nucleic acid to proceed, e.g., RNAi activity. Determination of binding free energies for nucleic acid molecules is well known in the art (see, e.g., Turner et al., 1987, CSH Symp. Quant. Biol. LII pp. 123-133; Frier et al., 1986, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 83:9373-9377; Turner et al., 1987, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 109:3783-3785). A percent complementarity indicates the percentage of contiguous residues in a nucleic acid molecule that can form hydrogen bonds (e.g., Watson-Crick base pairing) with a second nucleic acid sequence (e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 nucleotides out of a total of 10 nucleotides in the first oligonucleotide being based paired to a second nucleic acid sequence having 10 nucleotides represents 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% complementary respectively). “Fully complementary” means that all the contiguous residues of a nucleic acid sequence will hydrogen bond with the same number of contiguous residues in a second nucleic acid sequence. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule disclosed herein includes about 15 to about 35 or more (e.g., about 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 or 35 or more) nucleotides that are complementary to one or more target nucleic acid molecules or a portion thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “sense region” refers to a nucleotide sequence of a siNA molecule complementary (partially or fully) to an antisense region of the siNA molecule. The sense strand of a siNA molecule can include a nucleic acid sequence having homology with a target nucleic acid sequence. As used herein, “sense strand” refers to nucleic acid molecule that includes a sense region and may also include additional nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “antisense region” refers to a nucleotide sequence of a siNA molecule complementary (partially or fully) to a target nucleic acid sequence. The antisense strand of a siNA molecule can optionally include a nucleic acid sequence complementary to a sense region of the siNA molecule. As used herein, “antisense strand” refers to nucleic acid molecule that includes an antisense region and may also include additional nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “RNA” refers to a molecule that includes at least one ribonucleotide residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “duplex region” refers to the region in two complementary or substantially complementary oligonucleotides that form base pairs with one another, either by Watson-Crick base pairing or any other manner that allows for a duplex between oligonucleotide strands that are complementary or substantially complementary. For example, an oligonucleotide strand having 21 nucleotide units can base pair with another oligonucleotide of 21 nucleotide units, yet only 19 bases on each strand are complementary or substantially complementary, such that the “duplex region” consists of 19 base pairs. The remaining base pairs may, for example, exist as 5′ and 3′ overhangs. Further, within the duplex region, 100% complementarity is not required; substantial complementarity is allowable within a duplex region. Substantial complementarity refers to complementarity between the strands such that they are capable of annealing under biological conditions. Techniques to empirically determine if two strands are capable of annealing under biological conditions are well know in the art. Alternatively, two strands can be synthesized and added together under biological conditions to determine if they anneal to one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “non-pairing nucleotide analog” means a nucleotide analog which includes a non-base pairing moiety including but not limited to: 6 des amino adenosine (Nebularine), 4-Me-indole, 3-nitropyrrole, 5-nitroindole, Ds, Pa, N3-Me ribo U, N3-Me riboT, N3-Me dC, N3-Me-dT, N1-Me-dG, N1-Me-dA, N3-ethyl-dC, N3-Me dC.

Cell lines were established by lenti-viral induction of human HSP47 cDNA-GFP or rat GP46 cDNA-GFP construct into HEK293, human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, human HSC line hTERT or NRK cell line. Negative control siNA or siNA against GFP was introduced into the cells and GFP fluorescence was measured. The results showed that siNA against GFP knocks down the fluorescence to different extent in different cell lines. 293 HSP47-GFP and 293_GP46-GFP cell lines were selected for siHsp47 screening due to their easiness of being transfected and sensitivity to fluorescence knockdown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n is a series of bar graphs showing the cytotoxicity and knockdown efficiency of various siHsp47s in 293_HSP47-GFP and 293_GP46-GFP cell lines. The result showed that siHsp47-C, siHsp47-2 and siHsp47-2d efficiently knockdown both human HSP47 and rat GP46 (the human hsp47 homolog) without substantial cytotoxicity. siGp46A against GP46 does not knock down human HSP47.

The corresponding process in plants (Heifetz et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 99/61631) is often referred to as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or RNA silencing. The process of post-transcriptional gene silencing is thought to be an evolutionarily-conserved cellular defense mechanism used to prevent the expression of foreign genes (Fire et al., 1999, Trends Genet., 15, 358). Such protection from foreign gene expression may have evolved in response to the production of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) derived from viral infection or from the random integration of transposon elements into a host genome via a cellular response that specifically destroys homologous single-stranded RNA or viral genomic RNA. The presence of dsRNA in cells triggers the RNAi response through a mechanism that has yet to be fully characterized. This mechanism appears to be different from other known mechanisms involving double stranded RNA-specific ribonucleases, such as the interferon response that results from dsRNA-mediated activation of protein kinase PKR and 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase resulting in non-specific cleavage of mRNA by ribonuclease L (see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,107,094; 5,898,031; Clemens et al., 1997, J. Interferon & Cytokine Res., 17, 503-524; Adah et al., 2001, Curr. Med. Chem., 8, 1189).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe presence of long dsRNAs in cells stimulates the activity of a ribonuclease III enzyme referred to as dicer (Bass, 2000, Cell, 101, 235; Zamore et al., 2000, Cell, 101, 25-33; Hammond et al., 2000, Nature, 404, 293). Dicer is involved in the processing of the dsRNA into short pieces of dsRNA known as short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Zamore et al., 2000, Cell, 101, 25-33; Bass, 2000, Cell, 101, 235; Berstein et al., 2001, Nature, 409, 363). Short interfering RNAs derived from dicer activity are typically about 21 to about 23 nucleotides in length and include about 19 base pair duplexes (Zamore et al., 2000, Cell, 101, 25-33; Elbashir et al., 2001, Genes Dev., 15, 188). Dicer has also been implicated in the excision of 21- and 22-nucleotide small temporal RNAs (stRNAs) from precursor RNA of conserved structure that are implicated in translational control (Hutvagner et al., 2001, Science, 293, 834). The RNAi response also features an endonuclease complex, commonly referred to as an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates cleavage of single-stranded RNA having sequence complementary to the antisense strand of the si RNA duplex. Cleavage of the target RNA takes place in the middle of the region complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex (Elbashir et al., 2001, Genes Dev., 15, 188).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNAi has been studied in a variety of systems. Fire et al., 1998, Nature, 391, 806, were the first to observe RNAi in \nC. elegans\n. Bahramian and Zarbl, 1999, Molecular and Cellular Biology, 19, 274-283 and Wianny and Goetz, 1999, Nature Cell Biol., 2, 70, describe RNAi mediated by dsRNA in mammalian systems. Hammond et al., 2000, Nature, 404, 293, describe RNAi in \nDrosophila \ncells transfected with dsRNA. Elbashir et al., 2001, Nature, 411, 494 and Tuschl et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 01/75164, describe RNAi induced by introduction of duplexes of synthetic 21-nucleotide RNAs in cultured mammalian cells including human embryonic kidney and HeLa cells. Recent work in \nDrosophila \nembryonic lysates (Elbashir et al., 2001, EMBO J., 20, 6877 and Tuschl et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 01/75164) has revealed certain requirements for siRNA length, structure, chemical composition, and sequence that are essential to mediate efficient RNAi activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules (for example having structural features as disclosed herein) may inhibit or down regulate gene expression or viral replication by mediating RNA interference “RNAi” or gene silencing in a sequence-specific manner; see e.g., Zamore et al., 2000, Cell, 101, 25-33; Bass, 2001, Nature, 411, 428-429; Elbashir et al., 2001, Nature, 411, 494-498; and Kreutzer et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 00/44895; Zernicka-Goetz et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 01/36646; Fire, International PCT Publication No. WO 99/32619; Plaetinck et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 00/01846; Mello and Fire, International PCT Publication No. WO 01/29058; Deschamps-Depaillette, International PCT Publication No. WO 99/07409; and Li et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 00/44914; Allshire, 2002, Science, 297, 1818-1819; Volpe et al., 2002, Science, 297, 1833-1837; Jenuwein, 2002, Science, 297, 2215-2218; and Hall et al., 2002, Science, 297, 2232-2237; Hutvagner and Zamore, 2002, Science, 297, 2056-60; McManus et al., 2002, RNA, 8, 842-850; Reinhart et al., 2002, Gene & Dev., 16, 1616-1626; and Reinhart & Bartel, 2002, Science, 297, 1831).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn siNA nucleic acid molecule can be assembled from two separate polynucleotide strands, where one strand is the sense strand and the other is the antisense strand in which the antisense and sense strands are self-complementary (i.e. each strand includes nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in the other strand); such as where the antisense strand and sense strand form a duplex or double stranded structure having any length and structure as described herein for nucleic acid molecules as provided, for example wherein the double stranded region (duplex region) is about 15 to about 49 (e.g., about 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, or 49 base pairs); the antisense strand includes nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule (i.e., hsp47 mRNA) or a portion thereof and the sense strand includes nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof (e.g., about 17 to about 49 or more nucleotides of the nucleic acid molecules herein are complementary to the target nucleic acid or a portion thereof).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain aspects and embodiments a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a siNA molecule) provided herein may be a “RISC length” molecule or may be a Dicer substrate as described in more detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn siNA nucleic acid molecule may include separate sense and antisense sequences or regions, where the sense and antisense regions are covalently linked by nucleotide or non-nucleotide linkers molecules as is known in the art, or are alternately non-covalently linked by ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and/or stacking interactions. Nucleic acid molecules may include a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence of a target gene. Nucleic acid molecules may interact with nucleotide sequence of a target gene in a manner that causes inhibition of expression of the target gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, an siNA nucleic acid molecule is assembled from a single polynucleotide, where the self-complementary sense and antisense regions of the nucleic acid molecules are linked by means of a nucleic acid based or non-nucleic acid-based linker(s), i.e., the antisense strand and the sense strand are part of one single polynucleotide that having an antisense region and sense region that fold to form a duplex region (for example to form a “hairpin” structure as is well known in the art). Such siNA nucleic acid molecules can be a polynucleotide with a duplex, asymmetric duplex, hairpin or asymmetric hairpin secondary structure, having self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region includes nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in a separate target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof and the sense region having nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a sequence of hsp47 mRNA). Such siNA nucleic acid molecules can be a circular single-stranded polynucleotide having two or more loop structures and a stem comprising self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region includes nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof and the sense region having nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof, and wherein the circular polynucleotide can be processed either in vivo or in vitro to generate an active nucleic acid molecule capable of mediating RNAi.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following nomenclature is often used in the art to describe lengths and overhangs of siNA molecules and may be used throughout the specification and Examples. Names given to duplexes indicate the length of the oligomers and the presence or absence of overhangs. For example, a “21+2” duplex contains two nucleic acid strands both of which are 21 nucleotides in length, also termed a 21-mer siRNA duplex or a 21-mer nucleic acid and having a 2 \nnucleotides\n 3′-overhang. A “21−2” design refers to a 21-mer nucleic acid duplex with a 2 \nnucleotides\n 5′-overhang. A 21−0 design is a 21-mer nucleic acid duplex with no overhangs (blunt). A “21+2UU” is a 21-mer duplex with 2-\nnucleotides\n 3′-overhang and the terminal 2 nucleotides at the 3′-ends are both U residues (which may result in mismatch with target sequence). The aforementioned nomenclature can be applied to siNA molecules of various lengths of strands, duplexes and overhangs (such as 19−0, 21+2, 27+2, and the like). In an alternative but similar nomenclature, a “25/27” is an asymmetric duplex having a 25 base sense strand and a 27 base antisense strand with a 2- \nnucleotides\n 3′-overhang. A “27/25” is an asymmetric duplex having a 27 base sense strand and a 25 base antisense strand.\n\n\n \nChemical Modifications\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain aspects and embodiments, nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA molecules) as provided herein include one or more modifications (or chemical modifications). In certain embodiments, such modifications include any changes to a nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide that would make the molecule different than a standard ribonucleotide or RNA molecule (i.e., that includes standard adenosine, cytosine, uracil, or guanosine moieties); which may be referred to as an “unmodified” ribonucleotide or unmodified ribonucleic acid. Traditional DNA bases and polynucleotides having a 2′-deoxy sugar represented by adenosine, cytosine, thymine, or guanosine moieties may be referred to as an “unmodified deoxyribonucleotide” or “unmodified deoxyribonucleic acid”; accordingly, the term “unmodified nucleotide” or “unmodified nucleic acid” as used herein refers to an “unmodified ribonucleotide” or “unmodified ribonucleic acid” unless there is a clear indication to the contrary. Such modifications can be in the nucleotide sugar, nucleotide base. nucleotide phosphate group and/or the phosphate backbone of a polynucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments modifications as disclosed herein may be used to increase RNAi activity of a molecule and/or to increase the in vivo stability of the molecules, particularly the stability in serum, and/or to increase bioavailability of the molecules. Non-limiting examples of modifications include without limitation internucleotide or internucleoside linkages; deoxynucleotides or dideoxyribonucleotides at any position and strand of the nucleic acid molecule; nucleic acid (e.g., ribonucleic acid) with a modification at the 2′-position preferably selected from an amino, fluoro, methoxy, alkoxy and alkyl; 2′-deoxyribonucleotides, 2′-O-methyl ribonucleotides, 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro ribonucleotides, “universal base” nucleotides, “acyclic” nucleotides, 5-C-methyl nucleotides, biotin group, and terminal glyceryl and/or inverted deoxy abasic residue incorporation, sterically hindered molecules, such as fluorescent molecules and the like. Other nucleotides modifiers could include 3′-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin), 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine (ddI), 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC), 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (d4T) and the monophosphate nucleotides of 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC) and 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dide-oxythymidine (d4T).

Non-limiting examples of nucleotides having a northern configuration include locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides (e.g., 2′-O, 4′-C-methylene-(D-ribofuranosyl) nucleotides); 2′-methoxyethoxy (MOE) nucleotides; 2′-methyl-thio-ethyl, 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro nucleotides, 2′-deoxy-2′-chloro nucleotides, 2′-azido nucleotides, and 2′-O-methyl nucleotides. Locked nucleic acids, or LNA's are described, for example, in Elman et al., 2005; Kurreck et al., 2002; Crinelli et al., 2002; Braasch and Corey, 2001; Bondensgaard et al., 2000; Wahlestedt et al., 2000; and International Patent Publication Nos. WO 00/47599, WO 99/14226, and WO 98/39352 and WO 2004/083430. In one embodiment, an LNA is incorporated at the 5′ terminus of the sense strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemical modifications also include unlocked nucleic acids, or UNAs, which are non-nucleotide, acyclic analogues, in which the C2′-C3′ bond is not present (although UNAs are not truly nucleotides, they are expressly included in the scope of “modified” nucleotides or modified nucleic acids as contemplated herein). In particular embodiments, nucleic acid molecules with an overhang may be modified to have UNAs at the overhang positions (i.e., 2 nucleotide overhand). In other embodiments, UNAs are included at the 3′- or 5′-ends. A UNA may be located anywhere along a nucleic acid strand, i.e. in position 7. Nucleic acid molecules may contain one or more than UNA. Exemplary UNAs are disclosed in Nucleic Acids Symposium Series No. 52 p. 133-134 (2008). In certain embodiments a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a siNA molecule) as described herein include one or more UNAs; or one UNA.

A pattern of modification of the nucleotides in a contiguous stretch of nucleotides may be a modification contained within a single nucleotide or group of nucleotides that are covalently linked to each other via standard phosphodiester bonds or, at least partially, through phosphorothioate bonds. Accordingly, a “pattern” as contemplated herein, does not necessarily need to involve repeating units, although it may. Examples of modification patterns that may be used in conjunction with the nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA molecules) provided herein include those disclosed in Giese, U.S. Pat. No. 7,452,987. For example, nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA molecules) provided herein include those having modification patters such as, similar to, or the same as, the patterns shown diagrammatically in FIG. 2 of the Giese U.S. Pat. No. 7,452,987.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA modified nucleotide or group of modified nucleotides may be at the 5′-end or 3′-end of the sense or antisense strand, a flanking nucleotide or group of nucleotides is arrayed on both sides of the modified nucleotide or group, where the flanking nucleotide or group either is unmodified or does not have the same modification of the preceding nucleotide or group of nucleotides. The flanking nucleotide or group of nucleotides may, however, have a different modification. This sequence of modified nucleotide or group of modified nucleotides, respectively, and unmodified or differently modified nucleotide or group of unmodified or differently modified nucleotides may be repeated one or more times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some patterns, the 5′-terminal nucleotide of a strand is a modified nucleotide while in other patterns the 5′-terminal nucleotide of a strand is an unmodified nucleotide. In some patterns, the 5′-end of a strand starts with a group of modified nucleotides while in other patterns, the 5′-terminal end is an unmodified group of nucleotides. This pattern may be either on the first stretch or the second stretch of the nucleic acid molecule or on both.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModified nucleotides of one strand of the nucleic acid molecule may be complementary in position to the modified or unmodified nucleotides or groups of nucleotides of the other strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere may be a phase shift between modifications or patterns of modifications on one strand relative to the pattern of modification of the other strand such that the modification groups do not overlap. In one instance, the shift is such that the modified group of nucleotides of the sense strand corresponds to the unmodified group of nucleotides of the antisense strand and vice versa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere may be a partial shift of the pattern of modification such that the modified groups overlap. The groups of modified nucleotides in any given strand may optionally be the same length, but may be of different lengths. Similarly, groups of unmodified nucleotides in any given strand may optionally be the same length, or of different lengths.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some patterns, the second (penultimate) nucleotide at the terminus of the strand, is an unmodified nucleotide or the beginning of group of unmodified nucleotides. Preferably, this unmodified nucleotide or unmodified group of nucleotides is located at the 5′-end of the either or both the sense and antisense strands and even more preferably at the terminus of the sense strand. An unmodified nucleotide or unmodified group of nucleotide may be located at the 5′-end of the sense strand. In a preferred embodiment the pattern consists of alternating single modified and unmodified nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some double stranded nucleic acid molecules include a 2′-O-methyl modified nucleotide and a non-modified nucleotide, preferably a nucleotide which is not 2′-O-methyl modified, are incorporated on both strands in an alternating fashion, resulting in a pattern of alternating 2′-O-methyl modified nucleotides and nucleotides that are either unmodified or at least do not include a 2′-O-methyl modification. In certain embodiments, the same sequence of 2′-O-methyl modification and non-modification exists on the second strand; in other embodiments the alternating 2′-O-methyl modified nucleotides are only present in the sense strand and are not present in the antisense strand; and in yet other embodiments the alternating 2′-O-methyl modified nucleotides are only present in the sense strand and are not present in the antisense strand. In certain embodiments, there is a phase shift between the two strands such that the 2′-O-methyl modified nucleotide on the first strand base pairs with a non-modified nucleotide(s) on the second strand and vice versa. This particular arrangement, i.e. base pairing of 2′-O-methyl modified and non-modified nucleotide(s) on both strands is particularly preferred in certain embodiments. In certain embodiments, the pattern of alternating 2′-O-methyl modified nucleotides exists throughout the entire nucleic acid molecule; or the entire duplex region. In other embodiments the pattern of alternating 2′-O-methyl modified nucleotides exists only in a portion of the nucleic acid; or the entire duplex region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn “phase shift” patterns, it may be preferred if the antisense strand starts with a 2′-O-methyl modified nucleotide at the 5′ end whereby consequently the second nucleotide is non-modified, the third, fifth, seventh and so on nucleotides are thus again 2′-O-methyl modified whereas the second, fourth, sixth, eighth and the like nucleotides are non-modified nucleotides.\n\n\n \nExemplary Modification Locations and Patterns\n\n\n \n \n \nWhile exemplary patterns are provided in more detail below, all permutations of patterns with of all possible characteristics of the nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein and those known in the art are contemplated (e.g., characteristics include, but are not limited to, length of sense strand, length of antisense strand, length of duplex region, length of hangover, whether one or both ends of a double stranded nucleic acid molecule is blunt or has an overhang, location of modified nucleic acid, number of modified nucleic acids, types of modifications, whether a double overhang nucleic acid molecule has the same or different number of nucleotides on the overhang of each side, whether a one or more than one type of modification is used in a nucleic acid molecule, and number of contiguous modified/unmodified nucleotides). With respect to all detailed examples provided below, while the duplex region is shown to be 19 nucleotides, the nucleic acid molecules provided herein can have a duplex region ranging from 1 to 49 nucleotides in length as each strand of a duplex region can independently be 17-49 nucleotides in length Exemplary patterns are provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules may have a blunt end (when n is 0) on both ends that include a single or contiguous set of modified nucleic acids. The modified nucleic acid may be located at any position along either the sense or antisense strand. Nucleic acid molecules may include a group of about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 or 49 contiguous modified nucleotides. Modified nucleic acids may make up 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98% or 100% of a nucleic acid strand. Modified nucleic acids of the examples immediately below may be in the sense strand only, the antisense strand only, or in both the sense and antisense strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneral nucleic acid patters are shown below where X=sense strand nucleotide in the duplex region; X\na\n=5′-overhang nucleotide in the sense strand; X\nb\n=3′-overhang nucleotide in the sense strand; Y=antisense strand nucleotide in the duplex region; Y\na\n=3′-overhang nucleotide in the antisense strand; Y\nb\n=5′-overhang nucleotide in the antisense strand; and M=a modified nucleotide in the duplex region. Each a and b are independently 0 to 8 (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8). Each X, Y, a and b are independently modified or unmodified. The sense and antisense strands can are each independently 17-49 nucleotides in length.

strand, preferably the sense strand, that is nicked or gapped. As such, nucleic acid molecules may have three or more strand, for example, such as a meroduplex RNA (mdRNA) disclosed in International Patent Application No. PCT/US07/081,836. Nucleic acid molecules with a nicked or gapped strand may be between about 1-49 nucleotides, or may be RISC length (e.g., about 15 to 25 nucleotides) or Dicer substrate length (e.g., about 25 to 30 nucleotides) such as disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules with three or more strands include, for example, an ‘A’ (antisense) strand, ‘S1’ (second) strand, and ‘S2’ (third) strand in which the ‘S1’ and ‘S2’ strands arc complementary to and form base pairs with non-overlapping regions of the ‘A’ strand (e.g., an mdRNA can have the form of A:S1S2). The S1, S2, or more strands together form what is substantially similar to a sense strand to the ‘A’ antisense strand. The double-stranded region formed by the annealing of the ‘S1’ and ‘A’ strands is distinct from and non-overlapping with the double-stranded region formed by the annealing of the ‘S2’ and ‘A’ strands. An nucleic acid molecule (e.g., an siNA molecule) may be a “gapped” molecule, meaning a “gap” ranging from 0 nucleotides up to about 10 nucleotides (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 nucleotides). Preferably, the sense strand is gapped. In some embodiments, the A:S1 duplex is separated from the A:S2 duplex by a gap resulting from at least one unpaired nucleotide (up to about 10 unpaired nucleotides) in the ‘A’ strand that is positioned between the A:S I duplex and the A:S2 duplex and that is distinct from any one or more unpaired nucleotide at the 3′-end of one or more of the ‘A’, ‘S1’, or ‘S2 strands. The A:S1 duplex may be separated from the A: B2 duplex by a gap of zero nucleotides (i.e., a nick in which only a phosphodiester bond between two nucleotides is broken or missing in the polynucleotide molecule) between the A:S1 duplex and the A:S2 duplex-which can also be referred to as nicked dsRNA (ndsRNA). For example, A: S1 S2 may be include a dsRNA having at least two double-stranded regions that combined total about 14 base pairs to about 40 base pairs and the double-stranded regions are separated by a gap of about 0 to about 10 nucleotides, optionally having blunt ends, or A:S1S2 may include a dsRNA having at least two double-stranded regions separated by a gap of up to 10 nucleotides wherein at least one of the double-stranded regions includes between about 5 base pairs and 13 base pairs.\n\n\n \nDicer Substrates\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA molecules) provided herein may be a precursor “Dicer substrate” molecule, e.g., double stranded nucleic acid, processed in vivo to produce an active nucleic acid molecules, for example as described in Rossi, US Patent App. No. 20050244858. In certain conditions and situations, it has been found that these relatively longer dsRNA siNA species, e.g., of from about 25 to about 30 nucleotides, can give unexpectedly effective results in terms of potency and duration of action. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is thought that the longer dsRNA species serve as a substrate for the enzyme Dicer in the cytoplasm of a cell. In addition to cleaving double stranded nucleic acid into shorter segments, Dicer may facilitate the incorporation of a single-stranded cleavage product derived from the cleaved dsRNA into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC complex) that is responsible for the destruction of the cytoplasmic RNA derived from the target gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDicer substrates may have certain properties which enhance its processing by Dicer. Dicer substrates are of a length sufficient such that it is processed by Dicer to produce an active nucleic acid molecule and may further include one or more of the following properties: (i) the dsRNA is asymmetric, e.g., has a 3′ overhang on the first strand (antisense strand) and (ii) the dsRNA has a modified 3′ end on the antisense strand (sense strand) to direct orientation of Dicer binding and processing of the dsRNA to an active siRNA. In certain embodiments, the longest strand in the Dicer substrate may be 24-30 nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDicer substrates may be symmetric or asymmetric. The Dicer substrate may have a sense strand includes 22-28 nucleotides and the antisense strand may include 24-30 nucleotides; thus, in some embodiments the resulting Dicer substrate may have an overhang on the 3′ end of the antisense strand. Dicer substrate may have a sense strand 25 nucleotides in length, and the antisense strand having 27 nucleotides in length with a 2 \nbase\n 3′-overhang. The overhang may be 1-3 nucleotides, for example 2 nucleotides. The sense strand may also have a 5′ phosphate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn asymmetric Dicer substrate may further contain two deoxynucleotides at the 3′-end of the sense strand in place of two of the ribonucleotides. Some exemplary Dicer substrates lengths and structures are 21+0, 21+2, 21−2, 22+0, 22+1, 22−1, 23+0, 23+2, 23−2, 24+0, 24+2, 24−2, 25+0, 25+2, 25−2, 26+0, 26+2, 26−2, 27+0, 27+2, and 27−2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sense strand of a Dicer substrate may be between about 22 to about 30 (e.g., about 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30); about 22 to about 28; about 24 to about 30; about 25 to about 30; about 26 to about 30; about 26 and 29; or about 27 to about 28 nucleotides in length. In certain preferred embodiments Dicer substrates contain sense and antisense strands, that are at least about 25 nucleotides in length and no longer than about 30 nucleotides; between about 26 and 29 nucleotides; or 27 nucleotides in length. The sense and antisense strands may be the same length (blunt ended), different lengths (have overhangs), or a combination. The sense and antisense strands may exist on the same polynucleotide or on different polynucleotides. A Dicer substrate may have a duplex region of about 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or 27 nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLike other siNA molecules provided herein, the antisense strand of a Dicer substrate may have any sequence that anneals to the antisense strand under biological conditions, such as within the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDicer substrates may have any modifications to the nucleotide base, sugar or phosphate backbone as known in the art and/or as described herein for other nucleic acid molecules (such as siNA molecules). In certain embodiments, Dicer substrates may have a sense strand is modified for Dicer processing by suitable modifiers located at the 3′ end of the sense strand, i.e., the dsRNA is designed to direct orientation of Dicer binding and processing. Suitable modifiers include nucleotides such as deoxyribonucleotides, dideoxyribonucleotides, acyclonucleotides and the like and sterically hindered molecules, such as fluorescent molecules and the like. Acyclonucleotides substitute a 2-hydroxyethoxymethyl group for-the 2′-deoxyribofuranosyl sugar normally present in dNMPs. Other nucleotides modifiers that could be used in Dicer substrate siNA molecules include 3′-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin), 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine (ddI), 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC), 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (d4T) and the monophosphate nucleotides of 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC) and 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dide-oxythymidine (d4T). In one embodiment, deoxynucleotides are used as the modifiers. When nucleotide modifiers are utilized, they may replace ribonucleotides (e.g., 1-3 nucleotide modifiers, or 2 nucleotide modifiers are substituted for the ribonucleotides on the 3′ end of the sense strand) such that the length of the Dicer substrate does not change. When sterically hindered molecules are utilized, they may be attached to the ribonucleotide at the 3′ end of the antisense strand. Thus, in certain embodiments the length of the strand does not change with the incorporation of the modifiers. In certain embodiments, two DNA bases in the dsRNA are substituted to direct the orientation of Dicer processing of the antisense strand. In a further embodiment of two terminal DNA bases are substituted for two ribonucleotides on the 3′-end of the sense strand forming a blunt end of the duplex on the 3′ end of the sense strand and the 5′ end of the antisense strand, and a two-nucleotide RNA overhang is located on the 3′-end of the antisense strand. This is an asymmetric composition with DNA on the blunt end and RNA bases on the overhanging end.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments modifications are included in the Dicer substrate such that the modification does not prevent the nucleic acid molecule from serving as a substrate for Dicer. In one embodiment, one or more modifications are made that enhance Dicer processing of the Dicer substrate. One or more modifications may be made that result in more effective RNAi generation. One or more modifications may be made that support a greater RNAi effect. One or more modifications are made that result in greater potency per each Dicer substrate to be delivered to the cell. Modifications may be incorporated in the 3′-terminal region, the 5′-terminal region, in both the 3′-terminal and 5′-terminal region or at various positions within the sequence. Any number and combination of modifications can be incorporated into the Dicer substrate so long as the modification does not prevent the nucleic acid molecule from serving as a substrate for Dicer. Where multiple modifications are present, they may be the same or different. Modifications to bases, sugar moieties, the phosphate backbone, and their combinations are contemplated. Either 5′-terminus can be phosphorylated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of Dicer substrate phosphate backbone modifications include phosphonates, including methylphosphonate, phosphorothioate, and phosphotriester modifications such as alkylphosphotriesters, and the like. Examples of Dicer substrate sugar moiety modifications include 2′-alkyl pyrimidine, such as 2′-O-methyl, 2′-fluoro, amino, and deoxy modifications and the like (see, e.g., Amarzguioui et al., 2003). Examples of Dicer substrate base group modifications include abasic sugars, 2-O-alkyl modified pyrimidines, 4-thiouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-iodouracil, and 5-(3-aminoallyl)-uracil and the like. Locked nucleic acids, or LNA's, could also be incorporated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sense strand may be modified for Dicer processing by suitable modifiers located at the 3′ end of the sense strand, i.e., the Dicer substrate is designed to direct orientation of Dicer binding and processing. Suitable modifiers include nucleotides such as deoxyribonucleotides, dideoxyribonucleotides, acyclonucleotides and the like and sterically hindered molecules, such as fluorescent molecules and the like. Acyclonucleotides substitute a 2-hydroxyethoxymethyl group for-the 2′-deoxyribofuranosyl sugar normally present in dNMPs. Other nucleotides modifiers could include 3′-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin), 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine (ddI), 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC), 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (d4T) and the monophosphate nucleotides of 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC) and 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dide-oxythymidine (d4T). In one embodiment, deoxynucleotides are used as the modifiers. When nucleotide modifiers are utilized, 1-3 nucleotide modifiers, or 2 nucleotide modifiers are substituted for the ribonucleotides on the 3′ end of the sense strand. When sterically hindered molecules are utilized, they are attached to the ribonucleotide at the 3′ end of the antisense strand. Thus, the length of the strand does not change with the incorporation of the modifiers. In another embodiment, the invention contemplates substituting two DNA bases in the Dicer substrate to direct the orientation of Dicer processing of the antisense strand. In a further embodiment of the present invention, two terminal DNA bases are substituted for two ribonucleotides on the 3′-end of the sense strand forming a blunt end of the duplex on the 3′ end of the sense strand and the 5′ end of the antisense strand, and a two-nucleotide RNA overhang is located on the 3′-end of the antisense strand. This is an asymmetric composition with DNA on the blunt end and RNA bases on the overhanging end.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antisense strand may be modified for Dicer processing by suitable modifiers located at the 3′ end of the antisense strand, i.e., the dsRNA is designed to direct orientation of Dicer binding and processing. Suitable modifiers include nucleotides such as deoxyribonucleotides, dideoxyribonucleotides, acyclonucleotides and the like and sterically hindered molecules, such as fluorescent molecules and the like. Acyclonucleotides substitute a 2-hydroxyethoxymethyl group for the 2′-deoxyribofuranosyl sugar normally present in dNMPs. Other nucleotide modifiers could include 3′-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin), 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine (ddI), 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC), 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (d4T) and the monophosphate nucleotides of 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC) and 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dide-oxythymidine (d4T). In one embodiment, deoxynucleotides are used as the modifiers. When nucleotide modifiers are utilized, 1-3 nucleotide modifiers, or 2 nucleotide modifiers are substituted for the ribonucleotides on the 3′ end of the antisense strand. When sterically hindered molecules are utilized, they are attached to the ribonucleotide at the 3′ end of the antisense strand. Thus, the length of the strand does not change with the incorporation of the modifiers. In another embodiment, the invention contemplates substituting two DNA bases in the dsRNA to direct the orientation of Dicer processing. In a further invention, two terminal DNA bases are located on the 3′ end of the antisense strand in place of two ribonucleotides forming a blunt end of the duplex on the 5′ end of the sense strand and the 3′ end of the antisense strand, and a two-nucleotide RNA overhang is located on the 3′-end of the sense strand. This is an asymmetric composition with DNA on the blunt end and RNA bases on the overhanging end.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDicer substrates with a sense and an antisense strand can be linked by a third structure. The third structure will not block Dicer activity on the Dicer substrate and will not interfere with the directed destruction of the RNA transcribed from the target gene. The third structure may be a chemical linking group. Suitable chemical linking groups are known in the art and can be used. Alternatively, the third structure may be an oligonucleotide that links the two oligonucleotides of the dsRNA is a manner such that a hairpin structure is produced upon annealing of the two oligonucleotides making up the Dicer substrate. The hairpin structure preferably does not block Dicer activity on the Dicer substrate or interfere with the directed destruction of the RNA transcribed from the target gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sense and antisense strands of the Dicer substrate are not required to be completely complementary. They only need to be substantially complementary to anneal under biological conditions and to provide a substrate for Dicer that produces an siRNA sufficiently complementary to the target sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDicer substrate can have certain properties that enhance its processing by Dicer. The Dicer substrate can have a length sufficient such that it is processed by Dicer to produce an active nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siRNA) and may have one or more of the following properties: (i) the Dicer substrate is asymmetric, e.g., has a 3′ overhang on the first strand (antisense strand) and (ii) the Dicer substrate has a modified 3′ end on the second strand (sense strand) to direct orientation of Dicer binding and processing of the Dicer substrate to an active siRNA. The Dicer substrate can be asymmetric such that the sense strand includes 22-28 nucleotides and the antisense strand includes 24-30 nucleotides. Thus, the resulting Dicer substrate has an overhang on the 3′ end of the antisense strand. The overhang is 1-3 nucleotides, for example 2 nucleotides. The sense strand may also have a 5′ phosphate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Dicer substrate may have an overhang on the 3′ end of the antisense strand and the sense strand is modified for Dicer processing. The 5′ end of the sense strand may have a phosphate. The sense and antisense strands may anneal under biological conditions, such as the conditions found in the cytoplasm of a cell. A region of one of the strands, particularly the antisense strand, of the Dicer substrate may have a sequence length of at least 19 nucleotides, wherein these nucleotides are in the 21-nucleotide region adjacent to the 3′ end of the antisense strand and are sufficiently complementary to a nucleotide sequence of the RNA produced from the target gene. A Dicer substrate may also have one or more of the following additional properties: (a) the antisense strand has a right shift from a corresponding 21-mer (i.e., the antisense strand includes nucleotides on the right side of the molecule when compared to the corresponding 21-mer), (b) the strands may not be completely complementary, i.e., the strands may contain simple mismatch pairings and (c) base modifications such as locked nucleic acid(s) may be included in the 5′ end of the sense strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antisense strand of a Dicer substrate nucleic acid molecule may be modified to include 1-9 ribonucleotides on the 5′-end to give a length of 22-28 nucleotides. When the antisense strand has a length of 21 nucleotides, then 1-7 ribonucleotides, or 2-5 ribonucleotides and or 4 ribonucleotides may be added on the 3′-end. The added ribonucleotides may have any sequence. Although the added ribonucleotides may be complementary to the target gene sequence, full complementarity between the target sequence and the antisense strands is not required. That is, the resultant antisense strand is sufficiently complementary with the target sequence. A sense strand may then have 24-30 nucleotides. The sense strand may be substantially complementary with the antisense strand to anneal to the antisense strand under biological conditions. In one embodiment, the antisense strand may be synthesized to contain a modified 3′-end to direct Dicer processing. The sense strand may have a 3′ overhang. The antisense strand may be synthesized to contain a modified 3′-end for Dicer binding and processing and the sense strand has a 3′ overhang.\n\n\n \nHeat Shock Protein 47\n\n\n \n \n \nHeat shock protein 47 (HSP47) is a collagen-specific molecular chaperone and resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. It interacts with procollagen during the process of folding, assembling and transporting from the endoplasmic reticulum (Nagata Trends Biochem Sci 1996; 21:22-6; Razzaque et al. 2005; Contrib Nephrol 2005; 148: 57-69; Koide et al. 2006 J. Biol. Chem.; 281: 3432-38; Leivo et al. Dev. Biol. 1980; 76:100-114; Masuda et al. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94:2481-2488; Masuda et al. Cell Stress Chaperones 1998; 3:256-264). HSP47 has been reported to have an upregulated expression in various tissue fibrosis (Koide et al. J Biol Chem 1999; 274: 34523-26), such as liver cirrhosis (Masuda et al. J Clin Invest 1994; 94:2481-8), pulmonary fibrosis (Razzaque et al. Virchows Arch 1998; 432:455-60; Kakugawa ct al. Eur Respir J 2004; 24: 57-65), and glomerulosclerosis (Moriyama et al. Kidney Int 1998; 54: 110-19). Exemplary nucleic acid sequence of target human hsp47 cDNA is disclosed in GenBank accession number: NM\n—\n001235 and the corresponding mRNA sequence, for example as listed as SEQ ID NO: 1. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that a given sequence may change over time and to incorporate any changes needed in the nucleic acid molecules herein accordingly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific association of HSP47 with a diverse range of collagen types makes HSP47 a potential target for the treatment of fibrosis. Inhibition of hsp47 expression may prevent extracellular collagen I secretion. Sato et al. (Nat Biotechnol 2008; 26:431-442) explored this possibility by using siRNA for the inhibition hsp47 expression and preventing the progression of hepatic fibrosis in rats. Similarly, Chen et al. (Br J Dermatol 2007; 156: 1188-1195) and Wang et al. (Plast. Reconstr Surg 2003; 111: 1980-7) investigated the inhibition hsp47 expression by RNA interference technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods and Compositions for Inhibiting hsp47\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProvided are compositions and methods for inhibition of hsp47 expression by using small nucleic acid molecules, such as short interfering nucleic acid (siNA), interfering RNA (RNAi), short interfering RNA (siRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA), and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules capable of mediating or that mediate RNA interference against hsp47 gene expression. The composition and methods disclosed herein are also useful in treating various fibrosis such as liver fibrosis, lung fibrosis, and kidney fibrosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecule(s) and/or methods of the invention are used to down regulate the expression of gene(s) that encode RNA referred to, by example, Genbank Accession NM\n—\n001235.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions, methods and kits provided herein may include one or more nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA) and methods that independently or in combination modulate (e.g., downregulate) the expression of hsp47 protein and/or genes encoding hsp47 proteins, proteins and/or genes encoding hsp47 associated with the maintenance and/or development of diseases, conditions or disorders associated with hsp47, such as liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, peritoneal fibrosis, chronic hepatic damage, and fibrillogenesis (e.g., genes encoding sequences comprising those sequences referred to by GenBank Accession Nos. NM\n—\n001235), or a hsp47 gene family member where the genes or gene family sequences share sequence homology. The description of the various aspects and embodiments is provided with reference to exemplary gene hsp47. However, the various aspects and embodiments are also directed to other related hsp47 genes, such as homolog genes and transcript variants, and polymorphisms (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism, (SNPs)) associated with certain hsp47 genes. As such, the various aspects and embodiments are also directed to other genes that are involved in hsp47 mediated pathways of signal transduction or gene expression that are involved, for example, in the maintenance or development of diseases, traits, or conditions described herein. These additional genes can be analyzed for target sites using the methods described for the hsp47 gene herein. Thus, the modulation of other genes and the effects of such modulation of the other genes can be performed, determined, and measured as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, compositions and methods provided herein include a double-stranded short interfering nucleic acid (siNA) molecule that down-regulates expression of a hsp47 gene (e.g., human hsp47 exemplified by SEQ ID NO:1), where the nucleic acid molecule includes about 15 to about 49 base pairs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a nucleic acid disclosed may be used to inhibit the expression of the hsp47 gene or a hsp47 gene family where the genes or gene family sequences share sequence homology. Such homologous sequences can be identified as is known in the art, for example using sequence alignments. Nucleic acid molecules can be designed to target such homologous sequences, for example using perfectly complementary sequences or by incorporating non-canonical base pairs, for example mismatches and/or wobble base pairs, that can provide additional target sequences. In instances where mismatches are identified, non-canonical base pairs (for example, mismatches and/or wobble bases) can be used to generate nucleic acid molecules that target more than one gene sequence. In a non-limiting example, non-canonical base pairs such as UU and CC base pairs are used to generate nucleic acid molecules that are capable of targeting sequences for differing hsp47 targets that share sequence homology. As such, one advantage of using siNAs disclosed herein is that a single nucleic acid can be designed to include nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to the nucleotide sequence that is conserved between the homologous genes. In this approach, a single nucleic acid can be used to inhibit expression of more than one gene instead of using more than one nucleic acid molecule to target the different genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules may be used to target conserved sequences corresponding to a gene family or gene families such as hsp47 family genes. As such, nucleic acid molecules targeting multiple hsp47 targets can provide increased therapeutic effect. In addition, nucleic acid can be used to characterize pathways of gene function in a variety of applications. For example, nucleic acid molecules can be used to inhibit the activity of target gcnc(s) in a pathway to determine the function of uncharacterized gene(s) in gene function analysis, mRNA function analysis, or translational analysis. The nucleic acid molecules can be used to determine potential target gene pathways involved in various diseases and conditions toward pharmaceutical development. The nucleic acid molecules can be used to understand pathways of gene expression involved in, for example fibroses such as liver, kidney or pulmonary fibrosis, and/or inflammatory and proliferative traits, diseases, disorders, and/or conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compositions and methods provided herein include a nucleic acid molecule having RNAi activity against hsp47 RNA, where the nucleic acid molecule includes a sequence complementary to any RNA having hsp47 encoding sequence, such as those sequences having sequences as shown in Table I. In another embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule may have RNAi activity against hsp47 RNA, where the nucleic acid molecule includes a sequence complementary to an RNA having variant hsp47 encoding sequence, for example other mutant hsp47 genes not shown in Table I but known in the art to be associated with the maintenance and/or development of fibrosis. Chemical modifications as shown in Table I or otherwise described herein can be applied to any nucleic acid construct disclosed herein. In another embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule disclosed herein includes a nucleotide sequence that can interact with nucleotide sequence of a hsp47 gene and thereby mediate silencing of hsp47 gene expression, for example, wherein the nucleic acid molecule mediates regulation of hsp47 gene expression by cellular processes that modulate the chromatin structure or methylation patterns of the hsp47 gene and prevent transcription of the hsp47 gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules disclosed herein may have RNAi activity against hsp47 RNA, where the nucleic acid molecule includes a sequence complementary to any RNA having hsp47 encoding sequence, such as those sequences having GenBank Accession Nos. NM\n—\n001235. Nucleic acid molecules may have RNAi activity against hsp47 RNA, where the nucleic acid molecule includes a sequence complementary to an RNA having variant hsp47 encoding sequence, for example other mutant hsp47 genes known in the art to be associated with the maintenance and/or development of fibrosis. Nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein include a nucleotide sequence that can interact with nucleotide sequence of a hsp47 gene and thereby mediate silencing of hsp47 gene expression, e.g., where the nucleic acid molecule mediates regulation of hsp47 gene expression by cellular processes that modulate the chromatin structure or methylation patterns of the hsp47 gene and prevent transcription of the hsp47 gene.\n\n\n \nMethods of Treatment\n\n\n \n \n \nThe specific association of HSP47 with a diverse range of collagen types makes hsp47 a target for the treatment of fibrosis. Inhibition of hsp47 expression may prevent extracellular collagen I secretion. Sato et al. (Nat Biotechnol 2008; 26:431-442) explored this possibility by using siRNA for the inhibition hsp47 expression and preventing the progression of hepatic fibrosis in rats. Similarly, Chen et al. (Br J Dermatol 2007; 156: 1188-1195) and Wang et al. (Plast. Reconstr Surg 2003; 111: 1980-7) investigated the inhibition hsp47 expression by RNA interference technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, nucleic acid molecules may be used to down regulate or inhibit the expression of hsp47 and/or hsp47 proteins arising from hsp47 and/or hsp47 haplotype polymorphisms that are associated with a disease or condition, (e.g., fibrosis). Analysis of hsp47 and/or hsp47 genes, or hsp47 and/or hsp47 protein or RNA levels can be used to identify subjects with such polymorphisms or those subjects who are at risk of developing traits, conditions, or diseases described herein. These subjects are amenable to treatment, for example, treatment with nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein and any other composition useful in treating diseases related to hsp47 and/or hsp47 gene expression. As such, analysis of hsp47 and/or hsp47 protein or RNA levels can be used to determine treatment type and the course of therapy in treating a subject. Monitoring of hsp47 and/or hsp47 protein or RNA levels can be used to predict treatment outcome and to determine the efficacy of compounds and compositions that modulate the level and/or activity of certain hsp47 and/or hsp47 proteins associated with a trait, condition, or disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProvided arc compositions and methods for inhibition of hsp47 expression by using small nucleic acid molecules as provided herein, such as short interfering nucleic acid (siNA), interfering RNA (RNAi), short interfering RNA (siRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA), and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules capable of mediating or that mediate RNA interference against hsp47 gene expression. The composition and methods disclosed herein arc also useful in treating various fibrosis such as liver fibrosis, lung fibrosis, and kidney fibrosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein individually, or in combination or in conjunction with other drugs, can be use for preventing or treating diseases, traits, conditions and/or disorders associated with hsp47, such as liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, peritoneal fibrosis, chronic hepatic damage, and fibrillogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein are able to inhibit the expression of hsp47 in a sequence specific manner. The nucleic acid molecules may include a sense strand and an antisense strand which include contiguous nucleotides that are at least partially complementary (antisense) to a hsp47 mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, dsRNA specific for hsp47 can be used in conjunction with other dsRNA specific for other molecular chaperones that assist in the folding of newly synthesized proteins such as, calnexin, calreticulin, BiP (Bergeron et al. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19:124-128; Herbert et al. 1995; Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 60:405-415)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFibrosis can be treated by RNA interference using nucleic acid molecules as disclosed herein. Exemplary fibrosis include liver fibrosis, peritoneal fibrosis, lung fibrosis, kidney fibrosis. The nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein may inhibit the expression of hsp47 in a sequence specific manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment of fibrosis can be monitored by determining the level of extracellular collagen using suitable techniques known in the art such as, using anti-collagen I antibodies. Treatment can also be monitored by determining the level of hsp47 mRNA or the level of HSP47 protein in the cells of the affected tissue. Treatment can also be monitored by non-invasive scanning of the affected organ or tissue such as by computer assisted tomography scan, magnetic resonance elastography scans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for treating or preventing hsp47 associated disease or condition in a subject or organism may include contacting the subject or organism with a nucleic acid molecule as provided herein under conditions suitable to modulate the expression of the hsp47 gene in the subject or organism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for treating or preventing fibrosis in a subject or organism may include contacting the subject or organism with a nucleic acid molecule under conditions suitable to modulate the expression of the hsp47 gene in the subject or organism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for treating or preventing one or more fibroses selected from the group consisting of liver fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis in a subject or organism may include contacting the subject or organism with a nucleic acid molecule under conditions suitable to modulate the expression of the hsp47 gene in the subject or organism.\n\n\n \nFibrotic Diseases\n\n\n \n \n \nFibrotic diseases are generally characterized by the excess deposition of a fibrous material within the extracellular matrix, which contributes to abnormal changes in tissue architecture and interferes with normal organ function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll tissues damaged by trauma respond by the initiation of a wound-healing program. Fibrosis, a type of disorder characterized by excessive scarring, occurs when the normal self-limiting process of wound healing response is disturbed, and causes excessive production and deposition of collagen. As a result, normal organ tissue is replaced with scar tissue, which eventually leads to the functional failure of the organ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFibrosis may be initiated by diverse causes and in various organs. Liver cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, keloids and kidney fibrosis are all chronic conditions associated with progressive fibrosis, thereby causing a continuous loss of normal tissue function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcute fibrosis (usually with a sudden and severe onset and of short duration) occurs as a common response to various forms of trauma including accidental injuries (particularly injuries to the spine and central nervous system), infections, surgery, ischemic illness (e.g. cardiac scarring following heart attack), burns, environmental pollutants, alcohol and other types of toxins, acute respiratory distress syndrome, radiation and chemotherapy treatments).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFibrosis, a fibrosis related pathology or a pathology related to aberrant crosslinking of cellular proteins may all be treated by the siRNAs disclosed herein. Fibrotic diseases or diseases in which fibrosis is evident (fibrosis related pathology) include both acute and chronic forms of fibrosis of organs, including all etiological variants of the following: pulmonary fibrosis, including interstitial lung disease and fibrotic lung disease, liver fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis including myocardial fibrosis, kidney fibrosis including chronic renal failure, skin fibrosis including scleroderma, keloids and hypertrophic scars; myelofibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis); all types of ocular scarring including proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and scarring resulting from surgery to treat cataract or glaucoma; inflammatory bowel disease of variable etiology, macular degeneration, Grave's ophthalmopathy, drug induced ergotism, keloid scars, scleroderma, psoriasis, glioblastoma in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, sporadic glioblastoma, myleoid leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproferative syndrome, gynecological cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, Hansen's disease, and collagenous colitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the compounds (nucleic acid molecules) as disclosed herein may be used to treat fibrotic diseases, for example as disclosed herein, as well as many other diseases and conditions apart from fibrotic diseases, for example such as disclosed herein. Other conditions to be treated include fibrotic diseases in other organs—kidney fibrosis for any reason (CKD including ESRD); lung fibrosis (including ILF); myelofibrosis, abnormal scarring (keloids) associated with all possible types of skin injury accidental and jatrogenic (operations); scleroderma; cardiofibrosis, failure of glaucoma filtering operation; intestinal adhesions.\n\n\n \nOcular Surgery and Fibrotic Complications\n\n\n \n \n \nContracture of scar tissue resulting from eye surgery may often occur. Glaucoma surgery to create new drainage channels often fails due to scarring and contraction of tissues and the generated drainage system may be blocked requiring additional surgical intervention. Current anti-scarring regimens (Mitomycin C or 5FU) are limited due to the complications involved (e.g. blindness) e.g. see Cordeiro M F, et al., Human anti-transforming growth factor-beta2 antibody: a new glaucoma anti-scarring agent Invest Ophthalmol V is Sci. 1999 September; 40(10):2225-34. There may also be contraction of scar tissue formed after corneal trauma or corneal surgery, for example laser or surgical treatment for myopia or refractive error in which contraction of tissues may lead to inaccurate results. Scar tissue may be formed on/in the vitreous humor or the retina, for example, and may eventually causes blindness in some diabetics, and may be formed after detachment surgery, called proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). PVR is the most common complication following retinal detachment and is associated with a retinal hole or break. PVR refers to the growth of cellular membranes within the vitreous cavity and on the front and back surfaces of the retina containing retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. These membranes, which are essentially scar tissues, exert traction on the retina and may result in recurrences of retinal detachment, even after an initially successful retinal detachment procedure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScar tissue may be formed in the orbit or on eye and eyelid muscles after squint, orbital or eyelid surgery, or thyroid eye disease, and where scarring of the conjunctiva occurs as may happen after glaucoma surgery or in cicatricial disease, inflammatory disease, for example, pemphigoid, or infective disease, for example, trachoma. A further eye problem associated with the contraction of collagen-including tissues is the opacification and contracture of the lens capsule after cataract extraction. Important role for MMPs has been recognized in ocular diseases including wound healing, dry eye, sterile corneal ulceration, recurrent epithelial erosion, corneal neovascularization, pterygium, conjuctivochalasis, glaucoma, PVR, and ocular fibrosis.\n\n\n \nLiver Fibrosis\n\n\n \n \n \nLiver fibrosis (LF) is a generally irreversible consequence of hepatic damage of several etiologies. In the Western world, the main etiologic categories are: alcoholic liver disease (30-50%), viral hepatitis (30%), biliary disease (5-10%), primary hemochromatosis (5%), and drug-related and cryptogenic cirrhosis of, unknown etiology, (10-15%). Wilson's disease, α\n1\n-antitrypsin deficiency and other rare diseases also have liver fibrosis as one of the symptoms. Liver cirrhosis, the end stage of liver fibrosis, frequently requires liver transplantation and is among the top ten causes of death in the Western world.\n\n\n \nKidney Fibrosis and Related Conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \nChronic Renal Failure (CRF)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChronic renal failure is a gradual and progressive loss of the ability of the kidneys to excrete wastes, concentrate urine, and conserve electrolytes. CRF is slowly progressive. It most often results from any disease that causes gradual loss of kidney function, and fibrosis is the main pathology that produces CRF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetic Nephropathy\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetic nephropathy, hallmarks of which are glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, is the single most prevalent cause of end-stage renal disease in the modern world, and diabetic patients constitute the largest population on dialysis. Such therapy is costly and far from optimal. Transplantation offers a better outcome but suffers from a severe shortage of donors.\n\n\n \nChronic Kidney Disease\n\n\n \n \n \nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem and is recognized as a common condition that is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and chronic renal failure (CRF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) of the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) defines chronic kidney disease as either kidney damage or a decreased kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for three or more months. Other markers of CKD are also known and used for diagnosis. In general, the destruction of renal mass with irreversible sclerosis and loss of nephrons leads to a progressive decline in GFR. Recently, the K/DOQI published a classification of the stages of CKD, as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStage 1: Kidney damage with normal or increased GFR (>90 mL/min/1.73 m2)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStage 2: Mild reduction in GFR (60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStage 3: Moderate reduction in GFR (30-59 mL/min./1.73 m2)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStage 4: Severe reduction in GFR (15-29 ml./min/1.73 m2)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStage 5: Kidney failure (GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or dialysis)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn stages 1 and 2 CKD, GFR alone does not confirm the diagnosis. Other markers of kidney damage, including abnormalities in the composition of blood or urine or abnormalities in imaging tests, may be relied upon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPathophysiology of CKD\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApproximately 1 million nephrons are present in each kidney, each contributing to the total GFR. Irrespective of the etiology of renal injury, with progressive destruction of nephrons, the kidney is able to maintain GFR by hyperfiltration and compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining healthy nephrons. This nephron adaptability allows for continued normal clearance of plasma solutes so that substances such as urea and creatinine start to show significant increases in plasma levels only after total GFR has decreased to 50%, when the renal reserve has been exhausted. The plasma creatinine value will approximately double with a 50% reduction in GFR. Therefore, a doubling in plasma creatinine from a baseline value of 0.6 mg/dL to 1.2 mg/dL in a patient actually represents a loss of 50% of functioning nephron mass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe residual nephron hyperfiltration and hypertrophy, although beneficial for the reasons noted, is thought to represent a major cause of progressive renal dysfunction. This is believed to occur because of increased glomerular capillary pressure, which damages the capillaries and leads initially to focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and eventually to global glomerulosclerosis. This hypothesis has been based on studies of five-sixths nephrectomized rats, which develop lesions that are identical to those observed in humans with CKD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe two most common causes of chronic kidney disease are diabetes and hypertension. Other factors include acute insults from nephrotoxins, including contrasting agents, or decreased perfusion; Proteinuria; Increased renal ammoniagenesis with interstitial injury; Hyperlipidemia; Hyperphosphatemia with calcium phosphate deposition; Decreased levels of nitrous oxide and smoking.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the United States, the incidence and prevalence of CKD is rising, with poor outcomes and high cost to the health system. Kidney disease is the ninth leading cause of death in the US. The high rate of mortality has led the US Surgeon General's mandate for America's citizenry, Healthy People 2010, to contain a chapter focused on CKD. The objectives of this chapter are to articulate goals and to provide strategies to reduce the incidence, morbidity, mortality, and health costs of chronic kidney disease in the United States.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe incidence rates of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have also increased steadily internationally since 1989. The United States has the highest incident rate of ESRD, followed by Japan. Japan has the highest prevalence per million population, followed by the US.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mortality rates associated with hemodialysis are striking and indicate that the life expectancy of patients entering into hemodialysis is markedly shortened. At every age, patients with ESRD on dialysis have significantly increased mortality when compared with nondialysis patients and individuals without kidney disease. At \nage\n 60 years, a healthy person can expect to live for more than 20 years, whereas the life expectancy of a 60-year-old patient starting hemodialysis is closer to 4 years (Aurora and Verelli, May 21, 2009. Chronic Renal Failure: Treatment & Medication. Emedicine. http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/238798-treatment).\n\n\n \nPulmonary Fibrosis\n\n\n \n \n \nInterstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is scarring of the lung caused by a variety of inhaled agents including mineral particles, organic dusts, and oxidant gases, or by unknown reasons (idiopathic lung fibrosis). The disease afflicts millions of individuals worldwide, and there are no effective therapeutic approaches. A major reason for the lack of useful treatments is that few of the molecular mechanisms of disease have been defined sufficiently to design appropriate targets for therapy (Lasky J A., Brody A R. (2000), “Interstitial fibrosis and growth factors”, Environ Health Perspect.;108 Suppl 4:751-62).\n\n\n \nCardiac Fibrosis\n\n\n \n \n \nHeart failure is unique among the major cardiovascular disorders in that it alone is increasing in prevalence while there has been a striking decrease in other conditions. Some of this can be attributed to the aging of the populations of the United States and Europe. The ability to salvage patients with myocardial damage is also a major factor, as these patients may develop progression of left ventricular dysfunction due to deleterious remodelling of the heart.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe normal myocardium is composed of a variety of cells, cardiac myocytes and noncardiomyocytes, which include endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStructural remodeling of the ventricular wall is a key determinant of clinical outcome in heart disease. Such remodeling involves the production and destruction of extracellular matrix proteins, cell proliferation and migration, and apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Cardiac fibroblasts are crucially involved in these processes, producing growth factors and cytokines that act as autocrine and paracrine factors, as well as extracellular matrix proteins and proteinases. Recent studies have shown that the interactions between cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes are essential for the progression of cardiac remodeling of which the net effect is deterioration in cardiac function and the onset of heart failure (Manabe I, et al., (2002), “Gene expression in fibroblasts and fibrosis: involvement in cardiac hypertrophy”, Circ Res. 13; 91(12):1103-13).\n\n\n \nBurns and Scars\n\n\n \n \n \nA particular problem which may arise, particularly in fibrotic disease, is contraction of tissues, for example contraction of scars. Contraction of tissues including extracellular matrix components, especially of collagen-including tissues, may occur in connection with many different pathological conditions and with surgical or cosmetic procedures. Contracture, for example, of scars, may cause physical problems, which may lead to the need for medical treatment, or it may cause problems of a purely cosmetic nature. Collagen is the major component of scar and other contracted tissue and as such is the most important structural component to consider. Nevertheless, scar and other contracted tissue also includes other structural components, especially other extracellular matrix components, for example, elastin, which may also contribute to contraction of the tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nContraction of collagen-including tissue, which may also include other extracellular matrix components, frequently occurs in the healing of burns. The burns may be chemical, thermal or radiation burns and may be of the eye, the surface of the skin or the skin and the underlying tissues. It may also be the case that there are burns on internal tissues, for example, caused by radiation treatment. Contraction of burnt tissues is often a problem and may lead to physical and/or cosmetic problems, for example, loss of movement and/or disfigurement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSkin grafts may be applied for a variety of reasons and may often undergo contraction after application. As with the healing of burnt tissues the contraction may lead to both physical and cosmetic problems. It is a particularly serious problem where many skin grafts are needed as, for example, in a serious burns case.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nContraction is also a problem in production of artificial skin. To make a true artificial skin it is necessary to have an epidermis made of epithelial cells (keratinocytes) and a dermis made of collagen populated with fibroblasts. It is important to have both types of cells because they signal and stimulate each other using growth factors. The collagen component of the artificial skin often contracts to less than one tenth of its original area when populated by fibroblasts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCicatricial contraction, contraction due to shrinkage of the fibrous tissue of a scar, is common. In some cases the scar may become a vicious cicatrix, a scar in which the contraction causes serious deformity. A patient's stomach may be effectively separated into two separate chambers in an hour-glass contracture by the contraction of scar tissue formed when a stomach ulcer heals. Obstruction of passages and ducts, cicatricial stenosis, may occur due to the contraction of scar tissue. Contraction of blood vessels may be due to primary obstruction or surgical trauma, for example, after surgery or angioplasty. Stenosis of other hollow visci, for examples, ureters, may also occur. Problems may occur where any form of scarring takes place, whether resulting from accidental wounds or from surgery. Conditions of the skin and tendons which involve contraction of collagen-including tissues include post-trauma conditions resulting from surgery or accidents, for example, hand or foot tendon injuries, post-graft conditions and pathological conditions, such as scleroderma, Dupuytren's contracture and epidermolysis bullosa. Scarring and contraction of tissues in the eye may occur in various conditions, for example, the sequelae of retinal detachment or diabetic eye disease (as mentioned above). Contraction of the sockets found in the skull for the eyeballs and associated structures, including extra-ocular muscles and eyelids, may occur if there is trauma or inflammatory damage. The tissues contract within the sockets causing a variety of problems including double vision and an unsightly appearance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor further information on different types of fibrosis see: Molina V, et al., (2002), “Fibrotic diseases”, Harefuah, 141(11): 973-8, 1009; Yu L, et al., (2002), “Therapeutic strategies to halt renal fibrosis”, Curr Opin Pharmacol. 2(2):177-81; Keane WF and Lyle P A.

These protocols can be utilized for the delivery of virtually any nucleic acid molecule. Nucleic acid molecules can be administered to cells by a variety of methods known to those of skill in the art, including, but not restricted to, encapsulation in liposomes, by iontophoresis, or by incorporation into other vehicles, such as biodegradable polymers, hydrogels, cyclodextrins (see e.g., Gonzalez et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 10: 1068-1074 (1999); Wang et al., International PCT publication Nos. WO 03/47518 and WO 03/46185), poly(lactic-co-glycolic)acid (PLGA) and PLCA microspheres (see for example U.S. Pat.

These formulations offer a method for increasing the accumulation of drugs in target tissues. This class of drug carriers resists opsonization and elimination by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS or RES), thereby enabling longer blood circulation times and enhanced tissue exposure for the encapsulated drug (Lasic et al. Chem. Rev. 1995, 95, 2601-2627; Ishiwata et al., Chem. Pharm.

No. 6,586,524 and United States Patent Application Publication No. 20030077829.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules may be complexed with membrane disruptive agents such as those described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20010007666. The membrane disruptive agent or agents and the nucleic acid molecule may also be complexed with a cationic lipid or helper lipid molecule, such as those lipids described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,310.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid molecules may be administered via pulmonary delivery, such as by inhalation of an aerosol or spray dried formulation administered by an inhalation device or nebulizer, providing rapid local uptake of the nucleic acid molecules into relevant pulmonary tissues. Solid particulate compositions containing respirable dry particles of micronized nucleic acid compositions can be prepared by grinding dried or lyophilized nucleic acid compositions, and then passing the micronized composition through, for example, a 400 mesh screen to break up or separate out large agglomerates. A solid particulate composition comprising the nucleic acid compositions of the invention can optionally contain a dispersant which serves to facilitate the formation of an aerosol as well as other therapeutic compounds. A suitable dispersant is lactose, which can be blended with the nucleic acid compound in any suitable ratio, such as a 1 to 1 ratio by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAerosols of liquid particles may include a nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein and can be produced by any suitable means, such as with a nebulizer (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,501,729). Nebulizers are commercially available devices which transform solutions or suspensions of an active ingredient into a therapeutic aerosol mist either by means of acceleration of a compressed gas, typically air or oxygen, through a narrow venturi orifice or by means of ultrasonic agitation. Suitable formulations for use in nebulizers include the active ingredient in a liquid carrier in an amount of up to 40% w/w preferably less than 20% w/w of the formulation. The carrier is typically water or a dilute aqueous alcoholic solution, preferably made isotonic with body fluids by the addition of, e.g., sodium chloride or other suitable salts. Optional additives include preservatives if the formulation is not prepared sterile, e.g., methyl hydroxybenzoate, anti-oxidants, flavorings, volatile oils, buffering agents and emulsifiers and other formulation surfactants. The aerosols of solid particles including the active composition and surfactant can likewise be produced with any solid particulate aerosol generator. Aerosol generators for administering solid particulate therapeutics to a subject produce particles which are respirable, as explained above, and generate a volume of aerosol containing a predetermined metered dose of a therapeutic composition at a rate suitable for human administration. One illustrative type of solid particulate aerosol generator is an insufflator. Suitable formulations for administration by insufflation include finely comminuted powders which can be delivered by means of an insufflator. In the insufflator, the powder, e.g., a metered dose thereof effective to carry out the treatments described herein, is contained in capsules or cartridges, typically made of gelatin or plastic, which are either pierced or opened in situ and the powder delivered by air drawn through the device upon inhalation or by means of a manually-operated pump. The powder employed in the insufflator consists either solely of the active ingredient or of a powder blend comprising the active ingredient, a suitable powder diluent, such as lactose, and an optional surfactant. The active ingredient typically includes from 0.1 to 100 w/w of the formulation. A second type of illustrative aerosol generator includes a metered dose inhaler. Metered dose inhalers are pressurized aerosol dispensers, typically containing a suspension or solution formulation of the active ingredient in a liquefied propellant. During use these devices discharge the formulation through a valve adapted to deliver a metered volume to produce a fine particle spray containing the active ingredient. Suitable propellants include certain chlorofluorocarbon compounds, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane and mixtures thereof. The formulation can additionally contain one or more co-solvents, for example, ethanol, emulsifiers and other formulation surfactants, such as oleic acid or sorbitan trioleate, anti-oxidants and suitable flavoring agents. Other methods for pulmonary delivery are described in, e.g., US Patent Application No. 20040037780, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,592,904; 6,582,728; 6,565,885. PCT Patent Publication No. WO2008/132723 relates to aerosol delivery of oligonucleotides in general, and of siRNA in particular, to the respiratory system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules may be administered to the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS). Experiments have demonstrated the efficient in vivo uptake of nucleic acids by neurons. See e.g., Sommer et al., 1998, Antisense Nuc. Acid Drug Dev., 8, 75; Epa et al., 2000, Antisense Nuc. Acid Drug Dev., 10, 469; Broaddus et al., 1998, J. Neurosurg., 88(4), 734; Karle et al., 1997, Eur. J. Pharmocol., 340(2/3), 153; Bannai et al., 1998, Brain Research, 784(1,2), 304; Rajakumar et al., 1997, Synapse, 26(3), 199; Wu-pong et al., 1999, BioPharm, 12(1), 32; Bannai et al., 1998, Brain Res. Protoc., 3(1), 83; and Simantov et al., 1996, Neuroscience, 74(1), 39. Nucleic acid molecules are therefore amenable to delivery to and uptake by cells in the CNS and/or PNS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery of nucleic acid molecules to the CNS is provided by a variety of different strategies. Traditional approaches to CNS delivery that can be used include, but are not limited to, intrathecal and intracerebroventricular administration, implantation of catheters and pumps, direct injection or perfusion at the site of injury or lesion, injection into the brain arterial system, or by chemical or osmotic opening of the blood-brain barrier. Other approaches can include the use of various transport and carrier systems, for example though the use of conjugates and biodegradable polymers. Furthermore, gene therapy approaches, e.g., as described in Kaplitt et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,613 and Davidson, WO 04/013280, can be used to express nucleic acid molecules in the CNS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery systems may include, for example, aqueous and nonaqueous gels, creams, multiple emulsions, microemulsions, liposomes, ointments, aqueous and nonaqueous solutions, lotions, aerosols, hydrocarbon bases and powders, and can contain excipients such as solubilizers, permeation enhancers (e.g., fatty acids, fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols and amino acids), and hydrophilic polymers (e.g., polycarbophil and polyvinylpyrolidone). In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is a liposome or a transdermal enhancer. Examples of liposomes which can be used in this invention include the following: (1) CellFectin, 1:1.5 (M/M) liposome formulation of the cationic lipid N,NI,NII,NIII-tetramethyl-N,NI,NII,NIII-tetrapalmit-y-spermine and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) (GIBCO BRL); (2) Cytofectin GSV, 2:1 (M/M) liposome formulation of a cationic lipid and DOPE (Glen Research); (3) DOTAP(N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)-N,N,N-tri-methyl-ammoniummethylsulfate) (Boehringer Manheim); and (4) Lipofectamine, 3:1 (M/M) liposome formulation of the polycationic lipid DOSPA, the neutral lipid DOPE (GIBCO BRL) and Di-Alkylated Amino Acid (DiLA2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery systems may include patches, tablets, suppositories, pessaries, gels and creams, and can contain excipients such as solubilizers and enhancers (e.g., propylene glycol, bile salts and amino acids), and other vehicles (e.g., polyethylene glycol, fatty acid esters and derivatives, and hydrophilic polymers such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and hyaluronic acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules may be formulated or complexed with polyethylenimine (e.g., linear or branched PEI) and/or polyethylenimine derivatives, including for example grafted PEIs such as galactose PEI, cholesterol PEI, antibody derivatized PEI, and polyethylene glycol PEI (PEG-PEI) derivatives thereof (see for example Ogris et al., 2001, AAPA PharmSci, 3, 1-11; Furgeson et al., 2003, Bioconjugate Chem., 14, 840-847; Kunath et al., 2002, Pharmaceutical Research, 19, 810-817; Choi et al., 2001, Bull. Korean Chem. Soc., 22, 46-52; Bettinger et al., 1999, Bioconjugate Chem., 10, 558-561; Peterson et al., 2002, Bioconjugate Chem., 13, 845-854; Erbacher et al., 1999, Journal of Gene Medicine Preprint, 1, 1-18; Godbey et al., 1999., PNAS USA, 96, 5177-5181; Godbey et al., 1999, Journal of Controlled Release, 60, 149-160; Diebold et al., 1999, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 274, 19087-19094; Thomas and Klibanov, 2002, PNAS USA, 99, 14640-14645; and Sagara, U.S. Pat. No. 6,586,524.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules may include a bioconjugate, for example a nucleic acid conjugate as described in Vargeese et al., U.S. Ser. No. 10/427,160; U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,631; U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,434; U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,886; U.S. Pat. No. 6,153,737; U.S. Pat. No. 5,214,136; U.S. Pat. No. 5,138,045.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions, methods and kits disclosed herein may include an expression vector that includes a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one nucleic acid molecule of the invention in a manner that allows expression of the nucleic acid molecule. Methods of introducing nucleic acid molecules or one or more vectors capable of expressing the strands of dsRNA into the environment of the cell will depend on the type of cell and the make up of its environment. The nucleic acid molecule or the vector construct may be directly introduced into the cell (i.e., intracellularly); or introduced extracellularly into a cavity, interstitial space, into the circulation of an organism, introduced orally, or may be introduced by bathing an organism or a cell in a solution containing dsRNA. The cell is preferably a mammalian cell; more preferably a human cell. The nucleic acid molecule of the expression vector can include a sense region and an antisense region. The antisense region can include a sequence complementary to a RNA or DNA sequence encoding hsp47 and the sense region can include a sequence complementary to the antisense region. The nucleic acid molecule can include two distinct strands having complementary sense and antisense regions. The nucleic acid molecule can include a single strand having complementary sense and antisense regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules that interact with target RNA molecules and down-regulate gene encoding target RNA molecules (e.g., target RNA molecules referred to by Genbank Accession numbers herein) may be expressed from transcription units inserted into DNA or RNA vectors. Recombinant vectors can be DNA plasmids or viral vectors. Nucleic acid molecule expressing viral vectors can be constructed based on, but not limited to, adeno-associated virus, retrovirus, adenovirus, or alphavirus. The recombinant vectors capable of expressing the nucleic acid molecules can be delivered as described herein, and persist in target cells. Alternatively, viral vectors can be used that provide for transient expression of nucleic acid molecules. Such vectors can be repeatedly administered as necessary. Once expressed, the nucleic acid molecules bind and down-regulate gene function or expression via RNA interference (RNAi). Delivery of nucleic acid molecule expressing vectors can be systemic, such as by intravenous or intramuscular administration, by administration to target cells ex-planted from a subject followed by reintroduction into the subject, or by any other means that would allow for introduction into the desired target cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors may include a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one nucleic acid molecule disclosed herein, in a manner which allows expression of the nucleic acid molecule. For example, the vector may contain sequence(s) encoding both strands of a nucleic acid molecule that include a duplex. The vector can also contain sequence(s) encoding a single nucleic acid molecule that is self-complementary and thus forms a nucleic acid molecule. Non-limiting examples of such expression vectors are described in Paul et al., 2002, Nature Biotechnology, 19, 505; Miyagishi and Taira, 2002, Nature Biotechnology, 19, 497; Lee et al., 2002, Nature Biotechnology, 19, 500; and Novina et al., 2002, Nature Medicine, advance online publication doi:10.1038/nm725. Expression vectors may also be included in a mammalian (e.g., human) cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn expression vector may include a nucleic acid sequence encoding two or more nucleic acid molecules, which can be the same or different. Expression vectors may include a sequence for a nucleic acid molecule complementary to a nucleic acid molecule referred to by a Genbank Accession number NM\n—\n001235, for example those shown in Table I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn expression vector may encode one or both strands of a nucleic acid duplex, or a single self-complementary strand that self hybridizes into a nucleic acid duplex. The nucleic acid sequences encoding nucleic acid molecules can be operably linked in a manner that allows expression of the nucleic acid molecule (see for example Paul et al., 2002, Nature Biotechnology, 19, 505; Miyagishi and Taira, 2002, Nature Biotechnology, 19, 497; Lee et al., 2002, Nature Biotechnology, 19, 500; and Novina et al., 2002, Nature Medicine, advance online publication doi:10.1038/nm725).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn expression vector may include one or more of the following: a) a transcription initiation region (e.g., eukaryotic pol I, II or III initiation region); b) a transcription termination region (e.g., eukaryotic pol I, II or III termination region); c) an intron and d) a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one of the nucleic acid molecules, wherein said sequence is operably linked to the initiation region and the termination region in a manner that allows expression and/or delivery of the nucleic acid molecule. The vector can optionally include an open reading frame (ORF) for a protein operably linked on the 5′ side or the 3′-side of the sequence encoding the nucleic acid molecule; and/or an intron (intervening sequences).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscription of the nucleic acid molecule sequences can be driven from a promoter for eukaryotic RNA polymerase I (pol I), RNA polymerase II (pol II), or RNA polymerase III (pol III). Transcripts from pol II or pol III promoters are expressed at high levels in all cells; the levels of a given pol II promoter in a given cell type depends on the nature of the gene regulatory sequences (enhancers, silencers, etc.) present nearby. Prokaryotic RNA polymerase promoters are also used, providing that the prokaryotic RNA polymerase enzyme is expressed in the appropriate cells (Elroy-Stein and Moss, 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87, 6743-7; Gao and Huang 1993, Nucleic Acids Res., 21, 2867-72; Lieber et al., 1993, Methods Enzymol., 217, 47-66; Zhou et al., 1990, Mol. Cell. Biol., 10, 4529-37). Several investigators have demonstrated that nucleic acid molecules expressed from such promoters can function in mammalian cells (e.g. Kashani-Sabet et al., 1992, Antisense Res. Dev., 2, 3-15; Ojwang et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89, 10802-6; Chen et al., 1992, Nucleic Acids Res., 20, 4581-9; Yu et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90, 6340-4; L′Huillier et al., 1992, EMBO J., 11, 4411-8; Lisziewicz et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A, 90, 8000-4; Thompson et al., 1995, Nucleic Acids Res., 23, 2259; Sullenger & Cech, 1993, Science, 262, 1566). More specifically, transcription units such as the ones derived from genes encoding U6 small nuclear (snRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and adenovirus VA RNA are useful in generating high concentrations of desired RNA molecules such as siNA in cells (Thompson et al., supra; Couture and Stinchcomb, 1996, supra; Noonberg et al., 1994, Nucleic Acid Res., 22, 2830; Noonberg et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,803; Good et al., 1997, Gene Ther., 4, 45; Beigelman et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 96/18736. The above nucleic acid transcription units can be incorporated into a variety of vectors for introduction into mammalian cells, including but not restricted to, plasmid DNA vectors, viral DNA vectors (such as adenovirus or adeno-associated virus vectors), or viral RNA vectors (such as retroviral or alphavirus vectors) (see Couture and Stinchcomb, 1996 supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecule may be expressed within cells from eukaryotic promoters (e.g., Izant and Weintraub, 1985, Science, 229, 345; McGarry and Lindquist, 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 83, 399; Scanlon et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88, 10591-5; Kashani-Sabet et al., 1992, Antisense Res. Dev., 2, 3-15; propulic et al., 1992, J. Virol., 66, 1432-41; Weerasinghe et al., 1991, J. Virol., 65, 5531-4; Ojwang et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89, 10802-6; Chen et al., 1992, Nucleic Acids Res. 20, 4581-9; Sarver et al., 1990 Science, 247, 1222-1225; Thompson et al., 1995, Nucleic Acids Res., 23, 2259; Good et al., 1997, Gene Therapy, 4, 45. Those skilled in the art realize that any nucleic acid can be expressed in eukaryotic cells from the appropriate DNA/RNA vector. The activity of such nucleic acids can be augmented by their release from the primary transcript by a enzymatic nucleic acid (Draper et al., PCT WO 93/23569, and Sullivan et al., PCT WO 94/02595; Ohkawa et al., 1992, Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser., 27, 15-6; Taira et al., 1991, Nucleic Acids Res., 19, 5125-30; Ventura et al., 1993, Nucleic Acids Res., 21, 3249-55; Chowrira et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem., 269, 25856.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA viral construct packaged into a viral particle would accomplish both efficient introduction of an expression construct into the cell and transcription of dsRNA construct encoded by the expression construct.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for oral introduction include direct mixing of RNA with food of the organism, as well as engineered approaches in which a species that is used as food is engineered to express an RNA, then fed to the organism to be affected. Physical methods may be employed to introduce a nucleic acid molecule solution into the cell. Physical methods of introducing nucleic acids include injection of a solution containing the nucleic acid molecule, bombardment by particles covered by the nucleic acid molecule, soaking the cell or organism in a solution of the RNA, or electroporation of cell membranes in the presence of the nucleic acid molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther methods known in the art for introducing nucleic acids to cells may be used, such as lipid-mediated carrier transport, chemical mediated transport, such as calcium phosphate, and the like. Thus the nucleic acid molecules may be introduced along with components that perform one or more of the following activities: enhance RNA uptake by the cell, promote annealing of the duplex strands, stabilize the annealed strands, or other-wise increase inhibition of the target gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid molecules or the vector construct can be introduced into the cell using suitable formulations. One preferable formulation is with a lipid formulation such as in Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA), vitamin A coupled liposomes (Sato et al. Nat Biotechnol 2008; 26:431-442, PCT Patent Publication No. WO 2006/068232). Lipid formulations can also be administered to animals such as by intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal injection, or orally or by inhalation or other methods as are known in the art. When the formulation is suitable for administration into animals such as mammals and more specifically humans, the formulation is also pharmaceutically acceptable. Pharmaceutically acceptable formulations for administering oligonucleotides are known and can be used. In some instances, it may be preferable to formulate dsRNA in a buffer or saline solution and directly inject the formulated dsRNA into cells, as in studies with oocytes. The direct injection of dsRNA duplexes may also be done. For suitable methods of introducing dsRNA see U.S. published patent application No. 2004/0203145, 20070265220 which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymeric nanocapsules or microcapsules facilitate transport and release of the encapsulated or bound dsRNA into the cell. They include polymeric and monomeric materials, especially including polybutylcyanoacrylate. A summary of materials and fabrication methods has been published (see Kreuter, 1991). The polymeric materials which are formed from monomeric and/or oligomeric precursors in the polymerization/nanoparticle generation step, are per se known from the prior art, as are the molecular weights and molecular weight distribution of the polymeric material which a person skilled in the field of manufacturing nanoparticles may suitably select in accordance with the usual skill.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid moles may be formulated as a microemulsion. A microemulsion is a system of water, oil and amphiphile which is a single optically isotropic and thermodynamically stable liquid solution. Typically microemulsions are prepared by first dispersing an oil in an aqueous surfactant solution and then adding a sufficient amount of a 4th component, generally an intermediate chain-length alcohol to form a transparent system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurfactants that may be used in the preparation of microemulsions include, but are not limited to, ionic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants, Brij 96, polyoxyethylene oleyl ethers, polyglycerol fatty acid esters, tetraglycerol monolaurate (ML310), tetraglycerol monooleate (MO310), hexaglycerol monooleate (PO310), hexaglycerol pentaoleate (PO500), decaglycerol monocaprate (MCA750), decaglycerol monooleate (MO750), decaglycerol sequioleate (SO750), decaglycerol decaoleate (DA0750), alone or in combination with cosurfactants. The cosurfactant, usually a short-chain alcohol such as ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol, serves to increase the interfacial fluidity by penetrating into the surfactant film and consequently creating a disordered film because of the void space generated among surfactant molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWater Soluble Crosslinked Polymers\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery formulations can include water soluble degradable crosslinked polymers that include one or more degradable crosslinking lipid moiety, one or more PEI moiety, and/or one or more mPEG (methyl ether derivative of PEG (tnethoxypoly(ethylene glycol)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDegradable lipid moieties preferably include compounds having the following structural motif:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above formula, ester linkages are biodegradable groups, R represents a relatively hydrophobic “lipo” group, and the structural motif shown occurs m times where m is in the range of about 1 to about 30. For example, in certain embodiments R is selected from the group consisting of C2-C50 alkyl, C2-C50 heteroalkyl, C2-C50 alkenyl, C2-C50 heteroalkenyl, C5-C50 aryl; C2-C50 heteroaryl; C2-C50 alkynyl, C2-C50 heteroalkynyl, C2-C50 carboxyalkenyl, and C2-C50 carboxyheteroalkenyl. In preferred embodiments. R is a saturated or unsaturated alkyl having 4 to 30 carbons, more preferably 8 to 24 carbons or a sterol, preferably a cholesteryl moiety. In preferred embodiments, R is oleic, lauric, myristic, palmitic margaric, stearic, arachidic, behenic, or lignoceric. In a most preferred embodiment, R is oleic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe N in formula (B) may have an electron pair or a bond to a hydrogen atom. When N has an electron pair, the recurring unit may be cationic at low pH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe degradable crosslinking lipid moiety may be reacted with a polyethyleneimine (PEI) as shown in Scheme A below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn formula (A), R has the same meanings as described above. The PEI may contain recurring units of formula (B) in which x is an integer in the range of about 1 to about 100 and y is an integer in the range of about 1 to about 100.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction illustrated in Scheme A may be carried out by intermixing the PEI and the diacrylate (I) in a mutual solvent such as ethanol, methanol or dichloromethane with stirring, preferably at room temperature for several hours, then evaporating the solvent to recover the resulting polymer. While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the reaction between the PEI and diacrylate (I) involves a Michael reaction between one or more amines of the PEI with double bond(s) of the diacrylate (see J. March, \nAdvanced Organic Chemistry\n 3\nrd \nEd, pp. 711-712 (1985)). The di acrylate shown in Scheme A may be prepared in the manner as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 11/216,986 (US Publication No. 2006/0258751).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe molecular weight of the PEI is preferably in the range of about 200 to 25,000 Daltons more preferably 400 to 5,000 Daltons, yet more preferably 600 to 2000 Daltons. PEI may be either branched or linear.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe molar ratio of PEI to diacrylate is preferably in the range of about 1:2 to about 1:20. The weight average molecular weight of the cationic lipopolymer may be in the range of about 500 Daltons to about 1,000,000 Daltons preferably in the range of about 2,000 Daltons to about 200.000 Daltons. Molecular weights may be determined by size exclusion chromatography using PEG standards or by agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cationic lipopolymer is preferably degradable, more preferably biodegradable, e.g., degradable by a mechanism selected from the group consisting of hydrolysis, enzyme cleavage, reduction, photo-cleavage, and sonication. While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, but it is believed that degradation of the cationic lipopolymer of formula (II) within the cell proceeds by enzymatic cleavage and/or hydrolysis of the ester linkages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis may be carried out by reacting the degradable lipid moiety with the PEI moiety as described above. Then the mPEG (methyl ether derivative of PEG (methoxypoly (ethylene glycol)), is added to form the degradable crosslinked polymer. In preferred embodiments, the reaction is carried out at room temperature. The reaction products may be isolated by any means known in the art including chromatographic techniques. In a preferred embodiment, the reaction product may be removed by precipitation followed by centrifugation.\n\n\n \nDosages\n\n\n \n \n \nThe useful dosage to be administered and the particular mode of administration will vary depending upon such factors as the cell type, or for in vivo use, the age, weight and the particular animal and region thereof to be treated, the particular nucleic acid and delivery method used, the therapeutic or diagnostic use contemplated, and the form of the formulation, for example, suspension, emulsion, micelle or liposome, as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Typically, dosage is administered at lower levels and increased until the desired effect is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen lipids are used to deliver the nucleic acid, the amount of lipid compound that is administered can vary and generally depends upon the amount of nucleic acid being administered. For example, the weight ratio of lipid compound to nucleic acid is preferably from about 1:1 to about 30:1, with a weight ratio of about 5:1 to about 10:1 being more preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable dosage unit of nucleic acid molecules may be in the range of 0.001 to 0.25 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, or in the range of 0.01 to 20 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, or in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, or in the range of 0.10 to 5 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, or in the range of 0.1 to 2.5 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable amounts of nucleic acid molecules may be introduced and these amounts can be empirically determined using standard methods. Effective concentrations of individual nucleic acid molecule species in the environment of a cell may be about 1 femtomolar, about 50 femtomolar, 100 femtomolar, 1 picomolar, 1.5 picomolar, 2.5 picomolar, 5 picomolar, 10 picomolar, 25 picomolar, 50 picomolar, 100 picomolar, 500 picomolar, 1 nanomolar, 2.5 nanomolar, 5 nanomolar, 10 nanomolar, 25 nanomolar, 50 nanomolar, 100 nanomolar, 500 nanomolar, 1 micromolar, 2.5 micromolar, 5 micromolar, 10 micromolar, 100 micromolar or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage may be from 0.01 □g to 1 g per kg of body weight (e.g., 0.1 □g, 0.25 □g, 0.5 □g, 0.75 □g, 1 □g, 2.5 □g, 5 □g, 10 □g, 25 □g, 50 □g, 100 □g, 250 □g, 500 □g, 1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, or 500 mg per kg).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage levels of the order of from about 0.1 mg to about 140 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions (about 0.5 mg to about 7 g per subject per day). The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form varies depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Dosage unit forms generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood that the specific dose level for any particular subject depends upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions that include the nucleic acid molecule disclosed herein may be administered once daily, qid, tid, bid, QD, or at any interval and for any duration that is medically appropriate. However, the therapeutic agent may also be dosed in dosage units containing two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day. In that case, the nucleic acid molecules contained in each sub-dose may be correspondingly smaller in order to achieve the total daily dosage unit. The dosage unit can also be compounded for a single dose over several days, e.g., using a conventional sustained release formulation which provides sustained and consistent release of the dsRNA over a several day period. Sustained release formulations are well known in the art. The dosage unit may contain a corresponding multiple of the daily dose. The composition can be compounded in such a way that the sum of the multiple units of a nucleic acid together contain a sufficient dose.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions, Kits, and Containers\n\n\n \n \n \nAlso provided are compositions, kits, containers and formulations that include a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., an siNA molecule) as provided herein for reducing expression of hsp47 for administering or distributing the nucleic acid molecule to a patient. A kit may include at least one container and at least one label. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, and test tubes. The containers can be formed from a variety of materials such as glass, metal or plastic. The container can hold amino acid sequence(s), small molecule(s), nucleic acid sequence(s), cell population(s) and/or antibody(s). In one embodiment, the container holds a polynucleotide for use in examining the mRNA expression profile of a cell, together with reagents used for this purpose. In another embodiment a container includes an antibody, binding fragment thereof or specific binding protein for use in evaluating hsp47 protein expression cells and tissues, or for relevant laboratory, prognostic, diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic purposes; indications and/or directions for such uses can be included on or with such container, as can reagents and other compositions or tools used for these purposes. Kits may further include associated indications and/or directions; reagents and other compositions or tools used for such purpose can also be included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe container can alternatively hold a composition that is effective for treating, diagnosis, prognosing or prophylaxing a condition and can have a sterile access port (for example the container can be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). The active agents in the composition can be a nucleic acid molecule capable of specifically binding hsp47 and/or modulating the function of hsp47.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA kit may further include a second container that includes a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and/or dextrose solution. It can further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, stirrers, needles, syringes, and/or package inserts with indications and/or instructions for use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe units dosage ampoules or multidose containers, in which the nucleic acid molecules are packaged prior to use, may include an hermetically sealed container enclosing an amount of polynucleotide or solution containing a polynucleotide suitable for a pharmaceutically effective dose thereof, or multiples of an effective dose. The polynucleotide is packaged as a sterile formulation, and the hermetically sealed container is designed to preserve sterility of the formulation until use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe container in which the polynucleotide including a sequence encoding a cellular immune response element or fragment thereof may include a package that is labeled, and the label may bear a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency, for example the Food and Drug Administration, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency under Federal law, of the manufacture, use, or sale of the polynucleotide material therein for human administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFederal law requires that the use of pharmaceutical compositions in the therapy of humans be approved by an agency of the Federal government. In the United States, enforcement is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration, which issues appropriate regulations for securing such approval, detailed in 21 U.S.C. §301-392. Regulation for biologic material, including products made from the tissues of animals is provided under 42 U.S.C. §262. Similar approval is required by most foreign countries. Regulations vary from country to country, but individual procedures are well known to those in the art and the compositions and methods provided herein preferably comply accordingly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage to be administered depends to a large extent on the condition and size of the subject being treated as well as the frequency of treatment and the route of administration. Regimens for continuing therapy, including dose and frequency may be guided by the initial response and clinical judgment. The parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues is preferred, although other parenteral routes, such as inhalation of an aerosol formulation, may be required in specific administration, as for example to the mucous membranes of the nose, throat, bronchial tissues or lungs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs such, provided herein is a pharmaceutical product which may include a polynucleotide including a sequence encoding a cellular immune response element or fragment thereof in solution in a pharmaceutically acceptable injectable carrier and suitable for introduction interstitially into a tissue to cause cells of the tissue to express a cellular immune response element or fragment thereof, a container enclosing the solution, and a notice associated with the container in form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use, or sale of pharmaceuticals, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of manufacture, use, or sale of the solution of polynucleotide for human administration.\n\n\n \nIndications\n\n\n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein can be used to treat diseases, conditions or disorders associated with hsp47, such as liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, peritoneal fibrosis, chronic hepatic damage, and fibrillogenesis and any other disease or conditions that are related to or will respond to the levels of hsp47 in a cell or tissue, alone or in combination with other therapies. As such, compositions, kits and methods disclosed herein may include packaging a nucleic acid molecule disclosed herein that includes a label or package insert. The label may include indications for use of the nucleic acid molecules such as use for treatment or prevention of liver fibrosis, peritoneal fibrosis, kidney fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis, and any other disease or conditions that are related to or will respond to the levels of hsp47 in a cell or tissue, alone or in combination with other therapies. A label may include an indication for use in reducing expression of hsp47. A “package insert” is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications, other therapeutic products to be combined with the packaged product, and/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art will recognize that other anti-fibrosis treatments, drugs and therapies known in the art can be readily combined with the nucleic acid molecules herein (e.g. siNA molecules) and are hence contemplated herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods and compositions provided herein will now be described in greater detail by reference to the following non-limiting examples.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nSelecting hsp47 Nucleic Acid Molecule Sequences\n\n\n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA ≦25 nucleotides) against Hsp47 were designed using several computer programs including si RNA at Whitehead (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research), IDT siRNA Design (Integrated DNA Technologies), BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer (Invitrogen), siDESIGN Center (Dharmacon), and BIOPREDsi (Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, part of the Novartis Research Foundation, available at http://www.biopredsi.orgistart.html). The sequences of top scored siRNAs from these programs were compared and selected (see Table 1) based on the algorithms as well as the sequence homology between human and rat. Candidate sequences were validated by in vitro knocking down assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral parameters were considered for selecting a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a 21-mer siRNA) sequence. Exemplary parameters include:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1) thermodynamic stability (RISC favors the strand with less stable 5′ end)\n \n2) 30-52% GC content\n \n3) positional nucleotide preference:\n \n(C/G)NNNNNNNN(A/U)10NNNNNNNN(A/U), where N is any nucleotide\n \n4) devoid of putative immunostimulatory motifs\n \n5) 2-\nnucleotide\n 3′ overhang\n \n6) position of siRNA within the transcript (preferably within cDNA region)\n \n7) sequence specificity (checked by using BLAST)\n \n8) variations in single nucleotide by checking SNP database\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nsiRNA sequences having ≦25 nucleotides were designed based on the foregoing methods. Corresponding Dicer substrate siRNA (e.g., ≧26 nucleotides) were designed based on the smaller sequences and extend the target site of the siNA ≦2.5 nucleotide by adding 4 bases to the 3′-end of the sense strand and 6 bases to the 5′-end of the antisense strand. The Dicer substrates that were made generally have a 25 base sense strand a 27 base antisense strand with an asymmetric blunt ended and 3′-overhang molecule. The sequences of the sense and the anti-sense strand without base modification (base sequence) and with modifications (experimental sequence) are provided in Table 1.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to screen for the potent of various siNA molecules against both the human and rat hsp47 genes, various reporter cell lines were established by lenti-viral induction of human HSP47 cDNA-green fluorescent protein (GFP) or rat GP46 cDNA-GFP construct into 293, HT1080, human HSC line hTERT, or NRK cell lines. These cell lines were further evaluated by siRNA against GFP. The remaining fluorescence signal was measured and normalized to scrambled siRNA (Ambion) and subsequently normalized to cell viability. The results showed that siRNA against GFP knocks down the fluorescence to different extent in different cell lines (\nFIG. 1\n). 293_HSP47-GFP and 293_GP46-GFP cell lines were selected for siHsp47 screening due to their ease of transfection and sensitivity to fluorescence knockdown.\n\n\n \n \nsiRNA Transfection:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells were transfected with 1.5 pmol per well of siNA against GFP in 96-well tissue culture plates using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in a reverse transfection manner. Cells were seeded at 6,000 cells per well and mixed with the siNA complexs. Fluorescence readings were taken after 72 hours incubation on a \nSynergy\n 2 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek).\n\n\n \nCell Viability Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \nCells treated with or without siNA were measured for viability after 72 hours incubation using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit according to the manual (Promega). The readings were normalized to samples treated with scrambled siNA molecules.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nEvaluation of Inhibitory Efficiency of siHsp47 on hsp47 Expression in Reporter Cell Lines\n\n\n \n \n \nsiNAs against hsp47 were evaluated for their inhibitory efficiency in 293 HSP47-GFP and 293_GP46-GFP cell lines by evaluating the change in fluorescent signal from the reporter GFP. The experiments were carried out as described in Example 2. The fluorescent signals were normalized to fluorescent signals from cells treated with scrambled siRNA (Ambion) which served as a control. The results indicate that the tested hsp47 siNA molecules were effective in inhibiting hsp47 mRNA in both cell lines. However, siNA against GP46 mRNA (as published in the 2008 Sato et al paper) was effective only in the 293 GP46-GFP cell line. The results are shown in \nFIG. 2\n A-B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 293_HSP47-GFP and 293_GP46-GFP cell lines treated with siRNA against hsp47 and gp46 were evaluated for viability using the methods described in Example 2. The cell viability was normalized to cells treated with scrambled siRNA (Ambion). The results indicate that the cell viability was not affected significantly by the treatment with siNA molecules. However, the cell viability of 293_HSP47-GFP cell lines treated with different hsp47 siNA molecules varied depending on the siNA molecules used, while the viability of 293_GP46-GFP cell lines were similar. Viability for 293 HSP47-GFP cells were lower for siHsp47-6 and Hsp47-7 treated cells than the rest. The results are shown in \nFIG. 2C-D\n.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nEvaluation of siHsp47 Inhibitory Effect on hsp47 mRNA by TaqMan® qPCR\n\n\n \n \n \nIn Example 3, the knock down efficiency of siHsp47s in reporter cell lines was evaluated by change in fluorescent signal. To validate the results at the mRNA level, siRNAs targeting endogenous hsp47 were transfected into cells of the human HSC cell line hTERT using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in a reverse transfection manner as described in Example 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hsp47 mRNA level was evaluated for knock down efficiency of the various tested siHsp47 siNA molecules. Briefly, mRNA were isolated from hTERT cells after 72 hours after transfection using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The level of hsp47 mRNA was determined by reverse transcription coupled with quantitative PCR using TaqMan® probes. Briefly, cDNA synthesis was carried out using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (ABI) according to the manufacturer's instruction, and subjected to TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (ABI, hsp47 assay ID Hs01060395_g1). The level of hsp47 mRNA was normalized to the level of GAPDH mRNA according to the manufacturer's instruction (ABI). The results indicate that siHsp47-C was the most effective among all the hsp47 siRNAs, siHsp47-2 and siHsp47-2d were the next most effective. The combinations of siHsp47-1 with siHsp47-2 or siHsp47-1 with siHsp47-2d were more effective than siHsp47-1 alone. The results are shown in \nFIG. 3\n.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nValidation of siHsp47 Knock Down Effect at the Protein Level\n\n\n \n \n \nThe inhibitory effect of different Hsp47 siNA molecules (siHsp47) on hsp47 mRNA expression were validated at the protein level by measuring the HSP47 in hTERT cells transfected with different siHsp47. Transfection of hTERT cells with different siHsp47 were performed as described in Example 2. Transfected hTERT cells were lysed and the cell lysate were clarified by centrifugation. Proteins in the clarified cell lysate were resolved by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The level of HSP47 protein in the cell lysate were determined using an anti-HSP47 antibody (Assay Designs) as the primary antibody, Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with HRP (Millipore) as the secondary antibody, and subsequently detected by Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Anti-actin antibody (Abeam) was used as a protein loading control. The result showed significant decrease in the level of Hsp47 protein in cells treated with siHsp47-C, siHsp47-2d, alone or combination of siHsp47-1 with siHsp47-2d.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nDownregulation of Collagen I expression by hsp47 siRNA\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine the effect of siHsp47 on collagen I expression level, collagen I mRNA level in hTERT cells treated with different siRNA against hsp47 was measured. Briefly, hTERT cells were transfected with different siHsp47 as described in Example 2. The cells were lysed after 72 hours and mRNA were isolated using RNeasy mini kit according to the manual (Qiagen). The level of \ncollagen\n 1 mRNA was determined by reverse transcription coupled with quantitative PCR using TaqMan® probes. Briefly, cDNA synthesis was carried out using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (ABI) according to the manual, and subjected to TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (ABI, COL1A1 assay ID Hs01076780_g1). The level of collagen I mRNA was normalized to the level of GAPDH mRNA according to the manufacturer's instruction (ABI). The signals were normalized to the signal obtained from cells transfected with scrambled siNA. The result indicated that collagen I mRNA level is significantly reduced in the cells treated with some of the candidates siHsp47-2, siHsp47-2d, and their combination with siHsp47-1 and shown in \nFIG. 4\n.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nImmunofluorescence Staining of hsp47 siRNA Treated hTERT Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nTo visualize the expression of two fibrosis markers, \ncollagen\n 1 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), in hTERT cells transfected with or without siHsp47, the cells were stained with rabbit anti-collagen I antibody (Abeam) and mouse anti-alpha-SMA antibody (Sigma). Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen (Molecular Probes)) were used as secondary antibodies to visualize collagen I (green) and alpha-SMA (red). Hoescht was used to visualize nuleus (blue). The results indicate correlation between siRNA knocking down of some of the target genes and collagen/SMA expression.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nIn Vivo Testing of siHSP47 in Animal Models of Liver Fibrosis\n\n\n \n \n \nsiRNA for Rat Liver Cirrhosis Treatment\n\n\n \n \nThe siRNA duplex sequence for HSP47 (siHSP47C) is as listed below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSense (5′->3′)\n\n\nggacaggccucuacaacuaTT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntisense (5′->3′)\n\n\nuaguuguagaggccuguccTT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n10 mg/ml siRNA stock solution was prepared by dissolving in nuclease free water (Ambion). For treatment of cirrhotic rats, siRNA was formulated with vitamin A-coupled liposome as described by Sato et al (Sato Y. et al. Nature Biotechnology 2008. Vol. 26, p 431) in order to target activated hepatic stellate cells that produce collagen. The vitamin A (VA)-liposome-siRNA formulation consists of 0.33 μmol/ml of VA, 0.33 μmol/ml of liposome (Coatsome EL-01-D, NOF Corporation) and 0.5 μg/μl of siRNA in 5% glucose solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe liver cirrhosis animal model was reported by Sato et al (Sato Y. et al. Nature Biotechnology 2008. Vol. 26, p 431). 4 week-old male SD rats were induced with liver cirrhosis with 0.5% dimethylnitrosoamine (DMN) (Wako Chemicals, Japan) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A dose of 2 ml/kg per body weight was administered intraperitoneally for 3 consecutive days per week on \n \n \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n \n \n 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38 and 40\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA treatment: siRNA treatment was carried out from day 32 and for 5 intravenous injections. In detail, rats were treated with siRNA on day-32, 34, 36, 38 and 40. Then rats were sacrificed on day-42 or 43. 3 different siRNA doses (1.5 mg siRNA per kg body weight, 2.25 mg siRNA per kg body weight, 3.0 mg siRNA per kg body weight) were tested. Detail of tested groups and number of animals in each group are as follows:\n\n \n \n \n1) Cirrhosis was induced by DMN injection, then 5% glucose was injected instead of siRNA) (n=10)\n \n2) VA-Lip-siHSP47C1.5 mg/kg (n=10)\n \n3) VA-Lip-siHSP47C 2.25 mg/kg (n=10)\n \n4) VA-Lip-siHSP47C 3.0 mg/Kg (n=10)\n \n5) Sham (PBS was injected instead of DMN. 5% Glucose was injected instead of siRNA) (n=6)\n \n6) No treatment control (Intact) (n=6)\n \n\n\nVA-Lip Refers to Vitamin A—Liposome Complex.\n\n\n \n \n \nEvaluation of therapeutic efficacy: On \nday\n 43, 2 out of 10 animals in the “diseased rat” group and 1 out of 10 animals in “VA-Lip-siHSP47C siRNA 1.5 mg/kg” died due to development of liver cirrhosis. The remainder of the animals survived. After rats were sacrificed, liver tissues were fixed in 10% formalin. Then, the left lobule of each liver was embedded in paraffin for histology. Tissue slides were stained with Sirius red, and hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Sirius red staining was employed to visualize collagen-deposits and to determine the level of cirrhosis. HE staining was for nuclei and cytoplasm as counter-staining. Each slide was observed under microscope (BZ-8000, Keyence Corp. Japan) and percentage of Sirius red-stained area per slide was determined by image analysis software attached to the microscope. At least 4 slides per each liver were prepared for image analysis, and whole area of each slide (slice of liver) was captured by camera and analyzed. Statistical analysis was carried out by Student's t-test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults: \nFIG. 5\n shows the fibrotic areas. The area of fibrosis in “diseased rats” was higher than in the “sham” or “no treatment control” groups. Therefore, DMN treatment induced collagen deposition in the liver, which was a typical observation of liver fibrosis. However, the area of fibrosis was significantly reduced by the treatment of siRNA targeting HSP47 gene, compared with “disease rat” group (\nFIG. 5\n). This result indicates that siRNA as disclosed herein has a therapeutic efficacy in actual disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional siRNA compounds are tested in the liver fibrosis animal model, and were shown to reduce the fibrotic area in the liver.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nGeneration of Sequences for Active Double Stranded RNA Compounds to HSP47/SERPINH1 and Production of the siRNAs Shown in Tables A-18, A-19, and B-E\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing proprietary algorithms and the known sequence of the target genes, the sequences of many potential siRNAs were generated. The sequences that have been generated using this method are complementary to the corresponding mRNA sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuplexes are generated by annealing complementary single stranded oligonucleotides. In a laminar flow hood, a ˜500 μM Stock Solution of single stranded oligonucleotide is prepared by diluting in WFI (water for injection, Norbrook). Actual ssRNA concentrations are determined by diluting each 500 μM ssRNA 1:200 using WFI, and measuring the OD using Nano prop. The procedure is repeated 3 times and the average concentration is calculated. The Stock Solution was then diluted to a final concentration of 250 μM. Complementary single strands were annealed by heating to 850C and allowing to cool to room temperature over at least 45 minutes. Duplexes were tested for complete annealing by testing 5 μl on a 20% polyacrylamide gel and staining. Samples were stored at 800C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTables A-18, A-19 and B-E provide siRNAs for HSP47/SERPINH1. For each gene there is a separate list of 19-mer siRNA sequences, which are prioritized based on their score in the proprietary algorithm as the best sequences for targeting the human gene expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following abbreviations are used in the Tables A-18, A-19 and B-E herein: “other spec or Sp.” refers to cross species identity with other animals: D-dog, Rt-rat, Rb-Rabbit, Rh-rhesus monkey, P-Pig, M-Mouse; ORF: open reading frame. 19-mers, and 18+1-mers refer to oligomers of 19 and 18+1 (U in \nposition\n 1 of Antisense, A in position 19 of sense strand) ribonucleic acids in length, respectively.\n\n\n \n \nIn Vitro Testing of the siRNA Compounds for the Target Genes\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLow-Throughput-Screen (LTS).for siRNA Oligos Directed to Human and Rat SERPINH1 Gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell Lines: Human prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 cells (ATCC, Cat# CRL-1435) were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-Glutamine and human epithelial cervical cancer HeLa cells (ATCC, Cat#CCL-2) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine.

Cells were transfected with the siRNAs being tested at different concentrations using the Lipofectamine™2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2 \nincubator for either 48 h or 72 h. At 48-72 h after transfection cells were harvested and cell RNA was extracted. Cy3-labeled siRNA duplexes were used as a positive control for transfection efficiency. Mock cells treated with Lipofectamine™2000 reagent defined as “Control not active samples” (negative control) and cells treated with a known active siRNA (HSP47-C) at final concentration of 5 nM defined as “Control active samples” (positive control). Z′ and controls fold {Fold=mean (Negative)/mean (Positive)} are the means to describe the assay efficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe percent inhibition of target gene expression by each siRNA tested was determined by Qper analysis of a target mRNA from cells. Reverse transcription was performed by synthesizing cDNA from the cells and determining target gene mRNA levels by Real Time qPCR. Measured cell mRNA levels were normalized to those of the Cyclophilin A (CYNA, PPIA) mRNA for each sample. siRNA activity was determined based on the ratio of the target gene mRNA quantity siRNA-treated samples versus non-transfected control samples. Z′ and controls fold {Fold=mean (Negative)/mean(Positive)} are the means to describe the assay efficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe qPCR results are those that passed QC standards, i.e. the value of the standard curve slope was in the interval [−4, −3], R2>0.99, no primer dimers. Results that did not pass the QC requirements were disqualified from analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIC50 value of the tested RNAi activity was determined by constructing a dose-response curve using the activity results obtained with the various final siRNA concentrations. The dose response curve was constructed by plotting the relative amount of residual SERPINH1 mRNA versus the logarithm of transfected siRNA concentration, as described above.\n\n\n \nOn-Target and Off-Target Testing of Double Stranded RNA Molecules:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe psiCHECK system enables evaluation of the guide strand (GS) (antisense) and the passenger strand (PS) (sense strand) to elicit targeted (on-target) and off-targeted effects, by monitoring the changes in expression levels of their target sequences. Four psiCHECK™-2-based (Promega) constructs were prepared for the evaluation of target activity and potential off-target activity of each test molecule GS and PS strands. In each of the constructs one copy or three copies of either the full target or the seed-target sequence, of test molecule PS or GS, was cloned into the multiple cloning site located downstream of the \nRenilla \nluciferase translational stop codon in the 3′-UTR region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting vectors were termed:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1—GS-CM (guide strand, complete-match) vector containing one copy of the full target sequence (nucleotide sequence fully complementary to the whole 19-base sequence of the GS of the test molecule);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2—PS-CM (passenger strand, complete-match) vector containing one copy of the full target sequence (nucleotide sequence fully complementary to the whole 19-base sequence of the PS of the test molecule);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3—GS-SM (guide strand, seed-match) vector containing one copy or three copies of the seed region target sequence (sequence complementary to nucleotides 1-8 of the GS of the test molecule);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4—PS-SM (passenger strand, seed-match) vector containing one copy of the seed region target sequence (sequence complementary to nucleotides 1-8 of the PS of the test molecule).\n\n\n \nNomenclature:\n\n\n \n \n \nguide strand: strand of siRNA that enters the RISC complex and guides cleavage/silencing of the complementary RNA sequence\n\n\n \n \n \n \nseed sequence: Nucleotides 2-8 from the 5′ end of the guide strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncm (complete match): DNA fragment fully complementary to the guide strand of siRNA.

described above, were cloned in the 3′UTR of the reporter mRNA, \nRenilla \nLuciferase in the psiCHECK™-2 (Promega) vector. XhoI and NotI were used as cloning sites using standard molecular biology techniques. Each strand was chemically synthesized and annealed by heating to 100° C. and cooled to room temperature. Ligation was carried out for 3 hours using standard molecular biology techniques and transformed into \nE. coli \nDH5a cells. Resulting colonies were screened for presence of plasmid constructs by colony-PCR using relevant primers. Each of the plasmids (vectors) was purified from one positive colony and its sequence was verified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbout 1.3×10\n6 \nhuman HeLa cells were inoculated in 10 cm dish. Cells were then incubated in 37±1° C., 5% CO2 incubator for 24 hours. Growth medium was replaced one day post inoculation by 8 mL fresh growth medium and each plate was transfected with one of the plasmids mentioned above, using Lipofectamine™2000 reagent according manufacturing protocol and incubated for 5 hours at 37±10C and 5% CO2. Following incubation, cells were re-plated in a 96-well plate at final concentration of 5×103 cells per well in 80 μL growth medium. 16 hours later, cells were transfected with SERPINH1 siRNA molecules using Lipofectamine™2000 reagent at different concentrations ranging from 0.001 nM to 5 nM in a 1000. final volume. Mock cells treated with Lipofectamine™2000 reagent with the corresponding psiCHECK™-2 plasmid defined as “Control not active samples” (negative control) and cells treated with a known active siRNA (HSP47-C) at final concentration of 5 nM defined as “Control active samples” (positive control). Z′ and controls fold {Fold=mean (Negative)/mean(Positive)} are the means to describe the assay efficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells were then incubated for 48 hours at 37±1° C. and \nRenilla \nand FireFly Luciferase activities were measured in each of the siRNA transfected samples, using Dual-Luciferase® Assay kit (Promega, Cat#E1960) according to manufacturer procedure. The activity of a synthetic siRNA toward this target sequence results either in cleavage and subsequent degradation of the fused mRNA or in translation inhibition of the encoded protein. Measuring the decrease in \nRenilla \nluciferase activity thus provides a convenient way of monitoring siRNA effect while Firefly luciferase, allows normalization of \nRenilla \nluciferase expression. \nRenilla \nLuciferase activity value was divided by Firefly Luciferase activity value for each sample (normalization). \nRenilla \nluciferase activity is finally expressed as the percentage of the normalized activity value in tested sample relative to “Control not active samples”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults of TNFα and IL-6 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNC) exposed to unmodified or modified siRNA/Lipofectamine™2000.

(\nsiRNA stock\n 100 uM diluted in human serum 1:14.29 or human tissue extract from various tissue types). Five ul (5 ul) are added to 15ul 1.5×TBE-loading buffer at different time points (for example 0, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, 16 h and 24 h). Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −20° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach sample is loaded onto a non-denaturing 20% acrylamide gel, prepared according to methods known in the art. The oligos were visualized with ethidium bromide under UV light.\n\n\n \nExonuclease Stability Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nTo study the stabilization effect of 3′ non-nucleotide moieties on a nucleic acid molecule the sense strand, the antisense strand and the annealed siRNA duplex are incubated in cytosolic extracts prepared from different cell types.\n\n\n \n \nExtract: HCT116 cytosolic extract (12 mg/ml).\n\n\nExtract buffer: 25 mM Hepes pH-7.3 at 37° C.; 8 mM MgCl; 150 mM NaCl with 1 mM DTT was added fresh immediately before use.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethod: 3.5 ml of test siRNA (100 mM), were mixed with 46.5 ml contain 120 mg of HCT116 cytosolic extract. The 46.5 ml consists of 12 ml of HCT116 extract, and 34.5 ml of the extract buffer supplemented with DTT and protease inhibitors cocktail/100 (Calbiochem, setIII-539134). The final concentration of the siRNA in the incubation tube is 7 mM. The sample was incubated at 37° C., and at the indicated \ntime point\n 5 ml were moved to fresh tube, mixed withl5 ml of 1×TBE-50% Glycerol loading buffer, and snap frozen in Liquid N2. The final concentration of the siRNA in the loading buffer is 1.75 mM (21 ng siRNA/ml). For Analyses by native PAGE and EtBr staining 50 ng are loaded per lane. For \nNorthern analyses\n 1 ng of tested siRNA was loaded per lane.\n\n\n \n \nInnate Immune Response to SERPINH1 siRNA Molecules:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFresh human blood (at RT) was mixed at 1:1 ratio with sterile 0.9% NaCl at RT, and gently loaded (1:2 ratio) on Ficoll (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield cat# 1114547). Samples were centrifuged at RT (22° C., 800g) in a swinging centrifuge for 30 minutes, washed with RPMI1640 medium and centrifuged (RT, 250 g) for 10 minutes. Cells were counted and seeded at final concentration of 1.5×10\n6 \ncell/ml in growth medium (RPMI1640+10% FBS+2 mM L-glutamine+1% Pen-Strep) and incubated for 1 hours at 37° C. before siRNA treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells were then treated with the siRNAs being tested at different concentrations using the Lipofectamine™2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according manufacturer's instructions and incubated at 370C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a positive control for IFN response, cells were treated with either poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double strand RNA (dsRNA) which is a TLR3 ligand (InvivoGen Cat# tlr1-pic) at final concentrations of 0.25-5.0 μg/mL or to Thiazolaquinolone (CLO75), a TLR 7/8 ligand (InvivoGen Cat# tlr1-c75) at final concentrations of 0.075-2 μg/mL. Cell treated with Lipofectamine™2000 reagent were used as negative (reference) control for IFN response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt about 24 hours following incubation, cells were collected and supernatant was transferred to new tubes. Samples were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α cytokines was tested using IL-6, DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D System DY2060), and TNF-α, DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D System DY210), according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA was extracted from the cell pellets and mRNA levels of human genes IFIT1 (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) and MX1 (myxovirus (influenza virus) \nresistance\n 1, interferon-inducible protein p78) were measured by qPCR. Measured mRNA quantities were normalized to the mRNA quantity of the reference gene peptidylprolyl isomerase A (cyclophilin A; CycloA). Induction of IFN-signaling was evaluated by comparing the quantity of mRNA from IFIT1 and MX1 genes from treated cells, relative to their quantities non-treated cells. The qPCR results are those that passed QC standards, i.e. the value of the standard curve slope was in the interval [−4, −3], R2>0.99, no primer dimers. Results that did not pass the QC requirements were disqualified from analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 6 shows siSERPINH1 compounds.

Rat diabetic and aging models of kidney fibrosis include Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, aged falfa (obese Zucker) rats, aged Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, and Goto Kakizaki (GK) rats; GK rats are an inbred strain derived from Wistar rats, selected for spontaneous development of NIDDM (diabetes type II). Induced models of kidney fibrosis include the permanent unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model which is a model of acute interstitial fibrosis occurring in healthy non-diabetic animals; renal fibrosis develops within days following the obstruction. Another induced model of kidney fibrosis is 5/6 nephrectomy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo models of liver fibrosis in rats are the Bile Duct Ligation (BDL) with sham operation as controls, and CCl\n4 \npoisoning, with olive oil fed animals as controls, as described in the following references: Lotersztajn S, et al Hepatic Fibrosis: Molecular Mechanisms and Drug Targets.

Specifically, for optic nerve transection the orbital optic nerve (ON) of anesthetized rats is exposed through a supraorbital approach, the meninges severed and all axons in the ON transected by crushing with forceps for 10 seconds, 2 mm from the lamina cribrosa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules as disclosed herein are tested in this animal model and the results show that these siRNA compounds are useful in treating and/or preventing glaucoma.\n\n\n \n \nRat Optic Nerve Crush (ONC) Model: Intravitreal siRNA Delivery and Eye Drop Delivery\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor optic nerve transsection the orbital optic nerve (ON) of anesthetized rats is exposed through a supraorbital approach, the meninges severed and all axons in the ON transected by crushing with forceps for 10 seconds, 2 mm from the lamina cribrosa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe siRNA compounds are delivered alone or in combination in 5 uL volume (10 ug/uL) as eye drops. Immediately after optic nerve crush (ONC), 20 ug/10 ul test siRNA or 10 ul PBS is administered to one or both eyes of adult Wistar rats and the levels of siRNA taken up into the dissected and snap frozen whole retinae at 5 h and 1 d, and later at 2 d, 4 d, 7 d, 14 d and 21 d post injection is determined. Similar experiments are performed in order to test activity and efficacy of siRNA administered via eye drops.\n\n\n \nModel Systems of Ischemia Reperfusion Injury Following Lung Transplantation in Rats\n\n\n \n \n \nLung ischemia/reperfusion injury is achieved in a rat animal model as described in Mizobuchi et al., The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation, Vol 23 No. 7 (2004) and in Kazuhiro Yasufuku et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol Biol, Vol 25, pp 26-34 (2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, after inducing anesthesia with isofluorane, the trachea is cannulated with a 14-gauge Teflon catheter and the rat is mechanically ventilated with rodent ventilator using 100% oxygen, at a rate of 70 breaths per minute and 2 cm H2O of positive end-respiratory pressure. The left pulmonary artery, veins and main stem bronchus are occluded with a Castaneda clamp. During the operation, the lung is kept moist with saline and the incision is covered to minimize evaporative losses. The period of ischemia is 60 minutes long. At the end of the ischemic period the clamp is removed and the lung is allowed to ventilate and reperfuse for further 4 h, 24 h, and 5 d post induction of lung ischemia. At the end of the experiment, the lungs are gently harvested and either frozen for RNA extraction or fixed in glutaraldehyde cocktail for subsequent histological analysis.\n\n\n \nThe Bleomycin Animal Model as a Model for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).\n\n\n \n \n \nTesting feasibility of lung and liver delivery of vitamin A-Coatsome formulated siRNA administered by intravenous injection and intratracheal administration of siRNA-vitamin A-Coatsome complex to a healthy mice and bleomycine-treated mice\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObjective: To test two administration routes for feasibility of vitamin A-Coatsome formulated siRNA delivery to normal and fibrotic mouse lungs. The main hypothesis to be tested in the current study is whether systemic administration of vitamin A-Coatsome formulated modified siRNA provides efficient uptake and cell-specific distribution in the fibrotic and normal mouse lungs. Intratracheal route of vitamin A-Coatsome formulated modified siRNA will be tested in parallel. siRNA detection and cell-specific distribution in the lungs and liver will be performed by in situ hybridization (ISH)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBackground: The Bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis has been well developed and characterized over the last three decades (Moeller, et al. Int J Biochem Cell Biol, 40:362-382, 2008; Chua et al., Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 33:9-13, 2005). Histological hallmarks, such as intra-alveolar buds, mural incorporation of collagen and obliteration of alveolar space are present in BLM-treated animals similar to IPF patients. Early studies demonstrated that C57/B1 mice were consistently prone to BLM-induced lung fibrosis, whereas Balb/C mice were inheritantly resistant. Depending on the route of administration, different fibrotic pattern develops. Intratracheal instillation of BLM results in bronchiocentric accentuated fibrosis, whereas intravenous or intraperitoneal administration induces subpleural scarring similar to human disease (Chua et al. ibid). A mouse model of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is used. This model shows a heterogenous distribution of fibroproliferation, distributed mainly subpleurally, forming similar lesions to those observed in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrsosis (IPF) (Onuma, et al., Tohoku J Exp Med 194: 147-156, 2001 and Yamaguchi and Ruoslahti, Nature 336: 244-246, 1988). UIP will be induced by intraperitoneal injection of bleomycin every other day for 7 days for a constant composition of subpleural fibroproliferation in the mouse lung (Swiderski et al. Am J Pathol 152: 821-828, 1998 and Shimizukawa et al., Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 284: L526-L532, 2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs was previously demonstrated, vitamin A-loaded liposomes containing siRNA interact with retinol-binding protein (RBP) and provide efficient delivery to the hepatic stellate cells via RBP receptor (Sato et al. Nat Biotechnol 26:431-442, 2008). This study is planned to test whether vitA-Coatsome-siRNA complex will be efficiently taken up by an RBP receptor-expressing activated myofibroblasts in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice. In addition, local administration route (intratracheal instillation) will be tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneral Study Design\n\n\n \n \nMice—C57 B1 male\n\n\nStarting N (BLM I.P.)—40 (6 for the first pilot group, 34 for the study, taling in consideration anticipated 25% mortality)\n\n\n\n \nStarting N (Total)—60\n\n\n \n \n \nTest siRNA: SERPINHI compounds disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroups:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBLM\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndose,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTermination,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmg/kg\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nsiRNA\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\npost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBW, in\n\n\nBLM\n\n\n \n\n\ndose,\n\n\nsiRNA\n\n\n \n\n\nlast\n\n\nN (before\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.1 ml\n\n\nadm.\n\n\nBLM\n\n\nmg/kg\n\n\nadm\n\n\nsiRNA\n\n\nsiRNA\n\n\nsiRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\nsaline\n\n\nroute\n\n\nregime\n\n\nBW\n\n\nroute\n\n\nregime\n\n\nadm\n\n\n \nadministration\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.75\n\n\nI.P.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ndd\n \n \n \n 0, 2, 4, 6\n\n\n4.5\n\n\nI.V.\n\n\n2 daily\n\n\n 2 \nh\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.75\n\n\nI.P.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ndd\n \n \n \n 0, 2, 4, 6\n\n\n4.5\n\n\nI.V.\n\n\n2 daily\n\n\n24 \nh\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.75\n\n\nI.P.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ndd\n \n \n \n 0, 2, 4, 6\n\n\n2.25\n\n\nI.T.\n\n\n2 daily\n\n\n 2 \nh\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n0.75\n\n\nI.P.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ndd\n \n \n \n 0, 2, 4, 6\n\n\n2.25\n\n\nI.T.\n\n\n2 daily\n\n\n24 \nh\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\nintact\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n4.5\n\n\nI.V.\n\n\n2 daily\n\n\n 2 \nh\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n \n\n\nintact\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n4.5\n\n\nI.V\n\n\n2 daily\n\n\n24 \nh\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n \n\n\nintact\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n2.25\n\n\nI.T\n\n\n2 daily\n\n\n 2 \nh\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n \n\n\nintact\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n2.25\n\n\nI.T.\n\n\n2 daily\n\n\n24 \nh\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n0.75\n\n\nI.P.\n\n\n \n \n \ndd\n \n \n 0, 2, 4, 6\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nI.V.\n\n\n2 daily\n\n\n 2 \nh\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nvehicle\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.75\n\n\nI.P.\n\n\n \n \n \ndd\n \n \n 0, 2, 4, 6\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nI/T/\nvehicle\n \n\n\n2 daily\n\n\n24 \nh\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n \n\n\nIntact\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nintact\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nAny \ntime\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis of 12-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice will be induced by intraperitoneal instillation of bleomycin chlorate: 0.75 mg/kg body weight dissolved in 0.1 ml of saline every other day for 7 days, on \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n 0, 2, 4, and 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModel follow up and monitoring. The mice will be weighed before the BLM treatment, and twice weekly for the period of study duration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPilot evaluation of the establishment of fibrosis. The mice (N=30) are subjected to BLM treatment in groups, to allow for a one week time interval between the first treated group (N=5) and the rest of the animals. On day 14, two mice from the first group are sacrificed and the lungs harvested for the fast HE stain and quick histopathological evaluation of fibrosis. When lung fibrosis is confirmed, the remaining rats are sorted into the groups and treated with siRNA on Day 14 after the first BLM treatment. In case that no sufficient fibrosis develops in the lungs by day 14, the remaining mice from the first treated group are sacrificed on day 21, followed by quick histopathology evaluation of fibrosis. The rest of the animals are treated with test siRNA complex starting from day 21 after the BLM treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA administration. On day 14 or day 21 after the first BLM administration (TBD during the study, based on pilot evaluation of establishment of fibrosis), the animals are group sorted, according to BW. The animals from \n \ngroups\n \n 1 and 2 are administered intravenously (tail vein injection) with siRNA/vitA/Coatsome complex, at an siRNA concentration of 4.5 mg/kg BW. Intact animals of the same age (\nGroups\n 5 and 6) are treated in the same manner. BLM treated animals (Group 9) will be used as vitA-coatsome vehicle control). In 24 hours, the injection is repeated to all the animals, as above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe BLM animals from the \n \ngroups\n \n 3 and 4, and intact mice from \ngroups\n 7 and 8 are anesthetized with isoflutrane and subjected to intratracheal instillation of 2.25 mg/kg BW siRNA formulated in vitA-loaded liposomes. Mice from the \nBLM group\n 10 are administered with vitA/Coatsome vehicle only. The inttratracheal instillation is repeated after 24 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudy termination. The animals from the \n \n \ngroups\n \n \n 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 are sacrificed at 2 hours after the second siRNA complex injection or instillation.

The lungs are inflated with 0.8-1.0 ml of 10% NBF, and the trachea ligated. The lungs are excised and fixed for 24 h in 10% NBF. The liver is harvested from each animal and fixed in 10% NBF for 24 h.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSectioning and evaluation. Consequent sections are prepared from the lungs and livers. First consequent section are stained with hematoxylin and eosin for assessment of lung and liver morphology, second section are stained with Sirius Red (trichrome) to identify collagen The third consequent sections are subjected to in situ hybridization (ISH) for detection of siRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds as described herein are tested in this animal model and the results show that

\n \n \n \nThe contents of the articles, patents, and patent applications, and all other documents and electronically available information mentioned or cited herein, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety to the same extent as if each individual publication was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplicants reserve the right to physically incorporate into this application any and all materials and information from any such articles, patents, patent applications, or other physical and electronic documents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that varying substitutions and modifications can be made to the invention disclosed herein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Thus, such additional embodiments are within the scope of the present invention and the following claims. The present invention teaches one skilled in the art to test various combinations and/or substitutions of chemical modifications described herein toward generating nucleic acid constructs with improved activity for mediating RNAi activity. Such improved activity can include improved stability, improved bioavailability, and/or improved activation of cellular responses mediating RNAi. Therefore, the specific embodiments described herein are not limiting and one skilled in the art can readily appreciate that specific combinations of the modifications described herein can be tested without undue experimentation toward identifying nucleic acid molecules with improved RNAi activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventions illustratively described herein may suitably be practiced in the absence of any element or elements, limitation or limitations, not specifically disclosed herein. Thus, for example, the terms “a” and “an” and “the” and similar referents in the context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context. The terms “comprising”, “having,” “including,” containing”, etc. shall be read expansively and without limitation (e.g., meaning “including, but not limited to,”). Recitation of ranges of values herein are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range, unless otherwise indicated herein, and each separate value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. All methods described herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (e.g., “such as”) provided herein, is intended merely to better illuminate the invention and docs not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention unless otherwise claimed. No language in the specification should be construed as indicating any non-claimed element as essential to the practice of the invention. Additionally, the terms and expressions employed herein have been used as terms of description and not of limitation, and there is no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features shown and described or portions thereof, but it is recognized that various modifications are possible within the scope of the invention claimed. Thus, it should be understood that although the present invention has been specifically disclosed by preferred embodiments and optional features, modification and variation of the inventions embodied therein herein disclosed may be resorted to by those skilled in the art, and that such modifications and variations are considered to be within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention has been described broadly and generically herein. Each of the narrower species and subgeneric groupings falling within the generic disclosure also form part of the invention. This includes the generic description of the invention with a proviso or negative limitation removing any subject matter from the genus, regardless of whether or not the excised material is specifically recited herein. Other embodiments arc within the following claims. In addition, where features or aspects of the invention are described in terms of Markush groups, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group."
