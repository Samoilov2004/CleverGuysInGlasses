No. 60/862,540, filed Oct. 23, 2006.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe CB\n1 \nreceptor family is primarily found in the central and peripheral nervous systems and to a lesser extent in several peripheral organs. The CB\n2 \nreceptor is found primarily in the immune system. The pharmacology and therapeutic potential for cannabinoid receptor ligands has been reviewed (Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1998, 8, 301-313; Ann. Rep. Med. Chem., A. Doherty, Ed.; Academic Press, NY 1999, Vol. 34, 199-208; Exp. Opin. Ther. 2000, 10, 1529-1538; Trends in Pharma. Sci. 2000, 21, 218-224). CB\n1 \nreceptor agonists have been associated with stimulation of feeding, anemetic properties, analgesia, reduction in intraocular pressure in glaucoma, and alleviation of muscle spasms in multiple sclerosis. Conversely, CB\n1 \nreceptor antagonists have been shown effective for reducing feeding and body weight in animal models of obesity. However, most compounds that modulate CB1 receptor activity have the pharmacological property of inverse agonism which reduces basal CB1 receptor signal transduction as well as the activity of blocking CB1 agonist dependent receptor stimulation.\n\n\nA number of selective, centrally acting CB\n1 \nreceptor compounds are currently in development for the treatment of obesity. Nevertheless, there still remains a need for CB\n1 \nreceptor compounds which have increased in vivo potency which are low molecular weight, and have pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that provide therapeutic benefit while minimizing adverse events. See for example WO 2007/020502.\n\n\nIn addition to appentency disorders, CB\n1 \ninverse agonists have been shown to further potentiate the activity of antipsychotic agents in assays. Although current antipsychotic therapies are more or less effective at controlling positive symptoms, such therapies are not as effective in treating the negative and cognitive symptoms, rendering many patients incapable of leading normal lives. Convergent evidence suggests drugs that enhance neuronal activation in specific brain areas, hippocampal, striatal, and cortical areas in particular, would be effective in treating both negative and cognitive symptoms. In addition, the weight loss effects of CB\n1 \nreceptor compounds have been demonstrated in animal models of antipsychotic treatment-induced weight gain and therefore may also be effective in controlling the treatment-emergent weight gain and metabolic syndrome seen with current antipsychotic therapies.\n\n\nMoreover, CB\n1 \nreceptor compounds have been shown to reduce alcohol consumption in animal models of alcohol drinking and therefore may be useful in the treatment of substance abuse.\n\n\nWhile oral administration is a preferred route of drug delivery, many CB\n1 \nreceptor compounds suffer from poor oral bioavailability as a consequence of their limited solubility in aqueous media and their metabolic lability. Because of the high lipophilicity of the endogenous cannabinoid ligands and the complementary site to which they bind in the CB\n1 \nreceptor, known CB\n1 \nreceptor compounds are also highly lipophilic. This high lipophilicity leads to poor solubility in aqueous media which limits oral absorption and bioavailability. See for example WO 2007/020502.\n\n\nIn addition, compounds which are rapidly metabolized by the liver may undergo metabolic conversion following absorption from the small intestine and prior to reaching the general circulation. During this process, reactive metabolic intermediate (s) may be formed and subsequently may react with other nucleophiles in the body (such as proteins, DNA, RNA, etc.). This could lead to toxicity issues. This so-called “first pass effect” also limits drug bioavailability. See for example WO 2007/020502.\n\n\nIn conclusion, there is a need for CB\n1 \nreceptor compounds that have good bioavailability, have increased in vivo potency, are highly selective over CB\n2\n, are more readily soluble than previous molecules, and do not form reactive metabolites which could subsequently cause toxicity issues. The present invention satisfies this need and provides related advantages as well.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides a compound of Formula (I)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n

compounds of Formula Ia. All such isomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) are contemplated as aspects of the present invention.\n\n\nWhile compounds of Formula (I) in their racemic form are useful agents, it is generally preferable to administer compounds of Formula (I) in which one of the enantiomeric forms has been enriched. A preferred aspect of this invention provides compounds of Formula (Ia) that are substantially pure enantiomers. As such, each of the following specific classes of compounds of Formulas (I) and (Ia) are contemplated as aspects of the present invention:\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) Those where enantiomeric purities are greater than 80% enantiomeric excess;\n \n(b) Those where enantiomeric purities are greater than 90% enantiomeric excess;\n \n(c) Those where enantiomeric purities are greater than 95% enantiomeric excess; and\n \n(d) Those where enantiomeric purities are greater than 99% enantiomeric excess.\n \n \n \n\n\nThese enantiomerically pure compounds may be prepared by purification of the desired enantiomer of a compound of Formula (I) from a mixture of enantiomers of this compound. The desired enantiomer of a compound of Formula (I) may also be prepared by synthesis according to the following general schemes by using precursors that are substantially enantiomerically pure. Those skilled in the art will recognize that either resolution of final compounds or of intermediates will provide compounds of Formula (I) in substantially enantiomerically pure form, to yield for example, compounds of Formulas (Ia), and will employ the method which is most convenient.\n\n\nIt will be further recognized that a substantially pure diastereomer may be isolated from a mixture of diastereomers using methods known in the art. Methods for purification of diastereomers include chromatography and crystallization. A mixture of enantiomers may be separated into the individual substantially pure enantiomers by the process known as resolution. Enantiomers may be resolved through the use of chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Suitable chiral solid phases include polysaccharide-based stationary phases such as Chiralpak AD and Chiracel OJ (sold by Chiral Technologies, Inc.). Additionally, enantiomers of basic compounds may be resolved by conversion to a mixture of diastereomeric salts by treatment with a chiral acid. The desired diastereomeric salt is isolated by, for example, crystallization. The substantially enantiomerically pure basic compound may be isolated by treatment with base. Examples of chiral acids include (−)-tartaric acid, (+)-tartaric acid, (−)-mandelic acid, (+)-mandelic acid, (−)-ditoluoyltartaric acid and (+)-ditoluoyltartaric acid. Enantiomers of acidic compounds may be resolved in an analogous manner using a substantially enantiomerically pure base. Examples of such bases include R-alpha-methylbenzylamine, S-alpha-methylbenzylamine, and brucine. Another method for the resolution of a racemic mixture involves reaction with a substantially enantiomerically pure chiral reagent (referred to here as a chiral auxiliary) to form a covalent bond. This reaction results in a mixture of diastereomers, which is purified according to methods known in the art. All, or a portion, of the chiral auxiliary may then be cleaved from the molecule to generate a compound which is substantially enantiomerically pure. In some cases, the asymmetric center introduced by the chiral auxiliary may be retained in the final product.\n\n\nOne of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that certain disclosed intermediate compounds and the compound of Formula (II) may exist with different points of attachment of hydrogen, and is thus considered tautomeric. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are contemplated as an aspect of the present invention. Each of the forms of the tautomer may exist, interconvert, and undergo the tautomerization under the conditions specified.\n\n\nIt will be understood that as used herein, unless otherwise specified, references to the compounds of Formulas (I) or (Ia) are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n\n\nIt will be understood that the compounds of the present invention described below may exist as distinct crystal forms prepared by crystallization under controlled conditions.\n\n\nCompounds of Formulas (I) and (Ia) are selective for the CB\n1 \nreceptor in preference to the CB\n2 \nreceptor. In addition, there is evidence suggesting these CB\n1 \nreceptor ligands act as antagonists of CB\n1 \nreceptor function and have inverse agonists properties as well. Thus, it can be stated compounds of Formulas (I) and (Ia) are modulators of the CB\n1 \nreceptor, and as such are useful for prevention and treatment of conditions associated with the CB\n1 \nreceptor. Such conditions include, for example, memory deficits, cognitive disorders, negative symptoms of schizophrenia, substance abuse disorders (particularly to opiates, alcohol, and nicotine), obesity, metabolic disorders and eating disorders associated with excessive food intake. See DSM-IV-TR., \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Revised, \n4\nth \nEd., Text Revision (2000). See also DSM-IV, \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \n4\nth \nEd., (1994). The DSM-UV and DSM-IV-TR were prepared by the Task Force on Nomenclature and Statistics of the American Psychiatric Association, and provides descriptions of diagnostic categories. The skilled artisan will recognize that there are alternative nomenclatures, nosologies, and classification systems for pathologic psychological conditions and that these systems evolve with medical scientific progress.\n\n\nThe compounds of Formulas (I) or (Ia) can also be used to ameliorate weight gain, whether or not the associated weight gain subject can be classified as clinically obese.\n\n\nAn effective amount of the compounds of Formulas (I) or (Ia), may be administered to a patient in need of such treatment or prophylaxis in order to practice the present methods of therapy. The need for a prophylactic administration according to the methods of the present invention is determined via the use of well-known risk factors. The effective amount of an individual compound is determined, in the final analysis, by the physician in charge of the case, but depends on factors such as the exact disease to be treated, the severity of the disease and other diseases or conditions from which the patient suffers, the chosen route of administration, other drugs and treatments which the patient may concomitantly require, and other factors in the physician's judgment. The prophylactic or therapeutic dosage of a compound of Formula (I) or (Ia) will, of course, vary with the nature of the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of Formula (I) or (Ia) and its route of administration.\n\n\nThe dose may be administered in a single daily dose or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, based on the properties of the individual compound selected for administration and/or the characteristics of the dosage form (i.e., modified release), the dose may be administered less frequently, e.g., weekly, twice weekly, monthly, etc. The unit dosage may be correspondingly larger for the less frequent administration. When administered via, transdermal routes, or through a continual intravenous solution, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\nAs used above and throughout the description of the invention, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be defined as follows:\n\n\n“Agonist” and “agonists” shall refer to those compounds which stimulate the functional response of a receptor.\n\n\n“Neutral antagonist” and “neutral antagonists” shall refer to those compounds which do not alter the basal activity of a receptor but block the functional activity of agonists and inverse agonists by returning the functional response to that of the basal state.\n\n\n“Inverse agonist” and “inverse agonists” shall refer to those compounds which possess negative intrinsic activity by reversing the constitutive activity of the receptor. Inverse agonists act as antagonists to reverse the activity of agonists.\n\n\n“Antagonist” or “antagonists” shall refer to those compounds which are neutral antagonists.\n\n\n“Obesity” refers to the condition of having a high amount of body fat. A person is considered obese if he or she has a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m\n2 \nor greater. A person with BMI=27-30 is generally considered overweight. Conventionally, those persons with normal weight have a BMI of 19.9 to 25.9. The obesity may be due to any cause, whether genetic or environmental. Examples of disorders that may result in obesity or be the cause of obesity include overeating, decreased physical activity and pathological conditions showing reduced metabolic activity.\n\n\n“Pharmaceutically acceptable salts” and “salts” refer to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts, and base addition salts, of compounds of the present invention. See, for example S. M. Berge, et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts,” \nJ. Pharm. Sci., \n66, 1-19 (1977).\n\n\n“Pharmaceutical composition” and “composition” are intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient, preferably present in pharmaceutically effective amounts, and the inert ingredient(s) (pharmaceutically acceptable excipients) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of Formula (I) or (Ia) and any pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.\n\n\n“Prevention” (of obesity) refers to preventing obesity from occurring if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of the obese condition. Moreover, if treatment is commenced in already obese subjects, such treatment is expected to prevent, or to prevent the progression of, the medical sequelae of obesity (e.g., arteriosclerosis, Type II diabetes, polycystic ovarian disease, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, dermatological disorders, hypertension, insulin resistance, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and cholelithiasis).\n\n\n“Treating,” as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, means reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing the disorder or condition to which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition. The term “treatment” as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, refers to the act of treating as “treating” is defined immediately above.\n\n\n“p.o.,” as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, means orally.\n\n\n“s.c.” as used herein, unless otherwise indicated mean subcutaneous.\n\n\n“Ret.,” as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, mean retention.\n\n\n“DMSO,” as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, means dimethyl sulfoxide.\n\n\nFor the therapeutic utility taught herein, the salt of the claimed compounds must be pharmaceutically acceptable. For further details on pharmaceutically acceptable salts, see Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66, 1 (1977).\n\n\nPREPARATIONS AND EXAMPLES\n\n\nConditions for HPLC Methods referred to throughout the Preparations and Examples:\n\n\nMethod A\n\n\nLC column: Zorbax Eclipse XDB C8 4.6×150 mm 5 uM; Gradient: 20-90% acetonitrile w/0.01% trifluoracetic acid in 13.0 minutes.

In a 96 well format using a modified antibody capture technique (DeLapp et al., 1999), measure GTP-γ\n35\nS binding. Briefly incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature the GTP-binding assay buffer (20 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, pH 7.4), the CHO or Sf9 cell membranes expressing CB\n1 \nor CB\n2\n, (Applied Cell Sciences, Gaithersburg, Md.; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, Mass.; prepare membranes as previously described (DeLapp et al., 1999)), Example 2 and the 500 pM GTP-γ-\n35\nS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, Mass.). Perform antagonist dose responses in the presence of a saturating dose of a full agonist (methanandamide). To the 96 well plate, in addition, add a mixture containing 0.27% Nonidet P40 detergent (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind.), anti-Gi antibody (final dilution of 1:300; Covance, Princeton, N.J.), and 1.25 mg anti-rabbit antibody scintillation proximity assay beads (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.) and seal the plates and incubate for an additional 3 hours. Centrifuge the plates at 700×g for 10 minutes using a Beckman GS-6R centrifuge and count for 1 minute per well using a Wallac MicroBeta TriLux scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, Boston, Mass.).\n\n\nTo analyze data, subtract background from all wells. Determine percent agonist efficacy by normalizing agonist/inverse agonist dose response data to a full agonist (methanandamide) response. Calculate antagonist percent inhibition data by normalizing to results generated with a saturating concentration of agonist (methanandamide). Analyze the data using a 4-parameter logistic reduced fit with Activity Base and XLFit3 (IDBS, Emeryville, Calif.). Determine K\nb \nvalues using a modification of the Cheng-Prusoff relationship: K\nb\n=IC50/(1+[agonist]/EC50) where IC50 is determined from a four parameter fit of displacement curves, [agonist]=EC50 of full agonist, and EC50 is determined from a four parameter fit of a full agonist concentration response curve (Cheng and Prusoff 1973). Calculate mean K\nb \nvalues as a mean of at least three independent determinations±standard error of the mean (SEM).\n\n\nTable 1 summarizes the antagonist/inverse agonist properties of Example 2 in CHO cells expressing human or rat CB\n1 \nreceptors or Sf9 cells expressing human CB\n2 \nreceptors. It is concluded Example 2 exhibits potent human and rat CB\n1 \nantagonism with no measurable antagonism of the human CB\n2 \nreceptor. The data indicates Example 2 is a potent CB\n1 \nantagonist/inverse agonist at both rat and human receptors with no antagonism of human CB\n2 \nreceptors.\n\n\nTable 2 summarizes the agonist properties of Example 2 in Sf9 cell membranes from cells expressing human CB\n1 \nor CB\n2 \nreceptors. These data demonstrate that Example 2 is an inverse agonist at the human CB\n1 \nreceptor as evidenced by agonist efficacy (Table 2) less than zero which indicates that the compound decreased basal constitutive activity of the CB\n1 \nreceptor in vitro. Example 2 does not have any measurable CB\n2 \nagonist activity (Table 2).\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDeLapp N W, McKinzie J H, Sawyer B D, Vandergriff A, Falcone J, McClure D and Felder C C (1999).

House 12 mice per cage. Test only animals that weigh 25-30 g. On the day of testing, bring animals to the testing room at least 1 hour prior to dosing. When dosing starts, dose at 6-8 minute intervals between each dose with each mouse receiving either Administer vehicle (1% CMC, 0.5% SLS, 0.08% povidone, 0.05% antifoam) or Example 2, p.o. Next, place mice in a clean cage (4 mice per cage). After 90 minutes, start the test following a 90 minute pre-treatment with Example 2 or vehicle.\n\n\nMice FST: Place NIH-Swiss mice in clear plastic cylinders (diameter: 10 cm; height: 25 cm) filled to 6 cm with 22-25° C. water for six minutes. Record the duration of immobility during the last 4 minutes of the six-minute trial. A mouse is regarded as immobile when floating motionless or making only those movements necessary to keep its head above the water.

Prepare Example 2 in a vehicle suspension of 1% Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 0.5% Sodium lauryl sulfate, 0.05% Antifoam, 0.085% Povidone and administer, to rats (e.g., male Sprague Dawley rats, 155-175 g) p.o. (a dose of 1 or 10 mg/kg). Control rats receive vehicle. Administer clozapine (Sigma) 1 hour later at a concentration of 8 mg/mL in a vehicle solution of 0.4% lactic acid at a dose of 8 mg/kg s.c. Sacrifice animals (n=7-8 per group) by decapitation 2 hours after administration of clozapine or vehicle for clozapine. Remove rapidly whole brains and immediately immerse in isopentane (2-methyl butane) over dry ice. Cut coronal sections through the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral striatum (DL-Str) at 14 μm and perform Fos immunohistochemistry. Assess atypicality index (Robertson et al., 1994) using the following formula: Atypical Index=(NAcD−NAcV)−(DL-StrD−DL-StrV) where the average number of Fos-li neurons in NAc=nucleus accumbens, D=drug, V=vehicle, DL-Str=dorsolateral striatum. Analyze data using a one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keul's post hoc test (Graph Pad Prism 4.03). Set the level of significance at P<0.05.\n\n\nResults: Clozapine and Example 2 both individually tend to or significantly enhance cortical and subcortical Fos reactivity. Observe Example 2 enhancing the effects of clozapine alone at both 1 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.\n\n\nConclusions: Increase cFos expression in rat brain in both prefrontal cortex and subcortical regions by Example 2. Display a similar spectrum of neural activation by clozapine. Addition of Example 2 to clozapine results in augmentation of cFos expression induced by clozapine in brain areas critical to cognitive function and negative symptom control. Observe the overall effect of Example 2 to the clozapine effect producing a neural signature of greater atypicality with respect to ventral vs. dorsal striatal impact.\n\n\nStimulation of Monoamine Neurotransmitter Release and Turnover in Brain Regions Associated with Cognition\n\n\nMethods: Implant male Sprague-Dawley rats (260-300 g, Taconic Farms, Germantown, N.Y.) with a cannula (BAS, West Lafayette, Ind.) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) 5-7 days before the experiment. Insert a concentric type probe with a 4 mm membrane tip extending below the cannula through the cannula about 16 hours before the experiment began and collect the microdialysate from prefrontal cortex and analyze for monoamines and their metabolites. Calculate all microdialysis data as percent change from dialysate basal concentrations with 100% defined as the average of the final three drug pre-injection values and each group having 5-6 rats. Analyze data with ANOVA and follow by a post-hoc Bonferroni test.\n\n\nResults: Increase rat cortical monoamine and metabolite levels by Example 2 doses as low as 1 mg/kg, p.o.\n\n\n\nEthanol Seeking Behaviors: 12-Hour Ethanol Consumption in Alcohol-Preferring Rats (P Rats)\n\n\nEvaluate Example 2 for its ability to reduce consumption of ethanol in rats selectively bred for high oral ethanol intake (P rats). In addition, study the effects of Example 2 under conditions in which effects of the compound on motivation or the control of behavior by ethanol could be assessed.\n\n\nMethods: Study the effects of Example 2 on female, alcohol-preferring (P) rats on alcohol consumption under a continuous free access paradigm. For comparative purposes test the standard opioid antagonist naltrexone. Monitor voluntary consumption of 15% (v/v) ethanol. Suspend Example 2 in vehicle (1% CMC, 0.5% SLS, 0.08% povidone, 0.05% Dow Corning antifoam 1510 US) and give p.o. 3 hours prior to the onset of the dark cycle. In addition, measure locomotor activity via infrared sensor.\n\n\nResults: Consumption of ethanol but not water was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by orally-administered Example 2. Naltrexone, at higher doses, was also able to reduce ethanol intake. Example 2 did not significantly alter locomotor activity of these rats until a dose of 10 mg/kg.\n\n\n\nEthanol Seeking Behaviors: Progressive Ratio Responding Maintained by Ethanol\n\n\nAssess the ability of Example 2 to reduce the motivational drive controlling ethanol intake.\n\n\nMethods: Study female alcohol-preferring (P) rats under a progressive ratio schedule in which responding produces 15% ethanol (v/v). Under the progressive ratio schedule, the response requirement for ethanol delivery increases from 1 to 2 and then increments by 2 after 3 ethanol presentations.\n\n\nResults: Reduce ethanol-seeking behavior and the consumption of ethanol consumed by administration of Example 2 dose-dependently. Reduce Example 2 the breakpoint (the amount of work the rat would accomplish for a fixed quantity of ethanol) in a dose-dependent manner [F(4,20)=4.52, p=0.009].\n\n\n\nIn Vivo Efficacy in Feeding Models\n\n\nMethods: Administer Example 2 to diet-induced obese (DIO) male Long-Evans rats. Establish DIO by ad lib feeding from weanling of a diet consisting of 40% fat, 39% carbohydrate and 21% protein caloric content for at least 12 weeks. Define compound potency by T17 (the dose required to produce a difference from the vehicle group of 17 grams). This represents a minimally biologically relevant reduction of 3-4% of body weight compared to vehicle treatment after 2 weeks.\n\n\nResults: Decrease cumulative food intake by administrating Example 2 once daily orally throughout the 14-day study. Consistent with reduced food intake, observe reduction of cumulative body weight following the 14-day oral treatment with Example 2, producing an estimated T17 of 0.13 mg/kg. Measure body composition analysis by quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (QNMR) showing significant reductions in fat mass at doses ranging from 0.1-10 mg/kg with minimal changes in fat free mass at one of the highest doses.\n\n\n\nAtypical Antipsychotic Weight Gain Model\n\n\nMethods: Maintain adult lean, female Sprague-Dawley rats ad libitum on normal rodent chow Purina LabDiet 5001 (12.3% fat) and water. Treat one group (n=7) with vehicle (1% lactic acid) on days 1-14 vehicle while treating the rest with olanzapine (2 mg/kg, po). Follow food intake, monitor body weight and change in fat mass over a two week treatment. After 14 days of drug delivery, divide the olanzapine treated animals (n=8 per group) and treat one group with 0.3 mg/kg Example 2 plus olanzapine, treat a second group with 1 mg/kg Example 2 plus olanzapine and treat the final group with vehicle plus olanzapine for days 15-28.\n\n\nResults: Observe treatment emergent increases in cumulative food intake, body weight and fat mass compared to vehicle treated controls with once daily oral administration for 14-days of olanzapine. Addition of Example 2 and the olanzapine treatment results in a significant reduction in fat mass gain with both doses of Example 2 with no changes in fat free mass.\n\n\nConclusions: Produce a significant reduction in body weight from vehicle treated controls by daily oral administration of Example 2 for 14 days to diet-induced obese (DIO), male Long-Evans rats maintained on a high-energy diet reduced food intake. Estimate the efficacy dose (T17) of 0.13 mg/kg/day for Example 2 for producing a change in body mass from control. Analyze changes in body composition to determine that the reduced body mass results from a significant reduction in fat mass at doses up to 10 mg/kg (the highest dose tested). Evaluate with a once daily oral administration of Example 2 for 14 days to two week olanzapine treated, female Sprague-Dawley rats to help to produce a significant reduction in fat mass compared to that of olanzapine treated controls."

Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \n1. Technical Field\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel compounds which modulate the CB2 receptor and their use as medicaments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Background Information\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCannabinoids are a group of about 60 distinct compounds found in \nCannabis sativa \n(also know as marijuana) with cannabinol, cannabidiol and Δ\n9\n-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) being the most representative molecules. The therapeutic usage of \nCannabis \ncan be dated back to ancient dynasties of China and includes applications for various illnesses ranging from lack of appetite, emesis, cramps, menstrual pain, spasticity to rheumatism. The long history of \nCannabis \nuse has led to the development of several pharmaceutical drugs. For example, Marinol and Cesamet which are based on THC and its analogous nabilone, respectively, are used as anti-emetic and appetite stimulant. Despite of the clinical benefits, the therapeutic usage of cannabis is limited by its psychoactive effects including hallucination, addiction and dependence. Mechoulam R, ed. \nCannabinoids as Therapeutic Agents\n, Boca Raton, Fla.; CRC Press, 1986 provides a review of the medicinal use of cannabis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe physiological effects of cannabinoids are mediated by at least two G-protein coupled receptors, CB1 and CB2. Autoradiographic studies have demonstrated that CB1 receptors are expressed primarily in the central nervous system, specifically in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia and cerebellum. They are also found to a lesser degree in the reproductive system and other peripheral tissues including that of the immune system. CB1 receptors regulate the release of neurotransmitters from the pre-synaptic neurons and are believed to mediate most of the euphoric and other central nervous system effects of cannabis, such as THC-induced ring-catalepsy, hypomobility, and hypothermia, which were found to be completely absent in mice with a deletion of the CB1 gene (Zimmer et al., Increased mortality, hypoactivity, and hypoalgesia in cannabinoid CB1 receptor knockout mice. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. (1999) 96:5780-5785.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCB2 receptors are almost exclusively found in the immune system, with the greatest density in the spleen. It is estimated that the expression level of CB2 in the immune cells is about 10 to 100 times higher than CB1. Within the immune system, CB2 is found in various cell types, includung B cells, NK cells, monocytes, microglial cells, neutrophils, T cells, dentritic cells and mast cells, suggesting that a wide range of immune functions can be regulated through CB2 modulators (Klein et al., The cannabinoid system and immune system. J Leukoc Biol (2003) 74:.486-496). This is supported by the finding that the immunomodulatory effect of THC is absent in CB2 deficient mice mice (Bicklet et al., Immunomodulation by cannabinoid is absent in mice deficient for the cannabinoid CB2 receptor. Eur J Pharmacol (2000) 396:141-149). CB2 selective ligands have been developed and tested for their effects in various imflammatory settings. For example, in animal models of inflammation, CB2 selective agonists, inverse agonists and antagonists have been shown to be effective in suppressing inflammation (Hanus et al., HU-308: a specific agonist for CB(2), a peripheral cannabinoid receptor. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. (1999) 96:14228-14233, Ueda et al., Involvement of cannabinoid CB(2) receptor-mediated response and efficacy of cannabinoid CB(2) receptor inverse agonist, JTE-907, in cutaneous inflammation in mice. Eur J. Pharmacol. (2005) 520:164-171 and Smith et al., The anti-inflammatory activities of cannabinoid receptor ligands in mouse peritonitis models Eur J. Pharmacol. (2001) 432:107-119.). Furthermore, CB2 selective agonists inhibit disease severity and spasticity in animal models for multiple sclerosis (Baker et al., Cannabinoids control spasticity and tremor in a multiple sclerosis model. Nature (2000) 404:84-87.Arevalo-Martin et al., Therapeutic action of cannabinoids in a murine model of multiple sclerosis J. Neurosci. (2003) 23:2511-2516.). Taken together, these results support the notion that CB2 receptor modulators can be employed for the treatment of medical conditions having an inflammatory component.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to inflammation, CB2 agonists have been shown to inhibit pain and emesis. For instance, CB2 selective agonists blunt the pain response induced by thermal or other stimuli (Malan et al., CB2 cannabinoid receptor-mediated peripheral antinociception. Pain. (2001) 93:239-45 and Nackley et al., Selective activation of cannabinoid CB(2) receptors suppresses spinal fos protein expression and pain behavior in a rat model of inflammation. Neuroscience (2003) 119:747-57.) CB2 activation has also been demonstrated to inhibit neuropathic pain response (Ibrahim et al., Activation of CB2 cannabinoid receptors by AM1241 inhibits experimental neuropathic pain: pain inhibition by receptors not present in the CNS. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. (2003) 100:10529-33.) Finally, in contrast to the earlier data which did not find CB2 in the brain, a recent article demonstrated the expression of CB2 in the brain, at about 1.5% of the level in the spleen. CB2 activation is shown by this article to be responsible for the anti-emetic effect of endocannabinoid (Van Sickle et al., Identification and functional characterization of brainstem cannabinoid CB2 receptors. Science. 2005 310:329-332.) The foregoing results confirm that CB2 agonists can be used for the treatment of inflammatory and neuropathic pain as well as emesis.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel compounds which bind to and modulate the CB2 receptor. The invention also provides a method and pharmaceutical compositions for treating inflammation by way of the administration of therapeutic amounts of these compounds. Lastly, the invention provides a method and pharmaceutical compositions for treating pain by way of the administration of therapeutic amounts of the new compounds which are CB2 agonists.\n\n\n

compound is defined by the structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to pharmaceutical preparations, containing as active substance one or more compounds of the invention, or the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, optionally combined with conventional excipients and/or carriers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention also include their isotopically-labelled forms. An isotopically-labelled form of an active agent of a combination of the present invention is identical to said active agent but for the fact that one or more atoms of said active agent have been replaced by an atom or atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number of said atom which is usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes which are readily available commercially and which can be incorporated into an active agent of a combination of the present invention in accordance with well established procedures, include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, e.g., \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, and \n36\nCl, respectively. An active agent of a combination of the present invention, a prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of either which contains one or more of the above-mentioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms is contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of any compounds of described above containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms may occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Isomers shall be defined as being enantiomers and diastereomers. All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. Each stereogenic carbon may be in the R or S configuration, or a combination of configurations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds of the invention can exist in more than one tautomeric form. The invention includes methods using all such tautomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll terms as used herein in this specification, unless otherwise stated, shall be understood in their ordinary meaning as known in the art. For example, “C\n1-4\nalkoxy” is a C\n1-4\nalkyl with a terminal oxygen, such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy. All alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups shall be understood as being branched or unbranched where structurally possible and unless otherwise specified. Other more specific definitions are as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarbocycles include hydrocarbon rings containing from three to twelve carbon atoms. These carbocycles may be either aromatic or non-aromatic ring systems. The non-aromatic ring systems may be mono- or polyunsaturated. Preferred carbocycles include but are not limited to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexenyl, cycloheptanyl, cycloheptenyl, phenyl, indanyl, indenyl, benzocyclobutanyl, dihydronaphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, naphthyl, decahydronaphthyl, benzocycloheptanyl and benzocycloheptenyl. Certain terms for cycloalkyl such as cyclobutanyl and cyclobutyl shall be used interchangeably.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heterocycle” refers to a stable nonaromatic 4-8 membered (but preferably, 5 or 6 membered) monocyclic or nonaromatic 8-11 membered bicyclic or spirocyclic heterocycle radical which may be either saturated or unsaturated. Each heterocycle consists of carbon atoms and one or more, preferably from 1 to 4 heteroatoms chosen from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. The heterocycle may be attached by any atom of the cycle, which results in the creation of a stable structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroaryl” shall be understood to mean an aromatic 5-8 membered monocyclic or 8-11 membered bicyclic ring containing 1-4 heteroatoms such as N,O and S.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise stated, heterocycles and heteroaryl include but are not limited to, for example azetidinyl, furanyl, pyranyl, benzoxazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzimidazolyl, tetrahydropyranyl, dioxanyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, triazolyl, thienyl, thiadiazolyl, thiomorpholinyl, 1,1-dioxo-1λ\n6\n-thiomorpholinyl, morpholinyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, triazinyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, purinyl, quinolinyl, Dihydro-2H-quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, quinazolinyl, indazolyl, thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidinyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, indolinyl, isoindolinyl, benzofuranyl, benzopyranyl and benzodioxolyl, or 2-aza-spiro[4.5]dec-2-yl, 1-aza-spiro[4.5]dec-1-yl, 1-aza-spiro[4.4]non-1-yl, 2-aza-spiro[4.4]non-2-yl, 2-aza-spiro[5.5]undec-2-yl, 1-aza-spiro[5.5]undec-1-yl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroatom” as used herein shall be understood to mean atoms other than carbon such as O, N, S and P.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn all alkyl groups or carbon chains one or more carbon atoms can be optionally replaced by heteroatoms: O, S or N, it shall be understood that if N is not substituted then it is NH, it shall also be understood that the heteroatoms may replace either terminal carbon atoms or internal carbon atoms within a branched or unbranched carbon chain. Such groups can be substituted as herein above described by groups such as oxo to result in definitions such as but not limited to: alkoxycarbonyl, acyl, amido and thioxo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “aryl” as used herein shall be understood to mean aromatic carbocycle or heteroaryl as defined herein. Each aryl or heteroaryl unless otherwise specified includes it's partially or fully hydrogenated derivative. For example, quinolinyl may include decahydroquinolinyl and tetrahydroquinolinyl, naphthyl may include its hydrogenated derivatives such as tetrahydranaphthyl. Other partially or fully hydrogenated derivatives of the aryl and heteroaryl compounds described herein will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “nitrogen” and “sulfur” include any oxidized form of nitrogen and sulfur and the quaternized form of any basic nitrogen. For example, for an —S—C\n1-6 \nalkyl radical, unless otherwise specified, this shall be understood to include —S(O)—C\n1-6 \nalkyl and —S(O)\n2\n—C\n1-6 \nalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkyl” refers to a saturated aliphatic radical containing from one to ten carbon atoms or a mono- or polyunsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing from two to twelve carbon atoms. The mono- or polyunsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing at least one double or triple bond, respectively. “Alkyl” refers to both branched and unbranched alkyl groups. It should be understood that any combination term using an “alk” or “alkyl” prefix refers to analogs according to the above definition of “alkyl”. For example, terms such as “alkoxy”, “alkylhio” refer to alkyl groups linked to a second group via an oxygen or sulfur atom. “Alkanoyl” refers to an alkyl group linked to a carbonyl group (C═O).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “halogen” as used in the present specification shall be understood to mean bromine, chlorine, fluorine or iodine, preferably fluorine. The definitions “halogenated”, “partially or fully halogenated”; partially or fully fluorinated; “substituted by one or more halogen atoms”, includes for example, mono, di or tri halo derivatives on one or more carbon atoms. For alkyl, a nonlimiting example would be —CH\n2\nCHF\n2\n, —CF\n3 \netc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach alkyl, carbocycle, heterocycle or heteroaryl, or the analogs thereof, described herein shall be understood to be optionally partially or fully halogenated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are only those which are contemplated to be ‘chemically stable’ as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example, a compound which would have a ‘dangling valency’, or a ‘carbanion’ are not compounds contemplated by the inventive methods disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of compounds of formula (I). A “pharmaceutically acceptable derivative” refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester, or any other compound which, upon administration to a patient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound useful for the invention, or a pharmacologically active metabolite or pharmacologically active residue thereof. A pharmacologically active metabolite shall be understood to mean any compound of the invention capable of being metabolized enzymatically or chemically. This includes, for example, hydroxylated or oxidized derivative compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, perchloric, fumaric, maleic, phosphoric, glycolic, lactic, salicylic, succinic, toluene-p-sulfuric, tartaric, acetic, citric, methanesulfonic, formic, benzoic, malonic, naphthalene-2-sulfuric and benzenesulfonic acids. Other acids, such as oxalic acid, while not themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N—(C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)\n4\n \n+\n salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, within the scope of the invention is use of prodrugs of compounds of the invention. Prodrugs include those compounds that, upon simple chemical transformation, are modified to produce compounds of the invention. Simple chemical transformations include hydrolysis, oxidation and reduction. Specifically, when a prodrug is administered to a patient, the prodrug may be transformed into a compound disclosed hereinabove, thereby imparting the desired pharmacological effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I may be made using the general synthetic methods described below, which also constitute part of the invention.\n\n\n \nGeneral Synthetic Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also provides processes for making compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (II). Formula (III) can be made by the same schemes. In all Schemes, unless specified otherwise, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nin the Formulas below shall have the meaning of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nin Formula (I), Formula (II) and Formula (III) of the invention described herein above. Optimum reaction conditions and reaction times may vary depending on the particular reactants used. Unless otherwise specified, solvents, temperatures, pressures, and other reaction conditions may be readily selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. Specific procedures are provided in the Synthetic Examples section. Typically, reaction progress may be monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC), if desired, and intermediates and products may be purified by chromatography on silica gel and/or by recrystallization. The examples which follow are illustrative and, as recognized by one skilled in the art, particular reagents or conditions could be modified as needed for individual compounds without undue experimentation. Starting materials and intermediates used, in the Schemes below, are either commercially available or easily prepared from commercially available materials by those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula (II) may be synthesized according to Schemes 1 or 2 below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs illustrated in Scheme 1, reaction of a hydroxyl compound of Formula (IV) with a bromo-ester of Formula (V), in a suitable solvent, in the presence of a suitable base such as potassium hydroxide, provides a compound of Formula (VI). Hydrolysis of the ester of Formula (VI), in a suitable solvent using a suitable base, gives the corresponding acid. Reaction of this acid with reagents such as thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride gives the corresponding acid chloride. Reaction of this acid chloride with an amine R\n5\nNH\n2 \n(VII), in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of a suitable base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine, provides a compound of Formula (II).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the acid obtained above may also be coupled with the corresponding amine R\n5\nNH\n2\n(VII), under standard coupling conditions, to provide a compound of Formula (II). Standard peptide coupling reactions known in the art (see for example M. Bodanszky, 1984, The Practice of Peptide Synthesis, Springer-Verlag) may be employed in these syntheses. An example of suitable coupling conditions is treatment of a solution of the carboxylic acid in a suitable solvent such as DMF with EDC, HOBT, and a base such as diisopropylethylamine, followed by the desired amine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula (II) may also be prepared as shown in Scheme 2.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs illustrated in Scheme 2, reaction of an amine R\n5\nNH\n2 \n(VII) with a bromo acid of Formula (VIII) under conditions outlined in Scheme 1, provides an amide of Formula (IX). Reaction of the amide of Formula (IX) with a hydroxyl compound R\n2\nOH (IV), in a suitable solvent, in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydride, provides a compound of Formula (II).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula (I) may be prepared according to Scheme 3.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs illustrated in Scheme 3, reaction of an amine R\n5\nNH\n2 \n(VII) with a bromo acid of Formula (VIII) under conditions outlined in Scheme 1, provides an amide of Formula (IX).

Human CB1 and CB2 Receptor Binding:\n\n\nExperimental Method:\n\n\n \n \n \nCB2 membranes were purchased and made from HEK293 EBNA cells stably transfected with human CB2 receptor cDNA (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences). CB1 membranes were isolated from HEK cells stably co-transfected with human CB1 receptor and Gcc16 cDNA's. The membrane preparation was bound to scintillation beads (Ysi-Poly-L-lysine SPA beads, GE Healthcare) for 4 hours at room temperature in assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.8% fatty acid free Bovine Serum Albumin. Unbound membrane was removed by washing in assay buffer. Membrane-bead mixture was added to 96-well assay plates in the amounts of 15 ug membrane per well (CB2) or 2.5 ug per well (CB1) and 1 mg SPA bead per well. Compounds were added to the membrane-bead mixture in dose-response concentrations ranging from 1×10\n−5\nM to 1×10\n−10 \nM with 0.25% DMSO, final. The competition reaction was initiated with the addition of \n3\nH-CP55940 (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences) at a final concentration of 1.5 nM (CB2) or 2.5 nM (CB1). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 18 hours and read on TopCount NXT plate reader. Total and non-specific binding was determined in the absence and presence of 1.25 uM Win 55212 (Sigma). 1050 values for each compound were calculated as the concentration of compound that inhibits the specific binding of the radioactively labeled ligand to the receptor by 50% using the XLFit 4.1 four parameter logistic model. 1050 values were converted to inhibition constant (Ki) values using Cheng-Prusoff equation.\n\n\n \n \nB. CB2R Mediated Modulation of cAMP Synthesis:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention were evaluated for their CB2 agonist or inverse agonistic activity in accordance with the following experimental method. Compounds which were shown to bind to CB2 by the binding assay described above but which were not shown to exhibit CB2R-mediated modulation of cAMP synthesis by this assay were presumed to be CB2 antagonists.\n\n\n \nExperimental Method:\n\n\n \n \n \nCHO cells expressing human CB2R (Euroscreen) were plated at a density of 5000 cells per well in 384 well plates and incubated overnight at 37° C. After removing the media, the cells were treated with test compounds diluted in stimulation buffer containing 1 mM IBMX, 0.25% BSA and 10 uM Forskolin. The assay was incubated for 30 minutes at 37° C. Cells were lysed and the cAMP concentration was measured using DiscoverX-XS cAMP kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. In this setting, agonists will decrease forskolin induced production of cAMP while inverse agonists will further increase forskolin induced production of cAMP. EC50 of agonists were calculated as follows. The maximal amount of cAMP produced by forskolin compared to the level of cAMP inhibited by 1 uM CP55940 is defined as 100%. The EC50 value of each test compound was determined as the concentration at which 50% of the forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis was inhibited. Data was analyzed using a four-parameter logistic model. (Model 205 of XLfit 4.0).\n\n\n \n \nC.

In this setting, agonists will decrease forskolin induced production of cAMP while inverse agonists will further increase forskolin induced production of cAMP. EC50 of agonists were calculated as follows. The maximal amount of cAMP produced by forskolin compared to the level of cAMP inhibited by 1 uM CP55940 is defined as 100%. The EC50 value of each test compound was determined as the concentration at which 50% of the forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis was inhibited. Data was analyzed using a four-parameter logistic model.
