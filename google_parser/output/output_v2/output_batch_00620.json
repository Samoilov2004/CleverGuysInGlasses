Description\n\n\n\n\n Case 26838 \n\n\nIMIDAZOPYRIDINE COMPOUNDS, COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF \n\n\n USE \n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nThe present invention relates to organic compounds useful for therapy and/or prophylaxis in a patient, and in particular to inhibitors of TYK2 kinase useful for treating diseases mediated by TYK2 kinase. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION \n\n\nCytokine pathways mediate a broad range of biological functions, including many aspects of inflammation and immunity. Janus kinases (JAK), including JAK1 , JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 are cytoplasmic protein kinases that associate with type I and type II cytokine receptors and regulate cytokine signal transduction. Cytokine engagement with cognate receptors triggers activation of receptor associated JAKs and this leads to JAK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and ultimately transcriptional activation of specific gene sets. JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 exhibit broad patterns of gene expression, while JAK3 expression is limited to leukocytes. Cytokine receptors are typically functional as heterodimers, and as a result, more than one type of JAK kinase is usually associated with cytokine receptor complexes. The specific JAKs associated with different cytokine receptor complexes have been determined in many cases through genetic studies and corroborated by other experimental evidence. \n\n\n JAK1 is functionally and physically associated with the type I interferon (e.g., IFNalpha), type II interferon (e.g., IFNgamma), JL-2 and IL-6 cytokine receptor complexes. JAK1 knockout mice die perinatally due to defects in LIF receptor signaling. Characterization of tissues derived from JAK1 knockout mice demonstrated critical roles for this kinase in the IFN, IL-10, IL-2/IL-4, and IL-6 pathways. A humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 pathway (Tocilizumab) was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. \n\n Biochemical and genetic studies have shown an association between JAK2 and single-chain (e.g., EPO), IL-3 and interferon gamma cytokine receptor families. Consistent with this, JAK2 knockout mice die of anemia. Kinase activating mutations in JAK2 (e.g., JAK2 V617F) are associated with myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) in humans. \n\n\nJAK3 associates exclusively with the gamma common cytokine receptor chain, which is present in the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 cytokine receptor complexes. JAK3 is critical for lymphoid cell development and proliferation and mutations in JAK3 result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Based on its role in regulating lymphocytes, JAK3 and JAK3 -mediated pathways have been targeted for immunosuppressive indications (e-g transplantation rejection and rheumatoid arthritis). \n\n\n TYK2 associates with the type I interferon (e.g., IFNalpha), JL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23 cytokine receptor complexes. Consistent with this, primary cells derived from a TYK2 deficient human are defective in type I interferon, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23 signaling. A fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the shared p40 subunit of the IL-12 and 11-23 cytokines (Ustekinumab) was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. In addition, an antibody targeting the IL-12 and IL-23 pathways underwent clinical trials for treating Crohn's Disease. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION \n\n\nOne embodiment includes a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstereoisomers, tautomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein A, X, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n and R\n16\n are defined herein. \n\n\n Another embodiment includes a pharmaceutical composition that includes a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, stereoisomers, tautomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle. \n\n Another embodiment includes a method of inhibiting TYK2 kinase activity in a cell, comprising introducing into said cell an amount effective to inhibit said kinase of a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, stereoisomers, tautomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. \n\n\nAnother embodiment includes a method of treating or lessening the severity of a disease or condition responsive to the inhibition of TYK2 kinase activity in a patient.

For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable, sustaining remission and suppressing reoccurrence. \"Treatment\" can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder, (for example, through a genetic mutation) or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented. \n\n\nThe phrase \"therapeutically effective amount\" means an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition or disorder, (ii) attenuates, ameliorates or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition or disorder described herein. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the response rate (RR). In the case of immunological disorders, the therapeutic effective amount is an amount sufficient to decrease or alleviate an allergic disorder, the symptoms of an autoimmune and/or inflammatory disease, or the symptoms of an acute inflammatory reaction (e.g. asthma). In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount of a chemical entity described herein sufficient to significantly decrease the activity or number of B-cells. \n\n \" Inflammatory disorder\" as used herein can refer to any disease, disorder, or syndrome in which an excessive or unregulated inflammatory response leads to excessive inflammatory symptoms, host tissue damage, or loss of tissue function. \"Inflammatory disorder\" also refers to a pathological state mediated by influx of leukocytes and/or neutrophil chemotaxis. \n\n\n\"Inflammation\" as used herein refers to a localized, protective response elicited by injury or destruction of tissues, which serves to destroy, dilute, or wall off (sequester) both the injurious agent and the injured tissue. Inflammation is notably associated with influx of leukocytes and/or neutrophil chemotaxis. Inflammation can result from infection with pathogenic organisms and viruses and from noninfectious means such as trauma or reperfusion following myocardial infarction or stroke, immune response to foreign antigen, and autoimmune responses. Accordingly, inflammatory disorders amenable to treatment with Formulas Ia-Ib compounds encompass disorders associated with reactions of the specific defense system as well as with reactions of the nonspecific defense system. \n\n\n \"Specific defense system\" refers to the component of the immune system that reacts to the presence of specific antigens. Examples of inflammation resulting from a response of the specific defense system include the classical response to foreign antigens, autoimmune diseases, and delayed type hypersensitivity response mediated by T-cells. Chronic inflammatory diseases, the rejection of solid transplanted tissue and organs, e.g., kidney and bone marrow transplants, and graft versus host disease (GVHD), are further examples of inflammatory reactions of the specific defense system. \n\n\n The term \"nonspecific defense system\" as used herein refers to inflammatory disorders that are mediated by leukocytes that are incapable of immunological memory (e.g., granulocytes, and macrophages). Examples of inflammation that result, at least in part, from a reaction of the nonspecific defense system include inflammation associated with conditions such as adult (acute) respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ injury syndromes; reperfusion injury; acute glomerulonephritis; reactive arthritis; dermatoses with acute inflammatory components; acute purulent meningitis or other central nervous system inflammatory disorders such as stroke; thermal injury; inflammatory bowel disease; granulocyte transfusion associated syndromes; and cytokine-induced toxicity. \n\n\n\"Autoimmune disease\" as used herein refers to any group of disorders in which tissue injury is associated with humoral or cell-mediated responses to the body's own constituents. \n\n \"Allergic disease\" as used herein refers to any symptoms, tissue damage, or loss of tissue function resulting from allergy. \"Arthritic disease\" as used herein refers to any disease that is characterized by inflammatory lesions of the joints attributable to a variety of etiologies. \"Dermatitis\" as used herein refers to any of a large family of diseases of the skin that are characterized by inflammation of the skin attributable to a variety of etiologies. \"Transplant rejection\" as used herein refers to any immune reaction directed against grafted tissue, such as organs or cells (e.g., bone marrow), characterized by a loss of function of the grafted and surrounding tissues, pain, swelling, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. The therapeutic methods of the present invention include methods for the treatment of disorders associated with inflammatory cell activation. \n\n\n \"Inflammatory cell activation\" refers to the induction by a stimulus (including, but not limited to, cytokines, antigens or auto-antibodies) of a proliferative cellular response, the production of soluble mediators (including but not limited to cytokines, oxygen radicals, enzymes, prostanoids, or vasoactive amines), or cell surface expression of new or increased numbers of mediators (including, but not limited to, major histocompatability antigens or cell adhesion molecules) in inflammatory cells (including but not limited to monocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, granulocytes (i.e., polymorphonuclear leukocytes such as neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils), mast cells, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, and endothelial cells). It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the activation of one or a combination of these phenotypes in these cells can contribute to the initiation, perpetuation, or exacerbation of an inflammatory disorder. \n\n\n The term \"NSAID\" is an acronym for \"non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug\" and is a therapeutic agent with analgesic, antipyretic (lowering an elevated body temperature and relieving pain without impairing consciousness) and, in higher doses, with anti-inflammatory effects (reducing inflammation). The term \"non-steroidal\" is used to distinguish these drugs from steroids, which (among a broad range of other effects) have a similar eicosanoid- depressing, anti-inflammatory action. As analgesics, NSAIDs are unusual in that they are non-narcotic. NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. NSAIDs are usually indicated for the treatment of acute or chronic conditions where pain and inflammation are present. NSAIDs are generally indicated for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthropathies (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, acute gout, dysmenorrhoea, metastatic bone pain, headache and migraine, postoperative pain, mild-to-moderate pain due to inflammation \n\n and tissue injury, pyrexia, ileus, and renal colic. Most NSAIDs act as non-selective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes. Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A\n2\n). Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation. COX-2 inhibitors include celecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, parecoxib, rofecoxib, rofecoxib, and valdecoxib. \n\n\n The terms \"cancer\" and \"cancerous\" refer to or describe the physiological condition in patients that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth.

Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, those chemotherapeutic agents described above. \n\n\n The term \"package insert\" is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products. \n\n\nThe term \"stereoisomers\" refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space. Stereoisomers include diastereomers, enantiomers, conformers and the like. \n\n\n \"Diastereomer\" refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography. \n\n\n \"Enantiomers\" refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. \n\n\nStereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed.,\n\n\nMcGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \"Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds\", John Wiley & \n\n Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \"racemic mixture\" and \"racemate\" refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity. \n\n\n The term \"tautomer\" or \"tautomeric form\" refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. \n\n\n The phrase \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt,\" as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, />-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., l,l '-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and/or one or more counter ion. \n\n A \"solvate\" refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib. Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. The term \"hydrate\" refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water. The term \"leaving group\" or \"Lv\" refers to a group or portion of a first reactant in a chemical reaction that is displaced from the first reactant in the chemical reaction. Examples of leaving groups include, but are not limited to, halogen atoms, alkoxy and sulfonyloxy groups. Example sulfonyloxy groups include, but are not limited to, alkylsulfonyloxy groups (for example methyl sulfonyloxy (mesylate group) and trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy (triflate group)) and arylsulfonyloxy groups (for example />-toluenesulfonyloxy (tosylate group) and\n\n\n/>-nitrosulfonyloxy (nosylate group)). \n\n\n The term \"protecting group\" or \"Pg\" refers to a substituent that is commonly employed to block or protect a particular functionality while reacting other functional groups on the compound. For example, an \"amino-protecting group\" is a substituent attached to an amino group that blocks or protects the amino functionality in the compound. Suitable amino- protecting groups include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalimido, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) and 9-fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). Similarly, a \"hydroxy-protecting group\" refers to a substituent of a hydroxy group that blocks or protects the hydroxy functionality. Suitable hydroxy-protecting groups include acetyl, trialkylsilyl, dialkylphenylsilyl, benzoyl, benzyl, benzyloxymethyl, methyl, methoxymethyl, triarylmethyl, and tetrahydropyranyl. A \"carboxy-protecting group\" refers to a substituent of the carboxy group that blocks or protects the carboxy functionality. Common carboxy-protecting groups include -CH\n2\nCH\n2\nSO\n2\nPI1, cyanoethyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl, 2-(p-toluenesulfonyl)ethyl, 2-(p-nitrophenylsulfenyl)ethyl, 2-(diphenylphosphino)-ethyl, nitroethyl and the like. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W.\n\n\nGreene and P. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1999; and P. Kocienski, Protecting Groups, Third Ed., Verlag, 2003. \n\n\n The term \"patient\" includes human patients and animal patients.

It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib, including but not limited to: diastereomers, enantiomers, and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In addition, the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers.\n\n\nFor example, if a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. Both the single positional isomers and mixture of positional isomers, e.g., resulting from the N-oxidation of the pyrimidinyl and pyrrozolyl rings, or the E and Z forms of compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib (for example oxime moieties), are also within the scope of the present invention. \n\n\n In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined. \n\n\n The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention, as defined by the claims, embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. \n\n\nIn an embodiment, compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention, as defined by the claims. The term \"tautomer\" or \"tautomeric form\" refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. \n\n\n The present invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib, which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the invention. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \nU\nC, \n13\nC, \n\n \n14\nC, \n13\nN, \n15\nN, \n15\n0, \n17\n0, \n18\n0, \n32\nP, \n33\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n36\nC1, \n123\nI, and \n125\nI, respectively. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib (e.g., those labeled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., \n3\nH) and carbon- 14 (i.e., \n14\nC) isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as \n15\n0, \n13\nN, \nU\nC, and \n18\nF are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. \n\n\n SYNTHESIS OF TYK2 INHIBITOR COMPOUNDS \n\n\n Compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib may be synthesized by synthetic routes described herein. In certain embodiments, processes well-known in the chemical arts can be used, in addition to, or in light of, the description contained herein. The starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, Wis.) or are readily prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art (e.g., prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser, Reagents for Organic Synthesis, v. 1- 19, Wiley, N.Y. (1967-1999 ed.), Beilsteins Handbuch der organischen Chemie, 4, Aufl ed.\n\n\nSpringer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements (also available via the Beilstein online database)), or Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, Editors Katrizky and Rees, Pergamon Press, 1984. \n\n\n Compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib may be prepared singly or as compound libraries comprising at least 2, for example 5 to 1,000 compounds, or 10 to 100 compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib.\n\n\nLibraries of compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib may be prepared by a combinatorial \"split and mix\" approach or by multiple parallel syntheses using either solution phase or solid phase chemistry, by procedures known to those skilled in the art. Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound library comprising at least 2 compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib, enantiomers, diasteriomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n\n\nIn the preparation of compounds of the present invention, protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary or secondary amine) of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of \n\n the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups (NH-Pg) include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) and 9- fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention may be prepared from commercially available starting materials using the general methods illustrated herein. \n\n\n For illustrative purposes, reaction Schemes 1-8 depicted below provide routes for synthesizing the compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib, as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of the individual reaction steps, see the Examples section below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be available and used. Although specific starting materials and reagents are depicted in the Schemes and discussed below, other starting materials and reagents may be available for substitution to provide a variety of derivatives and/or reaction conditions. In addition, many of the compounds prepared by the methods described below can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n Schema 1 \n\n\nMethod A \n\n\n \n\n Scheme 1 depicts methods of preparing compounds 1 and 2 that can be used in further methods to prepare compounds of the present invention. Three methods are shown for the preparation of Compound 2. In the first method (Method A), 2-chloropyridine-3,4-diamine can be coupled with an acid chloride to form a mixture of regio-isomeric amides. Treatment of this amide mixture with POCl\n3\n gives compound 1. The chloride can be subsequently replaced with bromide when heated with HBr in acetic acid. \n\n\n In the second method (Method B), 2-chloropyridine-3,4-diamine can be condensed with an acid in the presence of polyphosphoric acid (PPA). This transformation also hydrolyzes the chloride to provide a hydroxyl intermediate, which can be converted to bromide 2 when treated with POBr\n3\n. \n\n\n In the third method (Method C), 2-chloropyridine-3,4-diamine can be converted to compound 1 in the presence of an aldehyde and ammonium acetate. Replacement of chloride with bromide when heated with HBr in acetic acid gives bromide 2. \n\n\n Sc \n\n\n \n\n Scheme 2 depicts methods of transforming bromide 2 through a palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction to provide compounds 3 and 4. Heating of bromide 2 with an amide (R\n5\nCONH\n2\n) or an amine (R\n5\nNH\n2\n) at 150 °C for a couple of hours under nitrogen, in the presence of Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3\n, XantPhos, Cs\n2\nC0\n3\n and 1 ,4-Dioxane/DME, gives the desired product. This \n\n Palldium-catalyzed coupling reaction can be carried out in a sealed tube in a microwave reactor. \n\n\n Scheme 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 3 describes a general method for preparing compound 5, which can be used in further methods in preparing compounds of the present invention. In Method D, 6-chloropyrimidine-\n\n\n4,5 -diamine is treated with an acid chloride in the presence of POCI\n3\n, to give intermediate 5. Alternatively, 6-chloropyrimidine-4,5 -diamine is condensed with an acid when heated in PPA, as shown in Method E. This can be accompanied by the hydrolysis of chloride to give a hydroxyl intermediate, which can be subsequently converted to compound 5 when treated with POCI\n3\n. In Method F, 6-chloropyrimidine-4,5-diamine can be transformed to compound\n\n\n5 when heated with FeCl\n3\n and oxygen in ethanol. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 4 describes general methods for preparing compounds 6 and 7, using compound 5, by palladium-catalyzed reactions. Heating of chloride 5 with an amide (R\n5\nCONH\n2\n) or an amine (R\n5\nNH\n2\n) at 160 °C for a couple of hours under nitrogen, in the presence of Pd2(dba)\n3\n, XantPhos, CS2CO3 and 1 ,4-Dioxane/DME, gives the desired product. This Palldium-catalyzed coupling reaction can be carried out in a sealed tube in a microwave reactor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 5 shows general synthetic methods for preparing further compounds of the present invention. Bromide 2 can be alkylated by an electrophile to give a mixture of N-substituted imidazoles 8 and 9, which can be carried on to the next step without separation. The following palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction can be carried out in a sealed tube in a microwave reactor. Heating of a mixture of bromides 8 and 9 with an amide (R\n5\nCONH\n2\n) or an amine (R\n5\nNH\n2\n) at 150 °C for a couple of hours under nitrogen, in the presence of Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3\n, XantPhos, Cs\n2\nC0\n3\n and 1 ,4-Dioxane/DME, gives the desired products, which could then be separated by rpHPLC or SFC. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 6 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n General preparation of intermediate 21 is shown in Scheme 6. Oxidation of a 2-Cl pyridine by hydrogen peroxide in TFA gives the N-oxide 14, which can be nitrated in concentrated sulfuric acid to provide compound 15. Hydrogenation of 15 gives 4-aminopyridine 16, which can be further nitrated to provide 17. Subsequent treatment of intermediate 16 with sulfuric acid gives compound 18, which can be reduced by hydrogen in the presence of Raney Ni to give diaminopyridine 19. Condensation of 19 with benaldehyde gives imidazopyridine 20, which can be transformed to bromide 21 when treated with TMSBr in propyl nitrile. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 7 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Pd^ilba)\n*\n. Xantphos \n\n\n C¾CO\n*\n. clioxane/DME \n\n\n 170 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScehme 7 describes general methods for preparing compounds 22 and 23, using bromide 21, by palladium-catalyzed reactions. Heating of bromide 21 with an amide (R\n5\nCONH\n2\n) or an amine (R\n5\nNH\n2\n) at 170 °C for a couple of hours, in the presence of Pd2(dba)\n3\n, XantPhos, CS2CO3 and 1 ,4-Dioxane/DME, gives the desired product 22 or 23. This Palldium-catalyzed coupling reaction can be carried out in a sealed tube in a microwave reactor. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n An alternative strategy to couple a purine chloride 5 and an amine (R\n5\nNH\n2\n) via palladium- mediate reaction (Scheme 4) is described in Scheme 8. Condensation of 6-chloropyrimidine- 4,5 -diamine with an acid in the presence of PPA resulted in purin-6-ol, which was transformed to 24 with POBr\n3\n. Displacement of bromide was carried out with sodium methanethiolate, followed by oxidation with oxone to give methylsulfone 25. Subsequent reaction with SEMC1 provided 26, which reacted smoothly with R\n5\nNH\n2\n in the presence of a base (NaH) to give 27. Deprotection of 27 with TBAF in refluxing THF resulted in final product 7. \n\n\n It will be appreciated that where appropriate functional groups exist, compounds of various formulae or any intermediates used in their preparation may be further derivatised by one or more standard synthetic methods employing condensation, substitution, oxidation, reduction, or cleavage reactions. Particular substitution approaches include conventional alkylation, arylation, heteroarylation, acylation, sulfonylation, halogenation, nitration, formylation and coupling procedures. \n\n In each of the exemplary Schemes it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and/or from starting materials. Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereoisomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereoisomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column. \n\n\n A single stereoisomer, e.g. an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., J.\n\n\nChromatogr., 113(3):283-302 (1975)). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: Drug Stereochemistry, Analytical Methods and Pharmacology, Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1993). \n\n\n Diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, a-methyl-P-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.\n\n\nAlternatively, the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds \n\n can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g. (-) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, a-methoxy-a-\n\n\n(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob, J. Org. Chem. 47:4165 (1982)), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase {Chiral Liquid Chromatography W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York, (1989); Okamoto, J. of Chromatogr. 513:375-378 (1990)). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism. \n\n\n PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND ADMINISTRATION \n\n\n Another embodiment provides pharmaceutical compositions or medicaments containing the compounds of of Formulas Ia-Ib and a therapeutically inert carrier, diluent or excipient, as well as methods of using the compounds of the invention to prepare such compositions and medicaments. In one example, compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib may be formulated by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed into a galenical administration form. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but preferably ranges anywhere from about 3 to about 8. In one example, a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib is formulated in an acetate buffer, at pH 5. In another embodiment, the compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib are sterile. The compound may be stored, for example, as a solid or amorphous composition, as a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution. \n\n\n Compositions are formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular patient being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical \n\n practitioners. The \"effective amount\" of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to inhibit TYK2 kinase activity. For example, such amount may be below the amount that is toxic to normal cells, or the patient as a whole. \n\n\nThe pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well-known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate warnings. \n\n\n Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides, copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™\n\n\n(injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. \n\n\n In one example, the pharmaceutically effective amount of the compound of the invention administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg/kg, alternatively about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg/kg/day. In another embodiment, oral unit dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules, preferably contain from about 5-100 mg of the compound of the invention. \n\n\n The compounds of the invention may be administered by any suitable means, including oral, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal, transdermal, parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions \n\n include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. \n\n\n The compounds of the present invention may be administered in any convenient administrative form, e.g., tablets, powders, capsules, solutions, dispersions, suspensions, syrups, sprays, suppositories, gels, emulsions, patches, etc. Such compositions may contain components conventional in pharmaceutical preparations, e.g., diluents, carriers, pH modifiers, sweeteners, bulking agents, and further active agents. \n\n\n A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier or excipient. Suitable carriers and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and are described in detail in, e.g., Ansel, Howard C, et al., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage\n\n\nForms and Drug Delivery Systems. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2004; Gennaro, Alfonso R., et al. Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2000; and Rowe, Raymond C. Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients. Chicago, Pharmaceutical Press, 2005. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents, diluents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament). \n\n\n An example of a suitable oral dosage form is a tablet containing about 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg or 500 mg of the compound of the invention compounded with about 90-30 mg anhydrous lactose, about 5-40 mg sodium croscarmellose, about 5-30 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30, and about 1 -10 mg magnesium stearate. The powdered ingredients are first mixed together and then mixed with a solution of the PVP. The resulting composition can be dried, granulated, mixed with the magnesium stearate and compressed to tablet form using conventional equipment. An example of an aerosol formulation can be prepared by dissolving the compound, for example 5-400 mg, of the invention in a suitable buffer solution, e.g. a phosphate buffer, adding a tonicifier, e.g. a salt such sodium chloride, if desired. The solution may be filtered, e.g., using a 0.2 micron filter, to remove impurities and contaminants. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition also includes an additional therapeutic agent selected from an anti-proliferative agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, an \n\n immunomodulatory agent, a neurotropic factor, an agent for treating cardiovascular disease, an agent for treating liver disease, an anti-viral agent, an agent for treating blood disorders, an agent for treating diabetes, or an agent for treating immunodeficiency disorders. \n\n\n An embodiment, therefore, includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, or a stereoisomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In a further embodiment includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formulas Ia- Ib, or a stereoisomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. \n\n\n Another embodiment includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, or a stereoisomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in the treatment of an immunological or inflammatory disease. Another embodiment includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, or a stereoisomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in the treatment of psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease. \n\n\nINDICATIONS AND METHODS OF TREATMENT \n\n\n The compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib inhibit TYK2 kinase activity. Accordingly, the compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib are useful for reducing inflammation in particular patient tissue and cells. Compounds of the invention are useful for inhibiting TYK2 kinase activity in cells that overexpress TYK2 kinase. Alternatively, compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib are useful for inhibiting TYK2 kinase activity in cells in which the type I interferon, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and\n\n\nIL-23 signaling pathway is disruptive or abnormal, for example by binding to TYK2 kinase and inhibiting its activity. More broadly, the compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib can be used for the treatment of immunological or inflammatory disorders. \n\n\n Another embodiment includes a method of treating or lessening the severity of a disease or condition responsive to the inhibition of TYK2 kinase activity in a patient. The method includes the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, stereoisomers, tautomers or salts thereof. \n\n\n In one embodiment, a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib is administered to a patient in a therapeutically effective amount to treat or lessen the severity of a disease or condition responsive to the inhibition of TYK2 kinase activity, and said compound is at least 15 fold, alternatively 10 fold, alternatively 5 fold or more selective in inhibiting TYK2 kinase activity over inhibiting each of the other Janus kinase activities. \n\n Another embodiment includes a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, stereoisomers, tautomers or salts thereof for use in therapy. \n\n\n Another embodiment includes a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, stereoisomers, tautomers or salts thereof for use in treating an immunological or inflammatory disease. \n\n\nAnother embodiment includes a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, stereoisomers, tautomers or salts thereof for use in treating psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease. \n\n\n Another embodiment includes the use of a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, stereoisomers, tautomers or salts thereof for treating an immunological or inflammatory disease. \n\n\n Another embodiment includes the use of a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, stereoisomers, tautomers or salts thereof for treating psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease. \n\n\n Another embodiment includes the use of a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, stereoisomers, tautomers or salts thereof in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of an immunological or inflammatory disease. \n\n\n Another embodiment includes the use of a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, stereoisomers, tautomers or salts thereof in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the disease or condition is cancer, stroke, diabetes, hepatomegaly, cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, viral disease, autoimmune diseases, immunological disease, atherosclerosis, restenosis, psoriasis, allergic disorders, inflammatory disease, neurological disorders, a hormone-related disease, conditions associated with organ transplantation, immunodeficiency disorders, destructive bone disorders, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, conditions associated with cell death, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, liver disease, pathologic immune conditions involving T cell activation, CNS disorders or a myeloproliferative disorder. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the disease or condition is cancer. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the disease or condition is an immunological disorder. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the disease is a myeloproliferative disorder. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the myeloproliferative disorder is polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, myelofibrosis or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the disease is asthma. \n\n In one embodiment, the cancer is breast, ovary, cervix, prostate, testis, penile, genitourinary tract, seminoma, esophagus, larynx, gastric, stomach, gastrointestinal, skin, keratoacanthoma, follicular carcinoma, melanoma, lung, small cell lung carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), lung adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma of the lung, colon, pancreas, thyroid, papillary, bladder, liver, biliary passage, kidney, bone, myeloid disorders, lymphoid disorders, hairy cells, buccal cavity and pharynx (oral), lip, tongue, mouth, salivary gland, pharynx, small intestine, colon, rectum, anal, renal, prostate, vulval, thyroid, large intestine, endometrial, uterine, brain, central nervous system, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, head cancer, neck cancer, Hodgkin's or leukemia. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the cardiovascular disease is restenosis, cardiomegaly, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the neurodegenerative disease is Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and cerebral ischemia, and neurodegenerative disease caused by traumatic injury, glutamate neurotoxicity or hypoxia. In one embodiment, the inflammatory disease is inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, contact dermatitis or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the autoimmune disease is lupus or multiple sclerosis. \n\n\n Evaluation of drug-induced immunosuppression by the compounds of the invention may be performed using in vivo functional tests, such as rodent models of induced arthritis and therapeutic or prophylactic treatment to assess disease score, T cell-dependent antibody response (TDAR), and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). Other in vivo systems including murine models of host defense against infections or tumor resistance (Burleson GR, Dean JH, and Munson AE. Methods in Immunotoxicology, Vol. 1. Wiley-Liss, New York, 1995) may be considered to elucidate the nature or mechanisms of observed immunosuppression. The in vivo test systems can be complemented by well-established in vitro or ex vivo functional assays for the assessment of immune competence. These assays may comprise B or T cell proliferation in response to mitogens or specific antigens, measurement of signaling through one or more of the Janus kinase pathways in B or T cells or immortalized B or T cell lines, measurement of cell surface markers in response to B or T cell signaling, natural killer (NK) cell activity, mast cell activity, mast cell degranulation, macrophage phagocytosis or kill activity, and neutrophil oxidative burst and/or chemotaxis. In each of these tests \n\n determination of cytokine production by particular effector cells (e.g., lymphocytes, NK, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils) may be included. The in vitro and ex vivo assays can be applied in both preclinical and clinical testing using lymphoid tissues and/or peripheral blood (House RV. \"Theory and practice of cytokine assessment in immunotoxicology\" (1999) Methods 19:17-27; Hubbard AK. \"Effects of xenobiotics on macrophage function: evaluation in vitro\" (1999) Methods;19:8-16; Lebrec H, et al (2001) Toxicology 158:25-29). \n\n\n Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA) 6-week detailed study using an autoimmune mechanism to mimic human arthritis; rat and mouse models (Example 68). Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is one of the most commonly used animal models of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Joint inflammation, which develops in animals with CIA, strongly resembles inflammation observed in patients with RA. Blocking tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an efficacious treatment of CIA, just as it is a highly efficacious therapy in treatment of RA patients. CIA is mediated by both T-cells and antibodies (B-cells). Macrophages are believed to play an important role in mediating tissue damage during disease development. CIA is induced by immunizing animals with collagen emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). It is most commonly induced in the DBA/1 mouse strain, but the disease can also be induced in Lewis rats. \n\n\n There is good evidence that B-cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and/or inflammatory disease. Protein-based therapeutics that deplete B cells such as Rituxan are effective against autoantibody-driven inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis\n\n\n(Rastetter et al. (2004) Annu Rev Med 55:477). CD69 is the early activation marker in leukocytes including T cells, thymocytes, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils. The CD69 human whole blood assay (Example 69) determines the ability of compounds to inhibit the production of CD69 by B lymphocytes in human whole blood activated by crosslinking surface IgM with goat F(ab')2 anti-human IgM. \n\n\n The T-cell Dependent Antibody Response (TDAR) is a predictive assay for immune function testing when potential immunotoxic effects of compounds need to be studied. The IgM- Plaque Forming Cell (PFC) assay, using Sheep Red Blood Cells (SRBC) as the antigen, is currently a widely accepted and validated standard test. TDAR has proven to be a highly predictable assay for adult exposure immunotoxicity detection in mice based on the US\n\n\nNational Toxicology Program (NTP) database (M.I. Luster et al (1992) Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 18:200-210). The utility of this assay stems from the fact that it is a holistic measurement involving several important components of an immune response. A TDAR is \n\n dependent on functions of the following cellular compartments: (1) antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages or dendritic cells; (2) T-helper cells, which are critical players in the genesis of the response, as well as in isotype switching; and (3) B-cells, which are the ultimate effector cells and are responsible for antibody production. Chemically-induced changes in any one compartment can cause significant changes in the overall TDAR (M.P.\n\n\nHolsapple In: G.R. Burleson, J.H. Dean and A.E. Munson, Editors, Modern Methods in Immunotoxicology, Volume 1, Wiley-Liss Publishers, New York, NY (1995), pp. 71-108). Usually, this assay is performed either as an ELISA for measurement of soluble antibody (Pv.J. Smialowizc et al (2001) Toxicol. Sci. 61 :164-175) or as a plaque (or antibody) forming cell assay (L. Guo et al (2002) Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 181 :219-227) to detect plasma cells secreting antigen specific antibodies. The antigen of choice is either whole cells (e.g. sheep erythrocytes) or soluble protein antigens (T. Miller et al (1998) Toxicol. Sci. 42:129- 135). \n\n\n A compound of Formulas Ia-Ib may be administered by any route appropriate to the disease or condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), transdermal, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal. For local immunosuppressive treatment, the compounds may be administered by intralesional administration, including perfusing or otherwise contacting the graft with the inhibitor before transplantation. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with for example the condition of the recipient. Where the compound of Formulas Ia-Ib is administered orally, it may be formulated as a pill, capsule, tablet, etc. with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Where the compound of Formulas Ia-Ib is administered parenterally, it may be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form, as detailed below. \n\n\n A dose to treat human patients may range from about 5 mg to about 1000 mg of a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib. A typical dose may be about 5 mg to about 300 mg of a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib. A dose may be administered once a day (QD), twice per day (BID), or more frequently, depending on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the particular compound. In addition, toxicity factors may influence the dosage and administration regimen. When administered orally, the pill, capsule, or tablet may be ingested daily or less frequently for a specified period of time. The regimen may be repeated for a number of cycles of therapy. \n\n COMBINATION THERAPY \n\n\n The compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein, such as an immunologic disorder (e.g. psoriasis or inflammation) or a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). In certain embodiments, a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib is combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second therapeutic compound that has anti-inflammatory or anti-hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for treating an inflammation, immune-response disorder, or hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). The second therapeutic agent may be a NSAID or other anti-inflammatory agent. The second therapeutic agent may be a chemotherapeutic agent. The second therapeutic agent of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of Formulas Ia-Ib such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such compounds are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. In one embodiment, a composition of this invention comprises a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, in combination with a therapeutic agent such as an NSAID. \n\n\n Another embodiment, therefore, includes a method of treating or lessening the severity of a disease or condition responsive to the inhibition of TYK2 kinase in a patient, comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulas\n\n\nIa-Ib, and further comprising, administering a second therapeutic agent. \n\n\n The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities. \n\n\n Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments. \n\n\n The combination therapy may provide \"synergy\" and prove \"synergistic\", i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that \n\n results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e. serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together. \n\n\nIn a particular embodiment of therapy, a compound of Formulas la- lb, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, may be combined with other therapeutic, hormonal or antibody agents such as those described herein, as well as combined with surgical therapy and radiotherapy. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of Formulas la- lb, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, and the use of at least one other cancer treatment method, or immunological disorder method. The amounts of the compound(s) of Formulas Ia-Ib and the other pharmaceutically active immunologic or chemotherapeutic agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect. \n\n\n METHODS AND ARTICLES OF MANUFACTURE \n\n\n Another embodiment includes a method of manufacturing a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib.

In addition, the label or package insert may indicate that the patient to be treated is one having a disorder characterized by overactive or irregular kinase acitivity. The label or package insert may also indicate that the composition can be used to treat other disorders. \n\n\nThe article of manufacture may comprise (a) a first container with a compound of Formulas\n\n\nIa-Ib contained therein; and (b) a second container with a second pharmaceutical formulation contained therein, wherein the second pharmaceutical formulation comprises a chemotherapeutic agent. The article of manufacture in this embodiment of the invention may further comprise a package insert indicating that the first and second compounds can be used to treat patients at risk of stroke, thrombus or thrombosis disorder. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second (or third) container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes. \n\n\n In order to illustrate the invention, the following examples are included. However, it is to be understood that these examples do not limit the invention and are only meant to suggest a \n\n method of practicing the invention. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that the chemical reactions described may be readily adapted to prepare other compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib, and alternative methods for preparing the compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib are within the scope of this invention. For example, the synthesis of non-exemplified compounds according to the invention may be successfully performed by modifications apparent to those skilled in the art, e.g., by appropriately protecting interfering groups, by utilizing other suitable reagents known in the art other than those described, and/or by making routine modifications of reaction conditions. Alternatively, other reactions disclosed herein or known in the art will be recognized as having applicability for preparing other compounds of the invention. BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES \n\n\nCompounds of Formulas Ia-Ib may be assayed for the ability to modulate the activity of protein kinases, tyrosine kinases, additional serine/threonine kinases, and/or dual specificity kinases in vitro and in vivo. In vitro assays include biochemical and cell-based assays that determine inhibition of the kinase activity. Alternate in vitro assays quantify the ability of the compound of Formulas Ia-Ib to bind to kinases and may be measured either by radiolabelling the compound of Formulas Ia-Ib prior to binding, isolating the compound of Formulas Ia-Ib /kinase complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound, or by running a competition experiment where a compound of Formulas Ia-Ib is incubated with known radiolabeled ligands. These and other useful in vitro assays are well known to those of skill in the art. \n\n\n In an embodiment, the compounds of Formulas Ia-Ib can be used to control, modulate or inhibit tyrosine kinase activity, for example TYK2 kinase activity, additional serine/threonine kinases, and/or dual specificity kinases. Thus, they are useful as pharmacological standards for use in the development of new biological tests, assays and in the search for new pharmacological agents. \n\n\nEXAMPLE A JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 Inhibition Assay Protocol \n\n\n The activity of the isolated JAK1 , JAK2 or TYK2 kinase domain was measured by monitoring phosphorylation of a peptide derived from JAK3 (Val-Ala-Leu-Val-Asp-Gly-Tyr- Phe-Arg-Leu-Thr-Thr) fluorescently labeled on the N-terminus with 5-carboxyfluorescein \n\n using the Caliper LabChip technology (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). To determine the inhibition constants (Ki) of Examples 1-472, compounds were diluted serially in DMSO and added to 50 uL kinase reactions containing 1.5 nM JAK1 , 0.2 nM purified JAK2 or 1 nM purified TYK2 enzyme, 100 mM Hepes pH7.2, 0.015% Brij-35, 1.5 uM peptide substrate, 25 uM ATP, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 4 mM DTT at a final DMSO concentration of\n\n\n2%. Reactions were incubated at 22 °C in 384-well polypropylene microtiter plates for 30 minutes and then stopped by addition of 25 uL of an EDTA containing solution (100 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 0.015% Brij-35, 150 mM EDTA), resulting in a final EDTA concentration of 50 mM. After termination of the kinase reaction, the proportion of phosphorylated product was determined as a fraction of total peptide substrate using the Caliper LabChip 3000 according to the manufacturer's specifications. Ki values were then determined using the Morrison tight binding model. Morrison, J.F., Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 185:269-296 (1969); William, J.W. and Morrison, J.F., Meth. EnzymoL, 63 :437-467 (1979). \n\n\nEXAMPLE B JAK3 Inhibition Assay Protocol \n\n\n The activity of the isolated JAK3 kinase domain was measured by monitoring phosphorylation of a peptide derived from JAK3 (Leu-Pro-Leu-Asp-Lys-Asp-Tyr-Tyr- Valval- Arg) fluorescently labeled on the N-terminus with 5-carboxyfluorescein using the Caliper LabChip technology (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). To determine the inhibition constants (Ki) of Examples 1-472, compounds were diluted serially in DMSO and added to\n\n\n50 uL kinase reactions containing 5 nM purified JAK3 enzyme, 100 mM Hepes pH7.2, 0.015% Brij-35, 1.5 uM peptide substrate, 5 uM ATP, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 4 mM DTT at a final DMSO concentration of 2%. Reactions were incubated at 22 °C in 384-well polypropylene microtiter plates for 30 minutes and then stopped by addition of 25 uL of an EDTA containing solution (100 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 0.015% Brij-35, 150 mM EDTA), resulting in a final EDTA concentration of 50 mM.

Compounds were serially diluted in DMSO and incubated with Set-2 cells (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures\n\n\n(DSMZ); Braunschweig, Germany), which express the JAK2V617F mutant protein, in 96- well microtiter plates for 1 hr at 37°C in RPMI medium at a final cell density of 10\n5\n cells per well and a final DMSO concentration of 0.57%. Compound-mediated effects on STAT5 phosphorylation were then measured in the lysates of incubated cells using the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) technology (Gaithersburg, Maryland) according to the manufacturer's protocol and EC\n50\n values were determined. Alternatively, serially diluted compounds were added to NK92 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC); Manassas, VA) in 96-well microtiter plates in RPMI medium at a final cell density of 10\n5\n cells per well and a final DMSO concentration of 0.57%. Human recombinant IL-12 (R&D systems; Minneapolis, MN) was then added at a final concentration of lOng/ml to the microtiter plates containing the NK92 cells and compound and the plates were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. Compound- mediated effects on STAT4 phosphorylation were then measured in the lysates of incubated cells using the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) technology (Gaithersburg, Maryland) according to the manufacturer's protocol and EC\n50\n values were determined. \n\n\nThe compounds of Examples 1-472 were tested in the above assays and found to have IC\n50\n values for TYK2 inhibition of less than about 5 μΜ. The compounds of Examples 1-28, 30- 102, 104-134 and 136-215 were tested in the above assays and found to have IC\n50\n values for TYK2 inhibition of less than about 1 μΜ.

Description\n\n\n\n\n ADENOSINE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE THEREOF \n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/317,972, filed March 26, 2010. The contents of any patents, patent applications, and references cited throughout this specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. \n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n Provided herein are benzyloxy cycloalkyladenosine (BCAA) compounds and their use as selective Al adenosine receptor agonists. In one embodiment, these compounds are directed to use in subjects for reducing and/or controlling elevated or abnormally fluctuating intraocular pressure (IOP) in the treatment of glaucoma or ocular \n\n\nhypertension (OHT). Specifically, the benzyloxy cycloalkyladenosine compounds include N\n6\n-(2-benzyloxycyclopentyl)adenosine (BCPA) and N\n6\n-(2- benzyloxycyclohexyl)adenosine (BCHA) compounds according to Formula I. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n Glaucoma refers to a group of optic neuropathies that are characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells and atrophy of the optic nerve with resultant visual field loss. The disease is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and the second leading cause of blindness, behind cataracts. Clinical trials have demonstrated that elevated IOP is a major risk factor for glaucoma and have validated the role of lowering IOP in the management of glaucoma. \n\n\n Glaucoma is classified according to three parameters: 1) the underlying cause, i.e., primary (idiopathic) or secondary (associated with some other ocular or systemic conditions); 2) the state of the anterior chamber angle, i.e., open angle (open access of the outflowing aqueous humor to trabecular meshwork) or closed angle (narrow angle; the trabecular meshwork is blocked by apposition of the peripheral iris and the cornea); and 3) chronicity, i.e., acute or chronic. Although secondary forms of glaucoma with clear etiologies do exist {e.g., pseudoexfoliation and pigmentary dispersion), the most common form of glaucoma is primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). \n\n\nOHT is a condition in which IOP is elevated but no glaucomatous findings have been observed (Bell, 2005). The Ocular Hypertension Study demonstrated that patients with \n\n OHT have an overall risk of 10% over 5 years of developing glaucoma and that this risk can be cut in half by the institution of medical treatment that reduces IOP. \n\n\nDrug therapies that have proven to be effective for the reduction of intraocular pressure include both agents that decrease aqueous humor production and agents that increase the outflow facility. Such therapies are in general administered by one of two possible routes: topically (direct application to the eye) or orally. However, pharmaceutical ocular anti-hypertension approaches have exhibited various undesirable side effects. For example, miotics such as pilocarpine can cause blurring of vision, headaches, and other negative visual side effects. Systemically administered carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can also cause nausea, dyspepsia, fatigue, and metabolic acidosis. Certain \n\n\nprostaglandins cause hyperemia, ocular itching, and darkening of eyelashes, irises, and periorbital tissues. Further, certain beta-blockers have increasingly become associated with serious pulmonary side-effects attributable to their effects on beta-2 receptors in pulmonary tissue. Sympathomimetics cause tachycardia, arrhythmia and hypertension. Such negative side-effects may lead to decreased patient compliance or to termination of therapy such that normal vision continues to deteriorate. Additionally, there are individuals who simply do not respond well when treated with certain existing glaucoma therapies. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n There remains a need for new treatments and therapies for elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and conditions caused by elevated IOP.

The terms \"comprising, \"having,\" \"including,\" and \"containing\" are to be construed as open-ended terms (i.e., meaning \"including, but not limited to\") unless otherwise noted. Recitation of ranges of values herein are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range, unless otherwise indicated herein, and each separate value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. \n\n\nEmbodiments of the present invention define compounds of Formula I that are selective adenosine Al receptor agonists. \n\n\n Adenosine is a purine nucleoside that modulates many physiologic processes. Cellular signaling by adenosine occurs through four adenosine receptor subtypes: Ai, A\n2\nA, A\n2\nB, and A\n3\n as reported by Ralevic and Burnstock (Pharmacol Rev. 50:413-492, 1988) and Fredholm BB et al (Pharmacol Rev. 53:527-552, 2001). In the eye, adenosine Ai \n\n receptor agonists lower IOP in mice, rabbits and monkeys (Tian B et al. Exp Eye Res. 64:979-989, 1997; Crosson CE. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 273: 320-326, 1995; and Avila MY et al. Br J Pharmacol. 134:241-245, 2001). While other publications have noted that adenosine Al receptor agonists in the eye target the conventional outflow pathway via the trabecular meshwork (Husain S et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 320: 258-265, 2007), reduction of IOP via other pathways has not been excluded. \n\n\nIt should be noted that the highly robust, adenosine Ai receptor-mediated drop in IOP reported in preclinical studies is often preceded by an immediate, yet transient elevation in IOP following instillation of the Ai receptor ligand (Crosson CE and Grey T. Inv Ophthal Visual Sci. 37, [9] 1833-1839, 1996). Transient elevations in IOP of ~ 3-9 mmHg have been observed in a -30 min \"window\" after dosing. This phenomenon may arise from cross-reactivity between adenosine receptor sub-types within the eye. \n\n\nPharmacological studies indicate that this transient elevation in IOP might be due, at least in part, to the activation of adenosine A\n2B\n receptors (Crosson, 1996). Therefore, development of a highly- selective Ai agonist that only reduce IOP would appear to be more tenable than the development of adenosine A\n2\n-receptor-based drugs for treating IOP, as A\n2A\n agonists may increase, decrease or exert mixed effects on IOP (Konno, 2004; Konno, J Pharmacol Sci., 2005; Konno, Eur J Pharmacol. 2005). \n\n\nAi agonists are known to play a role in conditions such as acute and chronic disorders of heart rhythym, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, decreased insulin sensitivity, and to have a use as an antinociceptive, antilipolytic or an anitanginal agent. Elzein, 2008, Expert Opin. Invest. Drugs, 1901-1910. \n\n\n Compounds that act as selective adenosine Ai agonists are known and have shown a variety of utilities. U.S. Patent No. 7,423,144 to Jagtap et al. describes such selective adenosine Al agonist compounds for the prevention or treatment of tachyarrhythmias (elevated heart rate), pain disorders, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. \n\n\nThe following compound: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhas been described in US2006/009417A1 and US2007/0185051A1 as an intermediate compound in a synthetic scheme to prepare Ai Adenosine receptor compounds of the general structure: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It has now been found that an additional class of compounds of Formula I are selective adenosine Ai receptor agonists. \n\n\nCompounds of Formula I are of the structure: \n\n\n \n\n wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from -H, -Ci-C6alkyl, -halo, or -0(Ci- Ce)alkyl; R is selected from -H, -halo or -CN; and n is 1 or 2.

It is further contemplated that the agents of the invention may be formulated in intraocular insert or implant devices. It is envisaged that a nonaqueous \n\n\nnanoprecipitation technique could be used to form nanparticles of a compound of Formula I having a particle size of less than 0.25 μιη (less than 250 nm). The corneal epithelial junction gap has been measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) as reported in The Use of Atomic Force Microscopy for the Observation of Corneal Epithelium Surface, Tsilimbaris et al., Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science, March 2000, Vol. 41, No. 3, pp. 680-686. A technique similar to that described by Dalpiaz et al. in Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2009, pages 1-13 would be suitable. \n\n\n Formula I compounds may be delivered directly to the eye in a cornea permeable form (for example: topical ocular drops or ointments; or via slow release devices such as pharmaceutical drug delivery sponges implanted in the cul-de-sac or implanted adjacent to the sclera or within the eye; periocular, conjunctival, sub- tenons, intracameral, intravitreal, or intracanalicular injections). It is further contemplated that the agents of the invention may be formulated in intraocular insert or implant devices. \n\n\nThe compounds of Formula I are preferably incorporated into topical ophthalmic formulations with a pH of about 4-8 for delivery to the eye. The compounds may be combined with ophthalmologically acceptable preservatives, surfactants, viscosity enhancers, penetration enhancers, buffers, sodium chloride, and water to form an aqueous, sterile ophthalmic suspension or solution. Ophthalmic solution formulations may be prepared by dissolving a compound in a physiologically acceptable isotonic aqueous buffer. Further, the ophthalmic solution may include an ophthalmologically acceptable surfactant to assist in dissolving the compound. Furthermore, the ophthalmic solution may contain an agent to increase viscosity or solubility such as hydroxypropyl β-Cyclodextrin (HPpCD) or (HPCD), hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or the like, to improve the retention of the formulation in the conjunctival sac. Gelling agents can also be used, including, but not limited to, gellan and xanthan gum. In order to prepare sterile ophthalmic ointment formulations, the active ingredient may be combined with a preservative in an appropriate vehicle such as mineral oil, liquid lanolin, or white \n\n petrolatum. Sterile ophthalmic gel formulations may be prepared by suspending the compound in a hydrophilic base prepared from the combination of, for example, carbopol-974, or the like, according to the published formulations for analogous ophthalmic preparations; preservatives and tonicity agents can be incorporated. \n\n\nCompounds in preferred embodiments are contained in a composition in amounts sufficient to lower IOP in patients experiencing elevated IOP and/or maintaining normal IOP levels in POAG or OHT patients. Such amounts are referred to herein as \"an amount effective to control or reduce IOP,\" or more simply \"an effective amount.\" The compounds will normally be contained in these formulations in an amount 0.05 mg/ml to 7.0 mg/ml but preferably in an amount of 0.4 to 7.0 mg/ml. Thus, for topical presentation 1 to 2 drops of these formulations would be delivered to the surface of the eye from 1 to 4 times per day, according to the discretion of a skilled clinician. \n\n\nThe compounds of Formula I can also be used in combination with other glaucoma treatment agents, such as, but not limited to, β-blockers, prostaglandin analogs, prostamides, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, a\n2\n agonists, miotics, and neuroprotectants, Ai agonists, A\n3\n antagonists, A\n2\nA agonists and combinations thereof. \n\n\nSYNTHESIS \n\n\n The BCPA esters were prepared according to the following procedure: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n cata yst BocHN \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n X = H or CI; n = 1 - 2 \n\n\n— R: H, Me, CHMe\n2\n, CMe\n3\n, F, CI, Br, I, N0\n2\n, NH\n2\n, OH, OMe, OEt, OCHMe\n2\n, 2,3-d imethyl, 2,4-dimethyl, 2,6-dimethyl or CN \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n Procedure and analytical data: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA mixture of 6-chloropurine-9H-P-D-ribofuranoside (1 g, 3.5 mmol) and (lR,2R)-(-)-2- benzyloxycyclopentylamine (1.91 g, 3. eq.) in ethanol (15 ml) was refluxed for 16 h and the solution was concentrated.

The results are shown below in the following table. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n displacement of specific [\n3\nH]CCPA binding in CHO cells stably transfected with human recombinant Ai adenosine receptor, expressed as Ki (nM). \nb\nDisplacement of specific [\n3\nH]NECA binding in CHO cells stably transfected with human recombinant A\n2A\n adenosine receptor, expressed as Ki (nM). displacement of specific [\n3\nH]NECA binding in CHO cells stably transfected with human recombinant A\n3\n adenosine receptor, expressed as Ki (nM). \n\n\n It can be seen from the above table that the compounds are potent Al agonists, while also being very selective to the Al receptor over the A2a and A3 receptors. The cLogP values for the compounds are predominantly between 2 and 3.5 and with such cLogP values it is anticipated that these compounds will cross the human corneal barrier. \n\n Evaluation of Compounds 1, 11, 17 and 18 in Rabbits for changes in Intraocular Pressure \n\n\n A study was conducted using ocular normotensive Dutch-Belted rabbits to evaluate changes in the intraocular pressure (IOP) of compounds 1, 11, 17 and 18 following topical administration to an eye of a rabbit. \n\n\n The study involved groups of eight rabbits and the rabbits were acclimated for two days before they received a single dose in either the right eye or left eye of the HPCD control. The IOP of the groups of rabbits were recorded at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after dosing of the control. The following day Compound 1 was administered as a single dose (200 meg), as a formulation comprising 1 part of an Ai agonist to 15 parts Hydroxypropyl β- Cyclodextrin (HPpCD) in WFI (i.e. 1: 15 wt/wt) reconstituted with 0.9% Saline for Injection, to the right eye of one group of eight rabbits and IOP measurements were recorded at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after dosing of Compound 1. The rabbits eyes were then washed out and three days later three groups of 8 rabbits were then administered a single dose (200 meg) to the left eye and IOP measurements were recorded at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after dosing with one of Compounds 11, 17 or 18. \n\n\n The results are shown in Figures la, lb, 2a and 2b. It can be seen from Figures la and lb that Compound 1 shows 28% reduction of IOP in normotensive Dutch-Belted rabbits at 2 hours post dosing, with a return of IOP to baseline levels 6 hours post dosing. \n\n\nFigures 2a and 2b show that Compounds 11 and 17 do not show significant changes in IOP relative to baseline after dosing. However, Compound 18 does show a reduction in IOP with the maximum (i.e 20%) IOP reduction measured at 2 hours post dosing, with a return of IOP to baseline levels 6 hours post dosing. \n\n\n Furthermore, given the selectivity and potency towards the Al receptor of these compounds they may be useful for treating a condition whereby agonism of the Al receptor is desirable, such as reducing the intraocular pressure in a subject's eye, slowing a subject's metabolic rate, treating pain, protecting a subject's heart against myocardial damage during cardioplegia, treating a cardiovascular disease including cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy. \n\n\n The present invention and its embodiments have been described in detail. However, the scope of the present invention is not intended to be limited to the particular \n\n\nembodiments of any process, manufacture, composition of matter, compounds, means, methods, and/or steps described in the specification. Various modifications, \n\n substitutions, and variations can be made to the disclosed material without departing from the spirit and/or essential characteristics of the present invention. Accordingly, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate from the disclosure that later modifications, substitutions, and/or variations performing substantially the same function or achieving substantially the same result as embodiments described herein may be utilized according to such related embodiments of the present invention.
