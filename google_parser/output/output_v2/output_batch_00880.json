Description\n\n\n\n\nPRIORITY TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of European Application No. 05103744.8, filed May 4, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) modulates a wide range of physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system and periphery, including anxiety, sleep regulation, aggression, feeding and depression (Hoyer et al., \nPharmacol. Rev. \n46, 157-204, 1994). Both pharmacological characterization and molecular cloning of several 5-HT receptor genes has revealed that 5-HT mediates its diverse physiological actions through a multiplicity of receptor subtypes. These receptors belong to at least two different protein superfamilies: ligand-gated ion channel receptor (5-HT\n3\n) and the G-protein-coupled 7-transmembrane receptors (thirteen distinct receptors cloned to date). In addition, within the G-protein-coupled receptors, serotonin exerts its actions through a multiplicity of signal transduction mechanisms.\n\n\nThe cloning and characterization of the human 5-HT\n5A \nserotonin receptor has been described in \nFEBS Letters, \n355, 242-246 (1994). The sequence is not closely related to that of any previously known serotonin receptor, with the best homology being 35% to the human 5-HT\n1B \nreceptor. It encodes a predicted 357 amino-acid protein, with seven putative transmembrane domains, consistent with that of a G-protein coupled receptor. The sequence is characterized by containing an intron between transmembrane domains V and VI. More recently coupling to Gi/o α mechanisms has been demonstrated with the inhibition of forskolin stimulated cAMP and also evidence for more complicated G-protein mediated coupling mechanisms have been proposed (Francken et al. \nEur. J. Pharmacol. \n361, 299-309, 1998; Noda et al., \nJ. Neurochem. \n84, 222-232, 2003). Furthermore, in WO 2004/096771 it is described the use of compounds, which are active on the 5-HT\n5A \nserotonin receptor for the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, panic disorders, agoraphobia, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, pain, memory disorders, dementia, disorders of eating behaviors, sexual dysfunction, sleep disorders, withdrawal from abuse of drugs, motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease, psychiatric disorders or gastrointestinal disorders. The \nJournal of Psychiatric Research, \n38, 371-376 (2004) describes evidence for a potential significant role of the 5-HT\n5A \ngene in schizophrenia and more specifically in patients with later age at onset.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides compounds of formula I\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n \n \nR\n1 \nis hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen or lower alkyl substituted by halogen;\n \nR is hydrogen or halogen; or\n \nR\n1 \nand R are together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached —CH═CH—CH═CH—;\n \nR\n2 \nis hydrogen, lower alkyl, phenyl optionally substituted by halogen, or is hetaryl optionally substituted by lower alkyl;\n \nR\n3 \nis hydrogen, lower alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkoxy, phenyloxy, benzyloxy, S-lower alkyl, halogen, CN, lower alkyl substituted by halogen or O-lower alkyl substituted by halogen;\n \nR\n4 \nis hydrogen or lower alkyl;\n \naryl is phenyl or naphthyl;\n \nn is 1, 2 or 3; and\n \nm is 1 or 2;\n\n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and tautomeric forms thereof.\n\n \n\n\nThe compounds of formula I can contain asymmetric carbon atoms.

In one such method, a 2-amino-benzamide V is reacted with a hydride transfer reagent, such as LiAlH\n4\n, in a suitable solvent, such as THF. Elevated temperature might be required to carry out the reaction. After hydrolysis of excess reagent, 2-aminomethyl-phenylamine VI is isolated from the mixture by conventional workup and purification. VI can then be reacted with thiophosgene, or a thiophosgene equivalent, in a suitable solvent, such as diethyl ether. A base, such as triethylamine, can be added to the reaction mixture to neutralize acidic by-products. After the evaporation of the solvent, the crude product can be used usually without further purification in the next step.\n\n\nAnother method to obtain 3,4-dihydro-1H-quinazoline-2-thiones VII is as follows: an anthranilic acid II is suitably activated, for instance with a coupling reagent such as HBTU, and converted with N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine in a suitable solvent, such as DMF, and optionally in the presence of a base, such as NMM, to a Weinreb amide of formula III. After isolation and purification by conventional means, III is then converted with a metalloorganic reagent R\n2\n—M, such as alkyllithium, in a suitable solvent, such as THF, for instance by allowing the reaction mixture to warm from low temperature, e.g. −78° C., to room temperature. Conventional workup and purification then gives a phenylalkanone, which can be converted to the corresponding phenylalkanole IV. Alternatively the phenylalkanole IV can be prepared from the corresponding 2-bromo-aniline or its mono-boc-protected derivative, which can be prepared by direct mono-boc-protection or via bis-boc-protection and selective mono-deprotection, by metal-halogen exchange with for example butyl lithium, eventual through prior deprotonation with a base, for instance phenyl magenesium chloride, and quenching with an aldehyde at low to room temperature. The phenylalkanole IV can be converted to 3,4-dihydro-1H-quinazoline-2-thione VII with HSCN, which might be generated in situ from thiocyanate salt, e.g. KSCN, and an acid, e.g. HCl. Elevated temperature is usually necessary to carry out the reaction. VII can then be obtained by conventional workup and purification of the reaction mixture. The latter two steps to the 3,4-dihydro-1H-quinazoline-2-thione VII can be also performed in one step without isolation of the intermediates.\n\n\nThe following abbreviations have been used:\n\n \n \nHBTU=O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate\n \nDMF=N,N-dimethylformamide\n \nNMM=N-methylmorpholine\n \nTHF=tetrahydrofuran\n \n\n\nCompounds of the invention were tested for 5-HT\n5A \nactivity in the following assay.\n\n\nTest Description\n\n\nA [\n3\nH]LSD radioligand binding assay was used to determine the affinity of the compounds for the recombinant human 5-HT\n5A \nreceptor, in membranes from transiently (cDNA) expressed 5-HT\n5A \nreceptors in Human Embryonic Kidney-EBNA (HEK-EBNA) cells. Assay buffer consisted of Tris (50 mM) buffer containing 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl\n2 \n(pH 7.4) and 10 μM pargyline. The binding assay was carried out in 96-well-plates in the presence of [\n3\nH]LSD (approximately 1 nM), approximately 2 μg/well of membrane protein, and 0.5 mg of Ysi-poly-l-lysine SPA beads in a final volume of 200 μl of buffer. Non-specific binding was defined using methiothepin 2 μM. Compounds were tested at 10 concentrations. All assays were conducted in duplicate and repeated at least two times. Assay plates were incubated for 120 min at room temperature before centrifugation. Bound ligand was determined using a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. IC\n50 \nvalues were calculated using a non-linear curve fitting program and Ki values calated using the Cheng-Prussoff equation.\n\n\nThe activity of the present preferred compounds (≦100 nM) is described in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n19.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n58.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n35.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n37\n\n\n22.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n54.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n86.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n90.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n82.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n42.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n89.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n83.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n58\n\n\n53.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n59\n\n\n48.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n62\n\n\n53.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n64\n\n\n19.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n67\n\n\n23.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such pharmaceutical compositions can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragées, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g., in the form of injectable solutions.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, in addition to one or more compounds of the invention, contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acids or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragées and hard gelatin capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatin capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are however usually required in the case of soft gelatin capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oil and the like.\n\n\nSuitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions also can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides a process for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Such process comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I and/or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts possess valuable pharmaceutical properties. Compounds of the present invention are active on the 5-HT\n5A \nreceptor and therefore suitable for the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, panic disorders, agoraphobia, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, pain, memory disorders, dementia, disorders of eating behaviors, sexual dysfunction, sleep disorders, withdrawal from abuse of drugs, motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease, psychiatric disorders or gastrointestinal disorders.\n\n\nThe most preferred indications in accordance with the present invention are those, which include disorders of the central nervous system, for example the treatment of anxiety, depression, sleep disorders and schizophrenia.\n\n\nThe dosage at which the compounds of the invention can be administered can vary within wide limits and will, of course, have to be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In the case of oral administration the dosage for adults can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per day of a compound of general formula I or of the corresponding amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The daily dosage can be administered as single dose or in divided doses and, in addition, the upper limit can also be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTablet Formulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(Wet Granulation)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmg/tablet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nIngredients\n\n\n5 mg\n\n\n25 mg\n\n\n100 mg\n\n\n500 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\n\nCompound of formula I\n\n\n5\n\n\n25\n\n\n100\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\nLactose Anhydrous DTG\n\n\n125\n\n\n105\n\n\n30\n\n\n150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\n\nSta-Rx 1500\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\n\nMicrocrystalline Cellulose\n\n\n30\n\n\n30\n\n\n30\n\n\n150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\n\nMagnesium Stearate\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n167\n\n\n167\n\n\n167\n\n\n831\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nManufacturing Procedure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
