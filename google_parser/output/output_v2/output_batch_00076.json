No. 60/588,502 filed Jul. 16, 2001.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention relates generally to novel hydantoin derivatives that can inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAMs) and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme (TACE) and in so doing prevent the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of treatment using such compounds.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nOsteo- and rheumatoid arthritis (OA and RA, respectively) are destructive diseases of articular cartilage characterized by localized erosion of the cartilage surface. Findings have shown that articular cartilage from the femoral heads of patients with OA, for example, had a reduced incorporation of radiolabeled sulfate over controls, suggesting that there must be an enhanced rate of cartilage degradation in OA (Mankin et al. J. Bone Joint Surg. 52A (1970) 424-434). There are four classes of protein degradative enzymes in mammalian cells: serine, cysteine, aspartic and metalloproteases. The available evidence supports the belief that it is the metalloproteases that are responsible for the degradation of the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage in OA and RA. Increased activities of collagenases and stromelysin have been found in OA cartilage and the activity correlates with severity of the lesion (Mankin et al. Arthritis Rheum. 21, 1978, 761-766, Woessner et al. Arthritis Rheum. 26, 1983, 63-68 and Ibid. 27, 1984, 305-312). In addition, aggrecanase (a newly identified metalloprotease) has been identified that provides the specific cleavage product of proteoglycan, found in RA and OA patients (Lohmander L. S. et al. Arthritis Rheum. 36, 1993, 1214-22).\n\n\nMetalloproteases (MPs) have been implicated as the key enzymes in the destruction of mammalian cartilage and bone. It can be expected that the pathogenesis of such diseases can be modified in a beneficial manner by the administration of MP inhibitors (see Wahl et al. Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 25, 175-184, AP, San Diego, 1990).\n\n\nMMPs are a family of over 20 different enzymes that are involved in a variety of biological processes important in the uncontrolled breakdown of connective tissue, including proteoglycan and collagen, leading to resorption of the extracellular matrix. This is a feature of many pathological conditions, such as RA and OA, corneal, epidermal or gastric ulceration; tumor metastasis or invasion; periodontal disease and bone disease. Normally these catabolic enzymes are tightly regulated at the level of their synthesis as well as at their level of extracellular activity through the action of specific inhibitors, such as alpha-2-macroglobulins and TIMPs (tissue inhibitor of MPs), which form inactive complexes with the MMP's.\n\n\nTumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is a cell-associated cytokine that is processed from a 26 kDa precursor form to a 17 kd active form. See Black R. A. “Tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme” Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2002 January; 34(1):1-5 and Moss M L, White J M, Lambert M H, Andrews R C. “TACE and other ADAM proteases as targets for drug discovery” Drug Discov Today. 2001 Apr. 1; 6(8):417-426, each of which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nTNF-α has been shown to play a pivotal role in immune and inflammatory responses. Inappropriate or over-expression of TNF-α is a hallmark of a number of diseases, including RA, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and sepsis. Inhibition of TNF-α production has been shown to be beneficial in many preclinical models of inflammatory disease, making inhibition of TNF-α production or signaling an appealing target for the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n\nTNF-α is a primary mediator in humans and animals of inflammation, fever and acute phase responses, similar to those observed during acute infection and shock. Excess TNF-α has been shown to be lethal. Blocking the effects of TNF-α with specific antibodies can be beneficial in a variety of conditions, including autoimmune diseases such as RA (Feldman et al, Lancet, (1994) 344, 1105), non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Lohmander L. S. et al., Arthritis Rheum. 36 (1993) 1214-22) and Crohn's disease (Macdonald T. et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 81 (1990) 301).\n\n\nCompounds that inhibit the production of TNF-α are therefore of therapeutic importance for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Recently it has been shown that metalloproteases, such as TACE, are capable of converting TNF-α from its inactive to active form (Gearing et al Nature, 1994, 370, 555). Since excessive TNF-α production has been noted in several disease conditions also characterized by MMP-mediated tissue degradation, compounds which inhibit both MMPs and TNF-α production may also have a particular advantage in diseases where both mechanisms are involved.\n\n\nOne approach to inhibiting the harmful effects of TNF-α is to inhibit the enzyme, TACE before it can process TNF-α to its soluble form. TACE is a member of the ADAM family of type I membrane proteins and mediates the ectodomain shedding of various membrane-anchored signaling and adhesion proteins. TACE has become increasingly important in the study of several diseases, including inflammatory disease, because of its role in cleaving TNF-α from its “stalk” sequence and thus releasing the soluble form of the TNF-α protein (Black R. A. Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2002 34, 1-5).\n\n\nThere are numerous patents and publications which disclose hydroxamate, sulphonamide, hydantoin, carboxylate and/or lactam based MMP inhibitors.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,677,355 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,534,491 (B2), describe compounds that are hydroxamic acid derivatives and MMP inhibitors.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,495,565 discloses lactam derivatives that are potential inhibitors of MMPs and/or TNF-α.\n\n\nPCT Publications WO2002/074750, WO2002/096426, WO20040067996, WO2004012663, WO200274750 and WO2004024721 disclose hydantoin derivatives that are potential inhibitors of MMPs.\n\n\nPCT Publications WO2004024698 and WO2004024715 disclose sulphonamide derivatives that are potential inhibitors of MMPs.\n\n\nPCT Publications WO2004056766, WO2003053940 and WO2003053941 also describe potential inhibitors of TACE and MMPs.\n\n\nThere is a need in the art for inhibitors of MMPs, ADAMs, TACE, and TNF-α, which can be useful as anti-inflammatory compounds and cartilage protecting therapeutics. The inhibition of TNF-α, TACE and or other MMPs can prevent the degradation of cartilage by these enzymes, thereby alleviating the pathological conditions of OA and RA as well as many other auto-immune diseases.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn its many embodiments, the present invention provides a novel class of compounds as inhibitors of TACE, the production of TNF-α, MMPs, ADAMs or any combination thereof, methods of preparing such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more such compounds, methods of preparing pharmaceutical formulations comprising one or

The term “prodrug”, as employed herein, denotes a compound that is a drug precursor which, upon administration to a subject, undergoes chemical conversion by metabolic or chemical processes to yield a compound of Formula I or a salt and/or solvate thereof. A discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, \nPro\n-\ndrugs as Novel Delivery Systems \n(1987) 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in \nBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design\n, (1987) Edward B. Roche, ed., American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, both of which are incorporated herein by reference thereto. The term “prodrug” means a compound (e.g, a drug precursor) that is transformed in vivo to yield a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms (e.g., by metabolic or chemical processes), such as, for example, through hydrolysis in blood. A discussion of the use of prodrugs is provided by T. Higuchi and W. Stella, “Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,” Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987.\n\n\nFor example, if a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group, a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as, for example, (C\n1\n-C\n8\n)alkyl, (C\n2\n-C\n12\n)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-(alkanoyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkanoyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, 1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-(N-(alkoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4-crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4-yl, di-N,N—(C\n1\n-C\n2\n)alkylamino(C\n2\n-C\n3\n)alkyl (such as β-dimethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(C\n1\n-C\n2\n)alkyl, N,N-di(C\n1\n-C\n2\n)alkylcarbamoyl-(C1-C2)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino- or morpholino(C\n2\n-C\n3\n)alkyl, and the like.\n\n\nSimilarly, if a compound of Formula (I) contains an alcohol functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as, for example, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-((C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N—(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyl, α-amino(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkanyl, arylacyl and α-aminoacyl, or α-aminoacyl-α-aminoacyl, where each α-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH)\n2\n, —P(O)(O(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl)\n2 \nor glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate), and the like.\n\n\nIf a compound of Formula (I) incorporates an amine functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as, for example, R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR′-carbonyl where R and R′ are each independently (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkyl, (C\n3\n-C\n7\n) cycloalkyl, benzyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural α-aminoacyl or natural α-aminoacyl, —C(OH)C(O)OY\n1 \nwherein Y\n1 \nis H, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl or benzyl, —C(OY\n2\n)Y\n3 \nwherein Y\n2 \nis (C\n1\n-C\n4\n) alkyl and Y\n3 \nis (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, carboxy(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, amino(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl or mono-N— or di-N,N—(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkylaminoalkyl, —C(Y\n4\n)Y\n5 \nwherein Y\n4 \nis H or methyl and Y\n5 \nis mono-N— or di-N,N—(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkylamino morpholino, piperidin-1-yl or pyrrolidin-1-yl, and the like.\n\n\n“Solvate” means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. “Solvate” encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Non-limiting examples of suitable solvates include ethanolates, methanolates, and the like. “Hydrate” is a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is H\n2\nO.\n\n\n“Effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” is meant to describe an amount of compound or a composition of the present invention effective in inhibiting TACE, the production of TNF-α, MMPs, ADAMS or any combination thereof and thus producing the desired therapeutic, ameliorative, inhibitory or preventative effect.\n\n\nThe compounds of Formula I can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of Formula I herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof, unless otherwise indicated. The term “salt(s)”, as employed herein, denotes acidic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids, as well as basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic bases. In addition, when a compound of Formula I contains both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, such as, but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions (“inner salts”) may be formed and are included within the term “salt(s)” as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful. Salts of the compounds of the Formula I may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of Formula I with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.\n\n\nExemplary acid addition salts include acetates, ascorbates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, fumarates, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, lactates, maleates, methanesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, nitrates, oxalates, phosphates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates, tartarates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates (also known as tosylates) and the like.

Stahl et al, Camille G. (eds.) \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Salts. Properties, Selection and Use\n. (2002) Zurich: Wiley-VCH; S. Berge et al, \nJournal of Pharmaceutical Sciences \n(1977) 66(1) 1-19; P. Gould, \nInternational J. of Pharmaceutics \n(1986) 33 201-217; Anderson et al, \nThe Practice of Medicinal Chemistry \n(1996), Academic Press, New York; and in \nThe Orange Book \n(Food & Drug Administration, Washington, D.C. on their website).

Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers, or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations. The use of the terms “salt”, “solvate” “prodrug” and the like, is intended to equally apply to the salt, solvate and prodrug of enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, positional isomers, racemates or prodrugs of the inventive compounds.\n\n\nPolymorphic forms of the compounds of Formula I, and of the salts, solvates and prodrugs of the compounds of Formula I, are intended to be included in the present invention.\n\n\nThe compounds according to the invention have pharmacological properties; in particular, the compounds of Formula I can be inhibitors of TACE, TNF-α and/or MMP activity.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising as an active ingredient at least one compound of formula (I).\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition of formula (I) additionally comprising at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating disorders associated with TACE, TNF-α, MMPs, ADAMs or any combination thereof, said method comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment a pharmaceutical composition which comprises therapeutically effective amounts of at least one compound of formula (I).\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a use of a compound of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicament to treat disorders associated with TACE, TNF-α, MMPs, ADAMs or any combination thereof.\n\n\nThe compounds of Formula I can have anti-inflammatory activity and/or immunomodulatory activity and can be useful in the treatment of diseases including but not limited to septic shock, hemodynamic shock, sepsis syndrome, post ischaemic reperfusion injury, malaria, mycobacterial infection, meningitis, psoriasis, congestive heart failure, fibrotic diseases, cachexia, graft rejection, cancers such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, diseases involving angiogenesis, autoimmune diseases, skin inflammatory diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and colitis, OA and RA, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, adult Still's disease, ureitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, Behcehe disease, Sjogren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, multiple sclerosis, sciatica, complex regional pain syndrome, radiation damage, hyperoxic alveolar injury, periodontal disease, HIV, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, glaucoma, sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinal disease, scleroderma, osteoporosis, renal ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral stroke, cerebral ischemia, nephritis, hepatitis, glomerulonephritis, cryptogenic fibrosing aveolitis, psoriasis, transplant rejection, atopic dermatitis, vasculitis, allergy, seasonal allergic rhinitis, reversible airway obstruction, adult respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or bronchitis.

The substrate SPDL-3 is an internally quenched peptide (MCA-Pro-Leu-Ala-Gln-Ala-Val-Arg-Ser-Ser-Ser-Dpa-Arg-NH2), with its sequence derived from the pro-TNFα cleavage site. MCA is (7-Methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl. Dpa is N-3-(2,4-Dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl.\n\n\nA 50 μl assay mixture contains 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 100 μM ZnCl\n2\n, 2% DMSO, 0.04% Methylcellulose, 30 μM SPDL-3, 70 pM rhTACEc and a test compound. RhTACEc is pre-incubated with the testing compound for 90 min. at 25° C. Reaction is started by addition of the substrate. The fluorescent intensity (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 405 nm) was measured every 45 seconds for 30 min. using a fluorospectrometer (GEMINI XS, Molecular Devices). Rate of enzymatic reaction is shown as Units per second. Effect of a test compound is shown as % of TACE activity in the absence of the compound.\n\n\nUseful compounds for TACE inhibitory activity can exhibit K\ni \nvalues of less than about 1000 nm, preferably about 0.01 nm to about 1000 nm, more preferably about 0.1 nm to about 100 nm, and most preferably less than about 15 nm.

The bulk composition and each individual dosage unit can contain fixed amounts of the afore-said “more than one pharmaceutically active agents”. The bulk composition is material that has not yet been formed into individual dosage units. An illustrative dosage unit is an oral dosage unit such as tablets, pills and the like. Similarly, the herein-described method of treating a patient by administering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is also intended to encompass the administration of the afore-said bulk composition and individual dosage units.\n\n\nFormulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or a soft gelatin capsules where in the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.\n\n\nAqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example, heptadecaethylene-oxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example, polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example, ethyl or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.\n\n\nOily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example, arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example, beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, e.g., sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, e.g., olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, e.g., liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, e.g., soy beans, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example, sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.\n\n\nSyrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, e.g., as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. The compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\nFor topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compounds of the invention are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouthwashes and gargles.)\n\n\nThe compounds for the present invention can be administered in the intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered as a suppository employing bases such as cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.\n\n\nThe dosage regimen utilizing the compounds of the present invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound thereof employed. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, arrest or reverse the progress of the condition. Optimal precision in achieving concentration of drug within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the drug's availability to target sites. This involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of a drug.

Water and EtOAc were added and the organic phase was washed by water 1-5 times to remove DMF. The organic phase was washed with brine, dried, concentrated, and dried to give the crude product (compound 8B) which was used without further purification.\n\n\nIn step 2, when alcohol was used, the reaction was operated in a similar manner as step 2 in example 6. When an aromatic or heterocyclic stannane was used, the reaction was operated in the following manner. The aromatic or heterocyclic stannane was added into a dry flask, followed by addition of the 4-Bromo-2-methyl-benzoic acid methyl ester (compound 8B), a base, such as Cs\n2\nCO\n3\n, K\n3\nPO\n4\n, and a palladium catalyst, such as Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n2\nCl\n2\n. The flask was placed under vacuum for 1 to 10 minutes to remove oxygen and was refilled with N\n2\n. An appropriate solvent, such as dry CH\n3\nCN, was added and the solution was stirred at 60° C. to reflux temperature overnight to 3 days. The solid was removed by filtration and the solvent was removed. Compound 8C was isolated by chromatography.\n\n\nIn step 3, compound 8C was dissolved in a suitable inert solvent, such as benzene, CCl\n4 \nor α,α,α-Trifluorotoluene. NBS and benzoyl peroxide were added and the solution was stirred at 50° C. to 90° C. for 1 to 24 hours. The solid was filtered and the solvent was removed. The residue was dissolved in ether and washed by water. The ether was removed to afford the compound 8D which was used without further purification.\n\n\nIn step 4, the benzyl bromide (compound 8D) was mixed with hydantoin methyl amine 8E, K\n2\nCO\n3\n, and DMF. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours. Then the solid was removed by filtration. The product could be purified by reverse phase HPLC. Compounds 8F and 8G could be obtained in a variable ratio.\n\n\nStep 5 is used when the compound 8F was isolated in step 4. Compound 8F was dissolved in an appropriate solvent, such as MeOH, and stirred at 50° C. to reflux temperature for 1 to 12 hours. The product could be obtained by removing the solvent by rotary evaporator or purifying via reverse phase chromatography.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nStep 3\n\n\n\nCompound 9C (prepared according to the procedure described by Wyrick, S.

Procedure for Example 1005\n\n\n\nCompound 1005A was treated with one equivalent of hexamethylene tetramine in chloroform or other suitable solvent for about 5 hours. The product was collected by filtration and then treated with HCl in ethanol for one day to three days. The solid was then collected by filtration to give compound 1005B.\n\n\nExample 1006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-Benzofuran-2-yl-2-bromo-ethanone (1006A, 3.0 g, 12.55 mmol), hexamethylene tetramine (1.94 g, 13.80 mmol), and NaI (350 mg) were stirred in CHCl\n3 \n(40 mL) for five hours. The solid was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum. The solid was then suspended in ethanol (30 mL) and HCl (conc, 36% in water, 10 mL) was added. The solution was stirred at 25° C. for 4 d. The solid was collected by filtration and washed by ethanol, dried under vacuum to give compound 1006B (3.05 g, contained NH\n4\nCl).\n\n\nExample 1007\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nStep 1\n\n\n\nTo a flame dried flask was added 2-bromo-1H-benzimidazole (1007A, 2.94 g, 14.92 mmol), anhydrous THF (75 mL), and NaH (95%, 490 mg, 19.4 mmol). The solution was stirred at 25° C. for 45 minutes; SEMCl (3.17 mL, 17.9 mmol) was added. The solution was stirred at 25° C. for 2.5 hours. Water (50 mL) and EtOAc (100 mL) were added. The aqueous layer was separated and extracted with EtOAc (100 mL) once. The organic layers were combined and concentrated under vacuum. The product was purified by SGC (Hexane/EtOAc: 3:1) to give compound 1007B (3.6 g, 74%).\n\n\nStep 2\n\n\nTo a flame dried flask was added compound 1007B (1.427 g, 4.35 mmol) and anhydrous ethyl ether/THF (2:1, 15 mL). The solution was cooled to −78° C. n-Butyllithium (1.6 M, 0.46 mL, 0.73 mmol) was added and stirred at −78° C. for 30 minutes. In another flamed dried pear shaped flask was added N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)glycine-N′-methoxy-N′-methylamide (949 mg, 4.35 mmol) and anhydrous THF (2 mL). Isopropyl magnesium chloride (2 M, 2.5 mL, 5.0 mmol) was added at 0° C. The solution was stirred at 0° C. for 5 minutes and was added into the compound 1003C solution via cannula at −78° C.
