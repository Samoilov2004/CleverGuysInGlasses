Höfle \net al.\n also discovered 37 natural epothilone variants and related compounds produced by \nSorangium cellulosum\n, including epothilones C, D, E, F and other isomers and variants. \nSee\n, \ne.g.\n, \n \nUS Pat. No. 6,624,310\n \n. While in 1993 Höfle \net al\n reported on cytotoxic effects of Epothilones A and B, in 1995 researchers with Merck reported that epothilone B exerts microtubule-stabilizing effects similar to paclitaxel (TAXOL\n®\n) (\nSee\n \nD.M. Bollag, \"\nEpothilones, a New Class of Microtubule-Stabilizing Agents with a Taxol-like Mechanism of Action,\n\" Cancer Research, Vol. 55 (June 1995), at pp. 2325-2333\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious derivatives and analogs of the naturally-occurring epothilones have been discovered at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Examples of epothilone analogs include the aza-epothilone B analog known as ixabepilone, 21-substituted analogs of epothilone B including a 21-amino analog, 2,3-olefinic analogs, C-3 cyano analogs, cyclopropyl analogs, and heterocyclic analogs including aziridinyl-epothilone analogs. \nSee, e.g.\n \n \nUS Pat.

Often, however, anticancer drugs attack not only tumor cells but also normal tissue, leading to undesired side effects. Additionally, anticancer drugs typically present solubility issues such that formulation and delivery of the agents can present challenges, leading to use of solubilizing agents such as CREMOPHOR\n®\n. The cytotoxicity of some anticancer drugs and/or formulation ingredients has been known to cause neuropathy or other side effects such as hypersensitivity reactions. These adverse side effects highlight the need for anticancer therapies that are selective for pathogenic cell populations and therefore result in reduced host toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, as discussed in \n \nWO 2004/054622 A1\n \n scientists have for many years attempted to use monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in targeted drug therapies for delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to patients, but drawbacks have been encountered in terms of, \ninter alia,\n the cleavable moiety, the linkers, and the form of drug released in the cell. It has been reported that successful therapy of tumors with mAbs is limited by inadequate penetration of the antibody in the tumor and by the heterogeneous distribution of corresponding tumor-associated antigen in the tumor tissue. See, \n \nKlar et al., WO 05/074901\n \n (assigned to Schering AG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nUS Pat. App. Pub. No. 2005/0002942\n \n discloses vitamin receptor binding drug delivery conjugates that are useful for targeted drug delivery. There is a need in the art for identifying anticancer agents that could be used to make conjugates such as those described in \n \nUS 2005/0002942\n \n, in the interest of providing targeted drug delivery for cancer treatment.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to compounds having the following Formula X:\n\n \n \n\nor pharmaceutically-acceptable salts and/or solvates thereof, wherein:\n\n \n \n \nK is -O-, -S-, or -NR\n7\n-;\n \nA is -(CR\n8\nR\n9\n)-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-Z- wherein Z is -(CHR\n10\n)-, -C(=O)-, -C(=O)-C(=O)-, -OC(=O)-, -N(R \n11\n)C(=O)-, -SO\n2\n-, or -N(R\n11\n)SO\n2\n-;\n \nB\n1\n is hydroxyl or cyano and R\n1\n is hydrogen or B\n1\n and R\n1\n are taken together to form a double bond;\n \nR\n2\n.

The initial definition provided for a group or term herein applies to that group or term throughout the present specification individually or as part of another group, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"folate-binding moiety or analog or derivative thereof\" as used herein means a moiety that will bind to a folate-receptor protein (not a monoclonal antibody) that is overexpressed or preferentially expressed on cancer cells. For example, it is known that the folate receptor (FR) is over-expressed in ovarian cancer cells and other cancer cells. Illustrative analogs and derivatives of folate are disclosed in \n \nUS Pat. App. Pub. No. 2005/0002942 to Vlahov et al.\n \n, (hereinafter \"Vlahov\"), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"releasable linker\" as used herein means a bivalent linker that includes at least one cleavable bond that can be broken under physiological conditions (e.g. a pH-labile, reductively-labile, acid-labile, oxidatively-labile, or enzyme-labile bond.) It should be appreciated that such physiological conditions resulting in bond breaking include standard chemical hydrolysis reactions that occur, for example, at physiological pH, or as a result of compartmentalization into a cellular organelle, such as an endosome having a lower pH than cytosolic pH, or as a result of reaction with a cellular reducing agent such as glutathione.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood that a cleavable bond can connect two adjacent atoms within the releasable linker and/or connect other groups to the releasable linker such as Q and K, as described herein, at either or both ends of the linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"alkyl\" and \"alk\" whether alone or in combination with some other group, refer to a straight or branched chain alkane (hydrocarbon) radical attached at any available carbon atom, containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Exemplary such groups include, but are not limited to methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, 4,4-dimethylpentyl, octyl, 2,2,4-trimethylpentyl, and the like. \"Lower alkyl\" or \"lower alkylene\" means a straight or branched chain alkyl having one to four carbon atoms. When a subscript is used with reference to an alkyl or other group, the subscript refers to the number of carbon atoms that the group may contain. For example, the term \"C\n0-4\nalkyl\" includes a bond and alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and the term \"C\n1-4\nalkyl\" means alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"alkylene\" refers to a bivalent hydrocarbon radical, as described above for \"alkyl\" but with two points of attachment. For example, a methylene group is a -CH\n2\n- group and an ethylene group is a -CH\n2\n-CH\n7\n- group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the term alkyl is used in connection with another group, as in heterocycloalkyl or cycloalkylalkyl, this means the other identified (first named) group is bonded directly through an alkyl group as defined above (e.g., which may be branched or straight chain). Thus, the term \"alkyl\" is used in this instance to refer to an alkylene, e.g., a divalent alkyl group, having two available points of attachment. For example, cyclopropylC\n1-4\nalkyl means a cyclopropyl group bonded through a straight or branched chain alkylene having one to four carbon atoms, and hydroxyalkyl means the group OH bonded through a straight or branched chain alkylene having one to ten carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. In the case of substituents, as in \"substituted cycloalkylalkyl,\" the alkylene portion of the group, besides being branched or straight chain, may be substituted as recited below for substituted alkyl groups and/or the first named group (\ne.g\n., cycloalkyl) may be substituted as recited herein for that named group (\ne.g\n., cycloalkyl).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Substituted alkyl\" refers to an alkyl group substituted with one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents, at any available point of attachment. However, when an alkyl group is substituted with multiple halo substituents, the alkyl may contain as valence allows up to 10 substituents, more preferably up to seven substituents. Alkyl substituents may include one or more of the following groups: halo \n(e.g.,\n a single halo substituent or multiple halo substituents forming, in the latter case, groups such as a perfluoroalkyl group or an alkyl group bearing Cl\n3\n or CF\n3\n), cyano, -OR\na\n, -SR\na\n, -C(=O)R\na\n, -C(=O)OR\na\n, -OC(=O)R\na\n, -OC(=O)OR\na\n, -NR\na\nR\nb\n, -C(=O)NR\na\nR\nb\n, -OC(=O)NR\na\nR\nb\n, -S(=O)R\na\n, -S(O)\n2\nR\na\n, -NHS(O)\n2\nR\na\n, -NHS(O)\n2\nNHR\na\n, -NHC(=O)NHR\na\n, -NHC(=O)R\na\n, -NHC(O)\n2\nR\na\n, -NHC(=N-CN)R\na\n, aryl, heterocycle, cycloalkyl, and/or heteroaryl, wherein the groups R\na\n and R\nb\n are independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclo, aryl, and heteroaryl, and wherein each R\na\n and/or R\nb\n in turn is optionally substituted with one to four groups selected from alkyl, alkenyl, halogen, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, cyano, nitro, amino, alkylamino, aminoalkyl, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, alkoxy, thiol, alkylthio, phenyl, benzyl, phenyloxy, benzyloxy, C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl, five or six membered heterocyclo or heteroaryl, and/or a lower alkyl or lower alkenyl substituted with one to four groups selected from hydroxy, cyano, halogen, haloC\n1-4\nalkyl, haloC\n1-4\nalkoxy, cyano, nitro, amino, C\n1-4\nalkylamino, aminoC\n1-4\nalkyl, hydroxyC\n1-4\nalkyl, C\n1-4\nalkoxy, thiol, and/or C\n1-4\nalkylthio. For the avoidance of doubt, a \"substituted lower alkyl\" means an alkyl group having one to four carbon atoms and one to four substituents selected from those recited immediately above for substituted alkyl groups. In the case of a substituted lower alkyl, preferably the groups R\na\n and R\nb\n are selected from hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl, phenyl, and five to six membered monocyclic heterocyclo and/or heteroaryl, in turn optionally substituted as above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"alkenyl\" refers to a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical containing from 2 to 12 carbon atoms and at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Exemplary such groups include ethenyl or allyl. \"Substituted alkenyl\" refers to an alkenyl group substituted with one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents, at any available point of attachment. Exemplary substituents include alkyl, substituted alkyl, and those groups recited above as alkyl substituents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"alkoxy\" and \"alkylthio\" refer to an alkyl group as described above bonded through an oxygen linkage (-O-) or a sulfur linkage (-S-), respectively. The terms \"substituted alkoxy\" and \"substituted alkylthio\" refer to a substituted alkyl group as described above bonded through an oxygen or sulfur linkage, respectively. A \"lower alkoxy\" or a C\n1-4\nalkoxy is a group OR, wherein R is lower alkyl (alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Amino\" is NH\n2\n. An alkylamino is -NR\nc\nR\nd\n wherein at least one of R\nc\n and R\nd\n is an alkyl or substituted alkyl, and the other of R\ne\n and R\nd\n is selected from hydrogen, alkyl, and substituted alkyl. An \"aminoalkyl\" means an amino group bonded through an alkylene group (-alkylene-NH\n2\n), and an alkylaminoalkyl means an alkylamino as defined above bonded through an alkylene group (-alkylene-NR\nc\nR\nd\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"aryl\" refers to cyclic, aromatic hydrocarbon groups which have 1 to 3 aromatic rings, especially monocyclic or bicyclic groups such as phenyl or naphthyl. Aryl groups which are bicyclic or tricyclic must include at least one fully aromatic carbocyclic ring but the other fused ring or rings may be aromatic or non-aromatic and may optionally contain heteroatoms, provided that in such cases the point of attachment will be to the aromatic carbocyclic ring. Additionally, when an aryl group has fused thereto a heterocyclic or cycloalkyl ring, the heterocyclic and/or cycloalkyl ring may have one or more carbonyl carbon atoms, i.e., attached via a double bond to an oxygen atom to define a carbonyl group. Thus, examples of \"aryl\" may include without limitation:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nand the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"arylene\" refers to a bivalent aryl radical, i.e., an aryl group as defined above having two points of attachment to two other groups, at any available points of attachment of the aryl ring. Arylene rings may also be substituted with any of the groups suitable for substitution on the aryl groups defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Substituted aryl\" refers to an aryl or arylene group as defined above substituted by one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents, at any point of attachment. Substituents include alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, as well as those groups recited above as alkyl substituents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"carbocyclic\" means a saturated or unsaturated monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic ring (preferably mono- or bicyclic) in which all atoms of all rings are carbon. Thus, the term includes cycloalkyl and aryl rings. The carbocyclic ring may be substituted in which case the substituents are selected from those recited above for cycloalkyl and aryl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"cycloalkyl\" refers to a fully saturated or partially saturated cyclic hydrocarbon group containing from 1 to 3 rings and 3 to 7 carbon atoms per ring. Exemplary fully saturated cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. Exemplary partially saturated cycloalkyl groups include cyclobutenyl, cyclopentenyl, and cyclohexenyl. The term \"cycloalkyl\" includes such groups having a bridge of three to four carbon atoms. Additionally, cycloalkyl groups which are bicyclic or tricyclic must include at least one fully saturated or partially saturated hydrocarbon ring but the other fused ring or rings may be aromatic or non-aromatic and may contain heteroatoms, provided that in such cases the point of attachment will be to the cyclic, non-aromatic hydrocarbon group. Additionally, one or more carbon atoms of the cycloalkyl group may form a carbon-to-oxygen double bond to define a carbonyl group. Thus, examples of \"cycloalkyl\" groups may include, without limitation:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nand the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"cycloalkylene\" refers to a bivalent cycloalkyl radical, i.e., a cycloalkyl group as defined above having two points of attachment to two other groups, at any available two points of attachment of the cycloalkyl ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Substituted cycloalkyl\" refers to a cycloalkyl group as defined above substituted at any available point of attachment with one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents. Cycloalkyl substituents include alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, and those groups recited above as alkyl substituents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"guanidinyl\" means the group\n\n \n \n\nThus, a guanidinylalkyl means an alkyl group bonded to the guanidinyl such as a group having the formula,\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"halogen\" or \"halo\" refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"heteroatoms\" includes oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"haloalkyl\" means an alkyl having one or more halo substituents, including without limitation groups such as -CH\n2\nF, -CHF\n2\n and -CF\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"haloalkoxy\" means an alkoxy group having one or more halo substituents. For example, \"haloalkoxy\" includes -OCF\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the term \"unsaturated\" is used herein to refer to a ring or group, the ring or group may be fully unsaturated or partially unsaturated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"heteroaryl\" refers to an aromatic group which is a 4 to 7 membered monocyclic, 7 to 11 membered bicyclic, or 10 to 15 membered tricyclic ring system, which has at least one ring containing at least one heteroatom. Each ring of the heteroaryl group containing a heteroatom can contain one or two oxygen or sulfur atoms and/or from one to four nitrogen atoms, provided that the total number of heteroatoms in each ring is four or less and each ring has at least one carbon atom. The fused rings completing the bicyclic and tricyclic groups may contain only carbon atoms and may be saturated, partially saturated, or unsaturated. The nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen atoms may optionally be quatemized.

Reference to a compound of the formula (X) herein is understood to include reference to salts and solvates thereof, racemates, diastereomers, and enantiomers thereof, unless otherwise indicated. The term \"salt(s)\", as employed herein, denotes acidic and/or basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids and bases. In addition, when a compound of formula (X) contains both a basic moiety, such as but not limited to a pyridinyl imidazolyl, amine or guanidinyl and an acidic moiety such as but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions may be formed and are included within the term \"salt(s)\" as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful, e.g., in isolation or purification steps which may be employed during preparation. Salts of the compounds of the formula (X) may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of formula (X) with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (X) that contain a basic moiety, such as but not limited to an amine, a guanidinyl group, or a pyridyl or imidazolyl ring, may form salts with a variety of organic and inorganic acids.

Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (\ne.g\n. methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (\ne.g\n. dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates), long chain halides (\ne.g\n. decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides), aralkyl halides (\ne.g\n. benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolvates of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated herein. Solvates of the compounds of formula (X) include, for example, hydrates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll stereoisomers of the present compounds (for example, those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents), including enantiomeric forms and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention. Thus, for example, each reference to compounds of Formula X, is intended to encompass compounds of Formula X'. Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers (\ne.g\n., as a pure or substantially pure optical isomer having a specified activity), or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention may have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations. Racemic forms can be resolved by physical methods, such as, for example, fractional crystallization, separation or crystallization of diastereomeric derivatives, or separation by chiral column chromatography. Individual optical isomers can be obtained from stereospecific processes, wherein starting materials and/or intermediates are selected having a stereochemistry corresponding with that desired for the end products, and the stereochemistry is maintained throughout the reactions, and/or the isomers can be obtained from racemates by any suitable method, including without limitation, conventional methods, such as, for example, salt formation with an optically active acid followed by crystallization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll configurational isomers of the compounds of the present invention are contemplated, either in admixture, or in pure or substantially pure form. As can be appreciated, the preferred configuration can be a function of the particular compound and the activity desired. Configurational isomers may be prepared by the processes described herein, which may be stereoselective. In other words, a desired stereochemistry for the final compounds can be achieved by using starting materials having the corresponding desired stereochemistry, and then maintaining the stereoselectivity throughout the process of preparation. Alternatively, the compounds may be prepared as racemates or diastereomers, and then the desired stereochemistry may be achieved via separation of configurational isomers which can be achieved by any suitable method known in the field, \ne.g\n., such as column chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout the specification, groups and substituents thereof may be chosen to provide stable moieties and compounds useful as pharmaceutically-acceptable compounds and/or intermediate compounds useful in making pharmaceutically-acceptable compounds. One skilled in the field will appreciate suitable selections for variables to achieve stable compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiments indicated herein as exemplary or preferred are intended to be illustrative and not limiting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments of the invention will be apparent to one skilled in the field such as, for example, considering combinations of the embodiments referenced above, and are contemplated as covered within the scope of the invention herein.\n\n\n \nUTILITY\n\n\n \n \n \nOne of the proteins that is over-expressed or preferentially expressed in certain cancer cells is the folate receptor. Folic acid is required for DNA synthesis, and certain human tumor cells are known to over-express folate-binding proteins. For example, both \nCampbell et al., \"\nFolate Binding Protein is a Marker for Ovarian Cancer,\n\" Cancer Research, Vol. 51 (Oct. 1, 1991), at pp. 5329-38\n, and \nConey et al., \"\nCloning of a Tumor-Associated Antigen: MOv 18 and MOv 19 Antibodies Recognize Folate-binding Protein,\n\" Cancer Research, Vol. 51 (Nov. 15, 1991), at pp. 6125-31\n, report that folate-binding proteins are markers for ovarian cancer. Folate-receptor over-expression is also known for other cancers such as, for example, skin, renal, breast, lung, colon, nose, throat, mammary gland, and brain cancers, as well as other cancers referenced herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are useful and can be delivered as epothilone-derived microtubule-stabilizing agents to tumors that express a folate receptor. They are useful in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other proliferative diseases, particularly those cancers characterized by cancer cells or tumors that express the folate receptor. The term \"folate-receptor associated condition\" as used herein comprises diseases or disorders characterized by expression of the folate receptor, or in other words, those diseases or disorders that can be diagnosed or treated based on the level of expression of the folate receptor in diseased tissue as compared with normal tissue.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered for any of the uses described herein by any suitable means, for example, parenterally, such as by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intrasternal injection or infusion techniques (\ne.g\n., as sterile injectable aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), and/or in dosage unit formulations containing non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles or diluents. The pharmaceutical compositions can, for example, be administered in a form suitable for immediate release or extended release. Immediate release or extended release can be achieved by the use of suitable pharmaceutical compositions comprising the present compounds, or, particularly in the case of extended release, by the use of devices such as subcutaneous implants or osmotic pumps.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary compositions for parenteral administration include injectable solutions or suspensions which can contain, for example, suitable non-toxic, parenterally acceptable diluents or solvents, such as mannitol, 1,3-butanediol, water, Ringer's solution, an isotonic sodium chloride solution (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection [Normal Saline] or 5% Dextrose Injection), or other suitable dispersing or wetting and suspending agents, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides, and fatty acids.

Cells were grown in a 37°C incubator containing 5% CO\n2\n for 2 days. On day 2, supernatants were removed from the flasks, and the flasks were divided into 2 groups. One group of cells were incubated with 5 ml of media containing 100 M of folic acid (Sigma) for 30 minutes and the others were grown in 5 ml of media without added folic acid. Cells were then treated with 20 nM of epothilone, epothilone analog, conjugated epothilone, or conjugated epothilone analog for one hour. At the end of the incubation, the drugs were removed from the flasks and the cells were washed with PBS buffer 3x. After washing, 5 ml of complete media were added into each flask, and the cell was grown in the CO\n2\n incubator for 23 hours. The next morning, the cells were removed from the flasks by trypsinization, cell numbers were determined, and then cells were plated in a 6 well plates. Ten days after plating, colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted. The surviving fractions were determined.\n\n\n \nIn vitro MTS Proliferation/Cytotoxicity Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nIn vitro cytotoxicity was assessed in tumor cells using a tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay which takes advantage of the metabolic conversion of MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-3-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) to a reduced form that absorbs light at 492 nm. Cells were seeded 24 hr prior to addition of the epothilone, epothilone analog, conjugated epothilone, or conjugated epothilone analog. Following a 72 hour incubation at 37°C with serially diluted compound, MTS, in combination with the electron coupling agent phenazine methosulfate, was added to the cells. The incubation was continued for 3 hours, then the absorbancy of the medium at 492 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer to obtain the number of surviving cells relative to control populations. The results are expressed as median cytotoxic concentrations (IC\n50\n values).\n\n\n \nFolate Receptor Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nAll sample preparation procedures used for the FR assay were performed at 4°C. Tissue samples were homogenized in homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.02 mg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin; 1 ml buffer/50mg tissue) using a PowerGen 125 homogenizer. Large debris was removed by mild centrifugation (3000 X g for 15 min). Membrane pellets were then collected by centrifugation at 40,000 X g for 60 min and resuspended in solubilization buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM n-octyl-(3-D-glucopyranoside, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide). Insoluble material was removed by a second 40,000 X g 60 min centrifugation, and the total protein concentration of the supernatants was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Pierce Chemical). Each sample was then diluted to 0.25 mg/ml in solubilization buffer, and 100 µl was placed inside each of two Microcon-30 microconcentrators (30,000-MW cutoff, Millipore). Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 X g for 10 min at room temperature to pass all of the liquid through the membrane, as well as to retain the solubilized FRs on the surface of the microconcentrator's membrane. All subsequent centrifugation steps were performed using these same parameters. Then 55 µl of 30 mM acetate buffer (pH 3.0) was added to each microconcentrator, followed by a centrifugation step. Next, 55 µl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was dispensed into each microconcentrator, followed by another centrifugation. Then 50 µl of [\n3\nH]folic acid binding reagent (120 nM [\n3\nH]folic acid (Amersham) in 10 mM Na\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.8mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH 7.4, containing 500 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 25 mM n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside) or 50 µl of a competing reagent (binding reagent plus 120 µM unlabeled folic acid) was added to the appropriate concentrators. Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the concentrators were washed/centrifuged three times with 75 \nµl\n 50 mM n -octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, 0.7 M NaCl in PBS, pH 7.4. After the final wash, the retentates containing the solubilized FRs were recovered from the membrane surface of the microconcentrators by two rinses with 100 µl of PBS containing 4% Triton X-100. The samples were then counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Bioscience). Counts per minute (cpm) values were converted to picomoles of FR based on the cpm of a known standard, and the final results were normalized with respect to the sample protein content.\n\n\n \nAnimals and Tumors\n\n\n \n \n \nFemale CD2FI mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley Inc., 20-22 g) maintained in a controlled environment and provided with water and food ad libitum were used in these studies. The murine FRα(-) Madison 109 (M109) lung carcinoma (Marks et al., 1977) and the FR-expressing (FRa(+)) 98M109 variant were used to evaluate the efficacy of the epothilone, epothilone analog (e.g., epothilone derivative), folate-epothilone conjugate, or folate-epothilone analog conjugate. In addition, the human head and neck epidermoid carcinoma KB grown in nude mice was also used for this purpose.\n\n\n \nDrug Treatment and Antitumor Efficacy Evaluation\n\n\n \n \n \nFor administration of epothilone or epothilone analogs to mice, an excipient consisting of the following was used: CREMOPHOR\n®\n/ethanol/water (1:1:8, v/v). The compounds were first dissolved in a mixture of CREMOPHOR\n®\n/ethanol (50:50). Final dilution to the required dosage strength was made less than 1 hr before drug administration. Mice were administered the agents by bolus IV injection through the tail vein. Folate-epothilone conjugates or folate-epothilone analog conjugates were prepared in sterile phosphate buffered saline and administered to mice by IV bolus injection through the tail vein at a volume of 0.01 mL/g of mice. Treatment of each animal was based on individual body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe required number of animals needed to detect a meaningful response were pooled at the start of the experiment and each was given a subcutaneous inoculation of a tumor brei (2% w/v). Tumors were allowed to grow for 4 days. On the fourth day, animals were evenly distributed to various treatment and control groups. Treated animals were checked daily for treatment related toxicity/mortality. Each group of animals was weighed before the initiation of treatment (Wtl) and then again following the last treatment dose (Wt2). The difference in body weight (Wt2-Wt1) provides a measure of treatment-related toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor response was determined by measurement of tumors with a caliper twice a week, until the tumors reached a predetermined \"target\" size of 1 gm. Tumor weights (mg) were estimated from the formula: \n \n \nTumor weight\n \n=\n \n \n \nlength x width\n \n2\n \n \n \n÷\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntitumor activity was evaluated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which is defined as the dose level immediately below which excessive toxicity (i.e. more than one death) occurred. When death occurred, the day of death was recorded. Treated mice dying prior to having their tumors reach target size were considered to have died from drug toxicity. No control mice died bearing tumors less than target size.

Nos. 6,605,599\n \n; \n \n6,831,090\n \n; \n \n6,800,653\n \n; \n \n6,291,684\n \n; \n \n6,719,540\n \n; \n \n7,173,884\n \n, \n \nUS Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2005/0002942\n \n and \nOrganic Letters, 2001, 3, 2693-2696\n, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference and/or in the Examples that follow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nScheme\n 1, a compound of formula X can be prepared from a compound of Formula II. Compounds of formula II can be obtained by fermentation (see, e.g. \nGerth et al., \"\nStudies on the Biosynthesis of Epothilones: The Biosynthetic Origin of the Carbon Skeleton,\n\" Journal of Antibiotics, Vol. 53, No. 12 (Dec. 2000\n), and \nHofle et al., \"\nEpothilone A and B- Novel 16-Membered Macrolides: Isolation, Crystal Structure, and Conformation in Solution\n\", Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., Vol. 35, No. 13/14, 1567-1.569 (1996\n), the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference) or by synthesis (see, e.g. \n \nVite et al. US Pat. Nos. 6,605,599\n \n; \n \n6,242,469\n \n; \n \n6,867,333\n \n and \n \nUS Pat. Appl. Pub. 2006/004065\n \n, and \nJohnson et al. Organic Letters, 2000, 2:1537-1540\n) the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). For example a compound of formula II where R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, and R\n12\n are methyl, B\n1\n is hydroxyl, R\n1\n and R\n6\n are hydrogen, and R\n2\n is 2-methylthiazol-4-yl is referred to as epothilone A and can be obtained from fermentation of \nSorangium cellulosum\n as referenced above. A compound of formula II can be converted to a compound of formula III where P is a silyl protecting group such as triethylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl, and the like (see, e.g., \nGreene et al., \"\nProtective groups in Organic Synthesis\n\", John Wiley and Sons, Inc.\n). For example, a compound of formula III where P is triethylsilyl can be prepared by treatment of a compound of formula II with chlorotriethylsilane in the presence of Hunig's base. In the case where B\n1\n is hydroxyl in the compound of formula II, then B\n1\n would also be converted to the corresponding silyl ether. A halohydrin of formula IV (Y is Cl, Br, or I) can be prepared from a compound of formula III by treatment with a metal halide salt by methods known in the art. For example, epoxide opening using magnesium bromide etherate at low temperature (-20 to -5°C) can provide diastereomeric halohydrins, where Y is bromine. A compound of formula V can be prepared from a compound of formula IV by displacement of the halogen using, for example, sodium azide in a polar solvent such as dimethyiformamide. An ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize that the stereochemisty at C\n12\n as depicted in Scheme I should not be construed as limiting, but rather exemplary. If desired, inversion of the stereochemistry at the C\n12\n position can be achieved following the Mitsunobu protocol which is well established in the art. For example, treatment of a compound of formula V with p-nitrobenzoic acid, diethylazodicarboxylate, and triphenylphosphine provides the corresponding nitrobenzoate ester, which can then be cleaved by mild ester hydrolysis using, for example, methanolic solutions of ammonia to provide a compound of formula VI. Again, the stereochemistry for C\n12\n as depicted for compound VI is not limiting, and is depicted as such to show that treatment of compound V as described will invert the stereochemistry at that position. Alternatively, other organic acids, azodicarboxylates, and organophosphines can be used to effect the Mitsonuobu inversion. A compound of formula VII where OG is a leaving group such as mesylate, tosylate, nosylate, triflate and the like can be prepared from a compound of formula VI by methods known in the art. For example, treatment of VI with methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine in a suitable organic solvent such as dichloromethane provides a compound of formula VII where OG is mesylate. A compound of formula VIII can be prepared from a compound of formula VII by reduction of the azido group with a reducing agent such as an organophosphine (e.g., trimethylphosphine). Alternatively, a compound of formula VIII can be prepared directly from a compound of formula VI using an organophosphine reducing agent such as triphenylphosphine. A compound of formula IX can be prepared from a compound of formula VIII by methods known in the art (see, e.g., \n \nUS Pat. No. 6,800,653\n \n; and \nRegueiro-Ren et al., Organic Letters, 2001, 3, 2693-2696\n). For instance, a compound of formula IX where H-K-A- is 2-hydroxyethyl can be prepared from a compound of formula VIII by alkylation of the aziridine ring using, for example, excess 3-bromoethanol and a base such as potassium carbonate. A compound of formula X can be prepared from a compound of formula IX by removal of the silyl ether protecting groups using methods known in the art (see, e.g., \nGreene et al., \"\nProtective groups in Organic Synthesis\n\", John Wiley and Sons, Inc.\n). For instance, when P is triethylsilyl, treatment of a compound of formula IX with trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane effects deprotection to provide a compound of formula X.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 2 shows a process for making a folate analog or derivative V and bivalent linker T-Q having the formula XI, below, that may be used with compounds of the invention to make conjugated molecules for targeted drug delivery, e.g., as per formula I, previously described. As shown in Scheme 2, a folate analog and bivalent linker can be assembled using methods known in the art, especially in the case where V is folic acid or a folic acid analog, as described, for example, by \nJackson, et al., Advanced Drug Delivery Rev. 56(2004) 1111-1125\n, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, and T-Q is a peptide. For example, peptidyl folate XI can be prepared as shown in Scheme 2. Sequential peptide coupling of a cysteine-loaded polystyrene resin with Fmoc-protected aspartate, arginine, aspartate, and then glutamate can be effected using PyBOP as coupling agent and piperidine as Fmoc-deprotection agent. N\n10\n-Trifluoroacetamide-protected pteroic acid can be prepared in two steps by enzymatic (carboxypeptidase G) conversion of folic acid to pteroic acid, followed by N\n10\n-protection using trifluoroacetic anhydride. Next, coupling of the N\n10\n-protected pteroic acid to the resin-bound peptide followed by cleavage from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid and removal of the N\n10\n-trifluoroacetyl group using ammonium hydroxide provides a V-T-Q fragment of a compound of formula I where V is folic acid and T-Q is -Asp-Arg-Asp-Cys-OH. Alternatively, pteroic acid analogs could be used in place of pteroic acid and other amino acids, could be used in place of those illustrated in Scheme 2.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 3, below, shows a method for using the epothilone derivatives of the present invention to prepare a conjugated molecule of formula I, for use in targeted drug delivery. As shown in Scheme 3, assembly of compounds of formula I can be achieved by coupling compounds of formula X to a fragment V-T-Q by stepwise incorporation of a releasable linker M. By way of illustration, a compound of formula X where -A-K-H is -CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH can be converted to a disulfanylethyl carbonate XIII using an activated benzotriazole compound of formula XII. A compound of formula XII can be prepared from mercaptoethanol, methoxycarbonyl sulfenyl chloride, and an optionally substituted 2-mercaptopyridine to provide an intermediate 2-(2-pyridin-2-yl)disulfanyl)ethanol, which can then be converted to a compound of formula XII by treatment with diphosgene and an optionally substituted 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Subsequent disulfide exchange with a peptidyl folate such as XI provides a compound of formula I where V is folic acid, T-Q is a -Asp-Arg-Asp-Cys-OH, M is -SCH\n2\nCH\n2\nO(C=O)-, A is -CH\n2\nCH\n2\n- and K is O.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 4 illustrates an alternative method for making a compound of formula X from a compound of formula XIV (see, \n \nU.S. Patent Application No. 60/940,088, filed May 25, 2006\n \n, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference). Compounds of formula XIV can be obtained by methods well known in the field, for example, by fermentation (see, e.g. \nGerth et al., \"\nStudies on the Biosynthesis of Epothilones: The Biosynthetic Origin of the Carbon Skeleton,\n\" Journal of Antibiotics, Vol. 53, No. 12 (Dec. 2000\n), and \nHofle et al., \"\nEpothilone A and B-Novel 16-Membered Macrolides: Isolation, Crystal Structure, and Conformation in Solution\n\", Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., Vol. 35, No. 13/14, 1567-1569 (1996\n), the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference) or by total synthesis (see, e.g. Vite et al. \n \nUS Pat. Nos. 6,605,599\n \n; \n \n6,242,469\n \n; \n \n6,867,333\n \n and \n \nUS Pat. Appl. Pub. 2006/004065\n \n, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). For example a compound of formula XIV where R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, and R\n12\n are methyl, B\n1\n is hydroxyl, R\n1\n and R\n6\n are hydrogen, and R\n2\n is 2-methylthiazol-4-yl is referred to as epothilone C and can be obtained from fermentation of \nSorangium cellulosum\n as referenced above. A compound of formula XIV can be converted to a compound of formula XV where P is a silyl protecting group such as triethylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl, and the like (see, e.g., \nGreene et al., \"\nProtective groups in Organic Synthesis\n\", John Wiley and Sons, Inc.\n). For example, a compound of formula XV where P is triethylsilyl can be prepared by treatment of a compound of Formula XIV with chlorotriethylsilane in the presence of base such as Hunig's base. In the case where B\n1\n is hydroxyl in the compound of formula XIV, then B\n1\n would also be converted to the corresponding silyl ether. A halohydrin of formula XVI or XVII (Y is Cl, Br, or I) can be prepared from a compound of formula XV by treatment with a halogenating agent such as Y\n2\n. For example, electrophilic addition in polar solvents such as acetonitrile using iodine can stereoselectively provide regioisomeric halohydrins of formulas XVI and XVII, where Y is iodine. Alternatively N-halo succinimides can also be used for the same transformation. A compound of formula XVIII can be prepared from compounds of formulas XVI and/or XVII by epoxide ring closure in the presence of bases such as triethylamine or Hunig's base in a polar/aqueous solvent system such as acetonitrile/water. If desired, compound XIV can be directly transformed into a compounds of formula XVI and/or XVII (where P is H ), which could then be converted into the epoxide XVIII (where P is H). A compound of formula XVIII can be transformed into the azido-alcohols of formulas VI and XIX by azide displacement in the presence of inorganic azide salts or tetra-alkyl ammonium azides in alcoholic solvents. In the case where P is a silyl protecting group, compounds of formulas XX and/or XXI where OG is a leaving group such as mesylate, tosylate, nosylate, triflate and the like can be prepared from compounds of formulas VI and/or XIX by methods known in the art. For example, treatment of VI and/or XIX with methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine in a suitable organic solvent such as dichloromethane provides compounds of formulas XX and XXI where OG is mesylate. A compound of formula VIII can be prepared from compounds of formulas XX and/or XXI by reduction of the azido group through methods known in the art. For example, compound VIII can be prepared from compounds of formulas XX and/or XXI through reaction with a reducing agent such as an organophosphine (e.g., trimethylphosphine) in polar solvents such as acetonitrile. Alternatively, when P is H, compound of formula VIII can be directly prepared from compounds of formulas VI and/or XIX by reduction of the azido group with a reducing agent such as an organophosphine (e.g., triphenylphosphine) in polar solvents such as acetonitrile. A compound of formula IX can be prepared from a compound of formula VIII by methods known in the art (see, e.g., \n \nUS Pat. No. 6,800,653\n \n; and \nRegueiro-Ren et al., Organic Letters, 2001, 3, 2693-2696\n). For instance, a compound of formula IX where H-K-A- is 2-hydroxyethyl can be prepared from a compound of formula VIII by alkylation of the aziridine ring using, for example, excess 2-bromoethanol and a base such as potassium carbonate. In case P is a trialkylsilyl, a compound of formula X can be prepared from a compound of formula IX by removal of the silyl ether protecting groups using methods known in the art (see, e.g., \nGreene et al., \"\nProtective groups in Organic Synthesis\n\", John Wiley and Sons, Inc.\n). For instance, when P is triethylsilyl, treatment of a compound of formula IX with trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane effects deprotection to provide a compound of formula X.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention will now be further described with reference to the following illustrative examples.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1: Folate conjugated epothilone analogs\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described in the detailed description above, analogs and derivatives of folate are described in Vlahov. In research and development directed toward folate receptor targeting to tumor cells of conjugated epothilone and epothilone analog compounds, several compounds were conjugated to folate. For example, Compound AA and Compound BB were considered as candidates for conjugation to folic acid:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound AA has activity in Phase II clinical trials, and six folate conjugates of Compound AA (Compounds AA.I to AA.VI; see \n \nFIG. 1\n \n) were prepared and optionally tested for chemical stability, FR binding, and FR-mediated activity in cell culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding of these folate conjugates of Compound AA to FR was determined in an assay that measures displacement of radiolabeled folic acid from FR expressed on KB tumor cells grown to confluence. Finding of the folate conjugates of Compounds AA.I and AA.II to FR was deemed acceptable [relative affinity (RA) >0.25; RA of folic acid = 1.0]. However, surprisingly, none of the six conjugates of Compound AA shown in \nFig. 1\n displayed appreciable cytotoxicity against KB tumor cells in antiproliferation assays that measure \n3\nH-thymidine incorporation (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince conjugates of Compound AA demonstrated disappointing cytotoxicity against tumor cells, studies were conducted using three conjugates of Compound BB (Compounds BB.I to BB.III). Compound BB is also known as epothilone F, and is an analog of Compound AA, where the 21-amino group is replaced by a 21-hydroxyl group. While Compound BB.II (\n \nFig. 2\n \n) displayed cytotoxicity at high concentrations, the activity was not attenuated in competition studies using excess of folic acid. Therefore, the observed cytotoxicity was attributed to non-specific release of Compound BB.II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther epothilone analogs, e.g., aziridinyl epothilones, are known in the art (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,399\n \n, \n \n638\n \n; \nRegueiro-Ren, A, et al. (2001) Org. Letters. 3:2693-96\n) and show potent antitumor cytotoxicity. For example, an MTS assay that compared the relative cytotoxic potency of a number of epothilones analogs against a pair of taxane-resistant cancer cell lines (HCTVM46 and A2790Tax) was conducted (see Table 1). HCTVM46 is a human colon carcinoma cell line derived from the sensitive HCT116 parent line, and is resistant to taxanes due to overexpression of the 170kD p-glyprotein drug efflux transporter. A2780Tax is a human ovarian carcinoma cell line derived from the parent A2780 line, and is resistant to paclitaxel as a result of a mutation in the tubulin amino acid sequence that impairs the ability of paclitaxel to bind.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is shown in Table 1, various aziridinyl epothilone analogs (Compounds CC-EE) show potent antitumor activity against both the HCT116 colon and A2780 ovarian carcinoma cell lines, compared to other known antitumor agents, e.g., paclitaxel, compound AA, and epothilone B.\n\n \nTable 1.

Consequently, having researched a number of epothilone compounds and analogs, there remained a challenge to discover a compound that would be readily available for conjugation to folate, and which would demonstrate activity via specific release of the active epothilone moiety in the tumor cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aziridinyl epothilone compound G was discovered, having the formula.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound G (see Examples 2 and 3) proved surprisingly easy to conjugate to folic acid to form Compound J (see Example 2) with relative affinity of 0.77 for folate receptor, when compared to folic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnexpectedly, the polar hydroxyl group on the aziridine side chain did not adversely affect the antitumor activity of the aziridine epothilone analogs. This is important because it is the aziridine epothilone analog, e.g., Compound G, that mediates the antitumor effects upon release from folic acid. The potency of Compound G, and three other highly potent epothilone analogs (ixabepilone, Compound AA, and Compound BB) were evaluated by the colony formation assay that is described above. The concentration needed to kill 90% of clonogenic KB cancer cells (IC\n90\n) was determined after a drug exposure duration of 17 hours. As shown in \n \nFIG. 3\n \n \n,\n compound G exhibited an IC\n90\n of 4.3 nM and was ~2, 4, and 6-fold more potent than compound CC, compound AA, and ixabepilone, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugation of compound G to form Compound J did not affect the antitumor activity of compound G. Compound J demonstrated substantial cytotoxic activity against tumor cells \nin vivo.\n In the KB \nin vivo\n FRa(+) tumor model, compound J demonstrated activity both at is maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and at two lower does levels that produced minimal toxicity (see \n \nFIG. 4\n \n). In contrast, ixabepilone was active only at its MTD (5 µmol/kg). When compared at the MTDs, compound J produced superior antitumor effects than ixabepilone (\n \nFIG. 4\n \n).\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast, with the FRα(-) M109 parent tumor model, Compound J had poor activity at all dose levels tested, including at its MTD (2.4 µmol/kg), whereas ixabepilone was active at its MTD of 5 µmol/kg. (\n \nFIG. 5\n \n). These results indicate that the FRα (-) M109 is sensitive to ixabepilone and the inactivity of compound J is likely largely a consequence of the absence of FRα expression by this tumor. These results also provide evidence that the antitumor activity of compound J may be mediated through the FRα receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther evidence of the FRα mediated drug delivery mechanism of compound J is provided by the observation that co-administration of a folate analog at 20-fold excess of the dose of compound J could substantially compete with compound J for receptor binding and protect FRα(+) 98M 109 tumors from the antitumor effects of compound J. (\n \nFIG. 6\n \n). Since Compound G and the conjugate (Compound J) have surprising anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo, and since the antitumor activities of Compound J may be attributed to FRα(+)-mediated effects, also described herein is the conjugation of aziridinyl epothilone analog Compound G (see Examples 2 and 3) to form Compound J. (See Example 2).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 2: PREPARATION OF COMPOUND J\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(S)-2-(4-((3-amino-4-oxo-3,4-dihydropteridin-6-yl)methylamino)benzamido)-5-((S)-3-carboxy-1-((S)-1-((S)-3-carboxy-1-((R)-1-carboxy-2-(2-(2-((3-((1S,3S,7S,10R,11S,12S,16R)-7,11-dihydroxy-8,8,10,12-tetramethyl-3-((E)-1-(2-methylthiazol-4-yl)prop-1-en-2-yl)-5,9-dioxo-4-oxa-17-azabicyclo[14.1.0]heptadecan-17-yl)ethoxy)carbonyloxy)ethyl)disulfanyl)ethylamino) -1-oxopropan-2-ylamino)-5-guanidino-1-oxopentan-3-ylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-ylamino)-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n\n \n\n\nA.

This sequence was repeated for each amino acid coupling step.\n\n\n \nSynthesis of N\n10\n-TFA-protected pteroic acid:\n\n\n \n \n \nTo 10 L of 0.1 M tris base solution (121.1 g tris base in 10 L water) in a 22 L mechanically-stirred round bottomed flask, equipped with a heating mantle, was added 200 g (0.453 mole) of folic acid. The mixture was stirred to dissolve the folic acid, and then 500 mg (3.67 mmole) zinc chloride was added. Carboxypeptidase G (13 x 20 unit vials available from Sigma) was added and the pH was adjusted to 7.3 with 1N HCl and maintained throughout the reaction. The mixture was protected from light and heated at 30°C for 8-10 days (use of an auto-titrator to hold the pH constant reduced the conversion time by 4-5 days). The reaction was monitored by analytical HPLC until 80% conversion was achieved (further conversion is desirable but has not been optimized). The product was precipitated from the reaction mixture by adjusting the solution to pH=3.0 using 6N HCl. The slurry was transferred to a centrifuge vial and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted. The wet solid was then directly purified as follows (the wet solid could be frozen for storage or first freeze-dried; however, storage of wet solids in the freezer until dissolution was more efficient). To 40 g of crude pteroic acid in 700 mL of water was added 1.0 M NaOH until pH=11.5. The mixture was filtered (Whatman type 1) and then chromatographed (column: 10 x 120 cm; stationary phase: 8 kg DEAE cellulose; mobile phase: 1.0 M NaCl/0.01 M NaOH, pH=11.5; flow rate: 17 ml/min). One liter yellow-colored fractions were collected and analyzed by HPLC. Fractions containing pure pteroic acid were adjusted to pH=3 with 6 M HCl to precipitate pteroic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was decanted and washed with water (3x). The solid was freeze-dried for at least 72 hr. The impact of residual water on the next reaction is not known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pteroic acid was further dried over P\n2\nO\n5\n under high vacuum for over 24 hr (note that similar results in the protection step were obtained without this additional drying step). Next, 100g (0.32 mol) of pteroic acid was added to a 5 L round bottom flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and an argon inlet, and stored under high vacuum overnight. Argon gas was added followed by 3500 g (2316 mL) of trifluoroacetic anhydride. The flask was sealed with a rubber stopper or argon inlet adaptor, and then stirred vigorously. The flask was protected from light and stirred at room temperature under argon atmosphere for 7 days (the reaction was monitored by HPLC of aliquots diluted 20x each with water and DMSO). The mixture was rotary evaporated to dryness and treated with 2.5 L of 3% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature to hydrolyze anhydride by-products. Rotary evaporation gave a dry solid. The solid was suspended in 2 L of water and then centrifuged in 250-mL centrifuge bottles at 3000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was removed and the solid was washed with water and centrifuged (4 times). The solid was freeze-dried for 3 days, transferred to amber bottles, and dried under high vacuum in the presence of P\n2\nO\n5\n for 2 days (Purity ≥95%; residual TFA assessed by Elemental Analysis).\n\n\n \nCleavage step:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe protected intermediate was released from the resin using the cleavage reagent prepared from 92.5% (50mL) TFA, 2.5% (1.34mL) H\n2\nO 2.5% (1.34mL) Triisopropylsilane, and 2.5% (1.34mL) ethanedithiol. The cleavage reagent was added to the reaction vessel (25mL). Argon was bubbled through the mixture for 1.5 hr. The liquid was drained from the vessel, and resin was washed with remaining reagent (3 X 8mL). The volatiles were concentrated by rotary evaporation to a volume of 10 mL. Diethyl ether (35.0 mL) was added to effect precipitation. The solid was collected by centrifugation and dried to give 1.25 g of cleavage product.\n\n\n \nDeprotection step:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe \nN\n \n10\n-trifluoroacetyl protecting group in the pteroic acid portion was removed under basic conditions. Starting with 250 mg of protected intermediate in 10 mL water, the pH was adjusted to 9.3 and maintained for 1 hr using 4: H\n2\nO:ammonium hydroxide (1 - 2 mL).

Description\n\n\n\n\nHJURP PEPTIDES AND VACCINES INCLUDING THE SAME\n\n\n\n\n\n The present invention relates to the field of biological science, more specifically to the field of cancer therapy.  In particular, the present invention relates to novel peptides that are extremely effective as cancer vaccines as well as drugs for treating and preventing tumors.\n\n\n\n \nPriority\n \n \n \nThe present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Applications No. 61/312,931, filed on March 11, 2010, and 61/315,320, filed on March 18, 2010 the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIt has been demonstrated that CD8 positive CTLs recognize epitope peptides derived from tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) found on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule, and then kill the tumor cells.  Since the discovery of the melanoma antigen (MAGE) family as the first example of TAAs, many other TAAs have been discovered through immunological approaches (\nNPL\n 1,Boon T, Int J Cancer 1993 May 8, 54(2): 177-80; NPL 2, Boon T & van der Bruggen P, J Exp Med 1996 Mar 1, 183(3): 725-9).  Some of these TAAs are currently undergoing clinical development as immunotherapeutic targets.\n\n\n\n\n     Favorable TAAs are indispensable for the proliferation and survival of cancer cells.  The use of such TAAs as targets for immunotherapy may minimize the well-described risk of immune escape of cancer cells attributable to deletion, mutation, or down-regulation of TAAs as a consequence of therapeutically driven immune selection.  Accordingly, the identification of new TAAs, capable of inducing potent and specific anti-tumor immune responses warrants further development of clinical investigation of peptide vaccination strategies for various types of cancer is ongoing (NPL 3, Harris CC, J Natl Cancer Inst 1996 Oct 16, 88(20): 1442-55; NPL 4, Butterfield LH et al., Cancer Res 1999 Jul 1, 59(13): 3134-42; NPL 5, Vissers JL et al., Cancer Res 1999 Nov 1, 59(21): 5554-9; NPL 6, van der Burg SH et al., J Immunol 1996 May 1, 156(9): 3308-14; NPL 7, Tanaka F et al., Cancer Res 1997 Oct 15, 57(20): 4465-8; NPL 8, Fujie T et al., Int J Cancer 1999 Jan 18, 80(2): 169-72; NPL 9, Kikuchi M et al., Int J Cancer 1999 May 5, 81(3): 459-66; NPL 10, Oiso M et al., Int J Cancer 1999 May 5, 81(3): 387-94).  To date, several clinical trials using these tumor-associated antigen derived peptides have been reported.  Unfortunately, many of the current cancer vaccine trial have shown only a low objective response rate (NPL 11, Belli F et al., J Clin Oncol 2002 Oct 15, 20(20): 4169-80; NPL 12, Coulie PG et al., Immunol Rev 2002 Oct, 188: 33-42; NPL 13, Rosenberg SA et al., Nat Med 2004 Sep, 10(9): 909-15). Accordingly, there remains a need for new TAAs as immunotherapeutic targets.\n\n\n\n\n  HJURP (reference sequence is shown in GenBank Accession No: NM_018410), Holliday junction recognizing protein, was identified from genome-wide expression profile analysis of non-small cell lung cancer using cDNA microarray composed of 27,648 genes (NPL 14, Kato T et al., Cancer Res. 2007 Sep 15;67(18):8544-53).  HJURP is involved in the homologous recombination pathway in the DSB (DNA double-strand break) repair process through interaction with hMSH5 (human MutS homologue 5) and NBS1 (Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein 1), which is a part of the MRN protein complex.  Treatment of cancer cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against HJURP caused abnormal chromosomal fusions and led to genomic instability and senescence.  In addition, HJURP overexpression was observed in a majority of human lung cancers (\nPTL\n 1, WO2004/031413).  Taken together, these data suggests that HJURP may be applicable to the target of cancer immunotherapy for patient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[PTL 1] WO2004/031413\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[NPL 1] Boon T, Int J Cancer 1993 May 8, 54(2): 177-80\n\n[NPL 2] Boon T & van der Bruggen P, J Exp Med 1996 Mar 1, 183(3): 725-9\n\n[NPL 3] Harris CC, J Natl Cancer Inst 1996 Oct 16, 88(20): 1442-55\n\n[NPL 4] Butterfield LH et al., Cancer Res 1999 Jul 1, 59(13): 3134-42\n\n[NPL 5] Vissers JL et al., Cancer Res 1999 Nov 1, 59(21): 5554-9\n\n[NPL 6] van der Burg SH et al., J Immunol 1996 May 1, 156(9): 3308-14\n\n[NPL 7] Tanaka F et al., Cancer Res 1997 Oct 15, 57(20): 4465-8\n\n[NPL 8] Fujie T et al., Int J Cancer 1999 Jan 18, 80(2): 169-72\n\n[NPL 9] Kikuchi M et al., Int J Cancer 1999 May 5, 81(3): 459-66\n\n[NPL 10] Oiso M et al., Int J Cancer 1999 May 5, 81(3): 387-94\n\n[NPL 11] Belli F et al., J Clin Oncol 2002 Oct 15, 20(20): 4169-80\n\n[NPL 12] Coulie PG et al., Immunol Rev 2002 Oct, 188: 33-42\n\n[NPL 13] Rosenberg SA et al., Nat Med 2004 Sep, 10(9): 909-15\n\n[NPL 14] Kato T et al., Cancer Res. 2007 Sep 15;67(18):8544-53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of the suitable targets of immunotherapy.  Because TAAs are generally perceived by the immune system as \"self\" and therefore often have no immunogenicity, the discovery of appropriate targets is of extreme importance.  Recognizing that HJURP (SEQ ID NO: 50), typically encoded by the gene of GenBank Accession No. NM_018410 (SEQ ID NO: 49) has been identified as up-regulated in cancers, including, but not limited to, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor, the present invention focuses on HJURP as a candidate for the target of cancer/tumor immunotherapy, more particularly novel HJURP epitope peptides that may serve as suitable immunotherapeutic targets.\n\n\n\n\n     To that end, the present invention is directed, at least in part, to the identification of specific epitope peptides among the gene products of HJURP that possess the ability to induce CTLs specific to HJURP.  As discussed in detail below, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from a healthy donor were stimulated using HLA-A*2402 or HLA-A*0201 binding candidate peptides derived from HJURP.  CTL lines were then established with specific cytotoxicity against the HLA-A24- or HLA-A2-positive target cells pulsed with each of candidate peptides.  The results herein demonstrate that these peptides are HLA-A24 or HLA-A2 restricted epitope peptides that may induce potent and specific immune responses against cells expressing HJURP.  These results further demonstrate that HJURP is strongly immunogenic and that the epitopes thereof are effective targets for caner/tumor immunotherapy.\n\n\n\n\n     Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide isolated peptides binding to HLA antigen, derived from HJURP (SEQ ID NO: 50) and the immunologically active fragments thereof.  Such peptides are expected to have CTL inducibility and, thus, can be used to induce CTL ex vivo or to be administered to a subject for inducing immune responses against cancers examples of which include, but are not limited to, AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor.  Preferred peptides are nonapeptides or decapeptides, and more preferably, a nonapeptide or decapeptide having an amino acid sequence selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 and 26 to 48.  Peptides having an amino acid sequence selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, 7, 18, 23, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 35, 37, 38 and 43 showed strong CTL inducibility and thus are particularly preferred.\n\n     The present invention also contemplates modified peptides having an amino acid sequence selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 and 26 to 48, wherein one, two or more amino acids are substituted deleted or added, so long as the modified peptides retain the requisite original CTL inducibility.\n\n     The present invention further encompasses isolated polynucleotides encoding any peptides of the present invention.  These polynucleotides can be used to induce or prepare APCs with CTL inducibility or, like the above-described peptides of the present invention, can be administered to a subject for inducing immune responses against cancers.\n\n\n\n\n     When administered to a subject, the present peptides are presented on the surface of APCs so as to induce CTLs targeting the respective peptides.  Therefore, one object of the present invention is to provide agents, compositions or substances that include or incorporate any peptides or polynucleotides of the present invention for inducing CTLs.  Such agents, compositions and/or substances can be used for the treatment and/or prophylaxis and/or postoperative recurrence of cancers, examples of which include, but are not limited to, AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor.  Thus, it is yet another object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical agents, compositions or substances for the treatment and/or prophylaxis and/or prevention of postoperative recurrence of cancer that include or incorporate any peptides or polynucleotides of the present invention. Instead of or in addition to the present peptides or polynucleotides, the pharmaceutical agents, compositions or substances of the present invention may include as active ingredients APCs or exosomes that present any of the present peptides.\n\n\n\n\n     The peptides or polynucleotides of the present invention may be used to induce APCs that present on the surface a complex of an HLA antigen and a present peptide, for example, by contacting APCs derived from a subject with the peptide or introducing a polynucleotide encoding a peptide of the present invention into APCs.  Such APCs have high CTL inducibility against target peptides and find use in cancer immunotherapy.  Accordingly, the present invention encompasses the methods for inducing APCs with CTL inducibility as well as APCs obtained by such methods.\n\n\n\n\n     It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for inducing CTL, such methods including the step of co-culturing CD8 positive cells with APCs or exosomes presenting the peptide of the present invention on its surface or the step of introducing a gene that includes a polynucleotide encoding a T cell receptor (TCR) subunit polypeptide binding to the present peptide. CTLs obtained by such methods find use in the treatment and/or prevention of cancers, examples of which include, but are not limited to, AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor.  Therefore, it is yet another object of present invention to provide CTLs obtained by the present methods.\n\n\n\n\n     It is yet another object of the present invention to provide methods for inducing an immune response against cancer in a subject in need thereof, such methods including the step of administering compositions or substances including the HJURP polypeptides or immunologically active fragments thereof, polynucleotides encoding HJURP polypeptides, exosomes or the APCs presenting HJURP polypeptides.\n\n\n\n\n     The applicability of the present invention extends to any of a number of diseases relating to or arising from HJURP overexpression, such as cancer, examples of which include, but are not limited to, AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor.\n\n\n\n\n     More specifically, the present invention provides followings:\n\n[1] An isolated peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 50 or an immunologically active fragment thereof, wherein said peptide binds an HLA antigen and has cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) inducibility,\n\n[2] The isolated peptide of [1], wherein the HLA antigen is HLA-A24,\n\n[3] The isolated peptide of [1], wherein the HLA antigen is HLA-A2,\n\n[4] The isolated peptide of [1] or [2], wherein said peptide comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24,\n\n[5] The isolated peptide of [1] or [3] , wherein said peptide comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 26 to 48,\n\n[6] An isolated peptide selected from the group consisting of: \n\n(a) an isolated peptide that binds to an HLA antigen, has cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) inducibility, and consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 50 or an immunologically active fragment thereof,\n\n(b) the isolated peptide of (a), wherein the HLA antigen is HLA-A24, \n\n(c) the isolated peptide of (a) or (b), which comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24, and\n\n(d) the isolated peptide of (a) or (b), wherein said peptide comprises a modified peptide having of an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24, wherein 1, 2, or several amino acid(s) are substituted, deleted, or added, provided said modified peptide retains the CTL inducibility of the original peptide ,\n\n[7] An isolated peptide selected from the group consisting of: \n\n(a) an isolated peptide binding to an HLA antigen and having cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) inducibility, wherein the peptide consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 50 or an immunologically active fragment thereof,\n\n(b) the isolated peptide of (a), wherein the HLA antigen is HLA-A2, \n\n(c) the isolated peptide of (a) or (b), which comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 26 to 48, and\n\n(d) the isolated peptide of (a) or (b), wherein said peptide comprises a modified peptide having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 26 to 48, wherein 1, 2, or several amino acid(s) are substituted, deleted, or added provided said modified peptide retains the CTL inducibility of the original peptide,\n\n[8] The isolated peptide of [6] which consists of an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24, wherein the peptide has one or both of the following characteristics:\n\n(a) The second amino acid from N-terminus is selected from the group consisting of phenylalanine, tyrosine, methionine and tryptophan;

The CTLs in \nwell number #\n4 stimulated with HJURP-A24-9-28 (SEQ ID NO: 3) (a), in #4 with HJURP-A24-9-263 (SEQ ID NO: 4) (b), in #4 with HJURP-A24-9-408 (SEQ ID NO: 7) (c), in #6 with HJURP-A24-10-383 (SEQ ID NO: 18) (d) and in #4 with HJURP-A24-10-162 (SEQ ID NO: 23) (e), showed potent IFN-gamma production compared with the control, respectively.  The square on the well of these pictures indicates that the cells from corresponding well were expanded to establish CTL lines.  In contrast, as is the typical case for negative data, no specific IFN-gamma production was detected from the CTL stimulated with HJURP-A24-9-149 (SEQ ID NO: 1) against peptide-pulsed target cells (f).  The square on the well of these pictures indicated that the cells from corresponding well were expanded to establish CTL lines.  In the figures, \"+\" indicates the IFN-gamma production against target cells pulsed with the appropriate peptide, and \"-\" indicates the IFN-gamma production against target cells not pulsed with any peptides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 is composed of a series of line graphs, (a) and (b), depicting the results of an IFN-gamma ELISA assay that, in turn, demonstrates the IFN-gamma production of CTL lines stimulated with HJURP-A24-9-263 (SEQ ID NO: 4) (a) and HJURP-A24-9-408 (SEQ ID NO: 7) (b).  The results demonstrate that CTL lines established by stimulation with each peptide show potent IFN-gamma production as compared with the control. In the figures, \"+\" indicates the IFN-gamma production against target cells pulsed with the appropriate peptide and \"-\" indicates the IFN-gamma production against target cells not pulsed with any peptides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 is a line graph depicting the IFN-gamma production of a CTL clone established by limiting dilution from the CTL line stimulated with HJURP-A24-9-408 (SEQ ID NO: 7).

Peptides\n \n \n \nTo demonstrate that peptides derived from HJURP function as an antigen recognized by CTLs, peptides derived from HJURP (SEQ ID NO: 50) were analyzed to determine whether they were antigen epitopes restricted by HLA-A24 or A2 which are commonly encountered HLA alleles (Date Y et al., Tissue Antigens 47: 93-101, 1996; Kondo A et al., J Immunol 155: 4307-12, 1995; Kubo RT et al., J Immunol 152: 3913-24, 1994).\n\n\n\n\n        Candidates of HLA-A24 binding peptides derived from HJURP were identified using the information on their binding affinities to HLA-A24.  The following candidate peptide were identified\" \n\n       HJURP-A24-9-576 (SEQ ID NO: 2),\n\n       HJURP-A24-9-28 (SEQ ID NO: 3),\n\n       HJURP-A24-9-263 (SEQ ID NO: 4),\n\n       HJURP-A24-9-403 (SEQ ID NO: 5),\n\n       HJURP-A24-9-388 (SEQ ID NO: 6),\n\n       HJURP-A24-9-408 (SEQ ID NO: 7),\n\n       HJURP-A24-9-544 (SEQ ID NO: 8),\n\n       HJURP-A24-9-280 (SEQ ID NO: 9),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-149 (SEQ ID NO: 10),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-395 (SEQ ID NO: 11),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-729 (SEQ ID NO: 12),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-56 (SEQ ID NO: 13),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-590 (SEQ ID NO: 14),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-635 (SEQ ID NO: 15),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-389 (SEQ ID NO: 16),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-28 (SEQ ID NO: 17),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-383 (SEQ ID NO: 18),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-379 (SEQ ID NO: 19),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-235 (SEQ ID NO: 20),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-218 (SEQ ID NO: 21),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-388 (SEQ ID NO: 22),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-162 (SEQ ID NO: 23), and\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-627 (SEQ ID NO: 24).\n\n\n\n\n        Moreover, after in vitro stimulation of T-cells by dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed (loaded) with these peptides, CTLs were successfully established by stimulating the DCs with each of the following peptides:\n\n        HJURP-A24-9-28 (SEQ ID NO: 3),\n\n       HJURP-A24-9-263 (SEQ ID NO: 4),\n\n       HJURP-A24-9-408 (SEQ ID NO: 7),\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-383 (SEQ ID NO: 18), and\n\n       HJURP-A24-10-162 (SEQ ID NO: 23).\n\n        These established CTLs showed potent specific CTL activity against target cells pulsed with respective peptides.  These results demonstrate that HJURP is an antigen recognized by CTLs and that the peptides tested are epitope peptides of HJURP restricted by HLA-A24.\n\n\n\n\n     Candidates of HLA-A2 binding peptides derived from HJURP were identified based on their binding affinities to HLA-A2.  The following candidate peptides were identified:\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-496 (SEQ ID NO: 26),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-354 (SEQ ID NO: 27),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-266 (SEQ ID NO: 28),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-51 (SEQ ID NO: 29),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-406 (SEQ ID NO: 30),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-129 (SEQ ID NO: 31),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-599 (SEQ ID NO: 32),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-226 (SEQ ID NO: 33),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-274 (SEQ ID NO: 34),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-386 (SEQ ID NO: 35),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-244 (SEQ ID NO: 36),\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-405 (SEQ ID NO: 37),\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-128 (SEQ ID NO: 38),\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-649 (SEQ ID NO: 39),\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-273 (SEQ ID NO: 40),\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-266 (SEQ ID NO: 41),\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-598 (SEQ ID NO: 42),\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-54 (SEQ ID NO: 43),\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-731 (SEQ ID NO: 44),\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-397 (SEQ ID NO: 45),\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-157 (SEQ ID NO: 46),\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-455 (SEQ ID NO: 47) and\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-156 (SEQ ID NO: 48).\n\n\n\n\n     Moreover, after in vitro stimulation of T-cells by dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed (loaded) with these peptides, CTLs were successfully established using each of the following peptides;\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-496 (SEQ ID NO: 26),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-354 (SEQ ID NO: 27),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-406 (SEQ ID NO: 30),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-129 (SEQ ID NO: 31),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-599 (SEQ ID NO: 32),\n\n       HJURP-A2-9-386 (SEQ ID NO: 35),\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-405 (SEQ ID NO: 37),\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-128 (SEQ ID NO: 38), and\n\n       HJURP-A2-10-54 (SEQ ID NO: 43).\n\n        These established CTLs showed potent specific CTL activity against target cells pulsed with respective peptides.  These results demonstrate that HJURP is an antigen recognized by CTLs and that the peptides tested are epitope peptides of HJURP restricted by HLA-A2.\n\n\n\n\n        Since the HJURP gene is over expressed in cancer cells such as AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor and not expressed in most normal organs, it is a good target for cancer immunotherapy.  Thus, the present invention provides nonapeptides (peptides composed of nine amino acid residues) and decapeptides (peptides composed of ten amino acid residues) of CTL-recognized epitopes from HJURP.  Alternatively, the present invention provides isolated peptides which bind to HLA antigens and induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), wherein the peptide has an amino acid sequence selected from among of SEQ ID NO: 50 or is an immunologically active fragment thereof.  More specifically, in some embodiments, the present invention provides peptides having an amino acid sequence selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 and 26 to 48.\n\n\n\n\n        Generally, software programs now available, for example, on the Internet, such as those described in Parker KC et al., J Immunol 1994 \nJan\n 1, 152(1): 163-75 and Nielsen M et al., Protein Sci 2003; 12: 1007-17 can be used to calculate the binding affinities between various peptides and HLA antigens in silico.  Binding affinity with HLA antigens can be measured as described, for example, in Parker KC et al., J Immunol 1994 \nJan\n 1, 152(1): 163-75, Kuzushima K et al., Blood 2001, 98(6): 1872-81, Larsen MV et al. BMC Bioinformatics. 2007 \nOct\n 31; 8: 424, Buus S et al. Tissue Antigens., 62:378-84, 2003, Nielsen M et al., Protein Sci 2003; 12: 1007-17, and Nielsen M et al. PLoS ONE 2007; 2: e796, which are summarized in, e.g., Lafuente EM et al., Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2009, 15, 3209-3220.  Methods for determining binding affinity are described, for example, in the Journal of Immunological Methods (1995, 185: 181-190) and Protein Science (2000, 9: 1838-1846).  Therefore, one can use such software programs to select those fragments derived from HJURP that have high binding affinity with HLA antigens.  Accordingly, the present invention encompasses peptides composed of any fragments derived from HJURP, which would be determined to bind with HLA antigens by such known programs.  Furthermore, such peptides may include the peptide composed of the full length of HJURP.\n\n\n\n\n  The peptides of the present invention, particularly the nonapeptides and decapeptides of the present invention, may be flanked with additional amino acid residues so long as the peptides retain their CTL inducibility.  The particular additional amino acid residues may be composed of any kind of amino acids so long as they do not impair the CTL inducibility of the original peptide.  Thus, the present invention encompasses peptides having a binding affinity for HLA antigens, including peptides derived from HJURP.  Such peptides are, for example, less than about 40 amino acids, often less than about 20 amino acids, usually less than about 15 amino acids.\n\n\n\n\n  Generally, it is known that modifications of one or more amino acids in a peptide do not influence the function of the peptide, or in some cases even enhance the desired function of the original protein.  In fact, modified peptides (i.e., peptides composed of an amino acid sequence modified by substituting, deleting, inserting, or adding one, two or several amino acid residues to an original reference sequence) have been known to retain the biological activity of the original peptide (Mark et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1984, 81: 5662-6; Zoller and Smith, Nucleic Acids Res 1982, 10: 6487-500; Dalbadie-McFarland et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1982, 79: 6409-13).  Thus, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the peptide having CTL inducibility of the present invention may be composed of a peptide having an amino acid sequence selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 and 26 to 48, wherein one, two or even more amino acids are added, deleted and/or substituted.\n\n\n\n\n  Those of skill in the art will recognize that individual additions, deletions, insertions, or substitutions to an amino acid sequence that alters a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids results in the conservation of the properties of the original amino acid side-chain; it is thus referred to as \"conservative substitution\" or \"conservative modification\", wherein the alteration of a protein results in a protein with similar functions.  Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art.  Examples of properties of amino acid side chains are hydrophobic amino acids (A, I, L, M, F, P, W, Y, V), hydrophilic amino acids (R, D, N, C, E, Q, G, H, K, S, T), and side chains having the following functional groups or characteristics in common: an aliphatic side-chain (G, A, V, L, I, P); a hydroxyl group containing side-chain (S, T, Y); a sulfur atom containing side-chain (C, M); a carboxylic acid and amide containing side-chain (D, N, E, Q); a base containing side-chain (R, K, H); and an aromatic group containing side-chain (H, F, Y, W).  In addition, the following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another:\n\n1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G);\n\n2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E);\n\n3) Aspargine (N), Glutamine (Q);\n\n4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K);\n\n5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V);\n\n6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W);\n\n7) Serine (S), Threonine (T); and\n\n8) Cysteine (C), Methionine (M) (see, e.g., Creighton, Proteins 1984).\n\n\n\n\n  Such conservatively modified peptides are also considered to be peptides of the present invention.  However, the peptide of the present invention is not restricted thereto and may include non-conservative modifications, so long as the resulting modified peptide retains the CTL inducibility of the original peptide.  Furthermore, the modified peptides should not exclude CTL inducible peptides of polymorphic variants, interspecies homologues, and alleles of HJURP.\n\n\n\n\n        Amino acid residues may be inserted, substituted or added to the peptides of the present invention or, alternatively, amino acid residues may be deleted there from to achieve a higher binding affinity.  To retain the requisite CTL inducibility, one preferably modifies (inserts, deletes, adds and/or substitutes) only a small number (for example, 1, 2 or several) or a small percentage of amino acids.  Herein, the term \"several\" means 5 or fewer amino acids, for example, 4 or 3 or fewer.  The percentage of amino acids to be modified may be 20% or less, for example, 15% or less, even more preferably 10% or less, for example 1 to 5%.\n\n\n\n\n        When used in cancer immunotherapy, the present peptides are presented on the surface of a cell or exosome as a complex with an HLA antigen. Therefore, it is preferable to select peptides that not only induce CTLs but also possess high binding affinity to the HLA antigen.  To that end, the peptides can be modified by substitution, insertion, and/or addition of the amino acid residues to yield a modified peptide having improved binding affinity.  In addition to peptides that are naturally displayed, since the regularity of the sequences of peptides displayed by binding to HLA antigens has already been known (J Immunol 1994, 152: 3913; Immunogenetics 1995, 41: 178; J Immunol 1994, 155: 4307), modifications based on such regularity may be introduced into the immunogenic peptides of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n        For example, peptides possessing high HLA-A24 binding affinity tend to have the second amino acid from the N-terminus substituted with phenylalanine, tyrosine, methionine, or tryptophan.  Likewise, peptides in which the C-terminal amino acid is substituted with phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, tryptophan, or methionine can also be favorably used.  Thus, peptides having an amino acid sequence selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 wherein the second amino acid from the N-terminus of the amino acid sequence of the SEQ ID NO is substituted with phenylalanine, tyrosine, methionine, or tryptophan, and peptides, and/or wherein the C-terminus of the amino acid sequence of the SEQ ID NO is substituted with phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, tryptophan, or methionine are encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n        Alternatively, in, peptides showing high HLA-A2 binding affinity , it may be desirable to substitute the second amino acid from the N-terminus with leucine or methionine or the amino acid at the C-terminus with valine or leucine .  Thus, peptides having amino acid sequences selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 26 to 48 wherein the second amino acid from the N-terminus of the amino acid sequence of the SEQ ID NO is substituted with leucine or methionine, and peptides, and/or wherein the C-terminus of the amino acid sequence of the SEQ ID NO is substituted with valine or leucine are encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n        Substitutions may be introduced not only at the terminal amino acids but also at the position of potential T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptides.  Several studies have demonstrated that a peptide with amino acid substitutions may have equal to or better function than that of the original, for example, CAP1, p53\n (264-272), \nHer-2/neu\n (369-377)\n or gp100\n (209-217)\n (Zaremba et al. Cancer Res. 57, 4570-4577, 1997, T. K. Hoffmann et al. J Immunol. (2002) \nFeb\n 1;168(3):1338-47., S. O. Dionne et al. Cancer Immunol immunother. (2003) 52: 199-206 and S. O. Dionne et al. Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2004) 53, 307-314).\n\n\n\n\n        The present invention also contemplates the addition of one, two or several amino acids to the N and/or C-terminus of the present peptides.  Such modified peptides having high HLA antigen binding affinity and retained CTL inducibility are also included in the present invention.  For example, the present invention provides an isolated peptide of less than 14, 13, 12, 11, or 10 amino acids in length comprising the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of:\n\n       (i) an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 9, and 26 to 36, wherein 1, 2, or several amino acid(s) are substituted, wherein the peptide binds an HLA antigen and induces cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and\n\n       (ii) the amino acid sequence of (i), wherein the amino acid sequence has one or both of the following characteristics:\n\n(a) the second amino acid from the N-terminus of said SEQ ID NO is selected from the group consisting of leucine or methionine; and\n\n(b) the C-terminal amino acid of said SEQ ID NO is selected from the group consisting of valine or leucine.\n\n\n\n\n        Moreover, the present invention also provides an isolated peptide of less than 15, 14, 13, 12, or 11 amino acids in length comprising the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of:\n\n       (i') an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 10 to 24, and 37 to 48, wherein 1, 2, or several amino acid(s) are substituted, wherein the peptide binds an HLA antigen and induces cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and\n\n       (ii') the amino acid sequence of (i'), wherein the amino acid sequence has one or both of the following characteristics:\n\n(a) the second amino acid from the N-terminus of said SEQ ID NO is selected from the group consisting of leucine or methionine; and\n\n(b) the C-terminal amino acid of said SEQ ID NO is selected from the group consisting of valine or leucine.\n\n        These peptides are processed in APC to present a peptide of (i), (ii), (i'), and (ii') thereon, when these peptides are contacted with, or introduced in APC.\n\n\n\n\n        However, when the peptide sequence is identical to a portion of the amino acid sequence of an endogenous or exogenous protein having a different function, side effects such as autoimmune disorders or allergic symptoms against specific substances may be induced.  Therefore, one can perform homology searches using available databases to avoid situations in which the sequence of the peptide matches the amino acid sequence of another protein.  When it becomes clear from the homology searches that there exists not even a peptide with 1 or 2 amino acids difference to the objective peptide, the objective peptide may be modified in order to increase its binding affinity with HLA antigens, and/or increase its CTL inducibility without any danger of such side effects.\n\n\n\n\n        Although peptides having high binding affinity to the HLA antigens as described above are expected to be highly effective, the candidate peptides, which are selected according to the presence of high binding affinity as an indicator, are further examined for the presence of CTL inducibility.  Herein, the phrase \"CTL inducibility\" indicates the ability of the peptide to induce CTLs when presented on antigen-presenting cells (APCs).  Further, \"CTL inducibility\" includes the ability of the peptide to induce CTL activation, CTL proliferation, promote CTL lysis of target cells, and to increase CTL IFN-gamma production.\n\n\n\n\n        Confirmation of CTL inducibility is accomplished by inducing APCs carrying human MHC antigens (for example, B-lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs)), or more specifically DCs derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes, and after stimulation with the peptides, mixing with CD8 positive cells, and then measuring the IFN-gamma produced and released by CTL against the target cells.  As the reaction system, transgenic animals that have been produced to express a human HLA antigen (for example, those described in BenMohamed L, Krishnan R, Longmate J, Auge C, Low L, Primus J, Diamond DJ, \nHum Immunol\n 2000 Aug, 61(8): 764-79, Related Articles, Books, Linkout Induction of CTL response by a minimal epitope vaccine in HLA A*0201/DR1 transgenic mice: dependent on MHC (HLA) class II restricted T(H) response) can be used.  For example, the target cells may be radiolabeled with \n51\nCr and such, and cytotoxic activity may be calculated from radioactivity released from the target cells.  Alternatively, it may be examined by measuring IFN-gamma produced and released by CTL in the presence of APCs that carry immobilized peptides, and visualizing the inhibition zone on the media using anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n\n\n        As a result of examining the CTL inducibility of the peptides as described above, it was discovered that nonapeptides or decapeptides selected from among those peptides having an amino acid sequence indicated by SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 and 26 to 48 showed particularly high CTL inducibility as well as high binding affinity to an HLA antigen.  Thus, these peptides are exemplified as preferred embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n        Furthermore, homology analysis results demonstrated that such peptides do not have significant homology with peptides derived from any other known human gene products.  This lowers the possibility of unknown or undesired immune responses arising when used for immunotherapy.  Therefore, also from this aspect, these peptides are useful for eliciting immunity against HJURP in cancer patients.  Thus, the peptides of the present invention, preferably, peptides having an amino acid sequence selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 and 26 to 48.\n\n\n\n\n        In addition to modification of the present peptides, discussed above, the peptides of the present invention may be linked to other peptides, so long as the resulting linked peptide retains the requisite CTL inducibility of the original peptide and, more preferably, also retain the requisite HLA binding.  Exemplary \"other\" peptides include: the peptides of the present invention or the CTL inducible peptides derived from other TAAs.  The linkers between the peptides are well known in the art, for example, AAY (P. M. Daftarian et al., J Trans Med 2007, 5:26), AAA, NKRK (R. P. M. Sutmuller et al., J Immunol. 2000, 165: 7308-7315) or K (S. Ota et al., Can Res. 62, 1471-1476, K. S. Kawamura et al., J Immunol. 2002, 168: 5709-5715).\n\n\n\n\n        For example, non-HJURP tumor associated antigen peptides also can be used substantially simultaneously to increase immune response via HLA class I and/or class II.  It is well established that cancer cells can express more than one tumor associated gene.  It is within the scope of routine experimentation for one of ordinary skill in the art to determine whether a particular subject expresses additional tumor associated genes, and then to include HLA class I and/or HLA class II binding peptides derived from expression products of such genes in HJURP compositions or vaccines according to the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n        Examples of HLA class I and HLA class II binding peptides will be known to one of ordinary skill in the art (for example, see Coulie, Stem Cells 13:393-403, 1995), and can be used in the invention in a like manner as those disclosed herein.  One of ordinary skill in the art can prepare polypeptides including one or more HJURP peptides and one or more of the non-HJURP peptides, or nucleic acids encoding such polypeptides, according to standard procedures of molecular biology.\n\n\n\n\n        The above-linked peptides are referred to herein as \"polytopes\", i.e., groups of two or more potentially immunogenic or immune response stimulating peptides which can be joined together in various arrangements (e.g., concatenated, overlapping).  The polytope (or nucleic acid encoding the polytope) can be administered in a standard immunization protocol, e.g., to animals, to test the effectiveness of the polytope in stimulating, enhancing and/or provoking an immune response.\n\n\n\n\n        The peptides can be joined together directly or via the use of flanking sequences to form polytopes, and the use of polytopes as vaccines is well known in the art (see, e.g., Thomson et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 92(13):5845-5849, 1995; Gilbert et al., Nature Biotechnol. 15(12):1280-1284, 1997; Thomson et al., J Immunol. 157(2):822-826, 1996; Tarn et al., J Exp. Med. 171(l):299-306, 1990).  Polytopes containing various numbers and combinations of epitopes can be prepared and tested for recognition by CTLs and for efficacy in increasing an immune response.\n\n\n\n\n        Furthermore, the peptides of the present invention may be further linked to other substances, so long as they retain the CTL inducibility.  Such substances may include: peptides, lipids, sugar and sugar chains, acetyl groups, natural and synthetic polymers, etc.  The peptides may contain modifications such as glycosylation, side chain oxidation, or phosphorylation; so long as the modifications do not destroy the biological activity of the peptides as described herein.  These kinds of modifications may be performed to confer additional functions (e.g., targeting function, and delivery function) or to stabilize the polypeptide.\n\n\n\n\n        For example, to increase the in vivo stability of a polypeptide, it is known in the art to introduce D-amino acids, amino acid mimetics or unnatural amino acids; this concept may also be adopted for the present polypeptides.  The stability of a polypeptide may be assayed in a number of ways.  For instance, peptidases and various biological media, such as human plasma and serum, can be used to test stability (see, e.g., Verhoef et al., Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokin 1986, 11: 291-302).\n\n\n\n\n        Moreover, as noted above, among the modified peptides that are substituted, deleted or added by one, two or several amino acid residues, those having same or higher activity as compared to original peptides can be screened for or selected.  The present invention, therefore, also provides the method of screening for or selecting modified peptides having same or higher activity as compared to originals.  For example, the method may include steps of:\n\na: substituting, deleting or adding at least one amino acid residue of a peptide of the present invention, \n\nb: determining the activity of the peptide, and \n\nc: selecting the peptide having same or higher activity as compared to the original.\n\n\n\n\n  Herein, the activity may include MHC binding activity, APC or CTL inducibility and cytotoxic activity.\n\n    Herein, the peptides of the present invention may also be described as \"HJURP peptide(s)\" or \"HJURP polypeptide(s)\".\n\n\n\n \nIII. Preparation of HJURP peptides\n \n \n \nThe peptides of the present invention may be prepared using well known techniques.  For example, the peptides may be prepared synthetically, by recombinant DNA technology or chemical synthesis.  The peptides of the present invention may be synthesized individually or as longer polypeptides including two or more peptides.  The peptides may be isolated, i.e., purified or isolated substantially free from other naturally occurring host cell proteins and fragments thereof, or any other chemical substances.\n\n\n\n\n     The peptides of the present invention may contain modifications, such as glycosylation, side chain oxidation, or phosphorylation; provided such modifications do not destroy the biological activity of the original peptides.  Other illustrative modifications include incorporation of D-amino acids or other amino acid mimetics that may be used, for example, to increase the serum half life of the peptides.\n\n\n\n\n     A peptide of the present invention may be obtained through chemical synthesis based on the selected amino acid sequence.  For example, conventional peptide synthesis methods that may be adopted for the synthesis include:\n\n(i) Peptide Synthesis, Interscience, New York, 1966;\n\n(ii) The Proteins, Vol. 2, Academic Press, New York, 1976;\n\n(iii) Peptide Synthesis (in Japanese), Maruzen Co., 1975;\n\n(iv) Basics and Experiment of Peptide Synthesis (in Japanese), Maruzen Co., 1985;\n\n(v) Development of Pharmaceuticals (second volume) (in Japanese), Vol. 14 (peptide synthesis), Hirokawa, 1991;\n\n(vi) WO99/67288; and\n\n(vii) Barany G. & Merrifield R.B., Peptides Vol. 2, \"Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis\", Academic Press, New York, 1980, 100-118.\n\n\n\n\n     Alternatively, the present peptides may be obtained adopting any known genetic engineering methods for producing peptides (e.g., Morrison J, J Bacteriology 1977, 132: 349-51; Clark-Curtiss & Curtiss, Methods in Enzymology (eds. Wu et al.) 1983, 101: 347-62).  For example, first, a suitable vector harboring a polynucleotide encoding the objective peptide in an expressible form (e.g., downstream of a regulatory sequence corresponding to a promoter sequence) is prepared and transformed into a suitable host cell.  Such vectors and host cells are also provided by the present invention.  The host cell is then cultured to produce the peptide of interest.  The peptide may also be produced in vitro adopting an in vitro translation system.\n\n\n\n \nIV. Polynucleotides\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides polynucleotides which encode any of the aforementioned peptides of the present invention.  These include polynucleotides derived from the natural occurring HJURP gene (GenBank Accession No. NM_018410 (for example, SEQ ID NO: 49)) and those having a conservatively modified nucleotide sequences thereof.  Herein, the phrase \"conservatively modified nucleotide sequence\" refers to sequences which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences.  Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein.  For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG, and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine.  Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon may be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide.  Such nucleic acid variations are \"silent variations,\" which are one species of conservatively modified variations.  Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a peptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid.  One of skill in the art will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) may be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule.  Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid that encodes a peptide is implicitly described in each disclosed sequence.\n\n\n\n\n        The polynucleotide of the present invention may be composed of DNA, RNA, and derivatives thereof.  As is well known in the art, a DNA molecule is suitably composed of bases such as the naturally occurring bases A, T, C, and G, and T is replaced by U in an RNA.  One of skill will recognize that non-naturally occurring bases be included in polynucleotides, as well.\n\n        The polynucleotide of the present invention may encode multiple peptides of the present invention with or without intervening amino acid sequences.  For example, the intervening amino acid sequence may provide a cleavage site (e.g., enzyme recognition sequence) of the polynucleotide or the translated peptides.  Furthermore, the polynucleotide may include any additional sequences to the coding sequence encoding the peptide of the present invention.  For example, the polynucleotide may be a recombinant polynucleotide that includes regulatory sequences required for the expression of the peptide or may be an expression vector (plasmid) with marker genes and such.  In general, such recombinant polynucleotides may be prepared by the manipulation of polynucleotides through conventional recombinant techniques using, for example, polymerases and end nucleases.\n\n\n\n\n     Both recombinant and chemical synthesis techniques may be used to produce the polynucleotides of the present invention.  For example, a polynucleotide may be produced by insertion into an appropriate vector, which may be expressed when transfected into a competent cell.  Alternatively, a polynucleotide may be amplified using PCR techniques or expression in suitable hosts (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, 1989).  Alternatively, a polynucleotide may be synthesized using the solid phase techniques, as described in Beaucage SL & Iyer RP, Tetrahedron 1992, 48: 2223-311; Matthes et al., EMBO J 1984, 3: 801-5.\n\n\n\n \nV. Exosomes\n \n\n The present invention further provides intracellular vesicles called exosomes, which present complexes formed between the peptides of the present invention and HLA antigens on their surface.  Exosomes may be prepared, for example, using the methods detailed in Japanese Patent Application Kohyo Publications No. Hei 11-510507 and WO99/03499, and may be prepared using APCs obtained from patients who are subject to treatment and/or prevention.  The exosomes of the present invention may be inoculated as vaccines, similarly to the peptides of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n  The type of HLA antigens included in the complexes must match that of the subject requiring treatment and/or prevention.  For example, in the Japanese population, HLA-A24 or HLA-A2, particularly HLA-A*2402 and HLA-A*0201 and HLA-A*0206 are often appropriate.  The use of A24 type or the A2 type that is highly expressed among the Japanese and Caucasian is favorable for obtaining effective results, and subtypes such as A*0201 and A*0206 find use.  Typically, in the clinic, the type of HLA antigen of the patient requiring treatment is investigated in advance, which enables appropriate selection of peptides having high levels of binding affinity to this antigen, or having CTL inducibility by antigen presentation.  Furthermore, in order to obtain peptides showing high binding affinity and CTL inducibility, substitution, deletion, or addition of 1, 2, or several amino acids may be performed based on the amino acid sequence of the naturally occurring HJURP partial peptide.\n\n        When using the A24 type HLA antigen for the exosome of the present invention, peptides having a sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 have particular utility.\n\n  Alternatively, when using the A2 type HLA antigen for the exosome of the present invention, the peptides having a sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 26 to 48 find use.\n\n\n\n \nVI. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs)\n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides isolated APCs that present complexes formed with HLA antigens and the peptides of the present invention on its surface.  The APCs may be derived from patients who are subject to treatment and/or prevention, and may be administered as vaccines by themselves or in combination with other drugs including the peptides of the present invention, exosomes, or CTLs.\n\n        The APCs are not limited to a particular kind of cells and include dendritic cells (DCs), Langerhans cells, macrophages, B cells, and activated T cells, which are known to present proteinaceous antigens on their cell surface so as to be recognized by lymphocytes.  Since DC is a representative APC having the strongest CTL inducing activity among APCs, DCs find use as the APCs of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n        For example, the APCs of the present invention may be obtained by inducing DCs from peripheral blood monocytes and then contacting (stimulating) them with the peptides of the present invention in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo.  When the peptides of the present invention are administered to the subjects, APCs that present the peptides of the present invention are induced in the body of the subject.  Therefore, the APCs of the present invention may be obtained by collecting the APCs from the subject after administering the peptides of the present invention to the subject.  Alternatively, the APCs of the present invention may be obtained by contacting APCs collected from a subject with the peptide of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n        The APCs of the present invention may be administered to a subject for inducing immune response against cancer in the subject by themselves or in combination with other drugs including the peptides, exosomes or CTLs of the present invention.  For example, the ex vivo administration may include steps of:\n\n       a: collecting APCs from a first subject, \n\n       b: contacting with the APCs of step a, with the peptide, and \n\n       c: administering the APCs of step b to a second subject.\n\n\n\n\n        The first subject and the second subject may be the same individual, or may be different individuals.  The APCs obtained by step b may be administered as a vaccine for treating and/or preventing cancer, examples of which include ,but are not limited to, AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor, but not limited thereto.\n\n        The present invention also provides a method or process for manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition for inducing APCs, wherein the method includes the step of admixing or formulating the peptide of the invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n\n\n        According to an aspect of the present invention, the APCs have a high level of CTL inducibility.  In the term of \"high level of CTL inducibility\", the high level is relative to the level of that by APC contacting with no peptide or peptides which may not induce the CTL.  Such APCs having a high level of CTL inducibility may be prepared by a method which includes the step of transferring a polynucleotide encoding the peptide of the present invention to APCs in vitro as well as the method mentioned above.  The introduced genes may be in the form of DNAs or RNAs.  Examples of methods for introduction include, without particular limitations, various methods conventionally performed in this field, such as lipofection, electroporation, or calcium phosphate method may be used.  More specifically, it may be performed as described in Cancer Res 1996, 56: 5672-7; J Immunol 1998, 161: 5607-13; J Exp Med 1996, 184: 465-72; Published Japanese Translation of International Publication No. 2000-509281.  By transferring the gene into APCs, the gene undergoes transcription, translation, and such in the cell, and then the obtained protein is processed by MHC Class I or Class II, and proceeds through a presentation pathway to present partial peptides.\n\n\n\n \nVII. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)\n \n \n \nA CTL induced against any of the peptides of the present invention strengthens the immune response targeting cancer cells in vivo and thus may be used as vaccines similar to the peptides.  Thus, the present invention provides isolated CTLs that are specifically induced or activated by any of the present peptides.\n\n        Such CTLs may be obtained by (1) administering the peptide(s) of the present invention to a subject or (2) contacting (stimulating) subject-derived APCs, and CD8 positive cells, or peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes in vitro with the peptide(s) of the present invention or (3) contacting CD8 positive cells or peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes in vitro with the APCs or exosomes presenting a complex of an HLA antigen and the peptide on its surface or (4) introducing a gene that includes a polynucleotide encoding a T cell receptor (TCR) subunit binding to the peptide of the present invention.  Such APCs or exosomes may be prepared by the methods described above and details of the method of (4) is described bellow in section \"VIII. T cell receptor (TCR)\".\n\n\n\n\n  The CTLs of the present invention may be derived from patients who are subject to treatment and/or prevention, and may be administered by themselves or in combination with other drugs including the peptides of the present invention or exosomes for the purpose of regulating effects.  The obtained CTLs act specifically against target cells presenting the peptides of the present invention, for example, the same peptides used for induction.  The target cells may be cells that endogenously express HJURP, such as cancer cells, or cells that are transfected with the HJURP gene; and cells that present a peptide of the present invention on the cell surface due to stimulation by the peptide may also serve as targets of activated CTL attack.\n\n\n\n \nVIII. T cell receptor (TCR)\n \n\n   The present invention also provides a composition including nucleic acids encoding polypeptides that are capable of forming a subunit of a T cell receptor (TCR), and methods of using the same.  The TCR subunits have the ability to form TCRs that confer specificity to T cells against tumor cells presenting HJURP.  By using the known methods in the art, the nucleic acids of alpha- and beta- chains as the TCR subunits of the CTL induced with one or more peptides of the present invention may be identified (WO2007/032255 and Morgan et al., J Immunol, 171, 3288 (2003)).  For example, the PCR method is preferred to analyze the TCR.  The PCR primers for the analysis can be, for example, 5'-R primers (5'-gtctaccaggcattcgcttcat-3') as 5' side primers (SEQ ID NO: 51) and 3-TRa-C primers (5'-tcagctggaccacagccgcagcgt-3') specific to TCR alpha chain C region (SEQ ID NO: 52), 3-TRb-C1 primers (5'-tcagaaatcctttctcttgac-3') specific to TCR beta chain C1 region (SEQ ID NO: 53) or 3-TRbeta-C2 primers (5'- ctagcctctggaatcctttctctt-3') specific to TCR beta chain C2 region (SEQ ID NO: 54) as 3' side primers, but not limited thereto.  The derivative TCRs may bind target cells displaying the HJURP peptide with high avidity, and optionally mediate efficient killing of target cells presenting the HJURP peptide in vivo and in vitro.\n\n\n\n\n    The nucleic acids encoding the TCR subunits may be incorporated into suitable vectors, e.g., retroviral vectors.  These vectors are well known in the art.  The nucleic acids or the vectors including them usefully may be transferred into a T cell, for example, a T cell from a patient.  Advantageously, the present invention provides an off-the-shelf composition allowing rapid modification of a patient's own T cells (or those of another mammal) to rapidly and easily produce modified T cells having excellent cancer cell killing properties.\n\n\n\n\n    The specific TCR is a receptor capable of specifically recognizing a complex of a peptide of the present invention and HLA molecule, giving a T cell specific activity against the target cell when the TCR is presented on the surface of the T cell.  A specific recognition of the above complex may be confirmed by any known methods, and preferred methods include, for example, HLA multimer staining analysis using HLA molecules and peptides of the present invention, and ELISPOT assay.  By performing the ELISPOT assay, it can be confirmed that a T cell expressing the TCR on the cell surface recognizes a cell by the TCR, and that the signal is transmitted intracellularly.  The confirmation that the above-mentioned complex can give a T cell cytotoxic activity when the complex exists on the T cell surface may also be carried out by a known method.  A preferred method includes, for example, the determination of cytotoxic activity against an HLA positive target cell, such as chromium release assay.\n\n\n\n\n        Also, the present invention provides CTLs which are prepared by transduction with the nucleic acids encoding the TCR subunits polypeptides that bind to the HJURP peptide of, e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 in the context of HLA-A24, and also the peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 26 to 48 in the context of HLA-A2.\n\n        The transduced CTLs are capable of homing to cancer cells in vivo, and may be expanded by well known culturing methods in vitro (e.g., Kawakami et al., J Immunol., 142, 3452-3461 (1989)).  The CTLs of the present invention may be used to form an immunogenic composition useful in treating or the prevention of cancer in a patient in need of therapy or protection (WO2006/031221).\n\n\n\n \nIX. Pharmaceutical substances or compositions\n \n \n \nSince HJURP expression is specifically elevated in cancer such as AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor compared with normal tissue, the peptides of or polynucleotides of the present invention may be used for the treatment and/or for the prophylaxis of cancer, and/or prevention of postoperative recurrence thereof.  Thus, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical agent, substance or composition for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of cancer, and/or for prevention of postoperative recurrence thereof, such agent, substance or composition including as an active ingredient one or more of the peptides, or polynucleotides of the present invention as an active ingredient.  Alternatively, the present peptides may be expressed on the surface of any of the foregoing exosomes or cells, such as APCs for the use as pharmaceutical substances or compositions.  In addition, the aforementioned CTLs which target any of the peptides of the present invention may also be used as the active ingredient of the present pharmaceutical substances or compositions.\n\n\n\n\n     In the present invention, the phrase \"active ingredient\" refers to a substance in an agent or composition that is biologically or physiologically active.  Particularly, in a pharmaceutical agent or composition, \"active ingredient\" refers to a substance that shows an objective pharmacological effect.  For example, in case of pharmaceutical agents or compositions for use in the treatment or prevention of cancer, active ingredients in the agents or compositions may lead to at least one biological or physiologically action on cancer cells and/or tissues directly or indirectly.  Preferably, such action may include reducing or inhibiting cancer cell growth, damaging or killing cancer cells and/or tissues, and so on.  Before formulated, \"active ingredient\" is also referred to as \"bulk\", \"drug substance\" or \"technical product\".\n\n     The present pharmaceutical agents or compositions find use as a vaccine.  In the present invention, the phrase \"vaccine\" (also referred to as an immunogenic composition) refers to a substance that has the function to induce anti-tumor immunity upon inoculation into animals.\n\n\n\n\n     The pharmaceutical agents or compositions of the present invention can be used for the treatment and/or prevention cancers, and/or prevention of postoperative recurrence thereof in subjects or patients including human and any other mammal including, but not limited to, mouse, rat, guinea-pig, rabbit, cat, dog, sheep, goat, pig, cattle, horse, monkey, baboon, and chimpanzee, particularly a commercially important animal or a domesticated animal.\n\n\n\n\n     In another embodiment, the present invention also provides the use of an active ingredient in manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition or agent for treating cancer or tumor, said active ingredient selected from among:\n\n    (a) a peptide of the present invention;\n\n    (b) a nucleic acid encoding such a peptide as disclosed herein in an expressible form;\n\n    (c) an APC or an exosome presenting a peptide of the present invention on its surface; and\n\n    (d) a cytotoxic T cell of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n     Alternatively, the present invention further provides an active ingredient for use in treating or preventing cancer of tumor, said active ingredient selected from among:\n\n    (a) a peptide of the present invention;\n\n    (b) a nucleic acid encoding such a peptide as disclosed herein in an expressible form;\n\n    (c) an APC or an exosome presenting a peptide of the present invention on its surface; and\n\n    (d) a cytotoxic T cell of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n     Alternatively, the present invention further provides a method or process for manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition or substance for treating or preventing cancer or tumor, wherein the method or process includes the step of formulating a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carrier with an active ingredient selected from among:\n\n\n \n(a) a peptide of the present invention;\n\n    (b) a nucleic acid encoding such a peptide as disclosed herein in an expressible form;\n\n    (c) an APC or an exosome presenting a peptide of the present invention on its surface; and\n\n    (d) a cytotoxic T cell of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n     In another embodiment, the present invention also provides a method or process for manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition or substance for treating or preventing cancer or tumor, wherein the method or process includes the steps of admixing an active ingredient with a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carrier, wherein the active ingredient is selected from among:\n\n    (a) a peptide of the present invention;\n\n    (b) a nucleic acid encoding such a peptide as disclosed herein in an expressible form;\n\n    (c) an APC or an exosome presenting a peptide of the present invention on its surface; and\n\n    (d) a cytotoxic T cell of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n     The pharmaceutical agents, substances or compositions of the present invention can be used to treat and/or prevent cancers or tumors, and/or prevention of postoperative recurrence thereof in subjects or patients including human and any other mammal including, but not limited to, mouse, rat, guinea-pig, rabbit, cat, dog, sheep, goat, pig, cattle, horse, monkey, baboon, and chimpanzee, particularly a commercially important animal or a domesticated animal.\n\n\n\n\n        According to the present invention, peptides having an amino acid sequence selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 have been found to be HLA-A24 restricted epitope peptides or the candidates and also SEQ ID NOs: 26 to 48 have been found to be HLA-A2 restricted epitope peptides or the candidates that may induce potent and specific immune response.  Therefore, the present pharmaceutical substances or compositions which include any of these peptides with the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 and 26 to 48 are particularly suited for the administration to subjects whose HLA antigen is HLA-A24 or HLA-A2.  The same applies to pharmaceutical substances or compositions which include polynucleotides encoding any of these peptides (i.e., the polynucleotides of the present invention).\n\n\n\n\n     Cancers to be treated by the pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention are not limited and include any cancer in which HJURP is involved (e.g., is overexpressed), including, but not limited to, AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor.\n\n\n\n\n     The present pharmaceutical substances or compositions may contain in addition to the aforementioned active ingredients, other peptides which have the ability to induce CTLs against cancerous cells, other polynucleotides encoding the other peptides, other cells that present the other peptides, or such.  Herein, the other peptides that have the ability to induce CTLs against cancerous cells are exemplified by cancer specific antigens (e.g., identified TAAs), but are not limited thereto.\n\n\n\n\n        If needed, the pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention may optionally include other therapeutic substances as an active ingredient, so long as the substance does not inhibit the antitumoral effect of the active ingredient, e.g., any of the present peptides.  For example, formulations may include anti-inflammatory substances or compositions, pain killers, chemotherapeutics, and the like.  In addition to other therapeutic substances in the medicament itself, the medicaments of the present invention may also be administered sequentially or concurrently with the one or more other pharmacologic substances or compositions.  The amounts of medicament and pharmacologic substance or composition depend, for example, on what type of pharmacologic substance(s) or composition(s) is/are used, the disease being treated, and the scheduling and routes of administration.\n\n        It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned herein, the pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention may include other substances or compositions conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question.\n\n\n\n\n        In one embodiment of the present invention, the present pharmaceutical agents, substances or compositions may be included in articles of manufacture and kits containing materials useful for treating the pathological conditions of the disease to be treated, e.g., cancer.  The article of manufacture may include a container of any of the present pharmaceutical substances or compositions with a label.  Suitable containers include bottles, vials, and test tubes.  The containers may be formed from a variety of materials, such as glass or plastic.  The label on the container should indicate the substance or composition is used for treating or prevention of one or more conditions of the disease.  The label may also indicate directions for administration and so on.\n\n\n\n\n        In addition to the container described above, a kit including a pharmaceutical agent, substance or composition of the present invention may optionally further include a second container housing a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent.  It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts with instructions for use.\n\n     The pharmaceutical compositions can, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which can contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient.  The pack can, for example, include metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack.  The pack or dispenser device can be accompanied by instructions for administration.\n\n\n\n\n (1) Pharmaceutical substances or compositions containing the peptides as the active ingredient\n\n       The peptides of the present invention can be administered directly as a pharmaceutical agent, substance or composition, or if necessary, may be formulated by conventional formulation methods.  In the latter case, in addition to the peptides of the present invention, carriers, excipients, and such that are ordinarily used for drugs can be included as appropriate without particular limitations.  Examples of such carriers are sterilized water, physiological saline, phosphate buffer, culture fluid and such.  Furthermore, the pharmaceutical substances or compositions can contain as necessary, stabilizers, suspensions, preservatives, surfactants and such.  The pharmaceutical agent, substances or compositions of the present invention can be used for anticancer purposes.\n\n\n\n\n        The peptides of the present invention can be prepared in combination, which includes two or more of peptides of the present invention, to induce CTL in vivo.  The peptides can be in a cocktail or can be conjugated to each other using standard techniques.  For example, the peptides can be chemically linked or expressed as a single fusion polypeptide sequence that may have one or several amino acid(s) as a linker (e.g., Lysine linker: K. S. Kawamura et al. J. Immunol. 2002, 168: 5709-5715).  The peptides in the combination can be the same or different.  By administering the peptides of the present invention, the peptides are presented in high density by the HLA antigens on APCs, then CTLs that specifically react toward the complex formed between the displayed peptide and the HLA antigen are induced.  Alternatively, APCs (e.g., DCs) are removed from subjects and then stimulated by the peptides of the present invention to obtain APCs that present any of the peptides of the present invention on their cell surface.  These APCs are re-administered to the subjects to induce CTLs in the subjects, and as a result, aggressiveness towards the tumor-associated endothelium can be increased.\n\n\n\n\n        The pharmaceutical substances or compositions for the treatment and/or prevention of cancer, which include any of the peptides of the present invention as the active ingredient, can include an adjuvant so that cellular immunity will be established effectively, or they can be administered with other active ingredients, and they can be administered by formulation into granules.  An adjuvant refers to any compound, substance or composition that enhances the immune response against the protein when administered together (or successively) with the protein having immunological activity.  An adjuvant that can be applied includes those described in the literature (Clin Microbiol Rev 1994, 7: 277-89).  Exemplary adjuvants include aluminum phosphate, aluminum hydroxide, alum, cholera toxin, salmonella toxin, Incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), ISCOMatrix, GM-CSF, CpG, O/W emulsion, and such, but are not limited thereto.\n\n        Furthermore, liposome formulations, granular formulations in which the peptide is bound to few-micrometers diameter beads, and formulations in which a lipid is bound to the peptide may be conveniently used.\n\n\n\n\n        In another embodiment of the present invention, the peptides of the present invention may also be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.  Preferable examples of the salts include salts with an alkali metal, salts with a metal, salts with an organic base, salts with an organic acid and salts with an inorganic acid. As used herein, \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the compound and which are obtained by reaction with inorganic acids or bases such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. Examples of preferred salts include salts with an alkali metal, salts with a metal, salts with an organic base, salts with an organic acid and salts with an inorganic acid.\n\n\n\n\n        In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical agents, substances or compositions of the present invention include a component that primes CTL.  Lipids have been identified as substances or compositions capable of priming CTL in vivo against viral antigens.  For example, palmitic acid residues can be attached to the epsilon- and alpha-amino groups of a lysine residue and then linked to a peptide of the present invention.  The lipidated peptide can then be administered either directly in a micelle or particle, incorporated into a liposome, or emulsified in an adjuvant.  As another example of lipid priming of CTL responses, E. coli lipoproteins, such as tripalmitoyl-S-glycerylcysteinyl-seryl-serine (P3CSS) can be used to prime CTL when covalently attached to an appropriate peptide (see, e.g., Deres et al., Nature 1989, 342: 561-4).\n\n\n\n\n        The method of administration can be oral, intradermal, subcutaneous, intravenous injection, or such, and systemic administration or local administration to the vicinity of the targeted sites.  The administration can be performed by single administration or boosted by multiple administrations.  The dose of the peptides of the present invention can be adjusted appropriately according to the disease to be treated, age of the patient, weight, method of administration, and such, and is ordinarily 0.001 mg to 1,000 mg, for example, 0.01 mg to 100 mg, for example, 0.1 mg to 10 mg, and can be administered once in a few days to few months.  One skilled in the art can appropriately select a suitable dose.\n\n\n\n\n (2) Pharmaceutical substances or compositions containing polynucleotides as active ingredient\n\n       The pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention can also include nucleic acids encoding the peptide(s) disclosed herein in an expressible form.  Herein, the phrase \"in an expressible form\" means that the polynucleotide, when introduced into a cell, will be expressed in vivo as a polypeptide that induces anti-tumor immunity.  In an exemplified embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence of the polynucleotide of interest includes regulatory elements necessary for expression of the polynucleotide.  The polynucleotide(s) can be equipped so to achieve stable insertion into the genome of the target cell (see, e.g., Thomas KR & Capecchi MR, Cell 1987, 51: 503-12 for a description of homologous recombination cassette vectors.  See also, e.g., Wolff et al., Science 1990, 247: 1465-8; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,580,859; 5,589,466; 5,804,566; 5,739,118; 5,736,524; 5,679,647; and WO 98/04720).  Examples of DNA-based delivery technologies include \"naked DNA\", facilitated (bupivacaine, polymers, peptide-mediated) delivery, cationic lipid complexes, and particle-mediated (\"gene gun\") or pressure-mediated delivery (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,922,687).\n\n\n\n\n        The peptides of the present invention can also be expressed by viral or bacterial vectors.  Examples of expression vectors include attenuated viral hosts, such as vaccinia or fowlpox.  This approach involves the use of vaccinia virus, e.g., as a vector to express nucleotide sequences that encode the peptide.  Upon introduction into a host, the recombinant vaccinia virus expresses the immunogenic peptide, and thereby elicits an immune response.  Vaccinia vectors and methods useful in immunization protocols are described in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,722,848.  Another vector is BCG (Bacille Calmette Guerin).  BCG vectors are described in Stover et al., Nature 1991, 351: 456-60.  A wide variety of other vectors useful for therapeutic administration or immunization, e.g., adeno and adeno-associated virus vectors, retroviral vectors, Salmonella typhi vectors, detoxified anthrax toxin vectors, and the like, will be apparent.  See, e.g., Shata et al., \nMol Med Today\n 2000, 6: 66-71; Shedlock et al., \nJ Leukoc Biol\n 2000, 68: 793-806; Hipp et al., In \nVivo\n 2000, 14: 571-85.\n\n        Delivery of a polynucleotide into a patient can be either direct, in which case the patient is directly exposed to a polynucleotide-carrying vector, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the polynucleotide of interest in vitro, then the cells are transplanted into the patient.  Theses two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo and ex vivo gene therapies.\n\n\n\n\n        For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al., Clinical Pharmacy 1993, 12: 488-505; Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 1991, 3: 87-95; Tolstoshev, Ann Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 1993, 33: 573-96; Mulligan, Science 1993, 260: 926-32; Morgan & Anderson, Ann Rev Biochem 1993, 62: 191-217; Trends in Biotechnology 1993, 11(5): 155-215).  Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology that are applicable to the present invention are described by  Ausubel et al., in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY, 1993; and by Krieger, in Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY, 1990.\n\n\n\n\n        The method of administration can be oral, intradermal, subcutaneous, intravenous injection, or such, and systemic administration or local administration to the vicinity of the targeted sites finds use.  The administration can be performed by single administration or boosted by multiple administrations.  The dose of the polynucleotide in the suitable carrier or cells transformed with the polynucleotide encoding the peptides of the present invention can be adjusted appropriately according to the disease to be treated, age of the patient, weight, method of administration, and such, and is ordinarily 0.001 mg to 1,000 mg, for example, 0.01 mg to 100 mg, for example, 0.1 mg to 10 mg, and can be administered once every a few days to once every few months.  One skilled in the art can appropriately select the suitable dose.\n\n\n\n \nX. Methods using the peptides, exosomes, APCs and CTLs\n \n \n \nThe peptides and polynucleotides of the present invention can be used for preparing or inducing APCs and CTLs.  The exosomes and APCs of the present invention can be also used for inducing CTLs.  The peptides, polynucleotides, exosomes and APCs can be used in combination with any other compounds so long as the additional compounds do not inhibit CTL inducibility.  Thus, any of the aforementioned pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention can be used for inducing CTLs.  In addition thereto, those including the peptides and polynucleotides can be also be used for inducing APCs as explained below.\n\n\n\n\n (1) Method of inducing antigen-presenting cells (APCs)\n\n       The present invention provides methods of inducing APCs with high CTL inducibility using the peptides or polynucleotides of the present invention.\n\n        The methods of the present invention include the step of contacting APCs with the peptides of the present invention in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo.  For example, the method contacting APCs with the peptides ex vivo can include steps of: \n\n       a: collecting APCs from a subject:, and\n\n       b: contacting the APCs of step a with the peptide.\n\n        The APCs are not limited to a particular kind of cells and include DCs, Langerhans cells, macrophages, B cells, and activated T cells, which are known to present proteinaceous antigens on their cell surface so as to be recognized by lymphocytes.  Preferably, DCs can be used since they have the strongest CTL inducibility among APCs.  Any peptides of the present invention can be used by themselves or with other peptides of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n        On the other hands, when the peptides of the present invention are administered to a subject, the APCs are contacted with the peptides in vivo, consequently, the APCs with high CTL inducibility are induced in the body of the subject.  Thus, the present invention includes administering the peptides of the present invention to a subject.  Similarly, when the polynucleotides of the present invention are administered to a subject in an expressible form, the peptides of the present invention are expressed and contacted with APCs in vivo, consequently, the APCs with high CTL inducibility are induced in the body of the subject.  Thus, the present invention may also include administering the polynucleotides of the present invention to a subject.  \"Expressible form\" is described above in section \"IX. Pharmaceutical substances or compositions, (2) Pharmaceutical substances or compositions containing polynucleotides as the active ingredient\".\n\n\n\n\n        Furthermore, the present invention may include introducing the polynucleotide of the present invention into an APCs to induce APCs with CTL inducibility.  For example, the method can include steps of:\n\n       a: collecting APCs from a subject:, and\n\n       b: introducing a polynucleotide encoding peptide of the present invention.\n\n        Step b can be performed as described above in section \"VI. Antigen-presenting cells\".\n\n\n\n\n        Alternatively, the present invention provides a method for preparing an antigen-presenting cell (APC) which specifically induces CTL activity against HJURP, wherein the method can include one of the following steps:\n\n(a) contacting an APC with a peptide of the present invention in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo; and \n\n       (b) introducing a polynucleotide encoding a peptide of the present invention into an APC.\n\n\n\n\n (2) Method of inducing CTLs\n\n       The present invention also provides methods for inducing CTLs using the peptides, polynucleotides, exosomes or APCs of the present invention.\n\n        The present invention also provides methods for inducing CTLs using a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide that is capable of forming a T cell receptor (TCR) subunit recognizing a complex of the peptides of the present invention and HLA antigens.  Preferably, the methods for inducing CTLs may include at least one step selected from among:\n\n       a) contacting a CD8 positive T cell with an antigen-presenting cell and/or an exosome that presents on its surface a complex of an HLA antigen and a peptide of the preset invention; and\n\n       b) introducing a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide that is capable of forming a TCR subunit recognizing a complex of a peptide of the present invention and an HLA antigen into a CD8 positive cell.\n\n\n\n\n        When the peptides, the polynucleotides, APCs, or exosomes of the present invention are administered to a subject, CTLs are induced in the body of the subject, and the strength of the immune response targeting the cancer cells is enhanced.  Thus, the methods of the present invention includes the step of administering the peptides, the polynucleotides, the APCs or exosomes of the present invention to a subject.\n\n\n\n\n        Alternatively, CTLs can be also induced by using them ex vivo, and after inducing CTL, the activated CTLs can be returned to the subject.  For example, the method can include steps of:\n\n       a: collecting APCs from a subject;\n\n       b: contacting with the APCs of step a, with the peptide; and \n\n       c: co-culturing the APCs of step b with CD8 positive cells.\n\n\n\n\n        The APCs to be co-cultured with the CD8 positive cells in above step c can also be prepared by transferring a gene that includes a polynucleotide of the present invention into APCs as described above in section \"VI. Antigen-presenting cells\"; though the present invention is limited thereto, and encompasses any APCs that effectively present on its surface a complex of an HLA antigen and a peptide of the present invention.\n\n        Instead of such APCs, the exosomes that presents on the surface a complex of an HLA antigen and the peptide of the present invention can be also used.  Namely, the present invention can include the step of co-culturing exosomes presenting on its surface a complex of an HLA antigen and the peptide of the present invention.  Such exosomes can be prepared by the methods described above in section \"V. Exosomes\".\n\n\n\n\n        Furthermore, CTL can be induced by introducing a gene that includes a polynucleotide encoding the TCR subunit binding to the peptide of the present invention into CD8 positive cells.  Such transduction can be performed as described above in section \"VIII. T cell receptor (TCR)\".\n\n        In addition, the present invention provides a method or process for manufacturing a pharmaceutical agent, substance or composition inducing CTLs, wherein the method includes the step of admixing or formulating the peptide of the present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n\n\n (3) Method of inducing immune response\n\n       Moreover, the present invention provides methods of inducing an immune response against diseases related to HJURP.  Suitable diseases may include cancer, examples of which include, but are not limited to, AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor.\n\n\n\n\n        The methods of the present invention may include the step of administering substance(s) or composition(s) containing any of the peptides of the present invention or polynucleotides encoding them. The present inventive method may also contemplate the administration of exosomes or APCs presenting any of the peptides of the present invention.  For details, see the item of \"IX. Pharmaceutical substances or compositions\", particularly the part describing the use of the pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention as vaccines.  In addition, the exosomes and APCs that can be employed for the present methods for inducing immune response are described in detail under the items of \"V. Exosomes\", \"VI. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs)\", and (1) and (2) of \"X. Methods using the peptides, exosomes, APCs and CTLs\", supra.\n\n\n\n\n        The present invention also provides a method or process for manufacturing a pharmaceutical agent, substance or composition inducing immune response, wherein the method may include the step of admixing or formulating the peptide of the present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n\n\n        Alternatively, the method of the present invention may include the step of administrating a vaccine or a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention that contains:\n\n       (a) a peptide of the present invention;\n\n       (b) a nucleic acid encoding such a peptide as disclosed herein in an expressible form;\n\n       (c) an APC or an exosome presenting a peptide of the present invention on its surface; or\n\n       (d) a cytotoxic T cell of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n     In the context of the present invention, a cancer overexpressing HJURP can be treated with these active ingredients.  Examples of such cancers include, but are not limited to, AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor.  Accordingly, prior to the administration of the vaccines or pharmaceutical compositions including the active ingredients, it is preferable to confirm whether the expression level of HJURP in the biological samples to be treated is enhanced compared with normal cells of the same organ.  Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating cancer (over)expressing HJURP, which method may include the steps of:\n\n    i) determining the expression level of HJURP in biological sample (s) obtained from a subject with the cancer to be treated;\n\n    ii) comparing the expression level of HJURP with normal control; and\n\n    iii) administrating at least one component selected from among (a) to (d) described above to a subject with cancer overexpressing HJURP compared with normal control.\n\n\n\n\n     Alternatively, the present invention also provides a vaccine or pharmaceutical composition that includes at least one component selected from among (a) to (d) described above, for use in administrating to a subject having cancer overexpressing HJURP.  In other words, the present invention further provides a method for identifying a subject to be treated with the HJURP polypeptide of the present invention, such methods including the step of determining an expression level of HJURP in subject-derived biological sample (s), wherein an increase of the level compared to a normal control level of the gene indicates that the subject may have cancer which may be treated with the HJURP polypeptide of the present invention.  The methods of treating cancer of the present invention are described in more detail below.\n\n\n\n\n     Any subject-derived cell or tissue can be used for the determination of HJURP expression so long as it includes the objective transcription or translation product of HJURP.  Examples of suitable samples include, but are not limited to, bodily tissues and fluids, such as blood, sputum and urine.  Preferably, the subject-derived cell or tissue sample contains a cell population including an epithelial cell, more preferably a cancerous epithelial cell or an epithelial cell derived from tissue suspected to be cancerous.  Further, if necessary, the cell may be purified from the obtained bodily tissues and fluids, and then used as the subjected-derived sample.\n\n     A subject to be treated by the present method is preferably a mammal.  Exemplary mammals include, but are not limited to, e.g., human, non-human primate, mouse, rat, dog, cat, horse, and cow.\n\n\n\n\n     According to the present invention, the expression level of HJURP in biological samples obtained from a subject may be determined.  The expression level can be determined at the transcription (nucleic acid) product level, using methods known in the art.  For example, the mRNA of HJURP may be quantified using probes by hybridization methods (e.g., Northern hybridization).  The detection may be carried out on a chip, an array or as such.  The use of an array may be preferable for detecting the expression level of HJURP.  Those skilled in the art can prepare such probes utilizing the sequence information of HJURP.  For example, the cDNA of HJURP may be used as the probes.  If necessary, the probes may be labeled with a suitable label, such as dyes, fluorescent substances and isotopes, and the expression level of the gene may be detected as the intensity of the hybridized labels.\n\n     Furthermore, the transcription product of HJURP (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 49) may be quantified using primers by amplification-based detection methods (e.g., RT-PCR).  Such primers may be prepared based on the available sequence information of the gene.\n\n\n\n\n     Specifically, a probe or primer used for the present method hybridizes under stringent, moderately stringent, or low stringent conditions to the mRNA of HJURP.  As used herein, the phrase \"stringent (hybridization) conditions\" refers to conditions under which a probe or primer will hybridize to its target sequence, but not to other sequences.  Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different under different circumstances.  Specific hybridization of longer sequences is observed at higher temperatures than shorter sequences.  Generally, the temperature of a stringent condition is selected to be about 5 degrees C lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for a specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH.  The Tm is the temperature (under a defined ionic strength, pH and nucleic acid concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to their target sequence hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium.  Since the target sequences are generally present at excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium.  Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30 degrees C for short probes or primers (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60 degrees C for longer probes or primers.  Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing substances, such as formamide.\n\n\n\n\n        A probe or primer of the present invention is typically a substantially purified oligonucleotide.  The oligonucleotide typically includes a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent conditions to at least about 2000, 1000, 500, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 50, or 25, consecutive sense strand nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid including a HJURP sequence, or an anti sense strand nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid including a HJURP sequence, or of a naturally occurring mutant of these sequences.  In particular, for example, in a preferred embodiment, an oligonucleotide having 5-50 in length can be used as a primer for amplifying the genes, to be detected.  More preferably, mRNA or cDNA of a HJURP gene can be detected with oligonucleotide probe or primer of a specific size, generally 15- 30b in length. In preferred embodiments, length of the oligonucleotide probe or primer can be selected from 15-25.  Assay procedures, devices, or reagents for the detection of gene by using such oligonucleotide probe or primer are well known (e.g. oligonucleotide microarray or PCR).  In these assays, probes or primers can also include tag or linker sequences.  Further, probes or primers can be modified with detectable label or affinity ligand to be captured.  Alternatively, in hybridization based detection procedures, a polynucleotide having a few hundreds (e.g., about 100-200) bases to a few kilo (e.g., about 1000-2000) bases in length can also be used for a probe (e.g., northern blotting assay or cDNA microarray analysis).\n\n\n\n\n     Alternatively, the translation product may be detected for the diagnosis of the present invention.  For example, the quantity of HJURP protein (SEQ ID NO: 50) or the immunologically fragment thereof may be determined.  Methods for determining the quantity of the protein as the translation product include immunoassay methods that use an antibody specifically recognizing the protein.  The antibody may be monoclonal or polyclonal.  Furthermore, any fragment or modification (e.g., chimeric antibody, scFv, Fab, F(ab')\n2\n, Fv, etc.) of the antibody may be used for the detection, so long as the fragment or modified antibody retains the binding ability to the HJURP protein.  Such antibodies against the peptides of the present invention and the fragments thereof are also provided by the present invention.  Methods to prepare these kinds of antibodies for the detection of proteins are well known in the art, and any method may be employed in the present invention to prepare such antibodies and equivalents thereof.\n\n\n\n\n     As another method to detect the expression level of HJURP gene based on its translation product, the intensity of staining may be measured via immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody against the HJURP protein.  Namely, in this measurement, strong staining indicates increased presence/level of the protein and, at the same time, high expression level of HJURP gene.\n\n     The expression level of a target gene, e.g., the HJURP gene, in cancer cells can be determined to be increased if the level increases from the control level (e.g., the level in normal cells) of the target gene by, for example, 10%, 25%, or 50%; or increases to more than 1.1 fold, more than 1.5 fold, more than 2.0 fold, more than 5.0 fold, more than 10.0 fold, or more.\n\n\n\n\n     The control level may be determined at the same time as the cancer cells by using a sample(s) previously collected and stored from a subject(s) whose disease state(s) (cancerous or non-cancerous) is/are known.  In addition, normal cells obtained from non-cancerous regions of an organ that has the cancer to be treated may be used as normal control.  Alternatively, the control level may be determined by a statistical method based on the results obtained by analyzing previously determined expression level(s) of HJURP gene in samples from subjects whose disease states are known.  Furthermore, the control level can be derived from a database of expression patterns from previously tested cells.  Moreover, according to an aspect of the present invention, the expression level of HJURP gene in a biological sample may be compared to multiple control levels, determined from multiple reference samples.  It is preferred to use a control level determined from a reference sample derived from a tissue type similar to that of the subject-derived biological sample.  Moreover, it is preferred to use the standard value of the expression levels of HJURP gene in a population with a known disease state.  The standard value may be obtained by any method known in the art.  For example, a range of mean +/- 2 S.D. or mean +/- 3 S.D. may be used as the standard value.\n\n\n\n\n     In the context of the present invention, a control level determined from a biological sample that is known to be non-cancerous is referred to as a \"normal control level\". On the other hand, if the control level is determined from a cancerous biological sample, it is referred to as a \"cancerous control level\".  Difference between a sample expression level and a control level can be normalized to the expression level of control nucleic acids, e.g., housekeeping genes, whose expression levels are known not to differ depending on the cancerous or non-cancerous state of the cell.  Exemplary control genes include, but are not limited to, beta-actin, \nglyceraldehyde\n 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, and ribosomal protein P1.\n\n     When the expression level of HJURP gene is increased as compared to the normal control level, or is similar/equivalent to the cancerous control level, the subject may be diagnosed with cancer to be treated.\n\n\n\n\n     The present invention also provides a method of (i) diagnosing whether a subject suspected to have cancer to be treated, and/or (ii) selecting a subject for cancer treatment, which method may include the steps of:\n\n    a) determining the expression level of HJURP in biological sample (s) obtained from a subject who is suspected to have the cancer to be treated;\n\n    b) comparing the expression level of HJURP with a normal control level;\n\n    c) diagnosing the subject as having the cancer to be treated, if the expression level of HJURP is increased as compared to the normal control level; and\n\n    d) selecting the subject for cancer treatment, if the subject is diagnosed as having the cancer to be treated, in step c).\n\n\n\n\n     Alternatively, such a method may include the steps of:\n\n    a) determining the expression level of HJURP in biological sample (s) obtained from a subject who is suspected to have the cancer to be treated;\n\n    b) comparing the expression level of HJURP with a cancerous control level;\n\n    c) diagnosing the subject as having the cancer to be treated, if the expression level of HJURP is similar or equivalent to the cancerous control level; and\n\n    d) selecting the subject for cancer treatment, if the subject is diagnosed as having the cancer to be treated, in step c).\n\n\n\n\n     The present invention also provides a diagnostic kit for diagnosing or determining a subject who is or is suspected to be suffering from cancer that can be treated with the HJURP polypeptide of the present invention, which may also find use in assessing and/or monitoring the efficacy or applicability of a cancer immunotherapy.  Preferably, the cancer includes, but is not limited to, AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor.  More particularly, the kit preferably may include at least one reagent for detecting the expression of the HJURP gene in a subject-derived cell, which reagent may be selected from the group of:\n\n    (a) a reagent for detecting mRNA of the HJURP gene;\n\n    (b) a reagent for detecting the HJURP protein or the immunologically fragment thereof; and\n\n    (c) a reagent for detecting the biological activity of the HJURP protein.\n\n\n\n\n     Examples of reagents suitable for detecting mRNA of the HJURP gene may include nucleic acids that specifically bind to or identify the HJURP mRNA, such as oligonucleotides that have a complementary sequence to a portion of the HJURP mRNA.  These kinds of oligonucleotides are exemplified by primers and probes that are specific to the HJURP mRNA.  These kinds of oligonucleotides may be prepared based on methods well known in the art.  If needed, the reagent for detecting the HJURP mRNA may be immobilized on a solid matrix.  Moreover, more than one reagent for detecting the HJURP mRNA may be included in the kit.\n\n\n\n\n     On the other hand, examples of reagents suitable for detecting the HJURP protein or the immunologically fragment thereof may include antibodies to the HJURP protein or the immunologically fragment thereof.  The antibody may be monoclonal or polyclonal.  Furthermore, any fragment or modification (e.g., chimeric antibody, scFv, Fab, F(ab')\n2\n, Fv, etc.) of the antibody may be used as the reagent, so long as the fragment or modified antibody retains the binding ability to the HJURP protein or the immunologically fragment thereof.  Methods to prepare these kinds of antibodies for the detection of proteins are well known in the art, and any method may be employed in the present invention to prepare such antibodies and equivalents thereof.  Furthermore, the antibody may be labeled with signal generating molecules via direct linkage or an indirect labeling technique.  Labels and methods for labeling antibodies and detecting the binding of the antibodies to their targets are well known in the art, and any labels and methods may be employed for the present invention.  Moreover, more than one reagent for detecting the HJURP protein may be included in the kit.\n\n\n\n\n     The kit may contain more than one of the aforementioned reagents. The kit can further include a solid matrix and reagent for binding a probe against an HJURP gene or antibody against an HJURP peptide, a medium and container for culturing cells, positive and negative control reagents, and a secondary antibody for detecting an antibody against an HJURP peptide.  For example, tissue samples obtained from subjects without cancer or suffering from cancer, may serve as useful control reagents.  A kit of the present invention may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts (e.g., written, tape, CD-ROM, etc.) with instructions for use.  These reagents and such may be retained in a container with a label.  Suitable containers may include bottles, vials, and test tubes.  The containers may be formed from a variety of materials, such as glass or plastic.\n\n\n\n\n     In an embodiment of the present invention, when the reagent is a probe against the HJURP mRNA, the reagent may be immobilized on a solid matrix, such as a porous strip, to form at least one detection site.  The measurement or detection region of the porous strip may include a plurality of sites, each containing a nucleic acid (probe).  A test strip may also contain sites for negative and/or positive controls.  Alternatively, control sites may be located on a strip separated from the test strip.  Optionally, the different detection sites may contain different amounts of immobilized nucleic acids, i.e., a higher amount in the first detection site and lesser amounts in subsequent sites.  Upon the addition of a test sample, the number of sites displaying a detectable signal provides a quantitative indication of the amount of HJURP mRNA present in the sample.  The detection sites may be configured in any suitably detectable shape and are typically in the shape of a bar or dot spanning the width of a test strip.\n\n\n\n\n     The kit of the present invention may further include a positive control sample or HJURP standard sample.  The positive control sample of the present invention may be prepared by collecting HJURP positive samples and then assaying their HJURP levels.  Alternatively, a purified HJURP protein or polynucleotide may be added to cells that do not express HJURP to form the positive sample or the HJURP standard sample.  In the present invention, purified HJURP may be a recombinant protein.  The HJURP level of the positive control sample is, for example, more than the cut off value.\n\n     In one embodiment, the present invention further provides a diagnostic kit including, a protein or a partial protein thereof capable of specifically recognizing the antibody of the present invention or the fragment thereof.\n\n\n\n\n     Examples of the partial peptide of the protein of the present invention include polypeptides composed of at least 8, preferably 15, and more preferably 20 contiguous amino acids in the amino acid sequence of the protein of the present invention.  Cancer can be diagnosed by detecting an antibody in a sample (e.g., blood, tissue) using a protein or a peptide (polypeptide) of the present invention.  The method for preparing the protein of the present invention and peptides are as described above.\n\n     The methods for diagnosing cancer of the present invention can be performed by determining the difference between the amount of anti-HJURP antibody and that in the corresponding control sample as describe above.  The subject is suspected to be suffering from cancer, if biological samples of the subject contain antibodies against the expression products (HJURP) of the gene and the quantity of the anti-HJURP antibody is determined to be more than the cut off value in level compared to that in normal control.\n\n\n\n\n     In another embodiment, a diagnostic kit of the present invention may include the peptide of the present invention and an HLA molecule binding thereto.  The method for detecting antigen specific CTLs using antigenic peptides and HLA molecules has already been established (for example, Altman JD et al., Science. 1996, 274(5284): 94-6).  Thus, the complex of the peptide of the present invention and the HLA molecule can be applied to the detection method to detect tumor antigen specific CTLs, thereby enabling earlier detection, recurrence and/or metastasis of cancer.  Further, it can be employed for the selection of subjects applicable with the pharmaceuticals including the peptide of the present invention as an active ingredient, or the assessment of the treatment effect of the pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n\n\n     Particularly, according to the known method (see, for example, Altman JD et al., Science. 1996, 274(5284): 94-6), the oligomer complex, such as tetramer, of the radio-labeled HLA molecule and the peptide of the present invention can be prepared.  With using the complex, the diagnosis can be done, for example, by quantifying the antigen-peptide specific CTLs in the peripheral blood lymphocytes derived from the subject suspected to be suffering from cancer.\n\n\n\n\n     The present invention further provides a method or diagnostic agents for evaluating immunological response of subject by using peptide epitopes as described herein.  In one embodiment of the invention, HLA-A24, or HLA-A02 restricted peptides as described herein may be used as reagents for evaluating or predicting an immune response of a subject.  The immune response to be evaluated may be induced by contacting an immunogen with immunocompetent cells in vitro or in vivo.  In preferred embodiments, the immunocompetent cells for evaluating an immunological response, may be selected from among peripheral blood, peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL), and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC).  Methods for collecting or isolating such immunocompetent cells are well known in the arts.  In some embodiments, any substances or compositions that may result in the production of antigen specific CTLs that recognize and bind to the peptide epitope(s) may be employed as the reagent.  The peptide reagents may need not to be used as the immunogen.  Assay systems that are used for such an analysis include relatively recent technical developments such as tetramers, staining for intracellular lymphokines and interferon release assays, or ELISPOT assays.  In a preferred embodiment, immunocompetent cells to be contacted with peptide reagent may be antigen presenting cells including dendritic cells.\n\n\n\n\n     For example, peptides of the present invention may be used in tetramer staining assays to assess peripheral blood mononuclear cells for the presence of antigen-specific CTLs following exposure to a tumor cell antigen or an immunogen.  The HLA tetrameric complex may be used to directly visualize antigen specific CTLs (see, e.g., Ogg et al., Science 279: 2103-2106, 1998; and Altman et al, Science 174 : 94-96, 1996) and determine the frequency of the antigen-specific CTL population in a sample of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  A tetramer reagent using a peptide of the invention may be generated as described below.\n\n\n\n\n     A peptide that binds to an HLA molecule is refolded in the presence of the corresponding HLA heavy chain and beta 2-microglobulin to generate a trimolecular complex.  In the complex, carboxyl terminal of the heavy chain is biotinylated at a site that was previously engineered into the protein.  Then, streptavidin is added to the complex to form tetramer composed of the trimolecular complex and streptavidin.  By means of fluorescently labeled streptavidin, the tetramer can be used to stain antigen specific cells.  The cells can then be identified, for example, by flow cytometry.  Such an analysis may be used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes.  Cells identified by the procedure can also be used for therapeutic purposes.\n\n\n\n\n     The present invention also provides reagents to evaluate immune recall responses (see, e.g., Bertoni et al, J. Clin. Invest. 100: 503-513, 1997 and Penna et al., J Exp. Med. 174: 1565-1570, 1991) including peptides of the present invention.  For example, patient PBMC samples from individuals with cancer to be treated can be analyzed for the presence of antigen-specific CTLs using specific peptides.  A blood sample containing mononuclear cells can be evaluated by cultivating the PBMCs and stimulating the cells with a peptide of the invention.  After an appropriate cultivation period, the expanded cell population can be analyzed, for example, for CTL activity.\n\n\n\n\n     The peptides may also be used as reagents to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine.  PBMCs obtained from a patient vaccinated with an immunogen may be analyzed using, for example, either of the methods described above.  The patient is HLA typed, and peptide epitope reagents that recognize the allele-specific molecules present in the patient are selected for the analysis.  The immunogenicity of the vaccine may be indicated by the presence of epitope-specific CTLs in the PBMC sample.  The peptides of the invention may also be used to make antibodies, using techniques well known in the art (see, e.g., CURRENTPROTOCOLSINIMMUNOLOGY, Wiley/Greene, NY; and Antibodies A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Lane, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989), which may find use as reagents to diagnose, detect or monitor cancer.  Such antibodies may include those that recognize a peptide in the context of an HLA molecule, i.e., antibodies that bind to a peptide-MHC complex.\n\n\n\n\n     The peptides and compositions of the present invention have a number of additional uses, some of which are described herein For instance, the present invention provides a method for diagnosing or detecting a disorder characterized by expression or presentation of a HJURP immunogenic polypeptide.  These methods involve determining expression or presentation of a HJURP HLA binding peptide, or a complex of a HJURP HLA binding peptide and an HLA class I molecule in a biological sample.  The expression or presentation of a peptide or complex of peptide and HLA class I molecule can be determined or detected by assaying with a binding partner for the peptide or complex.  In a preferred embodiment, a binding partner for the peptide or complex may be an antibody recognizes and specifically bind to the peptide or the complex.  The expression of HJURP in a biological sample, such as a tumor biopsy, can also be tested by standard PCR amplification protocols using HJURP primers.  An example of tumor expression is presented herein and further disclosure of exemplary conditions and primers for HJURP amplification can be found in WO2003/27322.\n\n\n\n\n     Preferably, the diagnostic methods involve contacting a biological sample isolated from a subject with a substance specific for the HJURP HLA binding peptide to detect the presence of the HJURP HLA binding peptide in the biological sample.  As used herein, \"contacting\" means placing the biological sample in sufficient proximity to the agent and under the appropriate conditions of, e.g., concentration, temperature, time, ionic strength, to allow the specific interaction between the agent and HJURP HLA binding peptide that are present in the biological sample.  In general, the conditions for contacting the agent with the biological sample are conditions known by those of ordinary skill in the art to facilitate a specific interaction between a molecule and its cognate (e.g., a protein and its receptor cognate, an antibody and its protein antigen cognate, a nucleic acid and its complementary sequence cognate) in a biological sample.  Exemplary conditions for facilitating a specific interaction between a molecule and its cognate are described in U. S. Patent No. 5,108,921, issued to Low et al.\n\n\n\n\n     The diagnostic method of the present invention can be performed in either or both of in vivo and in vitro.  Accordingly, biological sample can be located in vivo or in vitro in the present invention.  For example, the biological sample can be a tissue in vivo and the agent specific for the HJURP immunogenic polypeptide can be used to detect the presence of such molecules in the tissue.  Alternatively, the biological sample can be collected or isolated in vitro (e.g., a blood sample, tumor biopsy, tissue extract).  In a particularly preferred embodiment, the biological sample can be a cell-containing sample, more preferably a sample containing tumor cells collected from a subject to be diagnosed or treated.\n\n\n\n\n     Alternatively, the diagnosis can be done, by a method which allows direct quantification of antigen-specific T cells by staining with Fluorescein-labeled HLA multimeric complexes (e.g., Altman, J. D. et al., 1996, Science 274 : 94; Altman, J. D. et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 : 10330).  Staining for intracellular lymphokines, and interferon-gamma release assays or ELISPOT assays also has been provided.  Multimer staining, intracellular lymphokine staining and ELISPOT assays all appear to be at least 10-fold more sensitive than more conventional assays (Murali-Krishna, K. et al., 1998, Immunity 8: 177; Lalvani, A. et al., 1997, J. Exp. Med. 186: 859; Dunbar, P. R. et al., 1998, Curr. Biol. 8: 413).  Pentamers (e.g., US 2004-209295A), dextramers (e.g., WO 02/072631), and streptamers (e.g., \nNature medicine\n 6. 631-637 (2002)) may also be used.\n\n\n\n\n        For instance, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a method for diagnosing or evaluating an immunological response of a subject administered at least one of HJURP peptides of the present invention, the method including the steps of: \n\n(a) contacting an immunogen with immunocompetent cells under the condition suitable of induction of CTL specific to the immunogen; \n\n(b) detecting or determining induction level of the CTL induced in step (a); and \n\n(c) correlating the immunological response of the subject with the CTL induction level.\n\n\n\n\n        In the present invention, the immunogen is at least one of (a) a HJURP peptide selected from among the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 and 26 to 48, peptides having such amino acid sequences, and peptides having in which such amino acid sequences have been modified with 1, 2 or more amino acid substitution(s).  In the meantime, conditions suitable of induction of immunogen specific CTL are well known in the art.  For example, immunocompetent cells may be cultured in vitro under the presence of immunogen(s) to induce immunogen specific CTL.  In order to induce immunogen specific CTLs, any stimulating factors may be added to the cell culture.  For example, IL-2 is preferable stimulating factors for the CTL induction.\n\n\n\n\n        In some embodiments, the step of monitoring or evaluating immunological response of a subject to be treated with peptide cancer therapy may be performed before, during and/or after the treatment.  In general, during a protocol of cancer therapy, immunogenic peptides are administered repeatedly to a subject to be treated.  For example, immunogenic peptides may be administered every week for 3-10 weeks.  Accordingly, the immunological response of the subject can be evaluated or monitored during the cancer therapy protocol.  Alternatively, the step of evaluation or monitoring of immunological response to the cancer therapy may at the completion of the therapy protocol.\n\n\n\n\n        According to the present invention, enhanced induction of immunogen specific CTL as compared with a control indicates that the subject to be evaluated or diagnosed immunologically responded to the immunogen(s) that has/ have been administered.  Suitable controls for evaluating the immunological response may include, for example, a CTL induction level when the immunocompetent cells are contacted with no peptide, or control peptide(s) having amino acid sequences other than any HJURP peptides. (e.g. random amino acid sequence).  In a preferred embodiment, the immunological response of the subject is evaluated in a sequence specific manner, by comparison with an immunological response between each immunogen administered to the subject.  In particular, even when a mixture of some kinds of HJURP peptides is administered to the subject, immunological response might vary depending on the peptides.  In that case, by comparison of the immunological response between each peptide, peptides to which the subject show higher response can be identified.\n\n\n\n \nXI. Antibodies\n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides antibodies that bind to the peptides of the present invention.  Preferred antibodies specifically bind to the peptide of the present invention and will not bind (or will bind weakly) to non-peptide of the present invention.  Alternatively, antibodies bind to the peptide of the invention as well as the homologs thereof.  Antibodies against the peptide of the invention can find use in cancer diagnostic and prognostic assays, and imaging methodologies.  Similarly, such antibodies can find use in the treatment, diagnosis, and/or prognosis of other cancers, to the extent HJURP is also expressed or overexpressed in cancer patient.  Moreover, intracellularly expressed antibodies (e.g., single chain antibodies) may therapeutically find use in treating cancers in which the expression of HJURP is involved, examples of which include, but are not limited to, AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor.\n\n\n\n\n     The present invention also provides various immunological assay for the detection and/or quantification of HJURP protein (SEQ ID NO: 50) or fragments thereof including a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 and 26 to 48.  Such assays may include one or more anti-HJURP antibodies capable of recognizing and binding a HJURP protein or fragments thereof, as appropriate.  In the present invention, anti-HJURP antibodies binding to HJURP polypeptide preferably recognize a polypeptide having an amino acid sequenceselected from among SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 and 26 to 48.  A binding specificity of antibody can be confirmed with inhibition test.  That is, when the binding between an antibody to be analyzed and full-length of HJURP polypeptide are inhibited under presence of any fragment polypeptides having an amino acid sequence selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 and 26 to 48, the antibody specifically binds to the fragment.  In the present invention, such immunological assays are performed within various immunological assay formats well known in the art, including but not limited to, various types of radio-immunoassays, immuno-chromatograph technique, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), enzyme-linked immunofluorescent assays (ELIFA), and the like.\n\n\n\n\n     Related immunological but non-antibody assays of the invention may also include T cell immunogenicity assays (inhibitory or stimulatory) as well as MHC binding assays.  In addition, immunological imaging methods capable of detecting cancers expressing HJURP are also provided by the invention, including, but not limited to, radioscintigraphic imaging methods using labeled antibodies of the present invention.  Such assays can clinically find use in the detection, monitoring, and prognosis of HJURP expressing cancers including, but not limited to, AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor.\n\n\n\n\n     The present invention also provides an antibody that binds to the peptide of the invention.  The antibody of the invention can be used in any form, such as monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, and include antiserum obtained by immunizing an animal such as a rabbit with the peptide of the invention, all classes of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, human antibodies and humanized antibodies produced by genetic recombination.\n\n     A peptide of the invention used as an antigen to obtain an antibody may be derived from any animal species, but preferably is derived from a mammal such as a human, mouse, or rat, more preferably from a human.  A human-derived peptide may be obtained from the nucleotide or amino acid sequences disclosed herein.\n\n     According to the present invention, the peptide to be used as an immunization antigen may be a complete protein or a partial peptide of the protein.  A partial peptide may include, for example, the amino (N)-terminal or carboxy (C)-terminal fragment of a peptide of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n     Herein, an antibody is defined as a protein that reacts with either the full length or a fragment of a HJURP peptide.  In a preferred embodiment, antibody of the present invention can recognize fragment peptides of HJURP having an amino acid sequence selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 24 and 26 to 48.  Methods for synthesizing oligopeptide are well known in the arts.  After the synthesis, peptides may be optionally purified prior to use as immunogen.  In the present invention, the oligopeptide (e.g., 9- or 10mer) may be conjugated or linked with carriers to enhance the immunogenicity.  Keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is well known as the carrier.  Method for conjugating KLH and peptide are also well known in the arts.\n\n\n\n\n     Alternatively, a gene encoding a peptide of the invention or fragment thereof may be inserted into a known expression vector, which is then used to transform a host cell as described herein.  The desired peptide or fragment thereof may be recovered from the outside or inside of host cells by any standard method, and may subsequently be used as an antigen.  Alternatively, whole cells expressing the peptide or their lysates or a chemically synthesized peptide may be used as the antigen.\n\n\n\n\n     Any mammalian animal may be immunized with the antigen, but preferably the compatibility with parental cells used for cell fusion is taken into account.  In general, animals of Rodentia, Lagomorpha or Primate family may be used.  Animals of the family Rodentia include, for example, mouse, rat and hamster.  Animals of the family Lagomorpha include, for example, rabbit.  Animals of the Primate family include, for example, a monkey of Catarrhini (old world monkey) such as Macaca fascicularis, rhesus monkey, sacred baboon and chimpanzees.\n\n\n\n\n     Methods for immunizing animals with antigens are known in the art.  Intraperitoneal injection or subcutaneous injection of antigens is a standard method for immunization of mammals.  More specifically, antigens may be diluted and suspended in an appropriate amount of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), physiological saline, etc.  If desired, the antigen suspension may be mixed with an appropriate amount of a standard adjuvant, such as Freund's complete adjuvant, made into emulsion and then administered to mammalian animals.  Preferably, it is followed by several administrations of antigen mixed with an appropriately amount of Freund's incomplete adjuvant every 4 to 21 days.  An appropriate carrier may also be used for immunization.  After immunization as above, serum may be examined by a standard method for an increase in the amount of desired antibodies.\n\n\n\n\n     Polyclonal antibodies against the peptides of the present invention may be prepared by collecting blood from the immunized mammal examined for the increase of desired antibodies in the serum, and by separating serum from the blood by any conventional method.  Polyclonal antibodies include serum containing the polyclonal antibodies, as well as the fraction containing the polyclonal antibodies may be isolated from the serum.  Immunoglobulin G or M can be prepared from a fraction which recognizes only the peptide of the present invention using, for example, an affinity column coupled with the peptide of the present invention, and further purifying this fraction using protein A or protein G column.\n\n\n\n\n     To prepare monoclonal antibodies, immune cells are collected from the mammal immunized with the antigen and checked for the increased level of desired antibodies in the serum as described above, and are subjected to cell fusion.  The immune cells used for cell fusion may preferably be obtained from spleen.  Other preferred parental cells to be fused with the above immunocyte include, for example, myeloma cells of mammalians, and more preferably myeloma cells having an acquired property for the selection of fused cells by drugs.\n\n\n\n\n     The above immunocyte and myeloma cells can be fused according to known methods, for example, the method of Milstein et al. (Galfre and Milstein, Methods Enzymol 73: 3-46 (1981)).\n\n     Resulting hybridomas obtained by the cell fusion may be selected by cultivating them in a standard selection medium, such as HAT medium (hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine containing medium).  The cell culture is typically continued in the HAT medium for several days to several weeks, the time being sufficient to allow all the other cells, with the exception of the desired hybridoma (non-fused cells), to die.  Then, the standard limiting dilution may be performed to screen and clone a hybridoma cell producing the desired antibody.\n\n\n\n\n     In addition to the above method, in which a non-human animal is immunized with an antigen for preparing hybridoma, human lymphocytes such as those infected by EB virus may be immunized with a peptide, peptide expressing cells or their lysates in vitro.  Then, the immunized lymphocytes are fused with human-derived myeloma cells that are capable of indefinitely dividing, such as U266, to yield a hybridoma producing a desired human antibody that is able to bind to the peptide can be obtained (Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application No. Sho 63-17688).\n\n\n\n\n     The obtained hybridomas are subsequently transplanted into the abdominal cavity of a mouse and the ascites are extracted.  The obtained monoclonal antibodies can be purified by, for example, ammonium sulfate precipitation, a protein A or protein G column, DEAE ion exchange chromatography or an affinity column to which the peptide of the present invention is coupled.  The antibody of the present invention can be used not only for purification and detection of the peptide of the present invention, but also as a candidate for agonists and antagonists of the peptide of the present invention.\n\n     Alternatively, an immune cell, such as an immunized lymphocyte, producing antibodies may be immortalized by an oncogene and used for preparing monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n\n\n     Monoclonal antibodies thus obtained can be also recombinantly prepared using genetic engineering techniques (see, for example, Borrebaeck and Larrick, Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies, published in the United Kingdom by MacMillan Publishers LTD (1990)).  For example, a DNA encoding an antibody may be cloned from an immune cell, such as a hybridoma or an immunized lymphocyte producing the antibody, inserted into an appropriate vector, and introduced into host cells to prepare a recombinant antibody.  The present invention also provides recombinant antibodies prepared as described above.\n\n\n\n\n     Furthermore, an antibody of the present invention may be a fragment of an antibody or modified antibody, so long as it binds to one or more of the peptides of the invention.  For instance, the antibody fragment may be Fab, F(ab')\n2\n, Fv or single chain Fv (scFv), in which Fv fragments from H and L chains are ligated by an appropriate linker (Huston et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 85: 5879-83 (1988)).  More specifically, an antibody fragment may be generated by treating an antibody with an enzyme, such as papain or pepsin.  Alternatively, a gene encoding the antibody fragment may be constructed, inserted into an expression vector and expressed in an appropriate host cell (see, for example, Co et al., J Immunol 152: 2968-76 (1994); Better and Horwitz, Methods Enzymol 178: 476-96 (1989); Pluckthun and Skerra, Methods Enzymol 178: 497-515 (1989); Lamoyi, Methods Enzymol 121: 652-63 (1986); Rousseaux et al., Methods Enzymol 121: 663-9 (1986); Bird and Walker, Trends Biotechnol 9: 132-7 (1991)).\n\n     An antibody may be modified by conjugation with a variety of molecules, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG).  The present invention provides for such modified antibodies.  The modified antibody can be obtained by chemically modifying an antibody.  These modification methods are conventional in the field.\n\n\n\n\n     Alternatively, an antibody of the present invention may be obtained as a chimeric antibody, between a variable region derived from nonhuman antibody and the constant region derived from human antibody, or as a humanized antibody, including the complementarity determining region (CDR) derived from nonhuman antibody, the frame work region (FR) and the constant region derived from human antibody.  Such antibodies can be prepared according to known technology.  Humanization can be performed by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody (see, e.g., Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534-1536 (1988)).  Accordingly, such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies, wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species.\n\n\n\n\n     Fully human antibodies including human variable regions in addition to human framework and constant regions can also be used.  Such antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art.  For example, in vitro methods involve use of recombinant libraries of human antibody fragments displayed on bacteriophage (e.g., Hoogenboom & Winter, J. Mol. Biol. 227:381 (1991).  Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing of human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated.  This approach is described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,150,584, 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016.\n\n\n\n\n     Antibodies obtained as above may be purified to homogeneity.  For example, the separation and purification of the antibody can be performed according to the separation and purification methods used for general proteins.  For example, the antibody may be separated and isolated by the appropriately selected and combined use of column chromatographies, such as affinity chromatography, filter, ultrafiltration, salting-out, dialysis, SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing (Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Ed Harlow and David Lane, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1988)), but are not limited thereto.  A protein A column and protein G column can be used as the affinity column.  Exemplary protein A columns to be used include, for example, Hyper D, POROS and Sepharose F.F. (Pharmacia).\n\n\n\n\n     Exemplary chromatography, with the exception of affinity includes, for example, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, gel filtration, reverse phase chromatography, adsorption chromatography and the like (Strategies for Protein Purification and Characterization: A Laboratory Course Manual. Ed Daniel R. Marshak et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1996)).  The chromatographic procedures can be carried out by liquid-phase chromatography, such as HPLC and FPLC.\n\n\n\n\n     For example, measurement of absorbance, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), enzyme immunoassay (EIA), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and/or immunofluorescence may be used to measure the antigen binding activity of the antibody of the invention.  In ELISA, the antibody of the present invention is immobilized on a plate, a peptide of the invention is applied to the plate, and then a sample containing a desired antibody, such as culture supernatant of antibody producing cells or purified antibodies, is applied.  Then, a secondary antibody that recognizes the primary antibody and is labeled with an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, is applied, and the plate is incubated.  Next, after washing, an enzyme substrate, such as p-nitrophenyl phosphate, is added to the plate, and the absorbance is measured to evaluate the antigen binding activity of the sample.  A fragment of the peptide, such as a C-terminal or N-terminal fragment, may be used as the antigen to evaluate the binding activity of the antibody.  BIAcore (Pharmacia) may be used to evaluate the activity of the antibody according to the present invention.\n\n     The above methods allow for the detection or measurement of the peptide of the invention, by exposing the antibody of the invention to a sample assumed to contain the peptide of the invention, and detecting or measuring the immune complex formed by the antibody and the peptide.\n\n     Because the method of detection or measurement of the peptide according to the invention can specifically detect or measure a peptide, the method can find use in a variety of experiments in which the peptide is used.\n\n\n\n \nXII. Vectors and host cells\n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a vector and host cell into which a nucleotide encoding the peptide of the present invention is introduced.  A vector of the present invention can find use to keep a nucleotide, especially a DNA, of the present invention in host cell, to express the peptide of the present invention, or to administer the nucleotide of the present invention for gene therapy.\n\n\n\n\n     When E. coli is a host cell and the vector is amplified and produced in a large amount in E. coli (e.g., JM109, DH5 alpha, HB101 or XL1Blue), the vector should have \"ori\" to be amplified in E. coli and a marker gene for selecting transformed E. coli (e.g., a drug-resistance gene selected by a drug such as ampicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin, chloramphenicol or the like).  For example, M13-series vectors, pUC-series vectors, pBR322, pBluescript, pCR-Script, etc., can be used.  In addition, pGEM-T, pDIRECT and pT7 can also be used for subcloning and extracting cDNA as well as the vectors described above.  When a vector is used to produce the protein of the present invention, an expression vector can find use.  For example, an expression vector to be expressed in E. coli should have the above characteristics to be amplified in E. coli.  When E. coli, such as JM109, DH5 alpha, HB101 or XL1 Blue, are used as a host cell, the vector should have a promoter, for example, lacZ promoter (Ward et al., Nature 341: 544-6 (1989); FASEB J 6: 2422-7 (1992)), araB promoter (Better et al., Science 240: 1041-3 (1988)), T7 promoter or the like, that can efficiently express the desired gene in E. coli.  In that respect, pGEX-5X-1 (Pharmacia), \"QIAexpress system\" (Qiagen), pEGFP and pET (in this case, the host is preferably BL21 which expresses T7 RNA polymerase), for example, can be used instead of the above vectors.  Additionally, the vector may also contain a signal sequence for peptide secretion.  An exemplary signal sequence that directs the peptide to be secreted to the periplasm of the E. coli is the pelB signal sequence (Lei et al., J Bacteriol 169: 4379 (1987)).  Means for introducing of the vectors into the target host cells include, for example, the calcium chloride method, and the electroporation method.\n\n\n\n\n     In addition to E. coli, for example, expression vectors derived from mammals (for example, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pEGF-BOS (Nucleic Acids Res 18(17): 5322 (1990)), pEF, pCDM8), expression vectors derived from insect cells (for example, \"Bac-to-BAC baculovirus expression system\" (GIBCO BRL), pBacPAK8), expression vectors derived from plants (e.g., pMH1, pMH2), expression vectors derived from animal viruses (e.g., pHSV, pMV, pAdexLcw), expression vectors derived from retroviruses (e.g., pZIpneo), expression vector derived from yeast (e.g., \"Pichia Expression Kit\" (Invitrogen), pNV11, SP-Q01) and expression vectors derived from Bacillus subtilis (e.g., pPL608, pKTH50) can be used for producing the polypeptide of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n     In order to express the vector in animal cells, such as CHO, COS or NIH3T3 cells, the vector should have a promoter necessary for expression in such cells, for example, the SV40 promoter (Mulligan et al., Nature 277: 108 (1979)), the MMLV-LTR promoter, the EF1 alpha promoter (Mizushima et al., Nucleic Acids Res 18: 5322 (1990)), the CMV promoter and the like, and preferably a marker gene for selecting transformants (for example, a drug resistance gene selected by a drug (e.g., neomycin, G418)).  Examples of known vectors with these characteristics include, for example, pMAM, pDR2, pBK-RSV, pBK-CMV, pOPRSV and pOP13.\n\n        The following examples are presented to illustrate the present invention and to assist one of ordinary skill in making and using the same.  The examples are not intended in any way to otherwise limit the scope of the invention.\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 1\n \n \nMaterials and Methods\n \n \nCell lines\n \n \n \nTISI, HLA-A*2402-positive B-lymphoblastoid cell line, was purchased from the IHWG Cell and Gene Bank (Seattle, WA).  COS7, African green monkey kidney cell line, was purchased from ATCC.\n\n\n\n \nCandidate selection of peptides derived from HJURP\n \n \n \n9-mer and 10-mer peptides derived from HJURP that bind to HLA-A*2402 molecule were predicted using binding prediction software \"BIMAS\" (www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/molbio/hla_bind) (Parker et al.(J Immunol 1994, 152(1): 163-75), Kuzushima et al.(Blood 2001, 98(6): 1872-81) ) and \"NetMHC 3.0\" (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC/) (Buus et al. (Tissue Antigens., 62:378-84, 2003), Nielsen et al. (Protein Sci., 12:1007-17, 2003, Bioinformatics, 20(9):1388-97, 2004)).  These peptides were synthesized by Biosynthesis (Lewisville, Texas) according to a standard solid phase synthesis method and purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  The purity (>90%) and the identity of the peptides were determined by analytical HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis, respectively.  Peptides were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 20 mg/ml and stored at -80 degrees C.\n\n\n\n \nIn vitro CTL Induction\n \n \n \nMonocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were used as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against peptides presented on human leukocyte antigen (HLA).  DCs were generated in vitro as described elsewhere (Nakahara S et al., Cancer Res 2003 \nJul\n 15, 63(14): 4112-8).  Specifically, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from a normal volunteer (HLA-A*2402 positive) by Ficoll-Plaque (Pharmacia) solution were separated by adherence to a plastic tissue culture dish (Becton Dickinson) so as to enrich them as the monocyte fraction.  The monocyte-enriched population was cultured in the presence of 1,000 U/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (R&D System) and 1,000 U/ml of interleukin (IL)-4 (R&D System) in AIM-V Medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% heat-inactivated autologous serum (AS).  After 7 days of culture, the cytokine-induced DCs were pulsed with 20 micro-g/ml of each of the synthesized peptides in the presence of 3 micro-g/ml of beta 2-microglobulin for 3 hrs at 37 degrees C in AIM-V Medium.  The generated cells appeared to express DC-associated molecules, such as CD80, CD83, CD86 and HLA class II, on their cell surfaces (data not shown).  These peptide-pulsed DCs were then inactivated by X-irradiation (20 Gy) and mixed at a 1:20 ratio with autologous CD8+ T cells, obtained by positive selection with CD8 Positive Isolation Kit (Dynal).  These cultures were set up in 48-well plates (Corning); each well contained 1.5 x 10\n4\n peptide-pulsed DCs, 3 x 10\n5\n CD8+ T cells and 10 ng/ml of IL-7 (R&D System) in 0.5 ml of AIM-V/2% AS medium.  Three days later, these cultures were supplemented with IL-2 (CHIRON) to a final concentration of 20 IU/ml.  On \n \ndays\n \n 7 and 14, the T cells were further stimulated with the autologous peptide-pulsed DCs.  The DCs were prepared each time by the same way described above.  CTL was tested against peptide-pulsed TISI cells after the 3rd round of peptide stimulation on day 21 (Tanaka H et al., Br J Cancer 2001 \nJan\n 5, 84(1): 94-9; Umano Y et al., Br J Cancer 2001 \nApr\n 20, 84(8): 1052-7; Uchida N et al., Clin Cancer Res 2004 \nDec\n 15, 10(24): 8577-86; Suda T et al., Cancer Sci 2006 May, 97(5): 411-9; Watanabe T et al., Cancer Sci 2005 Aug, 96(8): 498-506).\n\n\n\n \nCTL Expansion Procedure\n \n \n \nCTLs were expanded in culture using the method similar to the one described by Riddell et al. (Walter EA et al., N Engl J Med 1995 \nOct\n 19, 333(16): 1038-44; Riddell SR et al., Nat Med 1996 Feb, 2(2): 216-23).  A total of 5 x 10\n4\n CTLs were suspended in 25 ml of AIM-V/5% AS medium with 2 kinds of human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, inactivated by Mitomycin C, in the presence of 40 ng/ml of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen).  One day after initiating the cultures, 120 IU/ml of IL-2 were added to the cultures.  The cultures were fed with fresh AIM-V/5% AS medium containing 30 IU/ml of IL-2 on \n \ndays\n \n 5, 8 and 11 (Tanaka H et al., Br J Cancer 2001 \nJan\n 5, 84(1): 94-9; Umano Y et al., Br J Cancer 2001 \nApr\n 20, 84(8): 1052-7; Uchida N et al., Clin Cancer Res 2004 \nDec\n 15, 10(24): 8577-86; Suda T et al., Cancer Sci 2006 May, 97(5): 411-9; Watanabe T et al., Cancer Sci 2005 Aug, 96(8): 498-506).\n\n\n\n \nEstablishment of CTL clones\n \n \n \nThe dilutions were made to have 0.3, 1, and 3 CTLs/well in 96 round-bottomed micro titer plate (Nalge Nunc International).  CTLs were cultured with 1 x 10\n4\n cells/well of 2 kinds of human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, 30ng/ml of anti-CD3 antibody, and 125 U/ml of IL-2 in a total of 150 micro-l/well of AIM-V Medium containing 5%AS.  50 micro-l /well of IL-2 were added to the medium 10 days later so to reach a final concentration of 125 U/ml IL-2.  CTL activity was tested on the 14th day, and CTL clones were expanded using the same method as described above (Uchida N et al., Clin Cancer Res 2004 \nDec\n 15, 10(24): 8577-86; Suda T et al., Cancer Sci 2006 May, 97(5): 411-9; Watanabe T et al., Cancer Sci 2005 Aug, 96(8): 498-506).\n\n\n\n \nSpecific CTL activity\n \n \n \nTo examine specific CTL activity, interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay and IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed.  Specifically, peptide-pulsed TISI (1 x 10\n4\n cells/ well) was prepared as stimulator cells.  Cultured cells in 48 wells were used as responder cells.  IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay and IFN-gamma ELISA assay were performed under manufacture procedure.\n\n\n\n \nPlasmid transfection\n \n \n \nThe cDNA encoding an open reading frame of target genes or HLA-A*2402 was amplified by PCR.  The PCR-amplified products were cloned into a vector and pIRES vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Cat. No. 631605).  The plasmids were transfected into COS7, which is the target genes and HLA-A24 negative cell line, using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures.  After 2days from transfection, the transfected cells were harvested with versene (Invitrogen) and used as the target cells (5 x 10\n4 \ncells/ well) for CTL activity assay.\n\n\n\n\n Results\n\n\nEnhanced HJURP expression in cancers\n\n\n\n\n \nThe global gene expression profile data obtained from various cancers using cDNA-microarray revealed that HJURP (GenBank Accession No. NM_018410; SEQ ID No: 49) expression was elevated.  HJURP expression was validly elevated in 3 out of 15 AMLs, 25 out of 26 bladder cancers, 29 out of 33 breast cancers, 8 out of 9 cervical cancers, 11 out of 11 cholangiocellular carcinoma, 25 out of 33 CMLs, 4 out of 12 colorectal cancers, 29 out of 40 esophagus cancers, 1 out of 3 gastric cancer diffused-type, 4 out of 4 liver cancer, 12 out of 12 NSCLC, 2 out of 3 lymphoma, 8 out of 11 osteosarcomas, 3 out of 5 ovarian cancer, 4 out of 4 pancreatic cancer, 12 out of 18 prostate cancer, 4 out of 7 renal carcinomas, 13 out of 13 SCLC, 8 out of 14 soft tissue tumor and 6 out of 9 testicular tumor as compared with corresponding normal tissue (Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPrediction of HLA-A24 binding peptides derived from HJURP\n \n \n \nTables 2a and 2b shows the HLA-A24 binding 9mer and 10mer peptides of HJURP in the order of high binding affinity.  15 peptides (SEQ ID NO: 1-6 and SEQ ID NO: 10-18) were selected by using BIMAS, and 9 peptides (SEQ ID NO: 7-9 and SEQ ID NO: 19-24) were predicted by NetMHC3.0.  A total of 24 peptides with potential HLA-A24 binding ability were selected and examined to determine the epitope peptides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nStart position indicates the number of amino acid residue from the N-terminus of HJURP.  Binding score and dissociation constant [Kd (nM)] are derived from \"BIMAS\" and \"NetMHC3.0\".\n\n\n\n \nCTL induction with the predicted peptides from HJURP restricted with HLA-A*2402 and establishment for CTL lines stimulated with HJURP derived peptides\n \n \n \nCTLs for those peptides derived from HJURP were generated according to the protocols as described in \"Materials and Methods\".  Peptide specific CTL activity was determined by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay (Figures 1a-e).  Well \nnumber #\n4 with HJURP-A24-9-28 (SEQ ID NO: 3) (a), #4 with HJURP-A24-9-263 (SEQ ID NO: 4) (b), #4 with HJURP-A24-9-408 (SEQ ID NO: 7) (c), #6 with HJURP-A24-10-383 (SEQ ID NO: 18) (d) and #4 with HJURP-A24-10-162 (SEQ ID NO: 23) (e) demonstrated potent IFN-gamma production as compared to the control wells.  On the other hand, no potent IFN-gamma production could be detected by stimulation with other peptides shown in Tables 2a and 2b, despite those peptides had possible binding activity with HLA-A*2402. As is typical of negative data, a specific CTL response was not observed from the peptide-pulsed target cellsstimulated with HJURP-A24-9-149 (SEQ ID NO: 1) (f).  As a result, 5 peptides derived from HJURP were identified as having the potential to induce potent CTLs.\n\n\n\n \nEstablishment of CTL lines and clones against HJURP specific peptides\n \n \n \nThe cells that showed peptide specific CTL activity detected by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay in the \nwell number #\n4 with HJURP-A24-9-263 (SEQ ID NO: 4) and in #4 with HJURP-A24-9-408 (SEQ ID NO: 7) were expanded and CTL lines were established by limiting dilution as described in the \"Materials and Methods\" section above.  CTL activity of those CTL lines was determined by IFN-gamma ELISA assay (Figures 2a and b).  The CTL lines demonstrated potent IFN-gamma production against the target cells pulsed with corresponding peptide as compared to target cells without peptide pulse.  Furthermore, CTL clone was established by limiting dilution from the CTL line, and IFN-gamma production from CTL clone against target cells pulsed peptide was determined by IFN-gamma ELISA assay.  Potent IFN-gamma production was determined from CTL clone stimulated with HJURP-A24-9-408 (SEQ ID NO: 7) in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n \nSpecific CTL activity against target cells exogenously expressing HJURP and HLA-A*2402\n \n\n The established CTL line raised against these peptides were examined for their ability to recognize target cells that endogenously express HJURP and HLA-A*2402 gene.  Specific CTL activity against COS7 cells which transfected with both the full length of HJURP and HLA-A*2402 gene (a specific model for the target cells that endogenously express HJURP and HLA-A*2402 gene) was tested using the CTL lines raised by corresponding peptide as the effecter cells.  COS7 cells transfected with either full length of HJURP genes or HLA-A* 2402 were prepared as controls.  In Figure 4, the CTLs stimulated with HJURP-A24-9-408 (SEQ ID NO: 7) (a) and HJURP-A24-9-263 (SEQ ID NO: 4) (b) showed potent CTL activity against COS7 cells expressing both HJURP and HLA- A*2402.  On the other hand, no significant specific CTL activity was detected against the controls.  Thus, these data clearly demonstrated that peptides of HJURP-A24-9-408 (SEQ ID NO: 7) and HJURP-A24-9-263 (SEQ ID NO: 4) were endogenously processed and expressed on the target cells with HLA-A*2402 molecule and were recognized by the CTLs.  These results indicate that this peptide derived from HJURP may be suitable as a cancer vaccine for the treatment of patients with HJURP expressing tumors.\n\n\n\n \nHomology analysis of antigen peptides\n \n \n \nThe CTLs stimulated with HJURP-A24-9-28 (SEQ ID NO: 3), HJURP-A24-9-263 (SEQ ID NO: 4), HJURP-A24-9-408 (SEQ ID NO: 7), HJURP-A24-10-383 (SEQ ID NO: 19) and HJURP-A24-10-162 (SEQ ID NO: 23) showed significant and specific CTL activity.  This result may be due to the fact that the sequences of HJURP-A24-9-28 (SEQ ID NO: 3), HJURP-A24-9-263 (SEQ ID NO: 4), HJURP-A24-9-408 (SEQ ID NO: 7), HJURP-A24-10-383 (SEQ ID NO: 18) and HJURP-A24-10-162 (SEQ ID NO: 23) are homologous to peptides derived from other molecules that are known to sensitize the human immune system.  To exclude this possibility, homology analyses were performed for these peptide sequences using as queries the BLAST algorithm (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi) which revealed no sequence with significant homology.  The results of homology analyses indicate that the sequences of HJURP-A24-9-28 (SEQ ID NO: 3), HJURP-A24-9-263  (SEQ ID NO: 4), HJURP-A24-9-408 (SEQ ID NO: 7), HJURP-A24-10-383 (SEQ ID NO: 18) and HJURP-A24-10-162 (SEQ ID NO: 23) are unique and thus, there is little possibility, to our best knowledge, that these molecules raise unintended immunologic response to some unrelated molecule.\n\n     In conclusion, novel HLA-A24 epitope peptide derived from HJURP were identified. Furthermore, the results herein demonstrate that epitope peptide of HJURP may be suitable for use in for cancer immunotherapy.\n\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES 2\n \n \nMaterials and Methods\n \n \nCell lines\n \n \n \nT2, HLA-A*0201-positive B-lymphoblastoid cell line, and COS7, African green monkey kidney cell line, were purchased from ATCC.\n\n\n\n \nCandidate selection of peptides derived from HJURP\n \n \n \n9-mer and 10-mer peptides derived from HJURP that bind to HLA-A*0201 molecule were predicted using binding prediction software \"NetMHC 3.0\" (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC/) (Buus et al. (Tissue Antigens., 62:378-84, 2003), Nielsen et al. (Protein Sci., 12:1007-17, 2003, Bioinformatics, 20(9):1388-97, 2004)).  These peptides were synthesized by Biosynthesis (Lewisville, Texas) according to a standard solid phase synthesis method and purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  The purity (>90%) and the identity of the peptides were determined by analytical HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis, respectively.  Peptides were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 20 mg/ml and stored at -80 degrees C.\n\n\n\n \nIn vitro CTL Induction\n \n \n \nMonocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were used as antigen-presenting cells to induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against peptides presented on human leukocyte antigen (HLA).  DCs were generated in vitro as described elsewhere (Nakahara S et al., Cancer Res 2003 \nJul\n 15, 63(14): 4112-8).  Specifically, peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a normal volunteer (HLA-A*0201 positive) by Ficoll-Plaque (Pharmacia) solution were separated by adherence to a plastic tissue culture dish (Becton Dickinson) so as to enrich them as the monocyte fraction.  The monocyte-enriched population was cultured in the presence of 1,000 U/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R&D System) and 1,000 U/ml of interleukin (IL)-4 (R&D System) in AIM-V Medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% heat-inactivated autologous serum (AS).  After 7 days of culture, the cytokine-induced DCs were pulsed with 20 micro-g/ml of each of the synthesized peptides in the presence of 3 micro-g/ml of beta 2-microglobulin for 3 hrs at 37 degrees C in AIM-V Medium.  The generated cells appeared to express DC-associated molecules, such as CD80, CD83, CD86 and HLA class II, on their cell surfaces (data not shown).  These peptide-pulsed DCs were then inactivated by X-irradiation (20 Gy) and mixed at a 1:20 ratio with autologous CD8+ T cells, obtained by positive selection with CD8 Positive Isolation Kit (Dynal).  These cultures were set up in 48-well plates (Corning); each well contained 1.5 x 10\n4\n peptide-pulsed DCs, 3 x 10\n5\n CD8+ T cells and 10 ng/ml of IL-7 (R&D System) in 0.5 ml of AIM-V/2% AS medium.  Three days later, these cultures were supplemented with IL-2 (CHIRON) to a final concentration of 20 IU/ml.  On \n \ndays\n \n 7 and 14, the T cells were further stimulated with the autologous peptide-pulsed DCs.  The DCs were prepared each time by the same way described above.  CTLs were tested against peptide-pulsed T2 cells after the 3rd round of peptide stimulation on day 21 (Tanaka H et al., Br J Cancer 2001 \nJan\n 5, 84(1): 94-9; Umano Y et al., Br J Cancer 2001 \nApr\n 20, 84(8): 1052-7; Uchida N et al., Clin Cancer Res 2004 \nDec\n 15, 10(24): 8577-86; Suda T et al., Cancer Sci 2006 May, 97(5): 411-9; Watanabe T et al., Cancer Sci 2005 Aug, 96(8): 498-506).\n\n\n\n \nCTL Expansion Procedure\n \n \n \nCTLs were expanded in culture using the method similar to the one described by Riddell et al. (Walter EA et al., N Engl J Med 1995 \nOct\n 19, 333(16): 1038-44; Riddell SR et al., Nat Med 1996 Feb, 2(2): 216-23).  A total of 5 x 10\n4\n CTLs were suspended in 25 ml of AIM-V/5% AS medium with 2 kinds of human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, inactivated by Mitomycin C, in the presence of 40 ng/ml of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen).  One day after initiating the cultures, 120 IU/ml of IL-2 were added to the cultures.  The cultures were fed with fresh AIM-V/5% AS medium containing 30 IU/ml of IL-2 on \n \ndays\n \n 5, 8 and 11 (Tanaka H et al., Br J Cancer 2001 \nJan\n 5, 84(1): 94-9; Umano Y et al., Br J Cancer 2001 \nApr\n 20, 84(8): 1052-7; Uchida N et al., Clin Cancer Res 2004 \nDec\n 15, 10(24): 8577-86; Suda T et al., Cancer Sci 2006 May, 97(5): 411-9; Watanabe T et al., Cancer Sci 2005 Aug, 96(8): 498-506).\n\n\n\n \nEstablishment of CTL clones\n \n \n \nThe dilutions were made to have 0.3, 1, and 3 CTLs/well in 96 round-bottomed micro titer plate (Nalge Nunc International).  CTLs were cultured with 1 x 10\n4\n cells/well of 2 kinds of human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, 30ng/ml of anti-CD3 antibody, and 125 U/ml of IL-2 in a total of 150 micro-l/well of AIM-V Medium containing 5%AS.  50 micro-l/well of IL-2 were added to the medium 10 days later so to reach a final concentration of 125 U/ml IL-2.  CTL activity was tested on the 14th day, and CTL clones were expanded using the same method as described above (Uchida N et al., Clin Cancer Res 2004 \nDec\n 15, 10(24): 8577-86; Suda T et al., Cancer Sci 2006 May, 97(5): 411-9; Watanabe T et al., Cancer Sci 2005 Aug, 96(8): 498-506).\n\n\n\n \nSpecific CTL activity\n \n \n \nTo examine specific CTL activity, interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay and IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed.  Specifically, peptide-pulsed T2 (1 x 10\n4\n/well) was prepared as stimulator cells.  Cultured cells in 48 wells were used as responder cells.  IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay and IFN-gamma ELISA assay were performed under manufacture procedure.\n\n\n\n \nEstablishment of the cells forcibly expressing either or both of the target gene and HLA-A02\n \n \n \nThe cDNA encoding an open reading frame of target genes or HLA-A*0201 was amplified by PCR.  The PCR-amplified products were cloned into pIRES vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Cat. No. 631605).  The plasmids were transfected into COS7, which is the target genes and HLA-A02-negative cell line, using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures.  After 2days from transfection, the transfected cells were harvested with versene (Invitrogen) and used as the target cells (5 x 10\n4 \ncells/ well) for CTL activity assay.\n\n\n\n\n Results\n\n\nPrediction of HLA-A*0201 binding peptides derived from HJURP\n\n\n\n\n \nTables 3a and 3b show the HLA-A2 binding 9mer and 10mer peptides of HJURP in the order of high binding affinity.  A total of 24 peptides with potential HLA-A2 binding ability were selected and examined to determine the epitope peptides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nStart position indicates the number of amino acid residue from the N-terminus of HJURP. Dissociation constant [Kd (nM)] are derived from \"NetMHC3.0\".\n\n\n\n \nCTL induction with the predicted peptides from HJURP restricted with HLA-A*0201 and establishment for CTL lines stimulated with HJURP derived peptides\n \n \n \nCTLs for those peptides derived from HJURP were generated according to the protocols as described in \"Materials and Methods\".  Peptide specific CTL activity was determined by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay (Figures 5a-i).  The following wells demonstrated potent IFN-gamma production as compared to the control wells: \nnumber #\n4 stimulated with HJURP-A02-9-496 (SEQ ID NO: 26) (a), #2 with HJURP-A02-9-354 (SEQ ID NO: 27) (b), #4 with HJURP-A02-9-406 (SEQ ID NO: 30) (c), #5 with HJURP-A02-9-129 (SEQ ID NO: 31) (d), #3 with HJURP-A02-9-599 (SEQ ID NO: 32) (e), #1 with HJURP-A02-9-386 (SEQ ID NO: 35) (f), #5 with HJURP-A02-10-405 (SEQ ID NO: 37) (g), #3 with HJURP-A02-10-128 (SEQ ID NO: 38) (h) and #6 with HJURP-A02-10-54 (SEQ ID NO: 43) (i).  On the other hand, no potent IFN-gamma production could be detected by stimulation with other peptides shown in Tables 3a and 3b, despite those peptides had possible binding activity with HLA-A*0201. As a typical case of negative data, a specific CTL response was not observed from peptide-pulsed target cells stimulated with HJURP-A02-9-150 (SEQ ID NO: 25)  (j).  As a result, 9 peptides derived from HJURP were identified as having the potential to induce potent CTLs.\n\n\n\n \nEstablishment of CTL lines and clones against HJURP derived peptides\n \n \n \nThe cells that showed peptide specific CTL activity detected by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay in the \nwell number #\n4 with HJURP-A02-9-496 (SEQ ID NO: 26) (a), in #4 with HJURP-A02-9-406 (SEQ ID NO: 30) (b), in #5 with HJURP-A02-9-129 (SEQ ID NO: 31) (c), in #5 with HJURP-A02-10-405 (SEQ ID NO: 37) (d) and in #3 with HJURP-A02-10-128 (SEQ ID NO: 38) (e) were expanded and CTL lines were established by limiting dilution as described in the \"Materials and Methods\" section above.  CTL activity of those CTL lines was determined by IFN-gamma ELISA assay (Figures 6a-e).  The CTL lines demonstrated potent IFN-gamma production against the target cells pulsed with the corresponding peptide as compared to target cells without peptide pulse.\n\n\n\n\n     Furthermore, the CTL clones were established by limiting dilution from the CTL line as described in \"Materials and Methods\", and IFN-gamma production from CTL clones against target cells pulsed peptide was determined by IFN-gamma ELISA assay.  Potent IFN-gamma production were determined from CTL clones stimulated with HJURP-A02-9-406 (SEQ ID NO: 30) (a), HJURP-A02-9-129 (SEQ ID NO: 31) (b), HJURP-A02-10-405 (SEQ ID NO: 37) (c) and HJURP-A02-10-128 (SEQ ID NO: 38) (d) (Figures 7a-d).\n\n\n\n \nSpecific CTL activity against target cells exogenously expressing HJURP and HLA-A*0201\n \n\n The established CTL lines and clones raised against the peptide were examined for the ability to recognize target cells that endogenously express HJURP and HLA-A*0201 molecule.  Specific CTL activity against COS7 cells which transfected with both the full length of HJURP and HLA-A*0201 molecule (a specific model for the target cells that endogenously express HJURP and HLA-A*0201 gene) were tested using the CTL clone raised by corresponding peptide as the effector cells.  COS7 cells transfected with either full length of HJURP genes or HLA-A*0201 were prepared as controls.  In Figure 8, the CTL clone stimulated with HJURP-A02-10-128 (SEQ ID NO: 38) showed potent CTL activity against COS7 cells expressing both HJURP and HLA- A*0201.  On the other hand, no significant specific CTL activity was detected against the controls.  Thus, these data clearly demonstrated that peptides of HJURP-A02-10-128 (SEQ ID NO: 38) was endogenously processed and expressed on the target cells with HLA-A*0201 molecule and were recognized by the CTLs.  These results indicate that this peptide derived from HJURP may be suitable as a cancer vaccine for the treatment of patients with HJURP expressing tumors.\n\n\n\n \nHomology analysis of antigen peptides\n \n \n \nThe CTLs stimulated with HJURP-A02-9-496 (SEQ ID NO: 26), HJURP-A02-9-354 (SEQ ID NO: 27), HJURP-A02-9-406 (SEQ ID NO: 30), HJURP-A02-9-129 (SEQ ID NO: 31), HJURP-A02-9-599 (SEQ ID NO: 32), HJURP-A02-9-386 (SEQ ID:35), HJURP-A02-10-405 (SEQ ID:37), HJURP-A02-10-128 (SEQ ID:38) and HJURP-A02-10-54 (SEQ ID NO: 43) showed significant and specific CTL activity.  This result may be due to the fact that the sequences of HJURP-A02-9-496 (SEQ ID NO: 26), HJURP-A02-9-354 (SEQ ID NO: 27), HJURP-A02-9-406 (SEQ ID NO: 30), HJURP-A02-9-129 (SEQ ID NO: 31), HJURP-A02-9-599 (SEQ ID NO: 32), HJURP-A02-9-386 (SEQ ID:35), HJURP-A02-10-405 (SEQ ID:37), HJURP-A02-10-128 (SEQ ID:38) and HJURP-A02-10-54 (SEQ ID NO: 43) are homologous to peptides derived from other molecules that are known to sensitize the human immune system.  To exclude this possibility, homology analyses were performed for these peptide sequences using as queries the BLAST algorithm (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi) which revealed no sequence with significant homology.  The results of homology analyses indicate that the sequences of HJURP-A02-9-496 (SEQ ID NO: 26), HJURP-A02-9-354 (SEQ ID NO: 27), HJURP-A02-9-406 (SEQ ID NO: 30), HJURP-A02-9-129 (SEQ ID NO: 31), HJURP-A02-9-599 (SEQ ID NO: 32), HJURP-A02-9-386 (SEQ ID:35), HJURP-A02-10-405 (SEQ ID:37), HJURP-A02-10-128 (SEQ ID:38) and HJURP-A02-10-54 (SEQ ID NO: 43) are unique and thus, there is little possibility, to our best knowledge, that these molecules raise unintended immunologic response to some unrelated molecule.\n\n     In conclusion, novel HLA-A*0201 epitope peptides derived from HJURP were identified. The results herein demonstrate that the epitope peptide of HJURP may be suitable for use in for cancer immunotherapy.\n\n\n\n \nIndustrial Applicability:\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides new TAAs, particularly those derived from HJURP that induce potent and specific anti-tumor immune responses and have applicability to a wide variety of cancer types.  Such TAAs can find use as peptide vaccines against diseases associated with HJURP, e.g., cancer, more particularly, AML, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, CML, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, Diffused-type gastric cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor and testicular tumor.\n\n\n\n\n     While the present invention is herein described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that the foregoing description is exemplary and explanatory in nature and is intended to illustrate the present invention and its preferred embodiments.  Through routine experimentation, one skilled in the art will readily recognize that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, the metes and bounds of which are defined by the appended claims."
