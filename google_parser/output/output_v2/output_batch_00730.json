A report of the International Diabetes Federation has it that the number of diabetes mellitus patients in the world is expected to explosively increase from the 246 million as of 2007 to 435 million in 2030. Diabetes\n \nmellitus, often simply referred to as diabetes, is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has high blood sugar, either because the body is not producing enough insulin or because cells are not responding to the insulin that is being produced. More than 90% of the diabetes patients suffer from \ntype\n 2 diabetes. Currently used therapeutic agents for diabetes include insulin agents, insulin secretion-promoting agents, agents for enhancing sensitivity to insulin, and glucose absorption inhibitors, the goal of which is to reduce blood sugar levels.  However, the drugs suffer from the disadvantages of causing hypoglycemia, weight gain, edema, and having negative effects on the digestive system and being insufficient in efficacy.  Such symptomatic treatment for reducing blood sugar levels cannot be expected to fundamentally cure diabetes because it cannot improve the function of the target beta cells. (Philippe J., Raccah D., \nInt J Clin Pract\n, 2009(63): 321-332).\n\n\n \n\n\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone which is secreted by L-cells when they are stimulated by abundant nutrients after meal.  This hormone is a kind of incretin hormones and is secreted, together with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), inducing glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (Baggio LL., Drucker DJ., \nGastroenterology\n, 2007(132):2131-2157). GLP-1 possesses physiological functions including increasing insulin secretion after meals, decreasing glucagon secretion, inhibiting gastric juice secretion, retarding gastric emptying in the stomach, lowering food intake, proliferating pancreatic beta cells, and suppressing the death of pancreatic beta cells (Abu-Hamdah R. et. al, \nJ Clin Endocrinol Metab\n, 2009(94): 1843-1852; KwonDY. et al., \nJ Pharmacol Sci\n, 2009(111): 361-371).  Insulin secretion-promoting agents, such as sulfonyl urea, have limitations in regards to regulating blood sugar due to their inability to regulate the abnormal secretion increase of glucagon and cause hypoglycemia due to glucose-independent insulin secretion whereas GLP-1 was found to have the function of regulating the secretion of both insulin and glucagon, promoting insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, and enhancing the proliferation, production and function of pancreatic beta cells as measured by pre-clinical animal testing (VilsbØll T., \nDiabetes Obes Metab\n, 2009(11):11-18; Kwon DY. et al., \nJ Pharmacol Sci\n, 2009(111):361-371).\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition, it was reported that repeat administration of exenatide for six weeks to insulin-resistant rats subjugated insulin resistance to some degree.  Hence, GLP-1 receptor activation is also expected to show anti-insulin resistance.  The direct mechanism of anti-insulin resistance of GLP-1 effectors still remains unclear, but is construed as being, in part, attributed to the secondary action resulting from appetite suppression and blood sugar reduction (Gedulin BR. et al., Endocrinology 2005(146):2069-2076).\n\n\n \n\n\nIncretin mimetics based on the activity of GLP-1 are arising as one of the most attractive targets for developing therapeutics for diabetes because they are anticipated to have the function of increasing insulin secretion, antagonizing insulin resistance, regulating blood sugar levels, and potentiating the function of beta cells.\n\n\n \n\n\nHowever, once in the circulation, GLP-1 has a half life of less than 2 minutes, due to rapid degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) (Kim W., Egan JM., Pharmacol Rev, 2008(60):470-512).  To overcome this disadvantage, many pharmaceutical companies have developed GLP-1 analogs which are not degraded by blood DPP4.  The first medication was exenatide (Byetta®) approved as single therapy for \ndiabetes mellitus type\n 2 by the FDA in 2005.  It was manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company.  \n\n\n \n\n\nLiraglutide (Victoza\n®\n) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog that has been developed by Novo Nordisk for the treatment of \ndiabetes mellitus type\n 2.  It was first commercialized in Europe in 2009, and then approved by the FDA in Jan. 2010.  Recently, the world`s leading pharmaceutical companies, such as GlaxoSmithKline and Roche, have reported the results of \nPhase\n 3 clinical trials and have conducted subsequent development processes.  However, the developed drugs are of peptides which are disadvantageous primarily in that the patient must subcutaneously inject themselves with the peptide drugs.  To overcome the inconvenience, pharmaceutical companies have made attempts to develop long-lasting Formulations such as those to be injected once a week, a month, etc.  Nonetheless, there still remains behind the burden of the drugs for the chronic disease being injections (Lovshin JA., Drucker DJ., \nNat Rev Endocrinol, \n2009(5):262-269).\n\n\n \n\n\nTo exert its physiological activity, GLP-1 binds to a GLP-1 receptor which is distributed throughout pancreatic beta-cells and the brain.  Structurally, the GLP-1 receptor belongs to class B of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), a subfamily characterized by a large N-terminal extracellular ligand binding domain that acts to regulate the affinity of ligands for the receptor (Dong M. et al., \nMol Endocrinol\n, 2008(22):1489-1499). Thus, it is very difficult to develop low-molecular weight ligands for this class receptor compared to those for other class GPCR, and there have been no reports of successfully developing such low-molecular weight ligands into drugs, so far (Hoare SR., \nDrug Discov Today\n, 2005(10):417-427). With GLP-1 stood in the spotlight of the art, research results of low-molecular weight ligands, although rare, have been reported.  Keen attention is expected to be paid to the low-molecular weight ligands.\n\n\n \n\n\nAccording to the research reports, the cyclobutane derivative Boc5 (Mw 1068) that has the same binding site as the endogenous ligand exhibited appetite suppression, weight loss and blood sugar reduction in both normal and hyperglycemic mice (Chen D. et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci\n, 2007(104):943-948;GuoJ. et al., \nPLoS ONE\n, 2008(3):e2982).  The quinoxaline derivative Compound-2, developed by Novo Nordisk, binds to a site different from that for the endogenous ligand to activate the ligand as well as to increase the binding of GLP-1 to the receptor.  Its mechanism is suggested to increase insulin release only at high glucose levels (Knudsen LB. et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci\n, 2007(104):937-942; Irwin N. et al., \nEur J Pharmacol\n, 2009, doi:10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.11.022).  Also, these two compounds were found to have different binding sites in the receptor as assayed by virtual molecular modeling of the GLP-1 receptor (Lin F., Wang R., \nJ Mol Model\n, 2009(15):53-65).  In recent, Lilly has reported a GLP-1 receptor full agonist having an EC\n50\n of 660 nM, opening the possibility of developing low-molecular weight drugs acting on the GLP-1 receptor (Kyle W. Sloop, \nDiabetes, \n2010(59):3099-3107).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide a novel quinoxaline derivative compound and a method for the preparation

Assay for Ability to Activate Human Glucagon Like \nPeptide\n 1 Receptor\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAn experiment was designed as follows.  When applied to the cells in which the human glucagon like peptide-1 receptor was transiently expressed, the compounds of the present invention activated the receptor so as to increase the level of cyclic adenosine-3`, 5`-monophosphate (cAMP), which thus stimulated the cAMP response element (CRE) to increase the activity of luciferase.  Thus, an increase of luciferase activity was evaluated as the ability of the compound to activate the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\nIn all of the following experiments, Below, 6,7-dichlroro-2-methylsulfonyl-3-N-tert-butylaminoquinoxaline of Novo Nordisk (\nCompound\n 2; GLP-1 agonist, BIOTREND Chemicals AG, Germany), known as a low-molecular weight compound able to activate the GLP-1 receptor, was used as a control (Knudsen LB. et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci\n, 2007(104):937-942).\n\n\n \n\n\nA human GLP-1 receptor expression vector (Origene, USA) was transiently transfected, together with a DNA construct, containing four copies of the cAMP-response element, capable of inducing the expression of firefly luciferase, and a DNA construct expressing renilla luciferase (Promega, USA), into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with the aid of Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen, USA).  After transfection of three hours, the medium was replaced with α-MEM (Minimum essential media; Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.  After incubation for six hrs, one volume of a dual luciferase assay reagent (Promega, USA) was added to the medium in which the cells were submerged while firefly luciferase and renilla luciferase activities were measured.  The renilla luciferase activity was used to modulate the efficiency of transfection.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention were tested at multiple concentrations.  Based on these multiple test results, a concentration showing 50% of the maximum effect of the positive control exenatide (American Peptide, USA) (EC\n50\n) was calculated using a non-linear regression analysis method.  Relative activity of each compound at a concentration of 1 μM to the maximum effect of the positive control is expressed as percentage in Table 1.\n\n\nOut of the compounds of Examples, as seen in Table 1, 71 compounds according to the present invention were found to range in EC\n50\n from 50 nM to 1,000 nM with superiority over Compound-2 of Novo Nordisk (2,506 nM).  The relative activity of these compounds at a concentration of 1 μM ranged from 40 to 100 % of that of the positive control.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExperimental Example 2: Assay for Selectivity for Human Glucagon Like Peptide-2 Receptor and Glucagon Receptor\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAn experiment was designed as follows.  When applied to the cells in which the human glucagon like peptide-2 receptor or the glucagon receptor, both belonging to the same family, was transiently expressed, the compounds of the present invention activated the receptor so as to increase the level of cyclic adenosine-3`, 5`-monophosphate (cAMP), which thus stimulated the cAMP response element (CRE) to increase the activity of luciferase.  Thus, an increase of luciferase activity was evaluated as the ability of the compound to activate the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe same procedure as in the assay for ability to activate human glucagon like \npeptide\n 1 receptor of Example 1 was repeated, with the exception that a human glucagon like peptide-2 receptor or glucagon receptor expression vector (Origene, USA) was transiently overexpressed, and glucagon like peptide-2 and glucagon (Sigma, USA) were used as positive controls.  The ability of each compound at a concentration of 3 μM to activate the glucagon like peptide-2 receptor or the glucagon receptor is expressed as percentage of the maximum reactivity of the positive controls in Table 1.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs is apparent from data of Table 1, most of the compounds suggested in the Examples exhibited no activities or only a low activity on the glucagon receptor and the glucagon like peptide-2 receptor. Hence, the compounds of Examples having excellent activity for the GLP-1 receptor were found to exhibit specific selectivity for the GLP-1 receptor over the two similar receptors.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExperimental Example 3: Assay for Insulin Secretion Using Rat Beta-Cell Line\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen the compounds of the present invention were applied to the rat beta-cell line (INS-1), the insulin secretion induced was evaluated as the activity of the compounds (enzyme immunoassay).\n\n\n \n\n\nKRBH (Krebs-Ringer Bicarabonate HEPES) buffer was prepared with reference to a previous publication (Hou ZQ. et al., \nMol Cell Endocrinol\n, 2008(291):71-78).  Insulin was quantitatively analyzed using a rat insulin enzyme immunoassay kit (Shibayagi, Japan; ALPCO, USA).  For quantitative protein assay, a BCA reagent (Pierce, USA) was used according to the protocol of the manufacturer`s.\n\n\nIn detail, rat beta-cells were incubated for one hour with glucose-free KRBH buffer to deplete nutrients.  To KRBH containing 11.1 mM glucose and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro-20-1724 (Calbiochem, USA) was added a compound with which the cells were then treated for 30 min.  A sample was taken from the supernatant and quantitatively measured for the insulin released from the beta-cells.  The cells were lysed and a portion taken from the cell lysate was quantitatively measured for protein.  The measured amount of insulin was corrected according to the amount of protein.  The ability of the compounds of the present invention is expressed as a percentage of the maximum effect of the positive control exenatide (American Peptide, USA) in Table 1.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs seen in Table 1, the compounds tested ranged in the relative insulin secretion activity from 0 to 80%.  Of them, the compound with selectivity for the GLP-1 receptor induced insulin secretion at a relative rate of from 20 to 80%, which is higher than Compound-2 of Novo Nordisk.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExperimental Example 4: Assay for Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion in Mice\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe glucose-stimulated insulin secretion activity of the compounds in seven-week old male mice (C57BL/6 mice) was evaluated as an index indicating anti-diabetes activity (enzyme immunoassay).\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental mice were starved for 16~17 hrs before experiments.  The compound of the present invention was orally administered 30 min before the injection of glucose. A glucose solution (1 g/kg/10 ml) was injected into the mice via the tail vein. Blood samples were taken from the intraorbital vein immediately before the injection of glucose and 1 and 5 min before the injection of glucose, and placed in heparinized tubes, followed by centrifugation. The plasma thus obtained were quantitatively analyzed for insulin using a mouse insulin analysis kit (Shibayagi, Japan). The results are shown in FIG. 1.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs Acute Insulin Response (AIR) values, mean values of the insulin concentrations secreted over a time period from 1 to 5 min after glucose administration were calculated (Winzell MS, \n, \nDiabetes\n, 2004(53):S215-219), and the results are shown in FIG. 2.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen the compound of Example 19 according to the present invention was orally administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg, as seen in FIG. 1, the insulin concentration was increased up to 2.9±0.5 ng/ml at 1 min after glucose injection, which was 1.6-fold greater than that of the control (1.6±0.2 ng/ml).  As is understood from data of FIG. 2, the acute insulin response of the compound was measured to be 2.3±0.2 ng/ml which was 1.6-fold greater than that of control (1.5±0.1 ng/ml).\n\n\nTable 1 \n \n \n
