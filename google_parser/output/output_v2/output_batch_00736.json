The invention also relates to the use of the innovative proteins in therapeutic applications to treat atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia and other cholesterol related diseases. The invention further relates to cells comprising such proteins, polynucleotides encoding such proteins or fragments thereof, and to vectors comprising the polynucleotides encoding the innovative proteins. \n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n\n [0003] Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries responsible for coronary heart disease (CHD) that underlies most deaths in industrialized countries (Lusis (2000)). Several risk factors for CHD have now been well established: dyslipidemias, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, poor diet, inactivity and stress. The most clinically relevant and common dyslipidemias are characterized by an increase in low density lipoprotein and very low density lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL) with \n\n\nhypercholesterolemia in the absence or presence of hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson et al. (1967)). An isolated elevation of LDL cholesterol is one of the most common risk factors for CHD. PCSK9 (also referred to as HCHOLA3, NARC-1, or FH3) is a protease belonging to the proteinase K subfamily of the secretory subtilase family (Naureckiene et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophy., 420:55-57 (2003)). PCSK9 has been shown to be a key regulator of cholesterol homeostasis and circulating low density lipoprotein levels. \n\n\nCirculating PCSK9 protein controls LDL metabolism by directly binding to the LDL receptor and promoting its degradation in hepatocytes. PCSK9-mediated down- \n\n regulation of LDL receptor protein and activity leads to reduced clearance of LDL from the circulation and higher LDL levels. Several mutant forms of PCSK9 are known, including S127R, 157K, F216L, R218S, and D374Y, with S127R, F216L, and D374Y being linked to autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH). It is believed that wild-type PCSK9 increases the turnover rate of the LDL receptor causing lower LDL clearance (Maxwell et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Set, 102(6):2069-2074 (2005); Benjannet et al. and Lalanne et al), while PCSK9 loss of function mutations result in increased levels of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), increased clearance of circulating LDL, and a corresponding decrease in plasma cholesterol levels (Rashid et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Set, 102(15):5374-5379 (2005)). As such, PCSK9 is a potential target for the treatment of atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia and other cholesterol related diseases. \n\n\n[0004] Fibronectin based scaffolds are a family of proteins capable of evolving to bind any compound of interest. These proteins, which generally make use of a scaffold derived from a fibronectin type III (Fn3) or Fn3-like domain, function in a manner characteristic of natural or engineered antibodies (that is, polyclonal, monoclonal, or single-chain antibodies) and, in addition, possess structural advantages. Specifically, the structure of these antibody mimics has been designed for optimal folding, stability, and solubility, even under conditions that normally lead to the loss of structure and function in antibodies. An example of fibronectin-based scaffold proteins is Adnectins (Adnexus, a Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D Company). \n\n\n [0005] Fibronectin type III (Fn3) domains comprise, in order from N-terminus to C- terminus, a beta or beta-like strand, A; a loop, AB; a beta or beta-like strand, B; a loop, BC; a beta or beta-like strand C; a loop CD; a beta or beta-like strand D; a loop DE; a beta or beta-like strand, E; a loop, EF; a beta or beta-like strand F; a loop FG; and a beta or beta-like strand G. Any or all of loops AB, BC, CD, DE, EF and FG may participate in target binding. The BC, DE, and FG loops are both structurally and functionally analogous to the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from immunoglobulins. U.S. Patent No. 7,1 15,396 describes Fn3 domain proteins wherein alterations to the BC, DE, and FG loops result in high affinity TNFa binders. U.S. Publication No. \n\n\n2007/0148126 describes Fn3 domain proteins wherein alterations to the BC, DE, and FG loops result in high affinity VEGFR2 binders. \n\n [0006] It would be advantageous to obtain improved fibronectin domain scaffold proteins that bind PCSK9 for the therapeutic treatment of atherosclerosis, \n\n\nhypercholesterolemia and other cholesterol related diseases. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n [0007] The application provides Adnectins against human PCSK9. One aspect of the invention provides for polypeptides comprising Fn3 domain in which one or more of the solvent accessible loops has been randomized or mutated. In some embodiments, the Fn3 domain is an Fn3 domain derived from the wild-type tenth module of the human fibronectin type III domain (\n10\nFn3). In some embodiments, the \n10\nFn3 polypeptide of the invention is at least 40%, 50%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, or 90% identical to the human \n10\nFn3 domain. \n\n\n [0008] In some embodiments, one or more loops selected from BC, DE, and FG may be extended or shortened in length relative to the corresponding human fibronectin loop. \n\n\n[0009] In some embodiments, the polypeptides of the invention comprise a tenth fibronectin type III (\n10\nFn3) domain, wherein the \n10\nFn3 domain comprises a loop, AB; a loop, BC; a loop, CD; a loop, DE; a loop EF; and a loop FG; and has at least one loop selected from loop BC, DE, and FG with an altered amino acid sequence relative to the sequence of the corresponding loop of the human \n10\nFn3 domain. \n\n\n[0010] In some embodiments, the polypeptide of the invention comprises an Fn3 domain that comprises an amino acid sequence at least 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, 99 or 100% identical to the non-loop regions. \n\n\n [0011] In some embodiments, the BC loop of the protein of the invention comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 2-17, 106- 135, and 301-303.

Polypeptides can include natural amino acids and non-natural amino acids such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 6,559,126, incorporated herein by reference. Polypeptides can also be modified in any of a variety of standard chemical ways (e.g., an amino acid can be modified with a protecting group; the carboxy-terminal amino acid can be made into a terminal amide group; the amino- terminal residue can be modified with groups to, e.g., enhance lipophilicity; or the polypeptide can be chemically glycosylated or otherwise modified to increase stability or in vivo half-life). Polypeptide modifications can include the attachment of another structure such as a cyclic compound or other molecule to the polypeptide and can also include polypeptides that contain one or more amino acids in an altered configuration (i.e., R or S; or, L or D). The peptides of the invention are proteins derived from the tenth type III domain of fibronectin that have been modified to bind specifically to PCSK9 and are referred to herein as, \"anti-PCSK9 Adnectin\" or \"PCSK9 Adnectin\". \n\n\n [0076] The term \"PK\" is an acronym for \"pharmacokinetic\" and encompasses properties of a compound including, by way of example, absorption, distribution, \n\n metabolism, and elimination by a subject. A \"PK modulation protein\" or \"PK moiety\" refers to any protein, peptide, or moiety that affects the pharmacokinetic properties of a biologically active molecule when fused to or administered together with the biologically active molecule. Examples of a PK modulation protein or PK moiety include PEG, human serum albumin (HSA) binders (as disclosed in U.S. Publication Nos. \n\n\n 2005/0287153 and 2007/0003549, PCT Publication Nos. WO 2009/083804 and WO 2009/133208, and SABA molecules as described herein), human serum albumin, Fc or Fc fragments and variants thereof, and sugars (e.g., sialic acid). \n\n\n [0077] \"Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity\" herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in a selected sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR®) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared. \n\n\n[0078] An \"isolated\" polypeptide is one that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of polypeptide as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing condition using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated polypeptide includes the polypeptide in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the polypeptide's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step. \n\n [0079] The notations \"mpk\", \"mg/kg\", or \"mg per kg\" refer to milligrams per kilogram. All notations are used interchangeably throughout the present disclosure. \n\n\n[0080] The \"half-life\" of an amino acid sequence or compound can generally be defined as the time taken for the serum concentration of the polypeptide to be reduced by 50%, in vivo, for example due to degradation of the sequence or compound and/or clearance or sequestration of the sequence or compound by natural mechanisms. The half- life can be determined in any manner known per se, such as by pharmacokinetic analysis. Suitable techniques will be clear to the person skilled in the art, and may for example generally involve the steps of suitably administering to the primate a suitable dose of the amino acid sequence or compound of the invention; collecting blood samples or other samples from said primate at regular intervals; determining the level or concentration of the amino acid sequence or compound of the invention in said blood sample; and calculating, from (a plot of) the data thus obtained, the time until the level or \n\n\nconcentration of the amino acid sequence or compound of the invention has been reduced by 50% compared to the initial level upon dosing. Reference is, for example, made to the standard handbooks, such as Kenneth, A. et al, Chemical Stability of Pharmaceuticals : A Handbook for Pharmacists and in Peters et al, Pharmacokinete Analysis: A Practical Approach (1996). Reference is also made to Gibaldi, M. et al, Pharmacokinetics, 2nd Rev. Edition, Marcel Dekker (1982). \n\n\n[0081] Half-life can be expressed using parameters such as the ti\n/2\n-alpha, ti\n/2\n-beta, HL Lambda z, and the area under the curve (AUC). In the present specification, an \"increase in half-life\" refers to an increase in any one of these parameters, any two of these parameters, any three of these parameters or all four of these parameters. An \"increase in half-life\" in particular refers to an increase in the ti/2-beta and/or \n\n\nHL_Lambda_z, either with or without an increase in the ti/2-alpha and/or the AUC or both. \n\n\nOverview \n\n\n [0082] This application provides Adnectins against human PCSK9. In order to identify PCSK9 specific antagonists, PCSK9 was presented to large synthetic libraries of Adnectins. Adnectins that bound to PCSK9 were screened for PCSK9 binding, for biophysical properties, and for PCSK9 inhibitory activity. The anti-PCSK9 Adnectins \n\n were mutated and subjected to further selective pressure by lowering the target concentration and selecting for anti-PCSK9 Adnectins with slow off-rates. From this optimization process, a family of Adnectins was identified as PCSK9 specific inhibitors with favorable biochemical and biophysical properties. \n\n\nFibronectin Based Scaffolds \n\n\n [0083] One aspect of the application provides for polypeptides comprising Fn3 domain in which one or more of the solvent accessible loops has been randomized or mutated. In some embodiments, the Fn3 domain is an Fn3 domain derived from the wild- type tenth module of the human fibronectin type III domain (\n10\nFn3): \n\n\n VSDVPRDLEVVAATPTSLLISWDAPAVTVRYYRITYGETGGNSPVOEFTVPGSKS TATISGLKPGVDYTITVYAVTGRGDSPASSKPISINYRT (SEQ ID NO: 1). In the \n10\nFn3 sequence, the BC, DE and FG loops are underlined. \n\n\n [0084] As described herein, non-ligand binding sequences of \n10\nFn3, .e., the \"\n10\nFn3 scaffold\", may be altered provided that the \n10\nFn3 retains ligand binding function and/or structural stability. A variety of mutant \n10\nFn3 scaffolds have been reported. In one aspect, one or more of Asp 7, Glu 9, and Asp 23 is replaced by another amino acid, such as, for example, a non-negatively charged amino acid residue (e.g., Asn, Lys, etc.). These mutations have been reported to have the effect of promoting greater stability of the mutant \n10\nFn3 at neutral pH as compared to the wild-type form (See, PCT Publication No. WO 02/04523). A variety of additional alterations in the \n10\nFn3 scaffold that are either beneficial or neutral have been disclosed. See, for example, Batori et al, Protein Eng., 15(12): 1015-1020 (Dec. 2002); Koide et al, Biochemistry, 40(34): 10326-10333 (Aug. 28, 2001). \n\n\n[0085] Both variant and wild-type \n10\nFn3 proteins are characterized by the same structure, namely seven beta-strand domain sequences designated A through G and six loop regions (AB loop, BC loop, CD loop, DE loop, EF loop, and FG loop) which connect the seven beta-strand domain sequences. The beta strands positioned closest to the N- and C-termini may adopt a beta-like conformation in solution. In SEQ ID NO: 1, the AB loop corresponds to residues 15-16, the BC loop corresponds to residues 21-30, the CD loop corresponds to residues 39-45, the DE loop corresponds to residues 51-56, \n\n the EF loop corresponds to residues 60-66, and the FG loop corresponds to residues 76- 87 (Xu et al, Chemistry & Biology, 9:933-942 (2002)). \n\n\n [0086] In some embodiments, the \n10\nFn3 polypeptide may be at least 40%, 50%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, or 90% identical to the human \n10\nFn3 domain, shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. Much of the variability will generally occur in one or more of the loops. Each of the beta or beta-like strands of a \n10\nFn3 polypeptide may consist essentially of an amino acid sequence that is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100% identical to the sequence of a corresponding beta or beta-like strand of SEQ ID NO: 1, provided that such variation does not disrupt the stability of the polypeptide in physiological conditions. \n\n\n[0087] In some embodiments, the disclosure provides polypeptides comprising a tenth fibronectin type III (\n10\nFn3) domain, wherein the \n10\nFn3 domain comprises a loop, AB; a loop, BC; a loop, CD; a loop, DE; a loop EF; and a loop FG; and has at least one loop selected from loop BC, DE, and FG with an altered amino acid sequence relative to the sequence of the corresponding loop of the human \n10\nFn3 domain. In some \n\n\nembodiments, the BC and FG loops are altered, and in some embodiments, the BC, DE, and FG loops are altered, i.e., the Fn3 domains comprise non-naturally occurring loops. In some embodiments, the AB, CD and/or the EF loops are altered. By \"altered\" is meant one or more amino acid sequence alterations relative to a template sequence \n\n\n(corresponding human fibronectin domain) and includes amino acid additions, deletions, and substitutions. Altering an amino acid sequence may be accomplished through intentional, blind, or spontaneous sequence variation, generally of a nucleic acid coding sequence, and may occur by any technique, for example, PCR, error-prone PCR, or chemical DNA synthesis. \n\n\n [0088] In some embodiments, one or more loops selected from BC, DE, and FG may be extended or shortened in length relative to the corresponding human fibronectin loop. In some embodiments, the length of the loop may be extended by 2-25 amino acids. In some embodiments, the length of the loop may be decreased by 1-11 amino acids. To optimize antigen binding, therefore, the length of a loop of \n10\nFn3 may be altered in length as well as in sequence to obtain the greatest possible flexibility and affinity in antigen binding. \n\n\n [0089] In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises a Fn3 domain that comprises an amino acid sequence at least 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, 99 or 100% identical to the \n\n non-loop regions of SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein at least one loop selected from BC, DE, and FG is altered. In some embodiments, the altered BC loop has up to 10 amino acid substitutions, up to 4 amino acid deletions, up to 10 amino acid insertions, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the altered DE loop has up to 6 amino acid substitutions, up to 4 amino acid deletions, up to 13 amino acid insertions or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the FG loop has up to 12 amino acid substitutions, up to 1 1 amino acid deletions, up to 25 amino acid insertions or a combination thereof. \n\n\n [0090] As described above, amino acid residues corresponding to residues 21-30, 51- 56, and 76-87 of SEQ ID NO: 1 define the BC, DE, and FG loops, respectively. \n\n\n However, it should be understood that not every residue within the loop region needs to be modified in order to achieve a \n10\nFn3 binder having strong affinity for a desired target (e.g., PCSK9). \n\n\n [0091] For example, residues 21 (S) and 22 (W) of the BC loop as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 do not need to be modified for binding PCSK9. That is, \n10\nFn3 domains with high affinity binding to PCSK9 may be obtained by modifying only residues 23-30 of loop BC as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. This is demonstrated in the BC loops exemplified in Table 3, which indicates that only the residues spanning the shaded positions were altered. \n\n\nTherefore, in some embodiments, a BC loop according to this designation comprises the shaded portion of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 2-17, 106-135, and 301-303 as shown in Table 3. For example, in one embodiment, a BC loop may comprise the sequence PPPSHGYG (residues 3-10 of SEQ ID NO: 2), DAPAHAYG (residues 3-10 of SEQ ID NO: 5), EPFSRLPGGGE (residues 3-13 of SEQ ID NO: 106), or DAPADGGYG \n\n\n(residues 3-11 of SEQ ID NO: 107). \n\n\n[0092] Similarly, positions 51 (P) and 56 (T) of loop DE as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 do not need to be modified for binding PCSK9. That is, \n10\nFn3 domains with high affinity binding to PCSK9 may be obtained by modifying only residues 52-55 of loop DE as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. This is demonstrated in the DE loops exemplified in Table 3, which indicates that only the residues spanning the shaded positions were altered. \n\n\nTherefore, in some embodiments, a DE loop according to this designation comprises the shaded portion of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 18-27 and 136-141, as shown in Table 3. For example, in one embodiment, a DE loop may comprise the sequence PGKG (residues 2-5 \n\n of SEQ ID NO: 18), VGVG (residues 2-5 SEQ ID NO: 27), or VSKS (residues 2-5 of SEQ ID NO: 137). \n\n\n [0093] Likewise, position 87 (P) of the FG loop as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 does not need to be modified for binding PCSK9. That is, \n10\nFn3 domains with high affinity binding to PCSK9 may be obtained by modifying only residues 76-86 of the FG loop as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. This is demonstrated in the FG loops exemplified in Table 3, which indicates that only the residues spanning the shaded positions were altered. \n\n\nTherefore, in some embodiments, an FG loop according to this designation comprises the shaded portion of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 28-38 and 142- 172, as shown in Table 3. For example, in one embodiment, an FG loop may comprise the sequence \n\n\n EYPYKHSGYYHR (residues 1 - 12 in SEQ ID NO: 28), EYPYDYSGYYHR (residues 1- 12 in SEQ ID NO: 142), or EFDFVGAGYYHR (residues 1 - 12 in SEQ ID NO: 167). \n\n\n[0094] In some embodiments, the present application demonstrates that the BC, DE, and FG loop regions can be generally described according to consensus sequences. For example, the BC loop can be generally defined by the consensus sequence SW(Xi)z 2G (SEQ ID NO: 323) where Xi is any amino acid, Z is a number from 6-9, and X\n2\n is Y or H. This consensus sequence is exemplified by BC loops shown in Table 3 except for the BC loop defined by SEQ ID NO: 106. In other embodiments, Z is a number selected from 2- 5. In certain embodiments, Z is a number selected from 10- 15. In some embodiments, X\n2\n is any aromatic residue (i.e., Y, F, W, or H). \n\n\n [0095] In another embodiment, the DE loop can be generally defined by the consensus sequence PX1X1X1X3T, (SEQ ID NO: 324) where Xi is any amino acid and X3 is G or S. This consensus is exemplified by the DE loops shown in Table 3. \n\n\n[0096] In another embodiment, the FG loop can be generally defined by the consensus sequence EX\n4\nX\n1\nX\n5\nX\n1\nX\n1\nX\n6\nGYX\n4\nHRP (SEQ ID NO: 325), where Xi is any amino acid; X\n4\n is Y or F; X\n5\n is Y, F, or W; and Xe is S or A. In certain embodiments, X\n4\n and X5 are aromatic residues, each independently selected from Y, F, W, or H. This consensus is exemplified by the FG loops shown in Table 3. \n\n\n[0097] Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides a PCSK9 binding Adnectin comprising a BC loop having the sequence SW(Xi)zX\n2\nG (SEQ ID NO: 323), a DE loop having the sequence PX\n1\nX\n1\nX\n1\nX\n3\nT (SEQ ID NO: 324), and an \n\n FG loop having the sequence EX4X1X5X1X1X6GYX4HRP (SEQ ID NO: 325), as defined above. \n\n\n [0098] In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a PCSK9 binding Adnectin comprising a BC loop having the sequence SWEPFSRLPGGGE (SEQ ID NO: 106), a DE loop having the sequence PX1X1X1X3T (SEQ ID NO: 324), and an FG loop having the sequence EX4X1X5X1X1X\n6\nGYX4HRP (SEQ ID NO: 325), as defined above. \n\n\n[0099] In certain embodiments, a BC loop can be generally defined by the consensus sequence (Xi)zX2G (SEQ ID NO: 449) where Xi is any amino acid, Z is a number from 6-9, and X2 is Y or H. This consensus sequence is exemplified by BC loops shown in Table 3 except for the BC loop defined by SEQ ID NO: 106. In other embodiments, Z is a number selected from 2-5. In certain embodiments, Z is a number selected from 10- 15. In some embodiments, X2 is any aromatic residue (i.e., Y, F, W, or H). \n\n\n[00100] In certain embodiments, the DE loop can be generally defined by the consensus sequence X1X1X1X\n3\n, (SEQ ID NO: 450) where Xi is any amino acid and X\n3\n is G or S. This consensus is demonstrated by the DE loops shown in Table 3. \n\n\n [00101] In certain embodiments, the FG loop can be generally defined by the consensus sequence EX4X1X5X1X1X6GYX4HR (SEQ ID NO: 451), where Xi is any amino acid; X4 is Y or F; X\n5\n is Y, F, or W; and Xe is S or A. In some embodiments, X4 and X5 are aromatic residues, each independently selected from Y, F, W, or H. This consensus is exemplified by the FG loops shown in Table 3. \n\n\n [00102] Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a PCSK9 binding Adnectin having a BC loop comprising the sequence (Xi)zX2G (SEQ ID NO: 449), a DE loop comprising the sequence X1X1X1X\n3\n (SEQ ID NO: 450), and an FG loop comprising the sequence EX4X1X5X1X1X\n6\nGYX4HR (SEQ ID NO: 451), as defined above. \n\n\n [00103] In certain embodiments, antibody-like proteins based on the \n10\nFn3 scaffold can be defined generally by the following sequence: \n\n\nEVVAAT(X)\na\nSLLI(X)\nx\nYYRITYGE(X)\n6\nQEFTV(X)\n};\nATI(X)\nc\nDYTITVYAV(X)\nz\nISrNYR T (SEQ ID NO:328) \n\n [00104] In SEQ ID NO:328, the AB loop is represented by X\na\n, the CD loop is represented by Xb, the EF loop is represented by X\nc\n, the BC loop is represented by X\nx\n, the DE loop is represented by X\ny\n, and the FG loop is represented by X\nz\n.

In other embodiments, the FG loop of the protein of the invention comprises the shaded portion of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 28-38 and 142-172 as shown in Table 3. For example, in one embodiment, an FG loop comprises the sequence EYPYKHSGYYHR (residues 1-12 in SEQ ID NO: 28), \n\n\nEYPYDYSGYYHR (residues 1-12 in SEQ ID NO: 142), or EFDFVGAGYYHR \n\n\n(residues 1-12 in SEQ ID NO: 167). \n\n\n [00112] In some embodiments, the protein of the invention comprises one BC loop sequence selected from the BC loop sequences having SEQ ID NOs: 2-17, 106-135, and 301-303, or the shaded portion of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 2-17, 106-135, and 301-303, as shown in Table 3; one DE loop sequence selected from the DE loop sequences having SEQ ID NOs: 18-27 and 136-141, or the shaded portion of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 18-27 and 136-141 as shown in Table 3; and one FG loop sequence selected from the FG loop sequences having SEQ ID NOS: 28-38 and 142-172, or the shaded portion of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 28-38 and 142-172 as shown in Table 3. In some embodiments, the protein of the invention comprises a BC, DE and FG loop amino acid sequence at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, 99 or 100% identical to of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 2-38, 106- 172, 301-303. In other embodiments, the protein of the invention comprises a BC, DE and FG loop amino acid sequence at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, 99 or 100% identical to the shaded portion of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 2-38, 106-172, 301-303 as shown in Table 3. \n\n\n [00113] In some embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin comprises the amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 39-76, 173-290, and 304-309. In some embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin comprises the Fn3 domain amino acid sequence from position 3-96 of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 39-76, 173-290, and 304-309. In some embodiments, the anti- PCSK9 Adnectin comprises an amino acid sequence at least 70, \n\n 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, 99 or 100% identical to any one of SEQ ID NOS:39-76, 173-290, and 304-309. \n\n\n [00114] Fibronectin naturally binds certain types of integrins through its integrin- binding motif, \"arginine-glycine-aspartic acid\" (RGD). In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises a \n10\nFn3 domain that lacks the (RGD) integrin binding motif. The integrin binding domain may be removed by altering the RGD sequence by amino acid substitution, deletion or insertion. \n\n\n [00115] In certain embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin molecules of the present invention may be modified to comprise an N-terminal extension sequence and/or a C- terminal extension. For example, an MG sequence may be placed at the N-terminus of the \n10\nFn3 defined by SEQ ID NO: 1. The M will usually be cleaved off, leaving a G at the N-terminus. Alternatively, the first 10 amino acids of the anti-PCSK9 Adnectins shown in Table 4 may be replaced with an alternative N-terminal sequence, referred to herein as N-terminal extensions, as shown in Table 6 (i.e., SEQ ID NOs: 371-379). In addition, an M, G or MG may also be placed N-terminal to any of the N-terminal extensions having SEQ ID NOs: 371-379. The anti-PCSK9 Adnectins described herein may also comprise alternative C-terminal tail sequences, referred to herein as C-terminal extension sequences. For example, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin sequences shown in Table 4 may be truncated at the threonine corresponding to T94 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (i.e., truncated after the INYRT (SEQ ID NO: 636) portion of the sequence). Such truncated version may be used as therapeutic molecules in the truncated form, or alternative C- terminal extensions may be added after the threonine residue. Exemplary C-terminal extension sequences are shown in Table 6 as SEQ ID NOs: 380-395. Exemplary anti- PCSK9 Adnectins comprising C-terminal extension sequences are shown in Table 4. For example, SEQ ID NO: 49 (clone 1813E02) comprises the naturally occurring C-terminal extension EIDKPSQ (SEQ ID NO: 380) followed by a His6 tag (SEQ ID NO: 637). However, it should be understood that the His6 tag is completely optional. \n\n\n[00116] In certain embodiments, the C-terminal extension sequences (also called \"tails\"), comprise E and D residues, and may be between 8 and 50, 10 and 30, 10 and 20, 5 and 10, and 2 and 4 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, tail sequences include ED-based linkers in which the sequence comprises tandem repeats of ED. In exemplary embodiments, the tail sequence comprises 2-10, 2-7, 2-5, 3-10, 3-7, 3-5, 3, 4 \n\n or 5 ED repeats. In certain embodiments, the ED-based tail sequences may also include additional amino acid residues, such as, for example: EI (SEQ ID NO: 385), EID, ES, EC, EGS, and EGC. Such sequences are based, in part, on known Adnectin tail sequences, such as EIDKPSQ (SEQ ID NO: 380), in which residues D and K have been removed. In exemplary embodiments, the ED-based tail comprises an E, I or EI (SEQ ID NO: 385) residues before the ED repeats. \n\n\n [00117] In other embodiments, the N- or C-terminal sequences may be combined with other known linker sequences (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 396-419 in Table 6) as necessary when designing an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin fusion molecule. Exemplary anti-PCSK9 Adnectin comprising linker sequences are shown in Table 4 (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 53, 55, and 57). In some embodiments, sequences may be placed at the C-terminus of the \n10\nFn3 domain to facilitate attachment of a pharmacokinetic moiety. For example, a cysteine containing linker such as GSGC (SEQ ID NO:77) may be added to the C-terminus to facilitate site directed PEGylation on the cysteine residue. \n\n\nPharmacokinetic Moieties \n\n\n [00118] In one aspect, the application provides for anti-PCSK9 Adnectins further comprising a pharmacokinetic (PK) moiety. Improved pharmacokinetics may be assessed according to the perceived therapeutic need. Often it is desirable to increase \n\n\nbioavailability and/or increase the time between doses, possibly by increasing the time that a protein remains available in the serum after dosing. In some instances, it is desirable to improve the continuity of the serum concentration of the protein over time (e.g., decrease the difference in serum concentration of the protein shortly after administration and shortly before the next administration). The anti-PCSK9 Adnectin may be attached to a moiety that reduces the clearance rate of the polypeptide in a mammal (e.g. , mouse, rat, or human) by greater than three-fold relative to the unmodified anti-PCSK9 Adnectin. Other measures of improved pharmacokinetics may include serum half-life, which is often divided into an alpha phase and a beta phase. Either or both phases may be improved significantly by addition of an appropriate moiety. \n\n\n[00119] Moieties that tend to slow clearance of a protein from the blood, herein referred to as \"PK moieties\", include polyoxyalkylene moieties, e.g., polyethylene glycol, sugars (e.g., sialic acid), and well-tolerated protein moieties (e.g., Fc and fragments and \n\n variants thereof, transferrin, or serum albumin). The anti-PCSK9 Adnectin may be fused to albumin or a fragment (portion) or variant of albumin as described in U.S. Publication No. 2007/0048282. In some embodiments, the PCSK9 Adnectin may be fused to one or more serum albumin binding Adnectin, as described herein. \n\n\n[00120] In some embodiments, the PK moiety is a serum albumin binding protein such as those described in U.S. Publication Nos. 2007/0178082 and 2007/0269422. \n\n\n[00121] In some embodiments, the PK moiety is a serum immunoglobulin binding protein such as those described in U.S. Publication No. 2007/0178082 \n\n\n[00122] In some embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin comprises polyethylene glycol (PEG). One or more PEG molecules may be attached at different positions on the protein, and such attachment may be achieved by reaction with amines, thiols or other suitable reactive groups. The amine moiety may be, for example, a primary amine found at the N-terminus of a polypeptide or an amine group present in an amino acid, such as lysine or arginine. In some embodiments, the PEG moiety is attached at a position on the polypeptide selected from the group consisting of: a) the N-terminus; b) between the N- terminus and the most N-terminal beta strand or beta-like strand; c) a loop positioned on a face of the polypeptide opposite the target-binding site; d) between the C-terminus and the most C-terminal beta strand or beta-like strand; and e) at the C-terminus. \n\n\n[00123] Pegylation may be achieved by site-directed pegylation, wherein a suitable reactive group is introduced into the protein to create a site where pegylation \n\n\npreferentially occurs. In some embodiments, the protein is modified to introduce a cysteine residue at a desired position, permitting site directed pegylation on the cysteine. PEG may vary widely in molecular weight and may be branched or linear. In one embodiment the PEG has two branches. In another embodiment the PEG has four branches. \n\n\n [00124] In some embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin is fused to an \n\n\nimmunoglobulin Fc domain, or a fragment or variant thereof. In an exemplary embodiment, the Fc domain is derived from an IgGl subclass, however, other subclasses (e.g., IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) may also be used. Shown below is the sequence of a human IgGl immunoglobulin Fc domain, and the relative position of each region within the Fc domain are indicated based on the EU numbering format: \n\n ASTKGPSVFPLAPSSKSTSGGTAALGCLVKDYFPEPVTVSWNSGALTSGVHTFPA VLQS SGLYSLSSWTVPSSSLGTOTYICNVNHKPSNTKVDKKVEPKSCDKTKTC??C?A?E GGPSVFLFPPKPKDTLMISRTPEVTCVVVDVSHEDPEVKFNWYVDGVEVHNAKT KPREEQYNSTYRVVSVLTVLHQDWLNGKEYKCKVSNKALPAPIEKTISKAKGQP REPQVYTLPPSRDELTKNQVSLTCLVKGFYPSDIAVEWESNGQPENNYKTTPPVL DSDGSFFLYSKLTVDKSRWQQGNVFSCSVMHEALHNHYTQKSLSLSPGK (SEQ ID NO: 315) \n\n\nThe core hinge sequence is underlined, and the CHI region is italicized; the CH2 and CH3 regions are in regular text. It should be understood that the C-terminal lysine is optional. \n\n\n[00125] The fusion may be formed by attaching an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin to either end of the Fc molecule, i.e., Fc-anti-PCSK9 Adnectin or anti-PCSK9 Adnectin-Fc arrangements. In certain embodiments, the Fc and anti-PCSK9 Adnectin are fused via a linker. Exemplary linker sequences include AGGGGSG (SEQ ID NO: 310), \n\n\nGSGSGSGSGSGS (SEQ ID NO: 31 1), QPDEPGGS (SEQ ID NO: 312), \n\n\nELQLEESAAEAQDGELD (SEQ ID NO: 313), TVAAPS (SEQ ID NO: 314), \n\n\nKAGGGGSG (SEQ ID NO: 620), KGSGSGSGSGSGS (SEQ ID NO: 621), \n\n\nKQPDEPGGS (SEQ ID NO: 622), KELQLEESAAEAQDGELD (SEQ ID NO: 623), KTVAAPS (SEQ ID NO: 624), KAGGGGSGG (SEQ ID NO: 625), \n\n\nKGSGSGSGSGSGSG (SEQ ID NO: 626), KQPDEPGGSG (SEQ ID NO: 627), KELQLEESAAEAQDGELDG (SEQ ID NO: 628), KTVAAPSG (SEQ ID NO: 629) AGGGGSGG (SEQ ID NO: 630), GSGSGSGSGSGSG (SEQ ID NO: 631), \n\n\nQPDEPGGSG (SEQ ID NO: 632), ELQLEESAAEAQDGELDG (SEQ ID NO: 633), and TVAAPSG (SEQ ID NO: 634). \n\n\n [00126] In some embodiments, the Fc region used in the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin fusion comprises the hinge region of an Fc molecule. As used herein, the \"hinge\" region comprises the core hinge residues spanning positions 104-119 of SEQ ID NO: 315 (DKTHTCPPCPAPELLG; SEQ ID NO: 316) of IgGl, which corresponds to positions\n\n\n221-236 according to EU numbering. In certain embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin- Fc fusion adopts a multimeric structure (e.g., dimer) owing, in part, to the cysteine \n\n residues at positions 109 and 1 12 of SEQ ID NO: 315 (EU numbering 226 and 229, respectively) within the hinge region. In other embodiments, the hinge region as used herein, may further include residues derived from the CHI and CH2 regions that flank the core hinge sequence, as shown in SEQ ID NO: 315. \n\n\n[00127] In some embodiments, the hinge sequence, may include substitutions that confer desirable pharmacokinetic, biophysical, and/or biological properties. Some exemplary hinge sequences include EPKSSDKTHTCPPCPAPELLGGPS (SEQ ID NO: 317; core hinge region underlined), EPKSSDKTHTCPPCPAPELLGGSS (SEQ ID NO: 318; core hinge region underlined), EPKSSGSTHTCPPCPAPELLGGSS (SEQ ID NO: 319; core hinge region underlined), DKTHTCPPCPAPELLGGPS (SEQ ID NO: 320; core hinge region underlined), and DKTHTCPPCPAPELLGGSS (SEQ ID NO: 321, core hinge region underlined). In one embodiment, the residue P at position 122 (EU numbering 238) of SEQ ID NO: 315 has been replaced with S to ablate Fc effector function; this replacement is exemplified in hinges having any one of SEQ ID NOs: 318, 319, and 321. In another embodiment, the residues DK at positions 104-105 of SEQ ID NO: 315 (EU numbering 221-222) have been replaced with GS to remove a potential clip site; this replacement is exemplified in SEQ ID NO: 319. In another embodiment, the C at position 103 of SEQ ID NO: 315 (EU numbering 220) has been replaced with S to prevent improper cystine bond formation in the absence of a light chain; this replacement is exemplified in SEQ ID NOs: 317-319. \n\n\n [00128] In certain embodiments, an antiPCSK9 Adnectin - Fc fusion may have the following configurations: 1) anti-PCSK9 Adnectin-hinge-Fc or 2) hinge-Fc-anti-PCSK9 Adnectin. Therefore, any anti-PCSK9 Adnectin of the present invention can be fused to an Fc region comprising a hinge sequence according to these configurations. In some embodiments, a linker may be used to join the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin to the hinge-Fc moiety, for example, an exemplary fusion protein may have the configuration hinge-anti- PCSK9 Adnectin-linker-Fc. Additionally, depending on the system in which the fusion polypeptide is produced, a leader sequence may placed at the N-terminus of the fusion polypeptide. For example, if the fusion is produced in a mammalian system, a leader sequence such as METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTG (SEQ ID NO: 326) may be added to the N-terminus of the fusion molecule. If the fusion is produced in E. coli, the fusion sequence will be preceded by a methionine. \n\n [00129] The following sequence exemplifies an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin-hinge-Fc construct produced in a mammalian system: \n\n\n METOTLLLWYLLLWVYGSTGGVSDVPRDLEVVAATPTSLLISWVPPSDDYGYYRIT YGETGGNSP VQEFTVPIGKGTA TISGLKPG VD YTITVYA VEFP WPHAGYYHRPISINYR T \n\n\n£7EPKSSGSTHTCPPCPAPELLGGSSVFLFPPKPKDTLMISRTPEVTCVVVDVSHED PEVKFNWYVDGVEVHNAKTKPREEQY STYRVVSVLTVLHQDWLNGKEYKCK VSNKALPAPIEKTISKAKGQPREPQVYTLPPSRDELTKNQVSLTCLVKGFYPSDIA VEWESNGQPE YKTTPPVLDSDGSFFLYSKLTVDKSRWQQGNVFSCSVMHEAL HNHYTQKSLSLSPGK (SEQ ID NO: 322).

It should be understood that the lysine at the end of SEQ ID NO: 322 is optional.

In some embodiments, the Fn3 domain is a \n10\nFn3 domain. In some embodiments, the PK moiety increases the serum half-life of the polypeptide by more than 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 150, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000% or more relative to the Fn3 domain alone. \n\n\n [00132] In some embodiments, the PK moiety is a polymeric sugar. In some embodiments, the PK moiety is a polyethylene glycol moiety. In some embodiments the PK moiety is a serum albumin binding protein. In some embodiments the PK moiety is human serum albumin. In some embodiments the PK moiety is a serum immunoglobulin binding protein. In some embodiments, the PK moiety is transferrin. \n\n\n[00133] In some embodiments the PK moiety is another Adnectin specific for a serum protein, e.g., HSA. The present application provides specific serum albumin binding Adnectin molecules (or SABA), as described herein. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 Adnectin fused to a SABA can be defined generally as follows: Xi-PCSK9 Adnectin core-X\n2\n-X\n3\n-X\n4\n-SABA core-X\n5\n (SEQ ID NO: 618), or Xj-SABA core-X\n2\n-X\n3\n-X\n4\n- PCSK9 Adnectin core-Xs (SEQ ID NO: 619)\n,\n wherein Xi and X\n4\n represent optional N-terminal \n\n extension sequences, X2 and X5 represent optional C-terminal extension sequences, and X\n3\n is a linker. In one embodiment, the Adnectins (either PCSK9 or serum albumin binding) of SEQ ID NOs: 618 and 619 comprise the \"core\" region of Adnectin, i.e., a PCSK9 Adnectin core sequence may be any one of the PCSK9 Adnectin sequences shown in Table 4, wherein the sequence begins at the amino acid residue corresponding to E8 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and ends at the amino acid corresponding to residue T94 of SEQ ID NO: l ; and a SABA core sequence may be selected from any of the SABA core sequences shown in Table 6. \n\n\n [00134] In some embodiments, Xi and X\n4\n are independently optional, and when present are independently selected from SEQ ID NOs: 371-379 listed in Table 6, and may optionally comprise an M, G or MG sequence at the N-terminus when such residues are not already present. For expression in a mammalian system, the fusion proteins may further comprise a leader sequence at the N-terminus, such as \n\n\n METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTG (SEQ ID NO: 326). In some embodiments, X\n2\n and X\n5\n are independently optional, and when present are independently selected from SEQ ID NOs: 380-395 listed in Table 6. In certain embodiments, X\n3\n is a linker sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: 396-419 listed in Table 6. The sequences shown in Table 2 represent exemplary fusions of anti-PCSK9 Adnectin and SABA. It should be understood that any PCSK9 Adnectin and SABA sequence described in the present application may be incorporated into these configurations. \n\n\nTable 2 \n\n\n Exemplary PCSK9 Adnectin - SABA Fusion Sequences \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiophysical and Biochemical Characterization \n\n\n [00135] The application provides Adnectin comprising a Fn3 domain that binds to PCSK9. Polypeptide binding to a target molecule may be assessed in terms of equilibrium constants (e.g., dissociation, K\nD\n) and in terms of kinetic constants (e.g., on- rate constant, K\non\n and off-rate constant, k\ncff\n). An Adnectin will generally bind to a target molecule with a K\nD\n of less than 500 nM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 500 pM, 200 pM, 100 pM, although higher K\nD\n values may be tolerated where the K\ncff\n is sufficiently low or the K\non\n, is sufficiently high. \n\n\n [00136] The SEQ ID NOS of the BC, DE and FG loops of the anti-PCSK9 Adnectins of the invention are presented in Table 3.

anti-PCSK9 Adnectins of the invention are presented in Table 5. \n\n\nTable 5 \n\n\n Anti-PC SK9 Adnectin Family Cysteine Mutants to Enable Pegylation \n\n\n *Note: Some proteins listed have not yet

Proteins that have been pegylated are indicated by asterisk. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNucleic Acid-Protein Fusion Technology \n\n\n [00139] In one aspect, the application provides an Adnectin comprising fibronectin type III domains that binds PCSK9. One way to rapidly make and test Fn3 domains with specific binding properties is the nucleic acid-protein fusion technology of Adnexus, a Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D Company. This disclosure utilizes the in vitro expression and tagging technology, termed PROfusion' which exploits nucleic acid-protein fusions (RNA- and DNA- protein fusions) to identify novel polypeptides and amino acid motifs that are important for binding to proteins. Nucleic acid-protein fusion technology is a technology that covalently couples a protein to its encoding genetic information. For a detailed description of the RNA-protein fusion technology and fibronectin-based scaffold protein library screening methods see Szostak et al, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,258,558, \n\n\n6,261,804, 6,214,553, 6,281,344, 6,207,446, 6,518,018 and 6,818,418; and Roberts et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Set, 94: 12297-12302 (1997), herein incorporated by reference. \n\n\nVectors and Polynucleotide Embodiments \n\n\n [00140] Nucleic acids encoding any of the various proteins or polypeptides disclosed herein may be synthesized chemically. Codon usage may be selected so as to improve expression in a cell. Such codon usage will depend on the cell type selected. Specialized codon usage patterns have been developed for E. coli and other bacteria, as well as mammalian ceils, plant cells, yeast cells and insect cells. See for example: Mayfield et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 100(2):438-442 (Jan. 21, 2003); Sinclair et al, Protein Expr. Purif., 26(I):96-105 (Oct. 2002); Connell, N.D., Curr. Opin. Biotechnol, 12(5):446-449 (Oct. 2001); Makrides et al, Microbiol. Rev., 60(3):512-538 (Sep. 1996); and Sharp et al, Yeast, 7(7):657-678 (Oct. 1991). \n\n\n [00141] General techniques for nucleic acid manipulation are described for example in Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989), or Ausubel, F. et al, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Green Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York (1987) and periodic updates, herein incorporated by reference. Generally, the DNA encoding the polypeptide is operably linked to suitable transcriptional or translational regulatory elements derived from mammalian, viral, or insect genes. Such regulatory elements \n\n include a transcriptional promoter, an optional operator sequence to control transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites, and sequences that control the termination of transcription and translation. The ability to replicate in a host, usually conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection gene to facilitate recognition of transformants is additionally incorporated. \n\n\n [00142] The proteins described herein may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which is preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N- terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. An exemplary N-terminal leader sequence for production of polypeptides in a mammalian system is METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTG (SEQ ID NO: 326), which is removed by the host cell following expression. \n\n\n [00143] For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process a native signal sequence, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, lpp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders. \n\n\n [00144] For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, a factor leader (including Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces alpha-factor leaders), or acid phosphatase leader, the C. albicans glucoamylase leader, or the signal described in U.S. Patent No. 5,631, 144. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available. The DNA for such precursor regions may be ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the protein. \n\n\n[00145] Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2 micron plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian \n\n cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter). \n\n\n [00146] Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli. \n\n\n[00147] Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the protein of the invention, e.g., a fibronectin-based scaffold protein. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter, beta-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, and hybrid promoters such as the tan promoter. However, other known bacterial promoters are suitable. \n\n\nPromoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the protein of the invention. Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3 ' end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tall to the 3' end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors. \n\n\n [00148] Examples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase. \n\n\n[00149] Transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells can be controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably Simian Virus \n\n 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g. , the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems. \n\n\n [00150] Transcription of a DNA encoding proteins of the invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, a- fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, Nature, 297: 17-18 (1982) on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5' or 3' to the peptide-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5' from the promoter. \n\n\n[00151] Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (e.g., yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5' and, occasionally 3', untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of mRNA encoding the protein of the invention. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO 94/1 1026 and the expression vector disclosed therein. \n\n\n [00152] The recombinant DNA can also include any type of protein tag sequence that may be useful for purifying the protein. Examples of protein tags include but are not limited to a histidine tag, a FLAG tag, a myc tag, an HA tag, or a GST tag. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts can be found in Cloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual, (Elsevier, New York (1985)), the relevant disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. \n\n\n[00153] The expression construct is introduced into the host cell using a method appropriate to the host cell, as will be apparent to one of skill in the art. A variety of methods for introducing nucleic acids into host cells are known in the art, including, but not limited to, electroporation; transfection employing calcium chloride, rubidium \n\n chloride, calcium phosphate, DEAE-dextran, or other substances; microprojectile bombardment; lipofection; and infection (where the vector is an infectious agent). \n\n\n[00154] Suitable host cells include prokaryotes, yeast, mammalian cells, or bacterial cells. Suitable bacteria include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for example, E. coli or Bacillus spp. Yeast, preferably from the Saccharomyces species, such as S. \n\n\ncerevisiae, may also be used for production of polypeptides. Various mammalian or insect cell culture systems can also be employed to express recombinant proteins. \n\n\nBaculovirus systems for production of heterologous proteins in insect cells are reviewed by Luckow et al. (Bio/Technology, 6:47 (1988)). Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include endothelial cells, COS-7 monkey kidney cells, CV-1, L cells, CI 27, 3T3, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), human embryonic kidney ceils, HeLa, 293, 293T, and BHK cell lines. Purified polypeptides are prepared by culturing suitable host/vector systems to express the recombinant proteins. For many applications, the small size of many of the polypeptides disclosed herein would make expression in E. coli as the preferred method for expression. The protein is then purified from culture media or cell extracts. \n\n\nProtein Production \n\n\n [00155] Host cells are transformed with the herein-described expression or cloning vectors for protein production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences. In the examples shown here, the host cells used for high- throughput protein production (HTPP) and mid-scale production was the HMS 174- bacterial strain. The host cells used to produce the proteins of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma)), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma)) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, may of the media described in Ham et al., Meth. Enzymol, 58:44 (1979), Barites et al, Anal. Biochem., 102:255 (1980), U.S. Patent Nos. 4,767,704, 4,657,866, 4,927,762, 4,560,655, 5, 122,469, 6,048,728, 5,672,502, or U.S. Patent No. RE 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, \n\n transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as Gentamycin drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. \n\n\n[00156] Proteins disclosed herein can also be produced using cell-translation systems. For such purposes the nucleic acids encoding the polypeptide must be modified to allow in vitro transcription to produce mR A and to allow cell-free translation of the mR A in the particular cell-free system being utilized (eukaryotic such as a mammalian or yeast cell-free translation system or prokaryotic such as a bacterial ceil-free translation system. \n\n\n[00157] Proteins of the invention can also be produced by chemical synthesis (e.g., by the methods described in Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2nd Edition, The Pierce \n\n\nChemical Co., Rockford, IL (1984)). Modifications to the protein can also be produced by chemical synthesis. \n\n\n [00158] The proteins of the present invention can be purified by isolation/purification methods for proteins generally known in the field of protein chemistry. Non-limiting examples include extraction, recrystallization, salting out (e.g., with ammonium sulfate or sodium sulfate), centrifugation, dialysis, ultrafiltration, adsorption chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, normal phase chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography, get filtration, gel permeation chromatography, affinity chromatography, electrophoresis, countercurrant distribution or any combinations of these. After purification, polypeptides may be exchanged into different buffers and/or concentrated by any of a variety of methods known to the art, including, but not limited to, filtration and dialysis. \n\n\n [00159] The purified polypeptide is preferably at least 85% pure, or preferably at least 95% pure, and most preferably at least 98% pure. Regardless of the exact numerical value of the purity, the polypeptide is sufficiently pure for use as a pharmaceutical product. \n\n [00160] A platform manufacturing process was used to prepare anti-PCSK9 Adnectin. The anti-PCSK9 Adnectin is produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli BLR (DE3) cells were transformed with expression vector (pET9d/ATI001173) which produces the protein in a soluble form intracellularly. The recombinant strain is grown in stirred tank fermentors. At the end of fermentation the cells are collected, lysed, and clarified in preparation for purification. ATI001 173 is a non-his tagged version of ATI001 114. The purified anti-PCSK9 Adnectin is conjugated to a 40 kDa branched methoxyPEG using a maleimide linker. The conjugated material is subsequently repurified to remove free PEG, free anti-PCSK9 Adnectin and product related impurities. Quality control testing is performed on the bulk drug substance. \n\n\nTherapeutic In Vivo Uses \n\n\n [00161] In one aspect, the application provides anti-PCSK9 Adnectin useful in the treatment of atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia and other cholesterol related diseases. The application also provides methods for administering anti-PCSK9 Adnectin to a subject. In some embodiments, the subject is a human. In some embodiments, the anti- PCSK9 Adnectin are pharmaceutically acceptable to a mammal, in particular a human. A \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" polypeptide refers to a polypeptide that is administered to an animal without significant adverse medical consequences, such as essentially endotoxin free, or very low endotoxin levels. \n\n\nFormulation and Administration \n\n\n [00162] The application further provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions comprising the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin or fusion proteins thereof described herein, wherein the composition is essentially endotoxin free. Therapeutic formulations comprising anti- PCSK9 Adnectin or fusions thereof are prepared for storage by mixing the described polypeptide having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Osol, A., Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Edition (1980)), in the form of aqueous solutions, lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as \n\n octadecyidimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as \n\n\npolyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrans; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as Tween, PLURONIC® or polyethylene glycol (PEG). \n\n\n [00163] The formulations herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. \n\n\n [00164] The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. \n\n\n[00165] The skilled artisan will understand that the dosage of each therapeutic agent will be dependent on the identity of the agent. \n\n\n[00166] For therapeutic applications, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin or a fusion protein comprising an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin is administered to a subject, in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. They can be administered intravenously as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, or by subcutaneous routes. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, and excipients are well known and can be determined by those of skill in the art as the clinical situation warrants. Examples of suitable carriers, diluents and/or excipients include: (1) Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline, (2) 0.9% saline (0.9% w/v NaCl), and (3) 5% (w/v) dextrose. \n\n\n[00167] The method of the present invention can be practiced in vitro, in vivo, or ex vivo. \n\n\n[00168] Administration of anti-PCSK9 Adnectin or a fusion thereof, and one or more additional therapeutic agents, whether co-administered or administered sequentially, may occur as described above for therapeutic applications. Suitable pharmaceutically \n\n acceptable carriers, diluents, and excipients for co-administration will be understood by the skilled artisan to depend on the identity of the particular therapeutic agent being administered. \n\n\n [00169] When present in an aqueous dosage form, rather than being lyophilized, the protein typically will be formulated at a concentration of about 0.1 mg/ml to 100 mg/ml, although wide variation outside of these ranges is permitted. For the treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of anti-PCSK9 Adnectin or a fusion thereof will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the severity and course of the disease, whether the protein is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, the course of previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the protein, and the discretion of the attending physician. The protein is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. \n\n\nFusions of Serum Albumin Binding Adnectin (SABA) \n\n\n[00170] In certain aspects, the application provides fusion proteins comprising anti- PCSK9 Adnectin fused to a \n10\nFn3 domains that binds to human serum albumin (a Serum Albumin Binding Adnectin (\n10\nFn3 domain) or SABA). Such fusion proteins have extended serum half lives in the presence of albumin relative to the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin alone (e.g., not conjugated to a PK moiety). \n\n\n[00171] \n10\nFn3 domains are cleared rapidly from circulation via renal filtration and degradation due to their small size of ~10 kDa (t \n2\n = 15^4 minutes in mice; 1-3 hours in monkeys). Fusion of a \n10\nFn3 domain, such as an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin, to a second polypeptide comprising a \n10\nFn3 domain that binds specifically to serum albumin, e.g., human serum albumin (HSA), may be used to prolong the t \n2\n of the anti-PCSK9 \n\n\nAdnectin. \n\n\n [00172] In certain embodiments, the serum half-life of the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin fused to the SABA is increased relative to the serum half-life of the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin when not conjugated to the SABA. In certain embodiments, the serum half-life of the SABA fusion is at least 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500, 1800, 1900, 2000, 2500, or 3000% longer relative to the serum half-life of the anti-\n\n\nPCSK9 Adnectin when not fused to the SABA. In other embodiments, the serum half-life of the SABA fusion is at least 1.5-fold, 2-fold, 2.5-fold, 3-fold, 3.5 fold, 4-fold, 4.5-fold, \n\n 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 10-fold, 12-fold, 13-fold, 15-fold, 17-fold, 20-fold, 22-fold, 25-fold, 27-fold, 30-fold, 35-fold, 40-fold, or 50-fold greater than the serum half-life of the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin when not fused to the SABA. In some embodiments, the serum half-life of the SABA fusion is at least 10 hours, 15 hours, 20 hours, 25 hours, 30 hours, 35 hours, 40 hours, 50 hours, 60 hours, 70 hours, 80 hours, 90 hours, 100 hours, 110 hours, 120 hours, 130 hours, 135 hours, 140 hours, 150 hours, 160 hours, or 200 hours. \n\n\n[00173] In certain embodiments, the serum albumin binding portion of the SABA fusion protein binds to HSA with a KD of less than 3 uM, 2.5 uM, 2 uM, 1.5 uM, 1 uM, 500 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 500 pM, 100 pM. 100 pM, 50 pM or 10 pM. In certain embodiments, the serum albumin binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins bind to HSA with a K\nD\n of less than 3 uM, 2.5 uM, 2 uM, 1.5 uM, 1 uM, 500 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 500 pM, 100 pM. 100 pM, 50 pM or 10 pM at a pH range of 5.5 to 7.4 at 25 °C or 37 °C. In some embodiments, the serum albumin binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins bind more tightly to HSA at a pH less than 7.4 as compared to binding at pH 7.4. \n\n\n [00174] Accordingly, the SABA fusion molecules described herein are useful for increasing the half-life of anti-PCSK9 Adnectin by creating a fusion between anti-PCSK9 Adnectin and the SABA. Such fusion molecules may be used to treat conditions which respond to the biological activity of PCSK9. The present invention contemplates the use of the SABA fusion molecules in diseases caused by the dysregulation of PCSK9. \n\n\n [00175] The fusion may be formed by attaching anti-PCSK9 Adnectin to either end of the SABA molecule, i.e., SABA-anti-PCSK9 Adnectin or anti-PCSK9 Adnectin-SABA arrangements. \n\n\n [00176] HSA has a serum concentration of 600 μΜ and a ti/2 of 19 days in humans. The extended ti/2 of HSA has been attributed, in part, to its recycling via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). HSA binds FcRn in a pH-dependent manner after endosomal uptake into endothelial cells; this interaction recycles HSA back into the bloodstream, thereby shunting it away from lysosomal degradation. FcRn is widely expressed and the recycling pathway is thought to be constitutive. In the majority of cell types, most FcRn resides in the intracellular sorting endosome. HSA is readily internalized by a nonspecific mechanism of fluid-phase pinocytosis and rescued from degradation in the lysosome by FcRn. At the acidic pH found in the endosome, HSA's affinity for FcRn \n\n increases (5μΜ at pH 6.0). Once bound to FcRn, HSA is shunted away from the lysosomal degradation pathway, transcytosed to and released at the cell surface. \n\n\n[00177] In certain embodiments, the serum albumin binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins described herein may also bind serum albumin from one or more of monkey, rat, or mouse. In certain embodiments, the HSA binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins described herein bind to rhesus serum albumin (RhSA) or cynomolgous monkey serum albumin (CySA) with a K\nD\n of less than 3 uM, 2.5 uM, 2 uM, 1.5 uM, 1 uM, 500 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 500 pM or 100 pM. \n\n\n[00178] In certain embodiments, the serum albumin binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins described herein bind to domain I and/or domain II of HSA. In one embodiment, the HSA binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins described herein do not bind to domain III of HSA. \n\n\n [00179] In certain embodiments, the serum albumin binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins comprises a sequence having at least 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80% or 85% identity to the wild-type \n10\nFn3 domain (SEQ ID NO: 1). In one embodiment, at least one of the BC, DE, or FG loops is modified relative to the wild-type \n10\nFn3 domain. In another embodiment, at least two of the BC, DE, or FG loops are modified relative to the wild-type \n10\nFn3 domain. In another embodiment, all three of the BC, DE, and FG loops are modified relative to the wild-type \n10\nFn3 domain. In other embodiments, a SABA comprises a sequence having at least 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%,\n\n\n90%, or 95% identity to any one of the 26 core SABA sequences shown in Table 6 (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 334, 338, 342, 346, and 348-370) or any one of the extended SABA sequences shown in Table 6 (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 420-447, minus the 6xHIS tag). \n\n\n[00180] In certain embodiments, the serum binding Adnectins based on the \n10\nFn3 scaffold can be defined generally by the following sequence: \n\n\nEVVAAT(X)\na\nSLLI(X)\nx\nYYRITYGE(X)\n6\nQEFTV(X)\n};\nATI(X)\nc\nDYTITVYAV(X)\nz\nISrNYR T (SEQ ID NO:328) [00181] In certain embodiments, the serum binding Adnectins based on the \n10\nFn3 scaffold can be defined generally by the sequence: \n\n EVVAATPTSLLI(X)\nx\nYYRITYGETGGNSPVQEFTV(X)yATISGLKPGVDYTITVYAV (X)\nZ\nISI YRT (SEQ ID NO:329) \n\n\n[00182] As described herein for anti-PCSK9 Adnectins, SEQ ID NOs: 328 and 329 can be defined and applied to SABA molecules in the same way. In exemplary embodiments, the BC, DE, and FG loops as represented by (X)\nx\n, (X)\ny\n, and (X)\nz\n, respectively, are replaced with polypeptides comprising the BC, DE and FG loop sequences from any of the HSA binders shown in Table 6 below (i.e., SEQ ID NOs: 330, 334, 338, 342, 346, and 348-370 in Table 6). In certain embodiments, the BC, DE, or FG loop sequences shown in Table 6 may contain one or more additional residues flanking the N- and/or C-termini. In particular, the BC loop may contain an SW at the N-terminus of the BC loop sequences shown in Table 6 when replacing (X)\nx\n in SEQ ID NO: 328. Similarly, the DE loop may contain a P preceding loop DE and the residue T following loop DE when replacing (X)\ny\n in SEQ ID NO: 328. The FG loop may contain a P following the FG loop when replacing (X)\nz\n in SEQ ID NO: 328. For example, SEQ ID NO: 330 indicates that the BC, DE, and FG loops comprise HSYYEQNS (SEQ ID NO: 638), YSQT (SEQ ID NO: 639), and YGSKYYY (SEQ ID NO: 640), respectively. However, when replacing (X)\nx\n, (X)\ny\n, and (X)\nz\n in SEQ ID NO: 328, i.e., the BC, DE and FG loops, the (X)\nx\n sequence may be SWHSYYEQNS (SEQ ID NO: 641), the (X)\ny\n sequence may be PYSQTT (SEQ ID NO: 642), and the (X)\nz\n sequence may be \n\n\nYGSKYYYP (SEQ ID NO: 643). \n\n\n [00183] In certain embodiments, a SABA for use in a fusion as described herein may comprise the sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 328 or 329, wherein the BC, DE, and FG loops as represented by (X)\nx\n, (X)\ny\n, and (X)\nz\n, respectively, are replaced with a respective set of specified BC, DE, and FG loops from any of the 26 core SABA sequences (i.e., SEQ ID NOs: 330, 334, 338, 342, 346, and 348-370 in Table 6), or sequences at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to the BC, DE and FG loop sequences of the 26 core SABA sequences. In exemplary embodiments, a SABA as described herein is defined by SEQ ID NO: 329 and has a set of BC, DE and FG loop sequences from any of the 26 core SABA sequences (i.e., SEQ ID NOs: 330, 334, 338, 342, 346, and 348-370 in Table 6), optionally with the N- and/or C-terminal additions to the loop sequences as described above. For example, SABA1 has the core \n\n sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 330 and comprises BC, DE, and FG loops as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 331-333, respectively. Therefore, a SABA based on the SABA1 core may comprise SEQ ID NO: 328 or 329, wherein (X)\nx\n comprises SEQ ID NO: 331, (X)\ny\n comprises SEQ ID NO: 332, and (X)\nz\n comprises SEQ ID NO: 333. In some \n\n\nembodiments, the sequences that replace (X)\nX;\n (X)\ny,\n and (X)\nz\n comprise additional residue(s) on either or both ends of the loops as described above. Similar constructs are contemplated utilizing the set of BC, DE and FG loops from the other SABA core sequences. The scaffold regions of such SABA may comprise anywhere from 0 to 20, from 0 to 15, from 0 to 10, from 0 to 8, from 0 to 6, from 0 to 5, from 0 to 4, from 0 to 3, from 0 to 2, or from 0 to 1 substitutions, conservative substitutions, deletions or additions relative to the scaffold amino acids residues of SEQ ID NO: 1. Such scaffold modifications may be made, so long as the SABA is capable of binding serum albumin, e.g., HSA, with a desired K\nD\n. \n\n\n [00184] In certain embodiments, a SABA (e.g., a SABA core sequence or a sequence based thereon as described above) may be modified to comprise an N-terminal extension sequence and/or a C-terminal extension sequence. Exemplary extension sequences are shown in Table 6. For example, SEQ ID NO: 420 designated as SABAl . l comprises the core SABA 1 sequence (SEQ ID NO: 330) with an N-terminal sequence \n\n\nMGVSDVPRDLE (SEQ ID NO: 371, designated as AdNTl), and a C-terminal sequence EIDKPSQ (SEQ ID NO: 380, designated as AdCTl). SABAl. l further comprises a His6 tag at the C-terminus, however, it should be understood that the His6 tag is completely optional and may be placed anywhere within the N- or C-terminal extension sequences, or may be absent from the sequence all together. Further, any of the exemplary N- or C- terminal extension sequences provided in Table 6 (SEQ ID NO: 371-395), and any variants thereof, can be used to modify any given SABA core sequence provided in Table 6. \n\n\n [00185] In certain embodiments, the C-terminal extension sequences (also called \"tails\"), comprise E and D residues, and may be between 8 and 50, 10 and 30, 10 and 20, 5 and 10, and 2 and 4 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, tail sequences include ED-based linkers in which the sequence comprises tandem repeats of ED. In exemplary embodiments, the tail sequence comprises 2-10, 2-7, 2-5, 3-10, 3-7, 3-5, 3, 4 or 5 ED repeats. In certain embodiments, the ED-based tail sequences may also include \n\n additional amino acid residues, such as, for example: EI, EID, ES, EC, EGS, and EGC. Such sequences are based, in part, on known Adnectin tail sequences, such as EIDKPSQ (SEQ ID NO: 380), in which residues D and K have been removed. In exemplary embodiments, the ED-based tail comprises an E, I or EI residues before the ED repeats. \n\n\n[00186] In other embodiments, the tail sequences may be combined with other known linker sequences (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 396-419 in Table 6) as necessary when designing a SABA fusion molecule. \n\n\nConjugation/Linkers \n\n\n[00187] SABA fusions may be covalently or non-covalently linked. In some embodiments, a serum albumin binding \n10\nFn3 may be directly or indirectly linked to an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin via a polypeptide linker. Suitable linkers for joining Fn3 domains are those which allow the separate domains to fold independently of each other forming a three dimensional structure that permits high affinity binding to a target molecule. \n\n\n[00188] The disclosure provides a number of suitable linkers that meet these requirements, including glycine-serine based linkers, glycine-proline based linkers, as well as the linker having the amino acid sequence PSTSTST (SEQ ID NO: 416). The Examples described herein demonstrate that Fn3 domains joined via polypeptide linkers retain their target binding function. In some embodiments, the linker is a glycine-serine based linker. These linkers comprise glycine and serine residues and may be between 8 and 50, 10 and 30, and 10 and 20 amino acids in length. Examples include linkers having an amino acid sequence (GS)\n7\n (SEQ ID NO: 403), G(GS)\n6\n (SEQ ID NO: 398), and G(GS)\n7\nG (SEQ ID NO: 400). Other linkers contain glutamic acid, and include, for example, (GSE)\n5\n (SEQ ID NO: 405) and GGSE GGSE (SEQ ID NO: 409). Other exemplary glycine-serine linkers include (GS)\n4\n (SEQ ID NO: 402), (GGGGS)\n7\n (SEQ ID NO: 411), (GGGGS)\n5\n (SEQ ID NO: 412), and (GGGGS)\n3\nG (SEQ ID NO: 413). In some embodiments, the linker is a glycine-proline based linker. These linkers comprise glycine and proline residues and may be between 3 and 30, 10 and 30, and 3 and 20 amino acids in length. Examples include linkers having an amino acid sequence (GP^G (SEQ ID NO: 414), (GP)\n5\nG (SEQ ID NO: 415), and GPG. In other embodiments, the linker may be a proline-alanine based linker having between 3 and 30, 10 and 30, and 3 and 20 amino acids in length. Examples of proline alanine based linkers include, for example, \n\n (PA)\n3\n (SEQ ID NO: 417), (PA)\n6\n (SEQ ID NO: 418) and (PA)\n9\n (SEQ ID NO: 419). It is contemplated, that the optimal linker length and amino acid composition may be determined by routine experimentation in view of the teachings provided herein. In some embodiments, an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin is linked to a SABA via a polypeptide linker having a protease site that is cleavable by a protease in the blood or target tissue. Such embodiments can be used to release an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin for better delivery or therapeutic properties or more efficient production. \n\n\n [00189] Additional linkers or spacers, may be introduced at the C-terminus of a Fn3 domain between the Fn3 domain and the polypeptide linker. Additional linkers or spacers may be introduced at the N-terminus of a Fn3 domain between the Fn3 domain and the polypeptide linker. \n\n\n [00190] In some embodiments, an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin may be directly or indirectly linked to a SABA via a polymeric linker. Polymeric linkers can be used to optimally vary the distance between each component of the fusion to create a protein fusion with one or more of the following characteristics: 1) reduced or increased steric hindrance of binding of one or more protein domains when binding to a protein of interest, 2) increased protein stability or solubility, 3) decreased protein aggregation, and 4) increased overall avidity or affinity of the protein. \n\n\n [00191] In some embodiments, an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin is linked to a SABA via a biocompatible polymer such as a polymeric sugar. The polymeric sugar can include an enzymatic cleavage site that is cleavable by an enzyme in the blood or target tissue. Such embodiments can be used to release an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin for better delivery or therapeutic properties or more efficient production. Summary of Sequences \n\n\n [00192] Many of the sequences referenced in \"Fusions of Serum Albumin Binding Adnectin (SABA)\" and \"Conjugation/Linkers\" sections above are summarized in Table 6 below. Unless otherwise specified, all N-terminal extensions are indicated with a single underline, all C-terminal tails/extensions are indicated with a double underline, and linker sequences are boxed. Loop regions BC, DE and FG are shaded for each core SABA sequence. As described further above, the modification sequences (e.g., N or C terminal extensions and linkers) can also be used to modify anti-PCSK9 Adnectin molecules. \n\n Table 6 \n\n\n \n\n SKQ Sl'(|IK'IK Di'sci iplinn Sl'(|IK'IK \n\n\n I I) illlH' \n\n\n 342 SABA4 Core 4 Adnectin; EMVAATPTSLLISWI ii iSYYRITYGET contains a scaffold GGNSPVQEFTVPi l TATI SGLKPGVDYTI mutation (bolded); TVYAVTlS l!liiieSPI S INYRT scaffold-perfect version \n\n\n is SABA5 \n\n\n 343 SABA4BC Core 4 BC Loop EDDSYYSR \n\n\n 344 SABA4DE Core 4 DE Loop SDLY \n\n\n 345 SABA4FG Core 4 FG Loop YDVTDLIMHE \n\n\n 346 SABA5 Core 5 Adnectin; see EWAATPTSLLISWlie lilYYRITYGET description for SABA4; GGNSPVQEFTVPilllTATI SGLKPGVDYTI corrected residue is TVYAVT wmmmmp i s iNYRT bolded \n\n\n 347 SABA5BC Core 5 BC Loop EDDSYYSR \n\n\n 348 SABA5DE Core 5 DE Loop SDLY \n\n\n 349 SABA5FG Core 5 FG Loop YDVTDLIMHE \n\n\n 350 SABA6 Core 6 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISWllII i lYYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTVP SeiTATI SGLKPGVDYTI TVYAVTS:ll iM:lM«PI S INYRT \n\n\n 351 SABA7 Core 7 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISW! »Sii»SYYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTVPlSSliTATI SGLKPGVDYTI TVYAVTlIil!l lIiliPI S INYRT \n\n\n 352 SABA8 Core 8 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISWll:ai;l:ilYYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTV!!I!ITATI SGLKPGVDYTI\n\n\nTVYAvm mmmp i s iNYRT \n\n\n 353 SABA9 Core 9 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISWi il l!lSYYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTVPii!IS TATI SGLKPGVDYTI TVYAVTlHSIil!lPI SINYRT \n\n\n 354 SABA10 Core 10 Adnectin EVVAATPT SLL I S«SHiSSSSYYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTVPiili!lTATI SGLKPGVDYTI TVYAV!!HIillPI S INYRT \n\n\n 355 SABA11 Core 1 1 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISWif!K!ie!ilYYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTVPiiii TATI SGLKPGVDYTI \n\n\n \n\n SKQ Sl'(|IK'IK Di'sci iplinn Sl'(|IK'IK \n\n\n I I) illlH' \n\n\n 356 SABA12 Core 12 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISWHGEPDQTRYYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTVPi ilTATISGLKPGVDYTI TVYAV:lS;lS:SiillPISINYRT \n\n\n 357 SABA13 Core 13 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISWi li ilYYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTVSSIISITATISGLKPGVDYTI\n\n\nTVYAvmmmwimmmpisiNYRT \n\n\n 358 SABA14 Core 14 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISW1S;11:1S1; YYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTVPiSHlSTATISGLKPGVDYTI TVYAVIIilillPISINYRT \n\n\n 359 SABA15 Core 15 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISWSHS:ll;iiiYYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTVPiiii TATISGLKPGVDYTI TVYAV118eS:Si!»PISINYRT \n\n\n 360 SABA16 Core 16 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISWil li lYYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTV»l:g:S:TATISGLKPGVDYTI\n\n\nTVYAvmrnmrn rnm\np\nisiNYRT \n\n\n 361 SABA17 Core 17 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISW!Sl:lSl;:ii YYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTVPSSiWTATISGLKPGVDYTI\n\n\nTVYAvwwmmm&mmpisiNYRT \n\n\n 362 SABA18 Core 18 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISWll:li!l¾YYYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTVPi llTATISGLKPGVDYTI TVYAV!imSii!PISINYRT \n\n\n 363 SABA19 Core 19 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISWiiWiiliiYYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTVPiiliSgjTATISGLKPGVDYTI\n\n\nTVYAvmAmmmpisiNYRT \n\n\n 364 SABA20 Core 20 Adnectin EVVAATPTSLLISWS SSS!ii YYRITYGET \n\n\n GGNSPVQEFTVei!S!S!lTATISGLKPGVDYTI TVYAV!KS;S»l;liiSl!

Human PCSK9 and Cynomolgus PCSK9 were immobilized on separate channels on one dimension of a ProteOn XPR (Bio-Rad) chip surfaces and exposed to 6 different concentrations of 2013E01 in the other dimension of the same SPR chip surface. This allowed kinetic determination in the absence of regeneration. Duplicate chips were used for kinetic determinations of the Human and Cynomolgus PCSK9 at 25 °C. Evaluation of the kinetic parameters was performed using the Langmuir interaction model and constant parameter fitting with the ProteOn Manager software. \n\n\n [00198] Under these conditions, anti-PCSK9 Adnectins bound to human PCSK9 with dissociation constants (KD) ranging from 80 pM to 1.6 nM and to the cyno PCSK9 with dissociation constants (KD) ranging from 8 nM to 24 nM (Table 7). Association rates were approximately 10\n5\n M\n'\nY\n1\n, coupled with dissociations that were typically 10\n\"3\n- 10\n\" 5\n s\n\"\n \\ For some Adnectins, the off-rates from human PCSK9 were slow (on the order of 10\n\"5\n s\n1\n), which is close to the limit of detection for SPR technologies so it is possible that these dissociation constant measurements from human PCSK9 are under-estimates. \n\n\nTable 7 \n\n\n SPR-Determined Kinetic Parameters for Anti-PCSK9 Adnectins Against Directly \n\n\n Immobilized Human and Cyno PCSK9 \n\n\n \n\n Clone ID PCSK9 Species kon CM\n\"1\n S\n\"1\n) koff Cs\n\"1\n) K\nD\n (nM)\n\n\n1922G04 human 5.41E+05 5.08E-05 0.094 ± 0.009\n\n\n1922G04 cyno 4.65E+05 7.00E-03 15.03 \n\n\n 2011H05 human 1.18E+05 9.76E-06 0.079 ± 0.038\n\n\n2011H05 cyno 1.90E+05 4.40E-03 23.1 \n\n\n 2012A04 human 2.59E+05 6.47E-05 0.251 ± 0.01 1\n\n\n2012A04 cyno 1.95E+05 4.75E-03 24.32 \n\n\nK\nD\n by BLI \n\n\n [00199] The binding characteristics of Adnectins and human PCSK9 were also determined by Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI). Biotinylated human PCSK9 was immobilized onto superstreptavidin sensor tips which were subsequently immersed into wells containing diluted Adnectin for the duration of the association phase. Tips were then immersed into a buffer-only well for observation of Adnectin dissociation. \n\n\nExperiments were performed in a temperature controlled environment at either 25 or 37 °C, and the oscillation speed was set at 1500 rpm. \n\n\n[00200] Binding interaction analysis was performed using proprietary software from Fortebio (Fortebio Data Analysis Software version 6.3.0.36). Global fits were performed for all samples, using a 1 : 1 binding model. The nature of these global fits constrained all values of concentration to a single pair of association and dissociation rates that were themselves constrained to each other. Affinities (¾), association and dissociation rates were averaged over the various loading levels used in the analysis. Under these conditions, Adnectins bound human PCSK9 with affinities ranging from 200pM to 7.5nM, as shown in Table 8 below.

The relative unbound Adnectin concentrations were measured by capture on a hPCSK9 solid matrix followed by detection with a fluorescently labeled antibody that recognizes the Adnectin scaffold. Due to technical limitations, the lowest concentration of Adnectins that could be tested was 1 nM. The global ¾ analyses estimate a ¾ = 70 pM (28-127pM within a 95% confidence interval) for ATI001081 and a K\nD\n = 223 pM for ATI001174 (range of 54-585pM within 95% confidence interval). \n\n\nTable 9 \n\n\n Solution Phase Affinity Measurements for PCSK9 Adnectins \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nITC \n\n [00202] The thermodynamics and stoichiometry of binding of Adnectins ATIOOl 174 and ATI001081 to human PCSK9 were characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Solution phase binding was measured in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.41, 150 mM NaCl at 37 °C. An average unimolecular binding constant of 1.3 ± 0.2 nM was observed for ATI001174 and 1.4 ± 0.4 nM for ATI001081. Detailed thermodynamic analyses are shown in Table 10 and Figure 13. The difference in observed enthalpies (-3.3 kcal/mol) for the two Adnectins suggests that ATIOOl 174 incurs an order of magnitude reduction in its affinity for PCSK9 due to PEGylation that is at least partially offset by the corresponding difference in entropy (-10.4 cal/mol-K). \n\n\nTable 10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Average of 3 experiments \n\n\nFluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Assay \n\n\n[00203] Three FRET based assays were developed to determine the binding affinity and potency of PCSK9-binding Adnectins, adapted from the general method described previously by Maio et al. (See, Miao, B. et al., Meth. Enzymol, 357: 180-188 (2002)). The PCSK9:EGFA FRET assay (Figures 2 and 3) measured the inhibition of PCSK9 binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain (EGFA domain), using recombinant human PCSK9 expressed in baculovirus and a synthetic 40-mer EGFA peptide (biotinylated). EGFA has been shown to represent the key interacting domain of LDLR with PCSK9 (Kwon, H.J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 105(6): 1820-1825 (2008)). This assay used a PCSK9 C- terminal domain binding mAb (mAb 4H5) labeled with Eu-chelate to provide FRET \n\n interaction with biotinylated EGFA through the streptavidin/ allophycocyanin fluorophore complex. \n\n\n [00204] Two other related, PCSK9-dependent FRET assays were also constructed. In one of these assays, competitive displacement by Adnectins of biotinylated Adnectins - ATI000972 or ATIOOl 125 is quantified (ATI000972 results shown in Figure 4). \n\n\n ATI000972 is a biotinylated version of 1459D05 and ATIOOl 125 is a biotinylated version of ATIOOl 081. In another assay, direct binding of an Adnectin (his-tagged) to PCSK9 is assayed using anti-his6 antibody (Figure 5). In each of the FRET assays, human PCSK9 concentration was either 1 or 5 nM. In some cases cynomolgus monkey PCSK9 replaced hPCSK9. Table 11 summarizes the overall data from these three FRET assays. \n\n\nTable 1 1 \n\n\n Summary of Adnectin Testing Data for 3 FRET Assays Using Human PCSK9 and 1 \n\n\n Assay for Cyno PCSK9 \n\n\n \n\n Clone ID hPCSK9: hPCSK9: hPCSK9: Direct binding cPCSK9:EGFA\n\n\nEGFA ATI00097 ATI00112 hPCSK9 IC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM) 2 IC50 5 IC50 EC50 (nM) \n\n\n (nM) (nM) \n\n\n 2381B04 2.4 nd 0.5 4.2 17.3\n\n\n2451H07 0.2 nd 0.2 13.2 27.1\n\n\n2381D04 2.9 nd 0.5 3.7 12\n\n\n2381F11 4 nd 0.8 < 1 26.5\n\n\n2381G09 3.1 nd 1.1 4.5 25.2\n\n\n2381H09 3.4 nd 0.5 4.1 20.2\n\n\n2382B09 3.8 nd 0.6 4.0 37.2\n\n\n2382B10 3 nd 0.5 3.1 18.1\n\n\n2382C05 4 nd 0.9 3.4 27.2\n\n\n2382C09 3.5 nd 0.6 2.9 23.9\n\n\n2382D03 3.3 nd 0.6 3.3 11.8\n\n\n2382D09 2.6 nd 0.4 3.7 13.9\n\n\n2382F05 2.4 nd 0.9 3.8 14.6\n\n\n2382G04 2.9 nd 0.5 3.6 20.1\n\n\n2382H03 3.4 nd 0.3 3.8 19.8\n\n\n2382H09 0.9 nd 0.3 3.6 17.9\n\n\n2382H10 2.6 nd 0.4 4.6 18.2\n\n\n2382D02 4.5 nd 0.5 5.3 57.8\n\n\n2451C06 1.2 nd 0.4 5.5 24.7 \n\n\nCell-Based Inhibition of PCSK9 Activity by PCSK9 Adnectins Dil-LDL Uptake Assay \n\n\n [00205] Cell culture methods were developed to assay the ability of Adnectins to inhibit PCSK9 activity on the LDLR. An effective means of measuring cellular LDLR activity is through an assay for uptake of labeled LDL, as shown by Lagace, T.A. et al. (J. Clin. Invest., 1 16(11):2995-3005 (2006)). The work further adapted a method for LDLR functional activity using fluorescent-labeled LDL (Dil-LDL) uptake adapted from a method originally shown by Teupser et al. (Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1303(3): 193-198 \n\n (1996)). Cells were first preincubated with recombinant human PCSK9 protein (10 ug/mL, 135 riM) in the presence and absence of Adnectins as shown. After 2 hours, the remaining LDLR activity was assayed by incubation with Dil-LDL (5 ug) for 2 hours followed by an assessment of accumulated Dil-LDL inside the cells using high content fluorescent micrscopy and image analysis (Cellomics), Figure 6 shows the effect of several Adnectins to inhibit PCS 9 activity and restore LDLR functional activity in HepG2 cells. In this assay, the Adnectins inhibited PCS 9 and restored Dil-LDL uptake with the following ECj\n0\n values: 1459D05, EC50 = 190 nM; 1784F03, 210 nM; \n\n\n2012A04, 130 nM; 2013E01, 160 nM. \n\n\nLDLR Depletion Assay \n\n\n [00206] HepG2 cells were grown in complete media, Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, ATCC®) with 1 % FBS (Hyclone), and split twice a week with Trypsin 0.25% (Invitrogen). To induce upregulation of the LDL receptor, cells were incubated overnight in LPDS media [RPMI (ATCQ with 5% lipoprotein deficient serum (Intracel), ΙΟΟηΜ superstatin (BMS) and 50uM Sodium Mevalonate (Sigma)]. The following day, cells were trypsinized briefly with Trypsin 0.05% (Invitrogen) and resuspended at 2 XI 0*6 cells per ml then aliquoted at 10Oul per well in a V-bottom 96 well plate. In the meantime, Adnectins were pre-incubated with PCS 9 in LPDS media for an hour at 37'C. After an hour, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 OOul of Adnectin PCSK9 mix and incubated overnight at 37'C. The following day cells were labeled with an antibody for LDL receptor (BAF 2148 from R&D), followed by a phycoerythrin (PE)-streptavidin conjugated secondary antibody (BD554061from BD Pharmingen) and analyzed by FACS on the FACS Canton (BD), \n\n\n[00207] 1 OnM of PCSK9 was pre-incubated for an hour with increasing concentration of Adnectin candidates before being added to HepG2 cells. After overnight incubation LDLR level were measured by FACS and the percentage of inhibition of PCSKS-induced LDLR depletion was graphed and EC50 determined using PRISM. 1459D05 appears to be the least potent candidate among those tested and did not reach the maximum inhibition whereas the other clones reach 150-200% maximum inhibition of PCS 9 (Figure 7). A summary of the PCSK9 Adnectin in vitro pharmacology data is shown below in Table 12. \n\n\n - 164 - \n\n\nSHEET RULE 91 ISA EP \n\n\n\n\n- 165 - \n\n Table 12 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3 \n\n\n In Vivo Pharmacodynamic Effects of PCSK9 Adnectins Human PCSK9 Transgenic Mouse Models \n\n\n [00208] PCSK9 Adnectins exhibited pharmacodynamic effects in vivo in two different human transgenic mouse models. One mouse model overexpresses human PCSK9 levels markedly and exhibits hypercholesterolemia as a result (Lagace, T.A. et al, J. Clin. Invest., 116(1 1):2995-3005 (2006)). The other mouse model is a genomic hPCSK9 transgenic (BAC-trans genie) which is regulated in liver similarly to mouse PCSK9 and which expresses near human-normal levels of hPCSK9 in plasma. For these studies, ELISA assays using species-specific, site-specific labeled antibodies and Adnectins were developed to measure plasma unbound human PCSK9 levels (i.e., hPCSK9 not complexed with the administered Adnectin) as an index of target engagement. \n\n\n[00209] Single doses of PCSK9 Adnectins in PEGylated form were injected intraperitoneally into the overexpresser hPCSK9 transgenic mouse model at the doses shown in Figures 8-9. PBS or dialysate samples were also injected as controls. Adnectin 1459D05-PEG (100 mg/kg intraperitoneal) treatment rapidly decreased plasma total cholesterol (Figure 8A) and LDL-C (not shown) to >35% below baseline in 4 hr. \n\n\nCholesterol levels in Adnectin treated mice remained below control levels throughout the 48 hr test period. This was accompanied by a sharp decrease in circulating levels of unbound hPCSK9 in the Adnectin treated transgenic mice (Figure 8B). Western blots of liver taken at 6 hours in parallel studies showed that LDLR protein levels were increased ~2-fold in Adnectin-treated mice (not shown). In further studies in this transgenic mouse model, ATI0011 14 was administered at 10 or 60 mg/kg. A marked, dose-dependent, rapid lowering of plasma cholesterol was seen, concomitant with a dose-related reduction in unbound hPCSK9 levels (Figure 9). These studies represent in vivo proof-of-concept for PCSK9 Adnectins as effective cholesterol lowering agents in a hypercholesterolemic human transgenic PCSK9 mouse model. \n\n\n [00210] In vivo studies were conducted in the normal expresser hPCSK9 transgenic mouse model. Injection of single doses of 1459D05-PEG or ATI001 114 (5 mg/kg) resulted in rapid and strong decreases in unbound hPCSK9 levels in plasma (Figure 10). This pharmacodynamic effect on unbound hPCSK9 was more pronounced following ATI0011 14 compared tol459D05-PEG, with greater magnitude and duration of effect \n\n observed for the higher affinity/potency Adnectin. A further study of dose dependency revealed that that the 50% inhibitory dose (ED50) was less than 0.1 mg/kg for \n\n\nATIOOl 114 at time points from 3 to 48 hours post-dose, as seen in Figure 11. These findings in a normal expresser transgenic mouse model show that PCSK9 inhibitory Adnectins exhibit marked, affinity-dependent and dose-dependent effects on \n\n\npharmacodynamic endpoints which are correlated with LDLR regulation and LDL cholesterol lowering. \n\n\nCynomolgus Monkeys \n\n\n[00211] A pharmacodynamic study was conducted in normal lean cynomolgus monkeys. Adnectin ATIOOl 1 14 was administered to cynos intravenously at 5 mg/kg, and plasma samples were collected at time intervals for LDL-C assay and pharmacokinetic assessment. A single dose of ATIOOl 1 14 rapidly lowered plasma LDL-C levels to >50% vs. baseline (or vs. PBS control group) within 48 hours (Figure 12). The duration of effect on LDL-C continued for more than a week with eventual return to baseline by 3 wk. This effect was observed with both two-branched and four-branched 40kDa PEGylated forms of the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin (ATIOOl 1 14 and ATI00121 1, \n\n\nrespectively). ATI00121 1 is ATI001081 with a 40 kDa 4-branched NOF PEG moiety. Total cholesterol showed a similar pattern but no effect on HDL or other metabolic parameter was observed (not shown). Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the plasma half-life was approximately 80-120 hrs, consistent with the pharmacodynamics of LDL lowering in the cynos. These findings indicate that a PCSK9 Adnectin is efficacious and fast-acting with rapid, robust, specific effects on LDL-C lowering in cynomolgus monkey model. \n\n\nExample 4 \n\n\n In Vitro and In Vivo Pharmacological Evaluation of the PCSK9 Adnectin-Fc Fusion \n\n\n Protein, PRD460 \n\n\n Production of PRD460 \n\n\n[00212] A vector encoding PRD460 was transfected into HEK-293 6E cells using polyethylenimine (PEI). The cells were grown at 37 °C for 5 days with 80% \n\n\nhumidification and 5% CO\n2\n. The cells were then pelleted, the supernatant was passed \n\n through a 0.22 um filter and then loaded onto to a ProteinA column. The column was washed with PBS and the protein was eluted with 20mM Gylcine, 150 mM NaCl pH 2.8. The eluted protein was concentrated and passed over a superdex200 column in 50mM MES, 100 mM NaCl pH 5.8. \n\n\n[00213] \n\n\n PRD460 K\nD\n by SPR \n\n\n [00214] The binding characteristics were characterized by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Anti-human antibody was immobilized on a BIACORE® chip, and PRD460 (sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 322) was captured on the chip surface. Varying concentrations of hPCSK9 were placed into the flow solution using MgC¾ (3 M) for chip regeneration between cycles. For comparison, ATI- 1081 was captured on an anti-His antibody immobilized on a BIACORE® chip. Duplicate experiments for PRD460 were performed on different days. Kinetic determinations were performed at 25 °C. \n\n\nEvaluation of the kinetic parameters was performed using the 1 : 1 Binding algorithm on the BIACORE® Evaluation software. \n\n\n [00215] Under these conditions, ATI-1081 bound to human PCSK9 with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 6.7 nM at 25 °C and PRD460 bound to human PCSK9 with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 3.29 +/- 0.55 nM at 25 °C (Table 13). The off-rate determinations using this assay format may be artificially limited by the off-rate of the captured ligand from the immobilized capture antibody, thus the assay format using direct immobilization of PCSK9 is a more accurate reflection of dissociation constant (¾) for ATI-1081. \n\n\nTable 13 \n\n\n Kinetic Parameters for PRD460 and ATI-1081 \n\n\n Against Captured Human PCSK9 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCSK9 Binding FRET Assays \n\n [00216] Two fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based assays were used to determine the competitive binding potency of PRD460 and other Adnectins to hPCSK9. The PCSK9:EGFA FRET assay measures the binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR, using a soluble epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain-A (EGFA) peptide and recombinant human PCSK9. The PCSK9:ATI972 FRET assay measures competitive displacement by Adnectins of the biotinylated Adnectin, ATI-972, from PCSK9. \n\n\n[00217] In the PCSK9:EGFA FRET assay (at 5 nM PCSK9), PRD460 completely and potently displaced EGFA from the PCSK9 binding site with EC50 = 0.7 nM (Fig. 1, left panel). PRD460 was more potent in this assay than either ATI-1 174 (EC50 = 1.9 nM) or ATI-1081 (EC50 = 3.7 nM) (Fig. 14). The greater apparent potency of PRD460 in this assay may be explained by bivalent (2: 1) binding of Adnectin PRD460 to PCSK9 (theoretically) compared to monovalent (1 : 1) binding by ATI-1081 and ATI-1174. \n\n\n[00218] Using the PCSK9:ATI-972 FRET assay (at 5 nM human PCSK9), PRD460 inhibited with EC50 = 0.3 nM, compared to 0.8 nM for ATI-11 14 and 2.8 nm for ΑΤΊ- 1081 (Fig. 15). These findings indicate that PRD460 potently displaced the biotinylated Adnectin ATI-972 from its binding site on PCSK9. The higher potency of PRD460 relative to ATI-1081 and ATI-1 174 is consistent with bivalent binding by PRD460. \n\n\nInhibition of PCSK9-induced LDLR Depletion in HepG2 Cells \n\n\n[00219] Human PCSK9 promotes the depletion of LDLR from the surface of HepG2 cells. Pre-incubation of PCSK9 with PCSK9 Adnectins inhibits PCSK9 binding to LDLR and prevents the depletion of LDLR from the cell surface. This assay was used to measure the potency of ATI-1081, ATI-1174 and PRD460 to inhibit PCSK9 induced depletion of LDLR from the cell surface. \n\n\n[00220] A dilution series of PCSK9 Adnectins were pre-incubated with 10 nM human PCSK9 for 1 hr at 37 degrees, the pre-incubated mixture was added to HepG2 cells, and the cells were incubated for 24 hours. Following this incubation, the level of LDLR on HepG2 cells was measured using FACS analysis. The percentage of inhibition of PCSK9-induced LDLR depletion was calculated and graphed (Fig. 15). In this assay ATI-1081, ATI-1 174, and PRD460 inhibited PCSK9 with comparable EC50's (9nM, 8nM and 6nM respectively) although a leftward-shift of the response curve was consistently observed for PRD460. These EC50's represent the limit of the assay. \n\n PCSK9 Cell Entry Assay in HepG2 Cells \n\n\n [00221] PCSK9 binding to the LDLR on the surface of hepatocytes results in co- internalization of the LDLR-PCSK9 complex during LDLR endocytosis, leading to enhanced degradation of the LDLR. A cell-based assay was developed to measure LDLR-dependent cellular entry of fluorescent PCSK9. Human PCSK9 was covalently labeled using the fluorophore ALEXA FLUOR®-647(AF647). PCSK9-AF647 was incubated with HepG2 cells with or without PCSK9-Adnectins and the intracellular fluorescence was quantified by high content fluorescent microscopy and image analysis (Cellomics). Dependence of PCSK9-AF647 cell entry on LDLR endocytosis was established in preliminary experiments. HepG2 cells were incubated with 10 nM PCSK9- AF647 and varying levels of Adnectins for 4 hrs at 37 degrees. In this assay, potent inhibition of PCSK9-AF647 intracellular fluorescence was observed for PRD460 (EC50 = 6 nM) as well as for ATI- 1 174 (EC50 = 10 nM) (Fig. 16). These findings indicate that Adnectin PRD460 and ATI- 1174 effectively blocked the binding of PCSK9 to cell surface LDLR in a human hepatic-derived cell line in culture, thereby reducing the internalization of PCSK9-AF647 during LDLR endocytosis. \n\n\nIn Vivo Transgenic Mouse Study \n\n\n[00222] In vivo studies were conducted in the normal expresser hPCSK9 transgenic mouse model. Binding of Adnectins to PCSK9 in the plasma is predicted to result in a decrease in the measured amount of unbound (free) circulating PCSK9. The decrease in unbound PCSK9 is the initial pharmacodynamic event which results in inhibition of the PCSK9-LDLR interaction and in LDL cholesterol lowering. Administration of single doses of PRD460 (i.p. doses from 0.6 to 18 mg/kg) to the transgenic mice resulted in rapid, strong decreases in plasma unbound hPCSK9 levels (Fig. 17). Dose-dependent decreases in unbound PCSK9 were observed with ED50 <0.6 mg/kg at the 3 hr time point. These findings in the normal expresser human PCSK9 transgenic mouse model show that PRD460 binds strongly and potently to circulating hPCSK9 in vivo. \n\n\nIn Vivo Pharmacodynamics in Cynomolgus Monkeys \n\n [00223] The pharmacodynamic effects of PCSK9 Adnectin PRD460 were evaluated in normal lean cynomolgus monkeys. PRD460 was administered to monkeys by i.v. dosing at 15 mg/kg, and plasma samples were collected at time intervals over 4 wks for the assay of LDL-C and free PCSK9 levels. A single dose of PRD460 rapidly lowered plasma LDL-C levels in the monkeys, reaching an average maximum effect of 42% of baseline LDL-C (58% reduction; n = 3 monkeys) by day 3 after dosing (Fig. 18). LDL-C levels were reduced by 50% or more for a week at this dose, remaining significantly below baseline for 3 wks and returning to baseline by 4 wks. Total cholesterol showed a similar pattern but no effect on HDL was observed (not shown). Treatment with PRD460 caused an immediate drop to near zero (below the lower limit of quantitation) in the unbound, free form of plasma PCSK9 (Fig. 18). The free PCSK9 levels remained near the lower limits of detection for several days then gradually returned to baseline levels by the end of 4 wks, consistent with a cause/effect relationship with plasma LDL-C. The data indicate that plasma LDL lowering mirrored the drop in free PCSK9 levels, consistent with PCSK9 inhibition regulating LDLR function following treatment with PRD460 in vivo. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the plasma half-life of Adnectin PRD460 was approximately 70 hrs in this cynomolgus monkey study. These findings indicate that a PCSK9 Adnectin-Fc fusion protein is highly efficacious and fast-acting with robust, specific, and long-lasting effects on LDL-C lowering in the cynomolgus monkey model. \n\n\nIn Vivo Pharmacological Evaluation of the Unmodified PCSK9 Adnectin, ATI- 1081 \n\n\n[00224] In addition to modified Adnectins containing a PK moiety (e.g., PEGylated and Fc-fusion Adnectins), an unmodified (\"naked\") PCSK9 Adnectin can also be administered. Strategies for unmodified PCSK9 Adnectin treatment include more frequent dosing to accommodate the shorter PK half-life, or using an extended release subcutaneous formulation to increase the length of the absorption phase and extend the pharmacodynamic effect. Many such formulations can be envisioned including, as a simple example, propylene glycol/PBS solutions to delay the rate of absorption and increase the time of exposure to the Adnectin in the circulation. \n\n\n[00225] The unmodified Adnectin ATI- 1081 was administered to cynomolgus monkeys i.v. at 10 mg/kg in PBS vehicle. ATI-1 114 (PEGylated version of the same Adnectin) was also administered at 1 mg/kg in PBS as a comparator. ATI- 1081 elicited a \n\n rapid, transient inhibition of unbound circulating PCSK9 levels. Within 30 minutes the extent of initial inhibition approached 100% (below the limits of quantitation) before returning to baseline several hours later (Figure 19). Concurrently, a trend to lower LDL- C levels was observed over the first 24 hrs in the ATI- 1081 treated monkeys (Fig. 20). \n\n\n[00226] The unmodified Adnectin ATI- 1081 was also administered to the normal expresser hPCSK9 transgenic mice in a simple extended release subcutaneous formulation using 50:50 propylene glycokPBS vehicle (PG vehicle) compared to PBS vehicle. This formulation is expected to modestly delay the rate of Adnectin absorption and increase the exposure time to ATI- 1081 in the circulation, thus improving the pharmacodynamic response. Administration (intraperitoneal) of ATI-1081 at 1 mg/kg in PBS vehicle resulted in -50% lowering of unbound plasma PCSK9 at 3 hr, compared to >85% lowering for ATI-1 114 at 0.3 mg/kg (Fig. 21). In a second experiment in the transgenic mice, ATI-1081 administered by subcutaneous injection in PG vehicle resulted in nearly equivalent decreases in unbound LDL compared to ATI-1174, with an improved duration of effect over the first 6 hrs of the study (Fig. 22). These findings indicate that the unmodified PCSK9 Adnectin ATI-1081 when administered subcutaneous ly in a simple extended release vehicle bound to the target human PCSK9 in vivo and elicited the initial pharmacodynamic response. The time dependency of the response was consistent with extended release prolonging the duration of effect for the unmodified PCSK9 Adnectin. \n\n\nExample 5 \n\n\n Serum Albumin-Binding Adnectins (SABA) Example 5A. Screening and Selection of Candidate Serum Albumin-Binding Adnectin Overview \n\n\n [00227] A selection technique known as PROfusion (see e.g., Roberts et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94(23): 12297-12302 (1997) and WO 2008/066752) was applied to a DNA library with variable regions designed into the BC, DE and FG loops of \n10\nFn3. A random library of greater than 10\n13\n molecules was created from this design, and selection pressure was applied against a biotinylated form of HSA to isolate candidate serum albumin-binding Adnectin (SABA) with desirable binding properties. \n\n High Throughput Protein Production (HTTP) Process \n\n\n [00228] The various HSA binding Adnectins were purified using a high throughput protein production process (HTPP). Selected binders were cloned into pET9d vector containing a HIS6 tag and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Transformed cells were inoculated in 5 ml LB medium containing 50 μg/mL Kanamycin in a 24-well format and grown at 37 °C overnight. Fresh 5 ml LB medium (50 μg/mL Kanamycin) cultures were prepared for inducible expression by aspirating 200 μΐ from the overnight culture and dispensing it into the appropriate well. The cultures were grown at 37 °C until A\n6\noo 0.6-0.9. After induction with 1 mM isopropyl- -thiogalactoside (IPTG), the culture was grown for another 4 hours at 30 °C and harvested by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 3220 x g at 4 °C. Cell Pellets were frozen at -80 °C. \n\n\n [00229] Cell pellets (in 24-well format) were lysed by resuspension in 450 μΐ of Lysis buffer (50 mM NaH\n2\nP0\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, lx Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail-EDTA free (Roche), 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM CHAPS, 40 mM Imidazole, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 30 ug/ml DNAse, 2 ug/ml aprotonin, pH 8.0) and shaken at room temperature for 1 hour. Lysates were clarified and re-racked into a 96-well format by transfer into a 96-well Whatman GF/D U IFILTER® fitted with a 96-well, 650 μΐ catch plate and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 200 x g. The clarified lysates were transferred to a 96-well Ni-Chelating Plate that had been equilibrated with equilibration buffer (50 mM NaH\n2\nP0\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM CHAPS, 40 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0) and incubated for 5 min. Unbound material was removed. The resin was washed 2 x 0.3 ml/well with Wash buffer #1 (50 mM NaH\n2\nP0\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM CHAPS, 40 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0). Next the resin was washed with 3 x 0.3 ml/well with PBS. Prior to elution each well was washed with 50 μΐ Elution buffer (PBS + 20 mM EDTA), incubated for 5 min and this wash discarded by vacuum. Protein was eluted by applying an additional 100 ul of Elution buffer to each well. After 30 minute incubation at room temperature the plate(s) were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 200 x g and eluted protein collected in 96-well catch plates containing 5 μΐ of 0.5M MgCl\n2\n affixed to the bottom of the Ni-plates. Eluted protein was quantified using a BCA Protein assay with SGE (control Adnectin) as the protein standard. The SGE\n\n\nAdnectin is a wild-type \n10\nFn3 domain (SEQ ID NO: 1) in which integrin binding domain (amino acids RGD at positions 78-80) have been replaced with SGE. \n\n HSA, RhSA and MuSA Direct Binding ELISA \n\n\n [00230] For assaying direct binders to HSA, MaxiSorp plates (Nunc International, Rochester, NY) were coated with 10 ug/mL HSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in PBS at 4 °C overnight followed by blocking in casein block buffer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) for 1-3 hours at room temperature. For single-point screening assays, purified HTPP Adnectin were diluted 1 :20 in casein block buffer and allowed to bind to HSA in each well for 1 hour at room temperature. For dose response assays, concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM up to 1 μΜ were used. After washing in PBST to remove unbound \n\n\nAdnectins, anti-His mAb-HRP conjugate (R&D Systems, MN) diluted 1 :2500 in casein block buffer was added to the bound His-tagged Adnectin for 1 hour at room temperature. Excess conjugate was removed by washing with PBST and bound Adnectins detected using TMB detection reagents (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. \n\n\nAggregation Measurement by Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography \n\n\n[00231] Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on the SABAs resulting from the HTPP. SEC of HTPP derived material was performed using a SUPERDEX® 200 5/150 or SUPERDEX® 75 5/150 column (GE Healthcare) on an Agilent 1 100 or 1200 HPLC system with UV detection at A214 nm and A280 nm and with fluorescence detection (excitation = 280 nm, emission = 350 nm). A buffer of 100 mM sodium sulfate, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.8 at appropriate flow rate of the SEC column employed. Gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) were used for molecular weight calibration. \n\n\n[00232] The results of the SEC on the HTPP purified SABAs were shown to be predominantly monomeric and eluted in the approximate range of 10 kDa vs. globular Gel Filtration standards (BioRad). \n\n\nIdentification of Candidate Serum Albumin-Binding Adnectin (SABA) \n\n\n[00233] As a result of the screening for HSA/RhSA/MuSA binding and biophysical criteria, four unique serum albumin-binding Adnectins (SABA) were identified and chosen to have their half-lives evaluated in mice. In order to carry out in vitro and in vivo \n\n characterization, midscales were undertaken for the four SABAs. Table 6 provides the sequences of twenty-six unique SABA core sequences identified from PROfusion, designated as SABA 1-26. SABA4 had a scaffold mutation that was fixed prior to midscaling. The scaffold-perfect version of SABA4 is SABA5. SABA4 and SABA5 have identical sequences in the BC, DE, and FG loops. \n\n\nExample 5B. Production and Formulation of Candidate SABAs \n\n\nMidscale Protein Production of SABAs \n\n\n [00234] The selected SABAs described in Example 5A, followed by the His\n6\n tag, were cloned into a pET 9d vector and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (see Table 6 for each His-tagged SABA sequence designated SABA1.1, SABA2.1 , SABA3.1, and SABA5.1). 20 ml of an inoculum culture (generated from a single plated colony) was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 μg/mL Kanamycin. The culture was grown at 37 °C until Aeoo 0.6- 1.0. After induction with 1 mM isopropyl-β- thiogalactoside (IPTG) the culture was grown for another 4 hours at 30 °C and harvested by centrifugation for 30 minutes at >10,000 x g at 4 °C. Cell Pellets were frozen at -80 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 mL of lysis buffer (20 mM NaH\n2\nP0\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, lx Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail-EDTA free (Roche), pH 7.4) using an ULTRA-TURRAX® homogenizer (IKA works) on ice. Cell lysis was achieved by high pressure homogenization (>18,000 psi) using a Model M- l 10S MICROFLUIDIZER® (Microfluidics). The soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 23,300 x g at 4 °C. The supernatant was clarified via 0.45 μιη filter. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a HISTRAP® column (GE) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM NaH\n2\nP0\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4. The column was then washed with 25 column volumes of 20 mM NaH\n2\nP0\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4, followed by 20 column volumes of 20 mM NaH\n2\nP0\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 25mM imidazole pH 7.4, and then 35 column volumes of 20 mM NaH\n2\nP0\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 40 mM imidazole pH 7.4. Protein was eluted with 15 column volumes of 20 mM NaH\n2\nP0\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 500 mM imidazole pH 7.4, fractions pooled based on absorbance at A\n2\nso and dialyzed against lx PBS, 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl pH 8.5 or 50 mM NaOAc; 150 mM NaCl; pH 4.5. Any precipitate was removed by filtering at 0.22 μιη . \n\n [00235] Midscale expression and purification yielded highly pure and active Adnectins that were expressed in a soluble form and purified from the soluble fraction of the bacterial cytosol. SEC analysis on a SUPERDEX® 200 or SUPERDEX® 75 10/30GL in a mobile phase of 100 mM NaP0\n4\n, 100 mM NaS0\n4\n, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.8 (GE \n\n\nHealthcare) demonstrated predominantly monomeric Adnectins. \n\n\nFormulation of SABA 1.2 \n\n\n [00236] One specific SABA, SAB A 1.2 (SEQ ID NO: 41 1), was chosen for a preliminary formulation screen. SABA 1.2 comprises an (ED)s extension on the \"core 1\" sequence of \n10\nFn3 (see SEQ ID NO: 421 in Table 6). For SABA 1.2, a stable formulation of 10 mM succinic acid, 8% sorbitol, 5% glycine at pH 6.0 and at a product concentration of 5 mg/mL was identified. In this formulation the protein melting temperature was 75 °C as determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) using a protein concentration of 1.25 mg/mL. The formulation provided satisfactory physical and chemical stability at 4 °C and 25 °C, with an initial aggregate level at 1.2%. After one month of stability, the level of aggregation was very low (1.6% at 4 °C and 3.8% at 25 °C). The protein was also stable in this formulation after five cycles of freeze-thaw as transitioned from -80 °C and - 20 °C to ambient temperature. In addition, in this formulation SABA 1.2 was soluble to at least 20 mg/mL protein concentration at 4 °C and ambient temperature with no precipitation or increase in aggregation. \n\n\nExample 5C. Biophysical Characterization of Candidate SABAs \n\n\nSize Exclusion Chromatography \n\n\n [00237] Standard size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on the candidate SABAs resulting from the midscale process. SEC of midscaled material was performed using a SUPERDEX® 200 10/30 or on a SUPERDEX® 75 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) on an Agilent 1 100 or 1200 HPLC system with UV detection at A2i\n4\n nm and A280 nm and with fluorescence detection (excitation = 280 nm, emission = 350 nm). A buffer of 100 mM sodium sulfate, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.8 at appropriate flow rate of the SEC column employed. Gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) were used for molecular weight calibration. \n\n [00238] The results of the SEC on the midscaled purified SAB As showed \n\n\npredominantly monomeric Adnectin and elution in the approximate range of 10 kDa vs. globular Gel Filtration standards (BioRad) as showed. Thermostability \n\n\n [00239] Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analyses of the midscaled SAB As were performed to determine their respective T\nm\n's. A 1 mg/ml solution was scanned in a N-DSC II calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp) by ramping the temperature from 5 °C to 95 °C at a rate of 1 degree per minute under 3 atm pressure. The data was analyzed vs. a control run of the appropriate buffer using a best fit using Orgin Software (OrginLab Corp). The results of the SEC and DSC analyses are summarized in Table 14. \n\n\nTable 14 \n\n\n Summary of SEC and DSC Analyses on Candidate SABAs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5D. Characterization of Candidate SABA1 Binding to Serum Albumin \n\n\n[00240] The kinetics of selected SABA clones purified from HTPP and/or midscaled material described in Examples 5A and 5B were determined by capturing the respective serum albumin (HSA/RhSA/MuSA) on the surface of a Biasensor CM5 chip and flowing a concentration series of SABAs over both the reference flow cell and the captured albumins. In addition, binding to albumin was carried out under various pH conditions ranging from pH 5.5 to pH 7.4. HSA-binding Adnectins SABA2.1, SABA3.1, SABA4.1, and SABA 1.1 cross reacted with RhSA but did not cross react with MuSA. SABA2 and SABA4 binding is pH sensitive whereas clone SABA3 demonstrated pH resistance \n\n binding to HSA down to pH 6.0. SABAl .1 fits biochemical criteria for pH resistance and affinity/kinetics down to pH 5.5. \n\n\n [00241] Domain mapping was determined by BIACORE®. Selected SABA clones purified from HTPP and/or midscaled material were determined by capturing HSA or a construct consisting of just HSA-domain I & II or HSA-domain III on the surface of a Biasensor CM5 chip and flowing a concentration series of the SABAs over both the reference flow cell and the captured albumins. Clones SABA2 & SABAl bound to HSA and the HSA-domain I-II construct but not the HSA-domain III construct. Clones SAB A3 & SABA4 bound to HSA but not to either the HSA-domain I-II or HSA-domain III constructs. The results are summarized in Table 15. \n\n\nTable 15 \n\n\n Binding Affinity and Kinetics of Candidate SABAs (SABA 1.1, 2.1, 3.1 and 4.1) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5E. Examination of the in vivo tm of candidate SABAs \n\n\n [00242] The half-life of HSA in mice was determined to allow for evaluation of HSA- binding Adnectins in mice as the HSA-binding Adnectins do not cross react with MuSA. HSA was injected into the tail vein of approximately 6 week old Ncr nude female mice at a 20 mg/kg (Figure 23A) and 50 mg/kg dose (Figure 23B), and the concentration of HSA \n\n in blood samples taken at intervals post-injection was determined by ELISA. The t \n2\n of HSA injected into mice at 20 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg were determined to be ~24 hrs and ~20 hrs, respectively. Half-Life Determination of SABA 1 -4 in Mice \n\n\n [00243] One liter £. coli growth of HSA binding clones SABA 1.1, SABA2.1, SABA3.1, and SABA4.1 were prepared, purified and endotoxin removed. Each SABA variant was injected into the tail vein of mice, and the concentration in blood samples taken at intervals post- injection was determined by ELISA. \n\n\n[00244] The pharmacokinetic profiles of each SABA were compared in the presence or absence of HSA in approximately 6 week old Ncr nude female mice. The mice that were co-injected with HSA had the HSA premixed with each SABA (HSA in a 3-4 molar excess) because the binding clone was selective for HSA and RhSA and did not bind the mouse serum albumin. The half-life of SABA 1.1 (clone 1318H04) in mice plasma was 0.56 hours whereas the half-life of SABA1.1 co-injected with HSA was 5.6 hours, a ~ 10- fold increase in half life (Figure 24A). The half-life of SABA2.1 in mice plasma was 0.24 hours whereas the half-life of SABA2.1 co-injected with HSA was 2.8 hours, a ~12- fold increase in half life (Figure 24B). The half-life of SAB A3.1 (clone 1245H07) in mice plasma was 0.28 hours whereas the half-life of SABA3.1 co-injected with HSA was 0.53 hours, a ~2-fold increase in half life (Figure 24C). The half-life of SABA4.1 in mice plasma was 0.66 hours whereas the half-life of SABA4 co-injected with HSA was 4.6 hours, a ~7-fold increase in half life (Figure 24D). A summary of the present example is shown in Figure 25. Table 16 summarizes similar data for SABA1.1, SABA2.1, SABA3.1, and SABA5.1; comparison is made to half life in cyno, where available. \n\n\nTable 16 \n\n\n \n\n SABA2.1 2.8 hrs NA Loss of binding at pH <6.5\n\n\nSABA3.1 32 min NA Poor Tl/2 observed in mice \n\n\nHalf-Life Determination of SABAl.1 and SABA5.1 in Cynomolgous Monkeys \n\n\n [00245] A three week single dose proof of concept study of SABAl .1 (Figure 26A) and SABA5.1 (Figure 26B) was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys to assess pharmacokinetics at a 1 mg per kg (mpk) dose IV in 2 cynomolgus monkeys. The pharmacokinetics were evaluated using a quantitative ELISA-based assay that was developed to detect the Adnectin in plasma samples. SABAl .1 has a half-life in the range of 96-137 hours (Figure 26A and Table 17A). SABA5.1 has a half-life of approximately 12 hours and was only measureable in the ELISA up to 120 hours (Figure 26B). Table 17A summarizes data for SABA 1.1 ; Table 17B summarizes data for SABA5.1. \n\n\nTable 17A \n\n\n SABAl .1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 17B \n\n\n SABA5.1 \n\n\n \n\n Example 5F. Characterization of SABAl Binding to Serum Albumin SABAl.1 and 1.2 Binds to HSA and RhSA \n\n\n [00246] SABA 1.2, a \"core 1\" \n10\nFn3 comprising an (ED)\n5\n extension (SEQ ID NO: 421 in Table 6) bound to human serum albumin (HSA) at neutral pH and 25 °C with an average association rate constant (ka) of 8.21E+03 M\n'\nV\n1\n, and an average dissociation rate constant (kd) of 4.43E-04 s\n\"1\n, for a calculated average ¾ of 55.3 nM (Table 18). For rhesus serum albumin (RhSA), the measured average association rate constant was 6.6E+03 M\n'\nV\n1\n, and the dissociation rate constant was 3.78E-03 s\n\"1\n, giving a calculated average ¾ of 580 nM. No measurable interaction between SABA 1.2 and mouse or rat serum albumin could be observed up to 1 μΜ (Table 18 and Figure 27). At 37 °C, the ka and kd increased between 2 to 5-fold, leading to a ~2-fold increase in affinity for HSA and 1/2 the affinity for RhSA (Table 18). \n\n\nTable 18 \n\n\n Kinetic parameters for SABA 1.2 binding to albumins, in HBS-P buffer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00247] Additionally, a calorimetric titration was performed to determine the stoichiometry between SABAl and HSA. For this study, SABA 1.1, a \"core 1\" \n10\nFn3 comprising a His6 extension (SEQ ID NO: 420 in Table 6), was used. HSA (10 μΐ per injection of 1 15 μΜ protein solution) was injected into the calorimetric cell containing SABAl.1 at a concentration of 8.1 μΜ. The experiment was performed at 37 °C in PBS buffer pH 7.4. Figure 28 shows that SABAl .1 binds to HSA with 1 : 1 stoichiometry. \n\n SABA 1.2 Binds Potently to HSA at Low pH \n\n\n [00248] The long half-life of albumins (e.g., t\n1/2\n of HSA is 19 days ) is due in large part to the fact that they are recycled from an endocytic pathway by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor, FcRn, under the low pH conditions that exist inside the endosome. As shown in Table 19 SABA1.2 potently bound HSA at the endosomal pH of 5.5, suggesting that the ti/2 of SABA1, once bound to HSA, would also benefit from the FcRn recycling mechanism. \n\n\nTable 19 \n\n\n Comparison of Albumin Binding Kinetics at pH 7.4 and 5.5, in MES Buffer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSABA 1.2 Binds to Domains I and II of HSA, but not Domain III \n\n\n [00249] The binding site SABA 1.2 on albumin was mapped to the N-terminal domains I or II using recombinant HSA fragments and has no detectable binding to domain III (Figure 29). Because domain III is the domain of HSA that primarily interacts with FcRn, it is less likely that SABA 1.2 would compete for HSA binding to FcRn, again increasing the possibility of fully leveraging the recycling mechanism for enhanced half-life. \n\n\nExample 5 G. In Vivo Pharmacology of SABA 1.2 \n\n\n[00250] A four week single dose pre-toxicology study of SABA 1.2 was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys to assess pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity at two different dose levels. The pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity were also evaluated in a three- week, single-dose pre-toxicology study that included both intravenous and subcutaneous administration arms. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of SABA 1.2 was evaluated in two separate, single dose pre-toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys using a \n\n quantitative ELISA-based assay that was developed to detect SABA 1.2 in plasma samples. \n\n\n [00251] SABA1.2 was administered to monkeys at 1 mpk and 10 mpk IV. Non- compartmental analyses using WI ONLIN® software were performed to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters. As shown in Figure 30 and the parameters described below, SABA 1.2 exhibited dose-dependent pharmacokinetics in this study as determined by area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) evaluation. The clearance (CL) for SABA 1.2 at 10 mpk was 0.15 ml/hr/kg, the beta phase half-life (ti\n/2\n) was 143 hours, the volume of distribution (Vz) was 30 mL/kg, and total drug exposure (AUCall) was 5,609,457 hr*nmol/L (Table 20). The clearance (CL) for SABA 1.2 at 1 mpk was 0.4 ml/hr/kg, the half-life (ti\n/2\n) was 124 hours, the volume of distribution (Vz) was 72 mL/kg, and total drug exposure (AUCall) was 214,636 hr*nmol/L (Table 20). \n\n\n [00252] After SC or IV administration of SABA 1.2, the beta-phase pharmacokinetic profiles were similar (Figure 31). The clearance (CL) for SABA1.2 at 1 mpk IV was 0.22 ml/hr/kg, the beta phase half-life (ti\n/2\n) was 125 hours, the volume of distribution (Vz) was 40 mL/kg, and total drug exposure (AUCall) was 357,993 hr*nmol/L (Table 20). The clearance (CL) for SABA1.2 at 1 mpk SC was 0.32 ml/hr/kg, the beta phase half-life (ti\n/2\n) was 134 hours, the volume of distribution (Vz) was 62 mL/kg, and total drug exposure (AUCall) was 251,339 hr*nmol/L (Table 20). The SC relative bioavailability (F) compared to IV was 0.7. \n\n\nTable 20 \n\n\n Pharmacokinetic Parameters for SABA 1.2 in Monkeys"

Alzheimer's disease accounts for the majority of senile dementias and is a leading cause of death in adults (Anderson, R. N., Natl. Vital Stat. Rep. 49: \\-%l (2001), the teachings of which are incorporated herein in their entirety). Histologically, the brain of persons afflicted with Alzheimer's disease is \n\n\ncharacterized by a distortion of the intracellular neurofibrils and the presence of senile plaques composed of granular or filamentous argentophilic masses with an amyloid protein core, largely due to the accumulation of β-amyloid protein (Αβ) in the brain. Αβ \n\n\naccumulation plays a role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease (Selkoe, D.J., Nature 399: 23-31 (1999)) and is a proteolytic fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is cleaved initially by β-secretase followed by γ-secretase to generate Αβ (Lin, X., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97: 1456-1460 (2000); De Strapper, B., et al, Nature 397 :387-390 (1998)). Inhibitors of β-secretase are described in US 7,214,715; US 7,504,420; US \n\n\n2007/0032470; WO 2002/02520; WO 2002/02505; WO 2002/02512; WO 2002/02518; WO 2003/040096; WO 2003/050073; WO 2003/072535; WO 2004/043916; WO 2004/050619; WO 2004/080376; WO 2005/030709; WO 2006/034296; WO 2006/110668; WO \n\n\n2009/015369; WO 2009/042694; Stachel, S.J., /.

All isotopic variations of the compounds herein, whether radioactive or not, are contemplated. \n\n\n [0178] Included in all uses of the compounds disclosed herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2, and/or Table 1), is any or all of the stereochemical, enantiomeric, diastereomeric, conformational, rotomeric, tautomeric, isotopic, solvate, hydrate, salt, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds as described. \n\n\n//. General Synthetic Methods \n\n\n[0179] The compounds herein are synthesized by an appropriate combination of generally well-known synthetic methods. Techniques useful in synthesizing the compounds herein are both readily apparent and accessible to those of skill in the relevant art in light of the teachings described herein. The discussion below is offered to illustrate certain of the diverse methods available for use in assembling the compounds herein. However, the discussion is not intended to define the scope of reactions or reaction sequences that are useful in preparing the compounds herein. \n\n\n [0180] A method for synthesizing the inhibitor compounds described herein is by adapting the synthesis for N-((lR,2S)-l-hydroxy-3-phenyl-l-((R)-pyrrolidin-2-yl)propan-2-yl)-5-((R)- 2-(4-methylthiazol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-l-carbonyl)chroman-7-carboxamide (14) below. \n\n\n [0181] Scheme 1 shows an exemplary synthesis of a hydroxyamine pyrrolidine fragment (3). (S)-2-(dibenzylamino)-3-phenylpropan-l-ol (1) can be oxidized and the resulting aldehyde coupled with N-Boc-pyrrolidine in the presence of (-)-sparteine to form the \n\n coupling product (R)-tert-butyl 2-((lS,2S)-2-(dibenzylamino)-l-hydroxy-3- phenylpropyl)pyrrolidine-l-carboxylate (2). The coupling product can then be debenzylated under standard hydro genation conditions. The conditions for these reactions are as described in the Experimental section below. \n\n\n Schem \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n H\n2\n, Pd(OH)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3 \n\n\n[0182] Scheme 2 shows an exemplary synthesis of desired inhibitor 14. Diene 4 can be cyclized under olefin metathesis conditions to form chromene 5 which can then be hydrogenated to form chroman 6. Monoester hydrolysis followed by coupling with pyrrolidine 9 yields a mixture of esters 10 and 11. Chromatographic separation of the two esters followed by hydrolysis of the minor product yields carboxylic acid 12. This acid can then be coupled with the aforementioned pyrrolidine 3 to form the Boc protected product 13. Treatment with acid will then liberate the desired product N-((lR,2S)-l-hydroxy-3-phenyl-l- ((R)-pyrrolidin-2-yl)propan-2-yl)-5-((R)-2-(4-methylthiazol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-l- carbonyl)chroman-7-carboxamide (14). The conditions for these reactions are as described in the Experimental section below. \n\n Scheme 2: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0183] Compounds of formula (I), (II), (III), or any variations thereof may be synthesized following Scheme 2 using partially protected fused-isophthalate (e.g. dimethyl chroman-5,7- dicarboxylate or dimethyl 2,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenzo[b]oxepine-6,8-dicarboxylate) and an appropriate amine. The resultant intermediate is then coupled with an appropriate hydroxyamine pyrrolidine fragment (e.g. the pyrrolidine fragment prepared according to Scheme 1) and deprotected to form the final inhibitor. \n\n\n///. Beta-Secretase Inhibitor Activity \n\n\n[0184] To develop useful β-secretase inhibitors, candidate inhibitors capable of selectively mediating, e.g., decreasing, memapsin 2 catalytic activity may be identified in vitro and subsequently tested for their ability to reduce the production of Αβ. The activity of the inhibitor compounds can be assayed utilizing methods known in the art and/or those methods presented herein. \n\n\n [0185] Compounds that decrease memapsin 2 catalytic activity may be identified and tested using biologically active memapsin 2, either recombinant or naturally occurring. Memapsin 2 can be found in native cells, isolated in vitro, or co-expressed or expressed in a cell. \n\n\nMeasuring the reduction in the memapsin 2 catalytic activity in the presence of an inhibitor \n\n relative to the activity in the absence of the inhibitor may be performed using a variety of methods known in the art. \n\n\n [0186] For example, the compounds may be tested for their ability to cause a detectable decrease in hydrolysis of a β-secretase site of a peptide in the presence of memapsin 2. These data can be expressed, for example, as Kj, Kj apparent, V/V\no\n, or percentage inhibition. Kj is the inhibition equilibrium constant which indicates the ability of compounds to inhibit a given enzyme (such as memapsin 2, memapsin 1, and/or cathepsin D). Numerically lower K; values indicate a higher affinity of the compounds herein for the enzyme. The Kj value is independent of the substrate concentration, and converted from Kj apparent. \n\n\n[0187] K; apparent is determined in the presence of substrate according to established techniques (see, for example, Bieth, J., Bayer-Symposium V: Proteinase Inhibitors, pp. 463- 469, Springer- Verlag, Berlin (1994)). The standard error for the Kj apparent is the error from the nonlinear regression of the Vi/V\n0\n data measured at different concentrations of the compounds herein (e.g., between about 10 nM to about 1000 nM) employing well-known techniques (see, for example, Bieth, J., Bayer-Symposium V: Proteinase Inhibitors, pp. 463- 469, Springer- Verlag, Berlin (1994), Ermolieff, J., et al., Biochemistry 39:12450-12456 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). V/V\no\n depicts the ratio of initial conversion velocities of a substrate (Ermolieff, et ah, Biochemistry 40:12450-12456 (2000)) by an enzyme in the absence (V\n0\n) or presence (Vj) of an inhibitor. A VyV\no\n value of 1.0 indicates that a compound does not inhibit the enzyme at the \n\n\nconcentration tested. A Vi/V\n0\n value less than 1.0 indicates that a compound herein inhibits enzyme activity. \n\n\n [0188] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) are capable of reducing memapsin 2 beta-secretase activity. In some embodiments, the compounds have a memapsin 2 beta-secretase Kj and/or Kj apparent (e.g., using any inhibitory assay described herein) of less than about any one of 10 μΜ, 5 μΜ, 1 μΜ, or less than about any one of 750, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2, or 1 nM; or from about 1 to 5, 1 to 10, 1 to 100, 1 to 300, 1 to 500, 1 to 1000, 100 to 500, 200 to 500, 300 to 500, 100 to 750, 200 to 750, 300 to 750, 400 to 750, 500 to 750, 100 to 1000, 250 to 1000, 500 to 1000, or 750 to 1000 nM. In some embodiments, the compounds have a memapsin 2 beta-secretase K; and/or K; apparent (e.g., using any inhibitory assay described herein) of less than about 300, 301 to 500, or greater than 501 nM. \n\n [0189] Once compounds are identified that are capable of mediating, e.g., reducing, the hydrolysis of a β-secretase site of a peptide in the presence of memapsin 2, the compounds may be further tested for their ability to selectively inhibit memapsin 2 relative to other enzymes. Typically, the other enzyme is a peptide hydrolase, such as memapsin 1 or cathepsin D; or from another family of interest, such as Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Compounds that decrease cathepsin D catalytic activity or memapsin 1 catalytic activity are tested using biologically active enzyme, either recombinant or naturally occurring. Cathepsin D or memapsin 1 catalytic activity can be found in native cells, isolated in vitro, or co- expressed or expressed in a cell. Inhibition by a compound described herein is measured using standard in vitro or in vivo assays such as those well known in the art or as otherwise described herein. \n\n\n [0190] For example, selectivity of a compound may be measured by determining the extent to which memapsin 2 hydrolyzes a substrate peptide compared to the extent to which the same compound inhibits memapsin 1 and/or cathepsin D cleaving of a substrate peptide in the presence of the compound. Exemplary substrate peptides that are useful in determining the activity of memapsin 2 and or memapsin 1 include APP and derivatives thereof, such as FS-2 (MCA-SEVNLDAEFK-DNP; SEQ ID NO.: 2) (Bachem Americas, Torrance, CA). \n\n\nExemplary substrate peptides that are useful in determining the activity of cathepsin D include, for example, peptides which include the sequence MCA-GKPILFFRLK(DNP)-dR (SEQ ID NO.: 1). These substrate peptides can be synthesized using known peptide synthesis methods, e.g., solid-phase peptide synthesis (e.g., FMOC amino acid coupling etc.). These data can be expressed, for example, as Ki, Ki apparent, Vi/Vo, or percentage inhibition and depict the inhibition of a compound for memapsin 2 catalytic activity relative to memapsin 1 or cathepsin D catalytic activity. For example, if the K; of a reaction between an inhibitor compound herein and memapsin 1 or cathepsin D is 1000 and the Ki of a reaction between an inhibitor compound herein and memapsin 2 is 100, the inhibitor compound inhibits the β- secretase activity of memapsin 2 with ten-fold selectivity over memapsin 1 or cathepsin D. \n\n\n[0191] The compounds described herein may be capable of selectively inhibiting memapsin 2 over Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). CYP3A4 plays an important role in the \n\n\nmetabolism of xenobiotics. Inhibition of CYP3A4 can lead to unwanted drug-drug interactions by modulating the metabolism of other therapeutics. Many patients, particularly those patients in advanced age seeking treatment for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, are prescribed multiple therapeutics for various conditions, wherein drug-drug interactions \n\n caused by inhibition of CYPAA4 would be highly undesirable. Accordingly, the ability to selectively inhibit memapsin 2 over CYP3A4 (e.g. , not effect or minimally effect CYP3A4) may aid in decreasing unwanted drug-drug interacations leading to decreased toxicity and increased effectiveness of beta-secretase inhibitors. Some compounds described herein have been shown to exhibit strikingly selective inhibition of memapsin 2 in the presence of Cytochrome P450 3A4. \n\n\n [0192] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) are capable of selectively reducing memapsin 2 relative to memapsin 1, cathepsin D and/or CYP3A4. In some embodiments, the compounds are capable of selectively reducing memapsin 2 relative to memapsin 1, cathepsin D, and/or CYP3A4 with greater than about 2-fold selectivity, or greater than about any one of 3, 5, 7, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 300, 200, 500, 750, 1000, 2000, 5000, or 10000-fold selectivity. In some embodiments, the compounds have a memapsin 2 beta-secretase K; and/or K; apparent (e.g., using any inhibitory assay described herein) of less than about 10 μΜ, 5 μΜ, 1 μΜ, or less than about any one of 750, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 100, 75, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2, or 1 nM, or from about any of 1 to 5, 1 to 10, 1 to 100, 1 to 250, 1 to 500, 1 to 1000, 100 to 500, 200 to 500, 300 to 500, 100 to 750, 200 to 750, 250 to 750, 300 to 750, 400 to 750, 500 to 750, 100 to 1000, 250 to 1000, 500 to 1000, or 750 to 1000 nM; and have a memapsin 1 and/or cathepsin D Kj and/or Kj apparent of more than about 10 μΜ, 5 μΜ, 1 μΜ, or more than about any one of 750, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2, or 1 nM, or from about any of 1 to 5, 1 to 10, 1 to 100, 1 to 300, 1 to 500, 1 to 1000, 100 to 500, 200 to 500, 300 to 500, 100 to 750, 200 to 750, 300 to 750, 400 to 750, 500 to 750, 100 to 1000, 250 to 1000, 500 to 1000, or 750 to 1000 nM. In some embodiments, the compounds have a memapsin 2 beta-secretase Kj and/or Kj apparent (e.g., using any inhibitory assay described herein) of less than about 10 μΜ, 5 μΜ, 1 μΜ, or less than about any one of 750, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2, or 1 nM, or from about any of 1 to 5, 1 to 10, 1 to 100, 1 to 250, 1 to 500, 1 to 1000, 100 to 500, 200 to 500, 300 to 500, 100 to 750, 200 to 750, 250 to 750, 400 to 750, 500 to 750, 100 to 1000, 250 to 1000, 500 to 1000, or 750 to 1000 nM; and have a CYP3A4 K\n;\n and/or K\n;\n apparent of more than about 100 μΜ, 50μΜ, 25 μΜ, 10 μΜ, 5 μΜ, 1 μΜ, or more than about any one of 750, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2, or 1 nM, or from about any of 1 to 5, 1 to 10, 1 to 100, 1 to 300, 1 to 500, 1 to 1000, 100 to 500, 200 to 500, 300 to 500, 100 to 750, 200 to 750, 300 to 750, 400 to 750, 500 to 750, 100 to 1000, 250 to 1000, 500 to 1000, or 750 to 1000 nM. \n\n [0193] Compounds demonstrating the ability to cause a detectable decrease in hydrolysis of a \n\n\nβ-secretase site of a peptide in the presence of memapsin 2 (or, in addition, selectivity of action toward memapsin 2), may be tested in cell models or animal models for their ability to cause a detectable decrease in the amount or production of β-amyloid protein (Αβ). For example, isosteric inhibitors of memapsin 2 have been tested for their ability to decrease Αβ production in cultured cells (see U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040121947, International Application No. PCT/US02/34324 (Publication No. WO 03/039454), and International Application No. PCT/US06/13342 (Publication No. WO 06/110668, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference)). Briefly, inhibitors may be added to a culture of cells (e.g., human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, or neuroblastoma line SK-N-BE(2)) stably transfected if needed with a nucleic acid constructs that encode human APP and, if needed, a nucleic acid construct encoding human memapsin 2. Immunoprecipitation of Αβ followed by SDS-gel \n\n\nelectrophoresis allows detection and quantitation of the amount of Αβ produced in the presence and absence of inhibitor. \n\n\n [0194] In addition to cell cultures, animal models may be used to test inhibitors of memapsin 2 for their ability to decrease Αβ production. For example, an animal (e.g. , rat) may be administered an inhibitor orally or intravenously. The plasma may then be collected and Αβ levels determined by capture ELISA (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA). \n\n\n[0195] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) are capable of reducing cellular Αβ production. In some embodiments, the compounds are capable of reducing cellular Αβ production with a IC50 (e.g., using an Αβ inhibitory assay described herein) of less than about 10 μΜ, 5 μΜ, 1 μΜ, or less than about 750, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2, or 1 nM, or from about 1 to 5, 1 to 10, 1 to 100, 1 to 300, 1 to 500, 1 to 1000, 100 to 500, 200 to 500, 300 to 500, 100 to 750, 200 to 750, 300 to 750, 400 to 750, 500 to 750, 100 to 1000, 250 to 1000, 500 to 1000, or 750 to 1000 nM. In some embodiments, the compounds are capable of reducing cellular Αβ production with a IC50 (e.g., using an Αβ inhibitory assay described herein) of less than 1 μΜ, between 1 and 5 μΜ, or greater than 5 μΜ. \n\n\n[0196] The presence of inhibitors in organs of animal models or within cellular \n\n\ncompartments may be ascertained using a fluorescent tag conjugated to the inhibitor and visualization via confocal microscopy (see U.S. Patent Application Publication No. \n\n 20040121947, and International Application No. PCT/US02/34324 (Publication No. WO 03/039454), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirities). \n\n\n[0197] The sample obtained from the mammal can be a fluid sample, such as a plasma or serum sample; or can be a tissue sample or extract, such as a brain biopsy. The amount of β- amyloid protein or a decrease in the production of β-amyloid protein can be measured using standard techniques (e.g., western blotting and ELISA assays). \n\n\n [0198] Further examples of assays for identifying memapsin 2- -secretase inhibitors are set forth in the Examples section below. Other methods for assaying the activity of memapsin 2, memapsin 1, cathepsin D, and CYP3A4 and the activity of agents that decrease the activity of these enzymes are known in the art. The selection of appropriate assay methods is well within the capabilities of those of skill in the art, particularly in view of the teaching provided herein. \n\n\nIV. Hepatic intrinsic clearance in liver microsomes \n\n\n[0199] The compounds herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) may have one or more favorable pharmacokinetic properties. For example, the ability for a beta-secretase inhibitor compound to resist hepatic clearance in an individual will result in the compound being available as a therapeutic for a longer duration, which may aid in e.g., lower dosage and/or less frequent dosing. \n\n\nAccordingly, beta-secretase inhibitor compounds with decreased hepatic clearance may have the advantages of potentially decreasing toxicity and may improve patient compliance. Some compounds described herein have been shown to exhibit strikingly lower hepatic intrinsic clearance properties. For examples, N-((lR,2S)-l-hydroxy-3-phenyl-l-((R)-pyrrolidin-2- yl)propan-2-yl)-5-((R)-2-(4-methylthiazol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-l-carbonyl)chroman-7- carboxamide, N-((lR,2S)-l-hydroxy-3-phenyl-l-((R)-pyrrolidin-2-yl)propan-2-yl)-6-((R)-2- (4-methylthiazol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-l-carbonyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenzo[b]oxepine-8- carboxamide and N-((lR,2S)-l-hydroxy-3-phenyl-l-((R)-pyrrolidin-2-yl)propan-2-yl)-7- ((R)-2-(4-methylthiazol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-l-carbonyl)chroman-5-carboxamide were determined to have a hepatic intrinsic clearance in liver microsomes of approximately 38, 59 and 78 mL/min/kg respectively (see data below). \n\n\n [0200] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) have a hepatic intrinsic clearance in liver microsomes of less than any of about 1000 mL/min/kg, 900 mL/min/kg, 800 mL/min/kg, 700 mL/min/kg, 600 mL/min/kg, 500 mL/min/kg, 300 \n\n mL/min/kg , 200 mL/min/kg, 150 mL/min/kg, 100 mL/min/kg, 75 mL/min/kg, 50 \n\n\nmL/min/kg, or 25 mL/min/kg, as measured by LC/MS/MS (see Examples section for assay details). \n\n\nV. Oral Bioavailability \n\n\n[0201] The compounds herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) may have favorable oral absorption. Oral absorption is estimated as the area under the curve (AUC) of an active drug in systemic circulation following oral administration relative to the AUC of the same drug following intravenous administration. Thus beta-secretase inhibitor compounds with enhanced AUC after oral dosage may have superior oral absorption. Some compounds described herein have been shown to exhibit surprisingly high AUC after oral administration. For examples, N-((1R,2S)- l-hydroxy-3-phenyl-l-((R)-pyrrolidin-2-yl)propan-2-yl)-5-((R)-2-(4-methylthiazol-2- yl)pyrrolidine-l-carbonyl)chroman-7-carboxamide, N-((lR,2S)-l-hydroxy-3-phenyl-l-((R)- pyrrolidin-2-yl)propan-2-yl)-6-((R)-2-(4-methylthiazol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-l-carbonyl)-2,3,4,5- tetrahydrobenzo[b]oxepine-8-carboxamide and N-((lR,2S)-l-hydroxy-3-phenyl-l-((R)- pyrrolidin-2-yl)propan-2-yl)-7-((R)-2-(4-methylthiazol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-l-carbonyl)chroman- 5-carboxamide were measured to have AUC of 246, 149 and 195 hrng/ml respectively in 6 hours after 10 mg/kg of each drug was administered orally in rats. \n\n\n [0202] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) have an AUC more than any of about 10 hrng/ml, 50 hrng/ml, 100 hrng/ml, 200 hrng/ml, 500 hrng/ml, 1000 hrng/ml, 2000 hrng/ml, or 5000 hrng/ml, as measured in rat after an oral dose of 10 mg/kg of the drug is administered (see Examples section for assay details). \n\n\nVI. Formulations \n\n\n[0203] In another aspect, provided are formulations (e.g., pharmaceutical formulations) comprising a memapsin 2 β-secretase inhibitor compound(e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) with a carrier, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The formulations may include optical isomers, diastereomers, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the inhibitors disclosed herein. The memapsin 2 β-secretase inhibitor included in the formulation may be covalently attached to a carrier moiety, as described above. Alternatively, the memapsin 2 β-secretase inhibitor included in the formulation is not covalently linked to a carrier moiety. \n\n [0204] Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include water, salt solutions (such as Ringer's solution), alcohols, oils, gelatins and carbohydrates such as lactose, amylose or starch, fatty acid esters, hydroxymethycellulose, and polyvinyl pyrrolidine. Such \n\n\npreparations can be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents such as lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, coloring, and/or aromatic substances and the like which preferably do not deleteriously react with the intended compound of use. \n\n\n [0205] The compounds described herein can be administered alone or can be \n\n\ncoadministered to the individual. Coadministration is meant to include simultaneous or sequential administration of the compounds individually or in combination (more than one compound). Thus, the preparations can also be combined, when desired, with other active substances related to the treatment of a specified condition (e.g., to reduce metabolic degradation). \n\n\n [0206] The β-secretase inhibitors described herein(e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) can be prepared and administered in a wide variety of oral, parenteral and topical dosage forms. Thus, the compounds herein can be administered by injection (e.g. , intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, \n\n\nsubcutaneously, intraduodenally, or intraperitoneally). Also, the compounds described herein can be administered by inhalation, for example, intranasally. Additionally, the compounds herein can be administered transdermally. Compounds herein may also be administered locally (e.g. , ocular administration such as topical eye drops or ointment). It is also envisioned that multiple routes of administration (e.g. , intramuscular, oral, transdermal) can be used to administer the inhibitor compounds described herein. Accordingly, also provided are pharmaceutical formulations comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and one or more inhibitor compounds described herein(e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1). \n\n\n[0207] For preparing pharmaceutical formulations from the compounds described herein, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substance, which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material. \n\n\n[0208] In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid, which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having \n\n the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. \n\n\n [0209] The powders and tablets preferably contain from 5% to 70% of the active compound. Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium \n\n\ncarboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term \n\n\n\"preparation\" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with \n\n\nencapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with or without other carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. \n\n\nSimilarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. \n\n\n[0210] For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed \n\n\nhomogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify. \n\n\n[0211] Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water/propylene glycol solutions. For parenteral injection, liquid preparations can be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. \n\n\n[0212] When parenteral application is needed or desired, particularly suitable admixtures for the compounds herein are injectable, sterile solutions, preferably oily or aqueous solutions, as well as suspensions, emulsions, or implants, including suppositories. In particular, carriers for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of dextrose, saline, pure water, ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, peanut oil, sesame oil, polyoxyethylene-block polymers, and the like. Ampules are convenient unit dosages. The compounds herein can also be incorporated into liposomes or administered via transdermal pumps or patches. \n\n\nPharmaceutical admixtures suitable for use herein are well-known to those of skill in the art and are described, for example, in Pharmaceutical Sciences (17th Ed., Mack Pub. Co., Easton, PA) and WO 96/05309, the teachings of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference. \n\n\n [0213] Ocular administration preparations (e.g. , in use of glaucoma treatment) include, but are not limited to, formulations in saline, optionally with additional carriers, stabalizers, etc. know to those of skill in the art. \n\n\n [0214] Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizers, and thickening agents \n\n as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well-known suspending agents. \n\n\n [0215] Also included are solid form preparations, which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like. \n\n\n [0216] The pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form. In such form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. \n\n\n [0217] Also provided are unit dosage forms comprising the formulations described herein. These unit dosage forms can be stored in a suitable packaging in single or multiple unit dosages and may also be further sterilized and sealed. For example, the pharmaceutical formulation (e.g., a dosage or unit dosage form of a pharmaceutical formulation) may include (i) an in inhibitor (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) and (ii) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, the formulation also includes one or more other compounds (or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof). In various variations, the amount of inhibitor compound in the formulation is included in any of the following ranges: about 5 to about 50 mg, about 20 to about 50 mg, about 50 to about 100 mg, about 100 to about 125 mg, about 125 to about 150 mg, about 150 to about 175 mg, about 175 to about 200 mg, about 200 to about 225 mg, about 225 to about 250 mg, about 250 to about 300 mg, about 300 to about 350 mg, about 350 to about 400 mg, about 400 to about 450 mg, or about 450 to about 500 mg. In some embodiments, the amount of compound in the formulation (e.g., a dosage or unit dosage form containing any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) is in the range of about 5 mg to about 500 mg, such as about 30 mg to about 300 mg or about 50 mg to about 200 mg, of the compound. \n\n\n [0218] Some compounds may have limited solubility in water and therefore may require a surfactant or other appropriate co-solvent in the composition. Such co-solvents include: \n\n Polysorbate 20, 60 and 80; Pluronic F-68, F-84 and P-103; cyclodextrin; polyoxyl 35 castor oil; or other agents known to those skilled in the art. Such co-solvents are typically employed at a level between about 0.01 % and about 2% by weight. \n\n\n [0219] Viscosity greater than that of simple aqueous solutions may be desirable to decrease variability in dispensing the formulations, to decrease physical separation of components of a suspension or emulsion of formulation and/or otherwise to improve the formulation. Such viscosity building agents include, for example, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, chondroitin sulfate and salts thereof, hyaluronic acid and salts thereof, combinations of the foregoing, and other agents known to those skilled in the art. Such agents are typically employed at a level between about 0.01 and about 2% by weight. Determination of acceptable amounts of any of the above adjuvants is readily ascertained by one skilled in the art. \n\n\n [0220] The formulations described may additionally include components to provide sustained release and/or comfort. Such components include high molecular weight, anionic mucomimetic polymers, gelling polysaccharides and finely-divided drug carrier substrates. These components are discussed in greater detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,911,920; 5,403,841; 5,212,162; and 4,861,760. The entire contents of these patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes. \n\n\nA. Effective Dosages \n\n\n[0221] Pharmaceutical formulations described include formulations wherein the active ingredient (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) is contained in an effective amount, i.e., in an amount effective to achieve its intended purpose. The actual amount effective for a particular application will depend, inter alia, on the condition being treated. For example, when administered in methods to treat Alzheimer's disease, such compositions will contain an amount of active ingredient effective to achieve the desired result {e.g., decreasing β-secretase activity or β-amyloid production). Determination of an effective amount of a compound herein is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure herein. \n\n\n[0222] The dosage and frequency (single or multiple doses) administered to a mammal can vary depending upon a variety of factors, including a disease that results in increased activity of memapsin 2 or increased accumulation of β-amyloid protein, whether the mammal suffers from another disease, and its route of administration; size, age, sex, health, body weight, body \n\n mass index, and diet of the recipient; nature and extent of symptoms of the disease being treated (e.g. , Alzheimer's disease), kind of concurrent treatment, complications from the disease being treated or other health-related problems. Other therapeutic regimens or agents can be used in conjunction with the methods and compounds described herein. Adjustment and manipulation of established dosages (e.g. , frequency and duration) are well within the ability of those skilled in the art. \n\n\n [0223] For any compound described herein, the effective amount can be initially determined from cell culture assays. Target concentrations will be those concentrations of active compound(s) that are capable of reducing the activity of memapsin 2 activity, as measured using the methods described herein or known in the art. \n\n\n [0224] As is well known in the art, therapeutically effective amounts for use in humans can also be determined from animal models. For example, a dose for humans can be formulated to achieve a concentration that has been found to be effective in animals. The dosage in humans can be adjusted by monitoring memapsin 2 inhibition and adjusting the dosage upwards or downwards, as described above. Adjusting the dose to achieve maximal efficacy in humans based on the methods described above and other methods as are well-known in the art is well within the capabilities of the ordinarily skilled artisan, particularly in view of the teaching provided herein. \n\n\n [0225] Dosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the individual and the compound being employed. The dose administered to an individual, should be sufficient to affect a beneficial therapeutic response in the individual over time. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects. \n\n\nDetermination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. In one embodiment, the dosage range is 0.001% to 10% w/v. In another embodiment, the dosage range is 0.1% to 5% w/v. \n\n\n[0226] Additional examples of dosages which can be used are an effective amount within the dosage range of about 0.1 g/kg to about 300 mg/kg, or within about 1.0 g/kg to about 40 mg/kg body weight, or within about 1.0 g/kg to about 20 mg/kg body weight, or within about 1.0 g/kg to about 10 mg/kg body weight, or within about 10.0 μg/kg to about 10 mg/kg body weight, or within about 100 μg/kg to about 10 mg/kg body weight, or within about 1.0 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg body weight, or within about 10 mg/kg to about 100 \n\n mg/kg body weight, or within about 50 mg/kg to about 150 mg/kg body weight, or within about 100 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg body weight, or within about 150 mg/kg to about 250 mg/kg body weight, or within about 200 mg/kg to about 300 mg/kg body weight, or within about 250 mg/kg to about 300 mg/kg body weight. Other dosages which can be used are about 0.01 mg/kg body weight, about 0.1 mg/kg body weight, about 1 mg/kg body weight, about 10 mg/kg body weight, about 20 mg/kg body weight, about 30 mg/kg body weight, about 40 mg/kg body weight, about 50 mg/kg body weight, about 75 mg/kg body weight, about 100 mg/kg body weight, about 125 mg/kg body weight, about 150 mg/kg body weight, about 175 mg/kg body weight, about 200 mg/kg body weight, about 225 mg/kg body weight, about 250 mg/kg body weight, about 275 mg/kg body weight, or about 300 mg/kg body weight. Compounds herein may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided dosage of two, three or four times daily. \n\n\n[0227] Utilizing the teachings provided herein, an effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimen can be planned which does not cause substantial toxicity and yet is entirely effective to treat the clinical symptoms demonstrated by the particular individual. This planning should involve the careful choice of active compound by considering factors such as compound potency, relative bioavailability, individual body weight, presence and severity of adverse side effects, preferred mode of administration and the toxicity profile of the selected agent. \n\n\nB. Kits \n\n\n[0228] Also provided are kits for administration of the compounds described herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1, formulations, and dosage forms thereof). \n\n\n [0229] In certain embodiments the kits may include a dosage amount of at least one formulation as disclosed herein. Kits may further comprise suitable packaging and/or instructions for use of the formulation. Kits may also comprise a means for the delivery of the formulation thereof. \n\n\n [0230] The kits may include other pharmaceutical agents for use in conjunction with the one or more compounds described herein(e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1). In some variations, the pharmaceutical agent(s) may be one or more anti-psychotic drugs. These agents may be provided in a separate form, or mixed with the compounds described herein, provided such mixing does not reduce the effectiveness of either the pharmaceutical agent or compound described herein and \n\n is compatible with the route of administration. Similarly the kits may include additional agents for adjunctive therapy or other agents known to the skilled artisan as effective in the treatment or prevention of the conditions described herein. \n\n\n [0231] The kits may optionally include appropriate instructions for preparation and administration of the composition, side effects of the composition, and any other relevant information. The instructions may be in any suitable format, including, but not limited to, printed matter, videotape, computer readable disk, optical disc or directions to internet-based instructions. \n\n\n [0232] In another aspect, provided are kits for treating an individual who suffers from or is susceptible to the conditions described herein, comprising a first container comprising a dosage amount of a formulation as disclosed herein, and instructions for use. The container may be any of those known in the art and appropriate for storage and delivery of intravenous formulation. In certain embodiments the kit further comprises a second container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, adjuvant, etc. for preparation of the composition to be administered to the individual. \n\n\n [0233] Kits may also be provided that contain sufficient dosages of the inhibitor (including formulation thereof) as disclosed herein to provide effective treatment for an individual for an extended period, such as 1-3 days, 1-5 days, a week, 2 weeks, 3, weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months or more. \n\n\n[0234] Kits may also include multiple doses of the compound and instructions for use and packaged in quantities sufficient for storage and use in pharmacies, for example, hospital pharmacies and compounding pharmacies. \n\n\n [0235] The kits may include the compounds as described herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) packaged in either a unit dosage form or in a multi-use form. The kits may also include multiple units of the unit dose form. In certain embodiments, provided are the compound described herein in a unit dose form. In other embodiments the compositions may be provided in a multi-dose form (e.g., a blister pack, etc.). \n\n\nC. Toxicity \n\n\n[0236] The ratio between toxicity and therapeutic effect for a particular compound is its therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio between LD\n50\n (the amount of compound lethal in 50% of the population) and ED\n50\n (the amount of compound effective in 50% of the population). Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. Therapeutic \n\n index data obtained from cell culture assays and/or animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosages for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds preferably lies within a range of plasma concentrations that include the ED\n50\n with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. See, e.g., Fingl et al, In: THE PHARMACOLOGICAL BASIS OF \n\n\nTHERAPEUTICS, Ch.l, p.l, 1975. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the individual's condition and the particular method in which the compound is used. \n\n\nVII. Methods of Reducing the Activity of Memapsin 2 Beta-Secretase \n\n\n[0237] In another aspect, the β-secretase inhibitor compounds herein can be employed in methods to decrease memapsin 2 activity, decrease hydrolysis of a β-secretase site of a memapsin 2 substrate, and/or decrease the accumulation of β-amyloid protein relative to the amount of memapsin 2 activity, hydrolysis of a β-secretase site, and accumulation of β- amyloid protein, respectively, in the absence of the β-secretase inhibitor. \n\n\n[0238] In an exemplary embodiment, a method of reducing memapsin 2 activity is provided. The method includes contacting a memapsin 2 with a β-secretase inhibitor compound herein. The memapsin 2 may be contacted in any appropriate environment (e.g., in vitro, in vivo). The memapsin 2 activity is decreased relative to the amount of activity in the absence of β-secretase inhibitor. \n\n\n [0239] In another exemplary embodiment, a method is provided of selectively mediating (e.g., reducing) memapsin 2 activity using an inhibitor described herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1). Selective reduction of the activity of memapsin 2 means that memapsin 2 is not only reduced relative to its activity in the absence of inhibitor, but is reduced to a greater extent as compared to the reduction in activity due to inhibitor action against another enzyme, such as a peptide hydrolase (e.g., cathepsin D, memapsin 1) and/or Cytochrome P450 3A4. For example, as described above, the reduction in activity of an enzyme may be expressed in terms of the inhibitory constant (K\n;\n). Where an inhibitor selectively reduces the activity of memapsin 2, the Kj of the reaction between an inhibitor compound described herein and memapsin 2 is less than the Kj of the reaction between an inhibitor compound herein and another peptide hydrolase and/or Cytochrome P450 3A4. \n\n\n [0240] In some embodiments, the K; of the reaction between an inhibitor compound (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) and \n\n memapsin 2 is less than the K; of the reaction between an inhibitor compound and another peptide hydrolase (e.g. , cathepsin D, memapsin 1). In some related embodiments, the inhibitor selectively reduces the activity of memapsin 2 as compared to memapsin 1. In other related embodiments, the inhibitor selectively reduces the activity of memapsin 2 as compared to cathepsin D. In some embodiments, the K; of the reaction between an inhibitor compound (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) and memapsin 2 is less than the Kj of the reaction between an inhibitor compound and Cytochrome P450 3A4. In an exemplary embodiment, the Kj of the reaction between an inhibitor compound herein and memapsin 2 is at least 2 times less than the K; of the reaction between an inhibitor compound herein and another peptide hydrolase and/or Cytochrome P450 3A4. In another exemplary embodiment, the Kj of the reaction between an inhibitor compound herein and memapsin 2 is at least 3, 5, 7, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 300, 200, 500, 750, 1000, 2000, 5000, or 10000 times less than the K\n;\n of the reaction between an inhibitor compound herein and another peptide hydrolase and/or Cytochrome P450 3A4. \n\n\n[0241] Thus, provided are methods of selectively reducing the activity of memapsin 2. The methods include contacting a memapsin 2 with a β-secretase inhibitor compound (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1). In a related embodiment, the method includes contacting the memapsin 2 with a β-secretase inhibitor in the presence of memapsin 1. In an alternative related embodiment, the method includes contacting the memapsin 2 with a β-secretase inhibitor in the presence of cathepsin D. In yet another related embodiment, the method includes contacting the memapsin 2 with a β-secretase inhibitor in the presence of cathepsin D and memapsin 1. In yet another embodiment, the method includes contacting the memapsin 2 with a β-secretase inhibitor in the presence of Cytochrome P450 3A4. In still another related embodiment, the method includes contacting the memapsin 2 with a β-secretase inhibitor in the presence of cathepsin D, memapsin 1, and Cytochrome P450 3A4. \n\n\n [0242] In some embodiments, the activity of memapsin-2 β-secretase may be determined by measuring the hydrolysis of a β-secretase site of a β-secretase substrate. Thus, described are methods of decreasing the hydrolysis of a β-secretase site of a β-secretase substrate by contacting a memapsin 2 with a β-secretase inhibitor compound (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1). In some \n\n\nembodiments, the hydrolysis of a β-secretase site is decreased relative the amount of hydrolysis in the absence of the inhibitor. In other embodiments, the hydrolysis is selectively \n\n reduced as compared to hydrolysis by memapsin 1 and/or cathepsin D. Thus, a method of selectively decreasing hydrolysis of a β-secretase site of a β-amyloid precursor protein relative to memapsin 1 and/or cathepsin D in a sample is provided. The method includes contacting a memapsin 2 with a β-secretase inhibitor compound. \n\n\n[0243] In another embodiment, provided are methods of decreasing the amount of β- amyloid protein in a sample by contacting the memapsin 2 with an inhibitor compound (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1). The amount of β-amyloid protein in a sample is decreased relative the amount of β-amyloid protein in the sample in the absence of the inhibitor. Thus, the accumulation of β-amyloid protein is thereby decreased. \n\n\n [0244] Memapsin 2 may be contacted in any suitable environment or any suitable sample. For example, memapsin 2 may be contacted in vitro, within a cell, or within a mammal. \n\n\nTypically, in vitro solutions are selected such that the components do not substantially interfere with the enzymatic activity of memapsin 2 (e.g., aqueous solutions). In some embodiments, the in vitro solution includes a biological sample, such as a mammalian sample. Exemplary mammalian samples include plasma or serum samples and tissue samples or extracts, such as a brain biopsy. Any appropriate cell or cellular sample may be selected in which to contact the memapsin 2 with the inhibitor. The cell may contain endogenous memapsin 2 or recombinant memapsin 2 as previously described (see U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040121947 (the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference), and International Application No. PCT/US02/34324 (Publication No. WO 03/039454)). Exemplary cells include human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, or neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE(2) (ATCC number CRL- 2271), Hela cells, 293 cells. In an exemplary embodiment, the compounds herein are administered to a mammal to inhibit the hydrolysis of a β-secretase site of a β-amyloid precursor protein (e.g., a mouse, rat or human). \n\n\nVIII. Methods of Treating Alzheimer's Disease \n\n\n[0245] In another aspect, the β-secretase inhibitor compounds herein can be employed in the treatment of diseases or conditions associated with and/or mediated by β-secretase activity, hydrolysis of a β-secretase site of a β-amyloid precursor protein, and/or β-amyloid protein accumulation. Typically, a mammal is treated for the disease or condition. In an exemplary embodiment, the disease is Alzheimer's disease. \n\n [0246] Thus, in some embodiments, provided are methods of treating Alzheimer's disease in a mammal comprising the step of administering to the mammal in need thereof an effective amount of a β-secretase inhibitor (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1). In some embodiments, the individual has one or more symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. In some embodiments, the individual has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The mammals treated with the inhibitors may be human primates, nonhuman primates or non-human mammals (e.g., rodents, canines). In one embodiment, the mammal is administered a compound herein that reduces β-secretase activity (inhibits memapsin 1 and memapsin 2 activity). In another embodiment, the mammal is administered a compound that selectively reduces memapsin 2 activity. In a related embodiment, the compound has minimal or no effect on reducing memapsin 1 activity. Therefore, also provided is a method of treating Alzheimer's disease in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a β-secretase inhibitor compound. In an exemplary embodiment, the β-secretase inhibitor compound is part of a pharmaceutical formulation, as described above. \n\n\n [0247] The inhibitor compounds herein can be employed in the treatment of diseases or conditions in an individual associated with β-secretase activity (e.g., memapsin 2 activity), which can halt, reverse or diminish the progression of the disease or condition, in particular Alzheimer's disease. In some embodiments, the individual has one or more symptoms of the disease or condition associated with β-secretase activity. In some embodiments, the individual has been diagnosed with disease or condition associated with β-secretase activity. In addition to compounds that decrease memapsin 2 activity, compounds that selectively reduce memapsin 2 activity are useful to treat diseases or conditions or biological processes associated with memapsin 2 activity rather than diseases or conditions or biological processes associated with both memapsin 2 activity and another peptide hydrolase (such as cathepsin D or memapsin 1). \n\n\n [0248] For example, both memapsin 1 and memapsin 2 cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) at a β-secretase site to form β-amyloid protein (also referred to herein as Αβ or β-amyloid protein). Thus, both memapsin 1 and memapsin 2 have β-secretase activity (Hussain, I., et ah, J. Biol. Chem. 27<5:23322-23328 (2001)). However, the β-secretase activity of memapsin 1 is significantly less than the β-secretase activity of memapsin 2 (Hussain, I., et ah, J. Biol. Chem. 27<5:23322-23328 (2001)). Memapsin 2 is localized in the brain, and pancreas, and other tissues (Lin, X., et ah, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 97: 1456- \n\n 1460 (2000)) and memapsin 1 is localized preferentially in placentae (Lin, X., et ah, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 97: 1456-1460 (2000)). Alzheimer's disease is associated with the accumulation of Αβ in the brain as a result of cleaving of APP by β-secretase (also referred to herein as memapsin 2, ASP2 and BACE). Thus, methods employing the compounds which selectively inhibit memapsin 2 activity relative to memapsin 1 activity may be important in the treatment of memapsin 2-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Selective inhibition of memapsin 2 activity makes the compounds herein suitable drug candidates for use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. \n\n\nIX. Methods of Treating Glaucoma \n\n\n[0249] In another aspect, the β-secretase inhibitor compounds herein can be employed in the treatment of diseases associated with vision loss (e.g., glaucoma). In some embodiments, provided are methods of treating glaucoma (e.g. closed-angle glaucoma and open-angle glaucoma) in an individual comprising the step of administering to the individual in need thereof an effective amount of the β-secretase inhibitors herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1). In an exemplary embodiment, the β-secretase inhibitor compound is part of a pharmaceutical formulation, as described above. \n\n\n [0250] In some aspects, the inhibitor compounds herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) can be employed in the treatment of diseases or conditions associated with β-secretase activity, which can halt, reverse or diminish the progression of glaucoma (e.g. closed-angle glaucoma and open-angle glaucoma). In some embodiments, the inhibitor compounds herein can be used to halt, reverse or diminish the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In other embodiments, compounds herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) are employed to improve or decrease intraocular pressure (IOP). \n\n\n[0251] Compounds desribed herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) may be used to treat glaucoma by one of several known routes of administration, including, but not limited to, orally (e.g., in tablet or capsule form), parenterally (e.g., injected into the anterior chamber, intravenous, \n\n\nintramuscular, or subcutaneous), or locally (e.g., topical eye drops or ointment). Compounds herein may also be formulated for sustained release during glaucoma treatment. \n\n [0252] Additional embodiments for treating glaucoma with compounds herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) are described by adapting one or more of the methods in Guo, et. al.

Methods of Administering Beta-Secretase Inhibitors to the CNS \n\n\n[0253] The inhibitor compounds of herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1) may be administered to the CNS through either invasive or non-invasive methods. Non-invasive methods of administration include those methods that do not require the use of a mechanical or physical means to breach the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Typically, non-invasive methods include the use of \n\n\nimmunoliposomes, blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), or the olfactory pathway. \n\n\n[0254] Immunoliposomes are liposomes with antibodies or antibody fragments that bind to receptors or transporters expressed on brain capillary endothelial cells attached to the surface of the liposome. An exemplary immunoliposome combines polymer (e.g., PEGylation) technology with that of chimeric peptide technology. For example, the β-secretase inhibitor may be packaged into a unilamellar lipid vesicle containing a PEG\n2000\n derivative that contains a reactive groups at one end, for attachment to a complementary reactive group of an antibody or fragment thereof. Complementary reactive groups are well known in the art and, include, fro example, amine and activated carboxylic acids, thiols and maleimides, and the like (Ambikanandan et al., J. Pharm Pharmaceut Sci 6(2):252-273 (2003); Huwyler et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93: 14164-14169 (1996); and Huwyler et al., J Pharmcol Exp Ther. 282: 1541-1546 (1997); and U.S. Pat. No. 6,372,250, all of which are herein \n\n\nincorporated by reference for all purposes in their entirety). \n\n\n [0255] Blood-brain barrier disruption is a temporal loss of the integrity of the tight junctions between endothelial cells that comprise the blood brain barrier. Typically, the compound is administered via systemic or intercarotid injection in conjuction with transient blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD). Exemplary agents useful for inducing BBBD include solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); ethanol (EtOH); metals (e.g., aluminum); X- irradiation; induction of pathological conditions (e.g., hypertension, hypercapnia, hypoxia, or ischemia); anti-neoplastic agents (e.g., VP-16, cisplatin, hydroxyurea, flurouracil and etoposide); or concurrent systemic administration of the convulsant drug metrazol and the \n\n anti-convulsant drug pentobarbital (Ambikanandan et al., J. Pharm Pharmaceut Sci 6(2):252- 273 (2003)); vasoactive leukotrienes (Black et al., J Neurosurg, 81(5):745-751 (1994)); intracarotid infusion of bradykinin, histamine, or the synthetic bradykinin compound RMP-7 (Miller et al., Science 297: 1116-1118 (2002), Matsukado, et al., Neurosurgery 39: 125-133 (1996), Abbott, et al., Mol Med Today 2: 106-113 (1996), Emerich et al., Clin Pharmacokinet 40: 105-123 (2001)); hyaluronidase (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20030215432, Kreil, et al. Protein Sci., 4(9): 1666-1669 (1995)); and intercarotid injection of inert hypertonic solutions such as mannitol, or arabinose (Neuwelt, E.A., et al., in Neuwelt EA (ed), Implications of the Blood Brain Barrier and its Manipulation: Clinical Aspects. Vol. 2, Plenum Press, New York, (1989), Neuwelt, et al., J Nucl Med, 35: 1831-1841 (1994), Neuwelt et al., Pediatr Neurosurg 21: 16-22 (1994), Kroll et al., Neurosurg, 42: 1083-1099 (1998), Rapoport, Cell Mol Neurobiol 20:217-230 (2000), and Doran et al., Neurosurg 36:965-970, (1995)). \n\n\n [0256] Olfactory pathway administration is the intranasal delivery of the compound to the olfactory nerves in the upper third of the nasal passages. After intranasal delivery, the compound is transported back along the sensory olfactory neurons to yield significant concentrations in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and olfactory bulb (Thorne et al., Brain Res, 692(l-2):278-282 (1995); Thorne et al., Clin Pharmacokinet 40:907-946 (2001); Ilium, Drug Discov 7¾< 7: 1184-1189 (2002); U.S. Pat. 6,180,603; U.S. Pat. 6,313,093; and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20030215398). \n\n\n [0257] Invasive methods of administration are those methods that involve a physical breach of the blood-brain barrier typically through a mechanical or physical means to introduce the compound into the CSF, or directly into the parenchyma of the brain. Typically, invasive methods of administration may include injection or surgical implantation of the compound. \n\n\n[0258] In injection methods, a needle is used to physically breach the BBB and deliver the compound directly into the CSF. Exemplary injection methods include intraventricular, intrathecal, or intralumbar routes of administration and may also involve infusion of the compound through a reservoir external to the body (Krewson et al., Brain Res 680: 196-206 (1995); Harbaugh et al., Neurosurg. 23(6):693-698 (1988); Huang et al., J Neurooncol 45:9- 17 (1999); Bobo et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91:2076-2082 (1994); Neuwalt et al., Neurosurg. 38(4): 1129-1145 (1996)). \n\n\n [0259] In surgical implantation methods, the compound is placed directly into the parenchyma of the brain. Exemplary surgical implantation methods may include \n\n\nincorporation of the compound into a polyanhydride wafer placed directly into the \n\n interstitium of the brain (Bremet al., Sci Med 3(4): 1-11 (1996); Brem et al., J Control Release 74:63-67 (2001)). \n\n\nX. Crystallized Complexes \n\n\n[0260] In another aspect, is provided a crystallized complex containing a memapsin 2 protein and a β-secretase inhibitor herein. Memapsin 2 proteins useful in forming co-crystals with isostere compounds (e.g., memapsin 2 protein fragments, transmembrane proteins, etc.) have been previously discussed in detail (see U.S. Patent Application Publication No. \n\n\n20040121947, and International Application No. PCT/US02/34324 (Publication No. WO 03/039454)). These memapsin 2 proteins are equally useful in forming crystallized complexes with β-secretase inhibitors described herein (e.g., any compound of formula I, II, III, or any variations thereof, Example 2 and/or Table 1). \n\n\n [0261] The crystallized complex may be formed employing techniques described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040121947, and International Application No. \n\n\nPCT/US02/34324 (Publication No. WO 03/039454). Briefly, a nucleic acid construct encoding the protein is generated, is expressed in a host cell, such as a mammalian host cell (e.g., Hela cell, 293 cell) or a bacterial host cell (e.g., E. coli), is purified and is crystallized with a compound or compounds herein. The diffraction resolution limit of the crystallized protein can be determined, for example, by x-ray diffraction or neutron diffraction techniques. \n\n\n [0262] In an exemplary embodiment, the crystallized protein may have an x-ray diffraction resolution limit not greater than about 4.0 Δ (angstroms). The crystallized protein may also have an x-ray diffraction resolution limit not greater than about 4.0 Δ, about 3.5 Δ, about 3.0 Δ, about 2.5 Δ, about 2.0 Δ, about 1.5 Δ, about 1.0 Δ, or about 0.5 Δ (angstroms). In some embodiments, the crystallized protein may also have an x-ray diffraction resolution limit not greater than about \n\n\n 2 Δ (angstroms). The diffraction resolution limit of the crystallized protein can be determined employing standard x-ray diffraction techniques. \n\n\n [0263] In another exemplary embodiment, the β-secretase inhibitor of the crystallized complex is in association with said protein at an S\n3\n' binding pocket, an S\n4\n' binding pocket and/or an S\n4\n binding pocket. S\n3\n', S\n4\n', and S\n4\n binding pockets are discussed in detail in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040121947, and International Application No. \n\n\nPCT/US02/34324 (Publication No. WO 03/039454). \n\n [0264] The terms and expressions which have been employed herein are used as terms of description and not of limitation, and there is no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding equivalents of the features shown and described, or portions thereof, it being recognized that various modifications are possible. Moreover, any one or more features of any embodiment described herein may be combined with any one or more other features of any other embodiment described herein, without departing from the envisioned scope. For example, the features of the β-secretase inhibitors described herein are equally applicable to the methods of treating disease states and/or the pharmaceutical formulations described herein. All publications, patents, and patent applications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. \n\n\nXI. Examples \n\n\nExample 1: Preparation of Selected Beta-Secretase Inhibitors and Precursor Compounds \n\n\n[0265] The described synthesis of Beta-Secretase inhibitors and precursor compounds is related to WO 2006/110668, filed on 4/10/2006 and entitled \"Compounds Which Inhibit Beta-Secretase Activity and Methods of Use Thereof,\" the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and particularly with respect to the synthetic methods described therein, e.g., paragraphs 150-153 and paragraphs 215-285; and United States Provisional Patent Application No. 60/952,198, filed on 07/26/2007 and entitled \n\n\n\"Compounds Which Inhibit Beta-Secretase Activity and Methods of Use Thereof,\" the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and particularly with respect to the synthetic methods described therein, e.g., paragraphs 83-86 and paragraphs 161-354. \n\n\n [0266] The precursor compounds synthesized below are useful in the methods of making compounds provided herein. Using the guidance provided, (for example, in the Exemplary Syntheses of Scheme 1) one skilled in the art will immediately recognize that the exemplified synthesis of the below precursor compounds may be modified using well known techniques and the teaching provided herein to arrive at a wide variety of inhibitor compounds (e.g., compounds of Example 2). Certain starting materials described, and some precursor compounds not described, may be commercially available and purchased from, for example, Sigma- Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, or Ryan Scientific. \n\n [0267] NMR spectra were collected on a Varian Mercury model VX-300 NMR spectrometer. NMR solvent were purchased from Cambrige Isotope Laboratories. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm and coupling constants (J) are reported in Hertz. \n\n\n [0268] Solvents used in the synthesis of inhibitor compounds were purchased from Aldrich,\n\n\nVWR, and EMD. Solvents were ACS Reagent Grade or higher, and used without further purification. \n\n\n Example 1.1: Synthesis of amine building blocks. \n\n\n (4-methylthiazol-2-yl)methanamine \n\n\n\n\n\n [0269] Methylthiazole (1.0 g, 10.1 mmol) in THF at - 78 °C was treated with n-BuLi (1.6 M, 7.56 mL) for 30 min, DMF (1.4 mL, 18.2 mmol) was added dropwise. The resulting reaction mixture was warmed to r.t. After the starting material disappeared (by TLC), the reaction mixture was recooled to 0 °C and LAH (0.69 g, 18.5 mmol) was added. The mixture was warmed to r.t. and stirred for 1 h, the reaction was quenched with aqueous NH\n4\nC1, diluted with EtOAc. The organic solution was separated, extracted twice with EtOAc, dried with Na\n2\nS0\n4\n, and concentrated. The residue was purified with flash chromatography to give the corresponding alcohol as a light yellow oil. 1H-NMR: (300 MHz, CDC1\n3\n), δ: 6.89 (s, 1 H); 4.95 (s, 2 H); 2.48 (s, 3 H). \n\n\n [0270] Methylthiazole methanol (0.57 g, 4.4 mmol) was treated with mesyl chloride (0.42 mL, 5.4 mmol) and triethyl ethylamine at 0 °C in dichloromethane. The resulting mixture was stirred for 20 minutes followed by quenching with aqueous NH\n4\nC1. Evaporation of the solvent from the organic layer and flash chromatography of the residue afforded the corresponding mesylate as an oil. The mesylate (0.25g, 1.2 mmol) was then dissolved in DMF and sodium azide (0.62g, 9.6 mmol) was added. The mixture was heated to reflux for 2 hours followed by cooling and washing with aqueous NH\n4\nC1. Evaporation of the solvent from the organic layer resulted in the corresponding azide. The azide (0.14g, 0.91mmol) was dissolved in ethyl acetate, Pd(OH)\n2\n (0.07g) was added, and the suspension was stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere for 5 hours. The suspension was filtered through Celite. Evaporation of the solvent and flash chromatography of the residue afforded the desired methylthiazole methylamine as a yellow oil. 1H-NMR: (300 MHz, CDC1\n3\n), δ: 6.74 (m, 1 H); 4.09 (m, 2 H); 2.37 (s, 3 H). \n\n [0271] Using an alternative synthetic route, NaBH\n4\n (0.75 g, 19.9 mmol, 1.3 eq) was added to a stirred solution of 4-methylthiazole-2-carbaldehyde (Aldrich, 1.7 ml, 2.0 g, 15.3 mmol, 1 eq) in 30 ml anhydrous MeOH at 0 °C. After 45 min the solvent was removed in vacuo. The residue was diluted with saturated aqueous NH4C1 and extracted with EtOAc (x3). The combined organics were washed with brine (xl) and dried over Na\n2\nS0\n4\n. The inorganics were filtered off, and the solvent was removed in vacuo. Purification via flash chromatography yielded (4-methylthiazol-2-yl)methanol in quantitative yield. \n\n\n [0272] Diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) (1.2 eq) and l,8-Diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene (DBU) (1.2 eq) were added to a stirred solution of (4-methylthiazol-2-yl)methanol (1 eq) in 7 ml anh. toluene under Ar.

After 1 h the resulting solution was treated sequentially with the amine (0.0299 g, 0.093 mmol, 1 eq) and DIPEA (0.065 ml, 0.048 g, 0.37 mmol, 4 eq). The reaction was stirred at 0 °C to room temperature overnight. After quenching with water the volatiles were removed via rotary evaporation. The residue was partitioned between EtOAc/ water and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with water (x2), brine (xl), and dried over Na\n2\nS0\n4\n. The inorganics were filtered off, and the solvent was removed via rotary evaporation. \n\n\nPurification via flash chromatography on silica gel yielded 0.0614 g, (0.091 mmol, 98%) of 13. \n\n [0384] HC1 (4.0 M in 1,4-dioxane, 1 ml, 4 mmol, large excess) was added to a stirred solution of 13 (0.0614 g, 0.091 mmol, 1 eq) in anhydrous MeOH ( 0.5 ml) under Ar. After 1 h the volatiles were removed via rotary evaporation. The residue was treated sequentially with saturated aqueous NaHC0\n3\n and CH\n2\nCI\n2\n. After vigorous stirring (ca. 5 min) the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with CH\n2\nCI\n2\n (xl). The combined organics were dried over Na\n2\nS0\n4\n. The inorganics were filtered off, and the solvent was removed via rotary evaporation.

\n\n\n[0416] Potency of compounds were determined by measurement of their inhibition of memapsin 2 activity toward a fluorescent substrate. Kinetic inhibition experiments were performed using the procedure as described in Ermolieff, et al. {Biochemistry 39:12450- 12456 (2000), the teachings of which are incorporated hereby in their entirety). Briefly, assays were performed at pH 4, 37 °C, by pre-incubation of memapsin 2 enzyme with compound for 20 minutes. Activity measurements were initiated by addition of a fluorogenic substrate FS-2 (Bachem Americas, Torrance, CA) MCA-SEVNLDAEFK-DNP (SEQ ID NO.: 2). The substrate was derived from 10 amino acids of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP), with the Swedish variant amino acids at the beta-secretase cleavage site. The terminal amino acid was modified from arginine to lysine to facilitate derivatization with a functional group for detection by autofluorescence. The amino acid sequence of the \"core\" peptide of the substrate is SEVNLDAEFK (SEQ ID NO.: 3). The amino terminus was derivatized with (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl (MCA), and the epsilon amine of the lysine side chain of the terminal residue (K in sequence SEVNLDAEFK (SEQ ID NO.: 3)) was derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP).

Cathepsin D protein was obtained from rat liver homogenates. Briefly, rat livers were homogenized in PBS. The extract was acidified to pH 4 with 2 M sodium acetate, pH 4 and allowed to incubate at 4 °C overnight. Following addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%, the extract was centrifuged at 25,000 xg and stirred overnight with pepstatin A immobilized on agarose beads (Sigma- Aldrich). Following wash with sodium acetate/1% Triton X-100 pH 4, pepstatin-A-immobilized cathepsin D was eluted with an addition of 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5. Eluent was immediately adjusted to pH 5 with 2 M sodium acetate. Assay of cathepsin D activity vs. cathepsin D substrate was performed at pH 4, 37 °C, using the same assay procedure for Memapsin 2 activity and Ki outlined in Example 3 above, in presence and absence of compound. \n\n\nExample 5: Cellular A fiIC50 Determinations \n\n\n[0419] The potency of compounds against intracellular memapsin 2 activity was determined in a cellular assay of Αβ production. Compounds that successfully penetrate the cell membrane demonstrated their ability to inhibit intracellular memapsin 2 activity by \n\n blocking the production of Αβ detected following secretion into the culture medium. Human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE(2) (ATCC number CRL-2271) was seeded in multi-well plates at 10,000 cells/well in complete medium [MEM+F12 (1: 1 ratio) + 1% pen/strep + 10% fetal bovine serum] and incubated 24h at 37 °C/5% C0\n2\n for 24h. Compounds are dissolved in DMSO to concentrations near 5 mM and diluted into serum-limited culture medium \n\n\n[MEM+F12 (1: 1 ratio) + 1% pen/strep + 5% fetal bovine serum] at a final DMSO \n\n\nconcentration of 0.2%. Following a 24 hour incubation, a portion of conditioned media was removed for analysis of Αβ\n40\n using a sandwich ELISA (Invitrogen). The amount of Αβ\n40\n over the range of concentration of compounds, expressed relative to control incubations without compound, were fit to a 4-paramter IC50 model. Results are provided in Table 1 above (\"Cellular IC\n50\n\")- \n\n\nExample 6: Determination of CYP3A4 Inhibition \n\n\n[0420] To evaluate the drug-drug interaction potential for compounds, the potency to inhibit the major metabolic cytochrome CYP450 isoform 3A4 is assessed. The inhibition constant Kj is determined for inhibition of the metabolism of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate. \n\n\nAssay Procedure \n\n\n[0421] CYP3A4 Kj assays are performed following a recently published protocol with slight modifications (Di, L., Kerns, E.H., Li, S.Q., and Carter, G.T. (2007) Comparison of cytochrome P450 inhibition assays for drug discovery using human liver microsomes with LC-MS, rhCYP450 isozymes with fluorescence, and double cocktail with LC-MS. \n\n\nInternational Journal of Pharmaceutics 335: 1-11). The P450 inhibition assay is performed in 96-well plates at 37.2 °C in a shaking incubator. The compounds are diluted from 5 mM stocks in 100% DMSO and incubated at seven final concentrations from 0.078 to 10 μΜ (0.1% DMSO in each final incubation), with human liver microsomes (HLM) at a final protein concentration o f 0.1 mg/mL protein and a substrate (midazolam) concentration ranging from 1.25 to 10 μΜ. \n\n\n [0422] The assay is standardized for both phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4) and the NADPH regenerating system (MgCl\n2\n, 3.3 mM; G6P, 3.3 mM; G6PD, 1 U/ml; NADP+, 1.3 mM). Eight replicate control samples (0.1% DMSO, no compound) are prepared. Assays (200 μ > are set up by mixing HLM+substrate stock, 10 of test article in 2% DMSO, and the substrate before initiating the reaction with the addition of the regenerating system \n\n mixture. Reactions are quenched following incubation for 20, 30 and 40 minutes as described following. \n\n\nReaction Quench and MS-Prep \n\n\n[0423] After incubation for the specified time in a humidified shaking incubator, 20 \\L of the reaction mixture isremoved and the reactions are terminated by adding 200 μΐ\n^\n of cold acetonitrile. Samples are centrifuged at 1000 xg for 15 minutes in Solvinert filter plate. The receptor plate is dried via speed vacuum at 40 °C. The sample is reconstituted with a reconstitution buffer composed of 10% acetonitrile, 10% DMSO, 80% H\n2\n0 with an internal standard added at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. MS-Analysis is completed using LC- MS/MS. Formation of l'-hydroxymidazolam is measured by monitoring a specific SRM (342>203) transition for the CYP3A4 metabolite. \n\n\nDetermination ofKi \n\n\n[0424] Data are expressed as the quantity of midazolam metabolite relative to control incubations. Initial velocities are obtained by multiplying the relative quantity by the initial substrate concentration and dividing by the incubation duration. Data are transformed to inverse of initial velocity and expressed vs. inhibitor concentration [I] for determination of Kj by the Dixon method (Dixon, M. (1953) Biochemical Journal 55: 170-171) using where intercept [I]=-K; is determined at multiple substrate concentrations. Results are provided in Table 1 above (\"CYP 3A4 Kf). \n\n\nExample 7: Determination of hepatic intrinsic clearance in liver microsomes \n\n\n[0425] To 500 μΐ of 200 mM Na\n+\n K\n+\n phoshapte buffer (pH 7.4), 100 μΐ of ImM EDTA solution was added followed by 100 μΐ of 2 mg protein/ml human liver microsomes. A 10 μΐ aliquot of test compound (20 mM stock in 50% acetonitrile) was diluted further with 40 μΐ of H\n2\n0 (total assay volume 750 μΐ. Assay mixture is incubated for 5 minutes at 37 °C. The assay was initiated by addition of 250 μΐ of 4mM NADPH solution. Incubation was continued at 37 °C. Separate reaction mixtures were prepared for 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min durations. \n\n\nIndividual reactions were halted by addition of 150 μΐ of 100% acetonitrile. Internal standard (10 μΐ of 100 ng/ml diazepam solution) was added. Concentration of the test compound in each separate reaction was measured using LC/MS/MS and a standard curve for the test compound according to standard procedures. \n\n [0426] The hepatic intrinsic clearance in liver microsome was determined by the following procedure described by Davies and Morris (Davies, B. and Morris, T. (19930) Physiological parameters in laboratory animals and humans. Pharm Res. 10: 1093- 1095) detailing the relationship of in vitro clearance to physiological parameters in animals and human subjects. \n\n\n[0427] The amount of compound remaining at each time point was expressed relative to the amount present in the initial (0 min) incubation. The relationship of relative amount vs. time was used to determine the half life of the compound in the microsome assay. The \n\n\nconcentration independent rate constant, k\n1 ;\n was determined from rectangular hyperbolic fit: \n\n\n % remaining = 100*(e\n\"klT\n) \n\n\nwhere T is time (in minutes), from the relationship of relative amount vs. time. Alternatively, ki was determined from a transform of the equation, where \n\n\n ki = 0.693Λ1/2 \n\n\n [0428] Conversion to in vivo clearance was obtained from the relation (Davies and Morris, 1993): \n\n\n CL = v / [S] \n\n\n - (k, x incubation volume} / protein amount \n\n\n _ \n\n\n\n\n\n ~XV2 \nX '\nm^some \nX\n g\n~\n e\n~\nr \nX\n Bod weighF^ where v = velocity of metabolism, [S] is the concentration of the compound, and volumes are expressed in mL. A lower intrinsic clearance rate demonstrates reduced propensity for metabolism and clearance in vivo.

Animals were \n\n\nindividually housed in an A A ALAC- accredited animal facility, and all studies were conducted in accordance with approved institutional IACUC protocols. Approximately one week of acclimation period was assigned. Prior to oral dosing, animals were fasted overnight for a minimum of 12 hours and food returned 4 hours post oral administration. Water was available ad libitum throughout the study. For intravenous dosing, food and water was supplied ad libitum. Animals were visually inspected to be healthy before being included into the study group. \n\n\n Compound Administration \n\n\n[0430] The compound, supplied as a salt in dry powder form, was formulated in 35% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextran (HPpCD) at a concentration near 3 mg/ml, and dosed at 10 mg/kg based upon free base concentration in the formulation. Dosage was calculated based on the animal body weight measured immediately prior to the study. For oral dosing, the dosing solution (dose volume < 10 mL/kg) was administered directly into the stomach using a 3-inch metallic rodent gavage needle. For intravenous dosing, the dosing solution (dose volume < 10 mL/kg) was injected as a bolus via one tail vein using a 25 gauge needle. \n\n\n Plasma Sampling \n\n\n [0431] Blood samples were collected from the JVC cannula using a 1 mL syringe with a 22g blunted needle. At each sampling time point, an initial draw was made to remove -50 μΐ blood from the dead space within the cannula. A clean syringe and needle was used to collect -100 μΐ blood, followed by replacing with an equal volume of heparinized saline (50 IU/ml). Blood samples for PK analysis (volume -100 μΐ) were transferred into lithium-heparin tubes on wet ice. For oral PK, samples were collected at pre-dose, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, and 6 hr. For intravenous PK, samples were collected at pre-dose, 2 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, and 6 hr. The total volume of blood drawn from the rat is less than 10% of the total circulation volume. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm x 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were subsequently stored at -70 °C for bioanalysis. \n\n\n Bioanalysis \n\n\n [0432] Bioanalysis of compound from plasma was conducted by extracting 20 μΐ of plasma with 100 μΐ of acetonitrile using a 96-well Solvinert filter plate (Millipore). Samples were \n\n subjected to LC/MS/MS analysis using an Eksigent Express LC 100 microflow HPLC system, coupled with an Michrom C-18 0.2 * 50mm column, and a Thermo TSQuantum Ultra triple quadrupole mass spectrometer running in positive ion, SRM mode. Concentration of compound was determined using a standard curve prepared in pre-extracted control plasma. \n\n\n Pharmacokinetic analysis \n\n\n[0433] Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using the validated pharmacokinetic program WinNonlin Professional version 5.2 software (Pharsight Co., Mountain View, CA). The mean plasma compound concentration versus time (AUC) was processed using the noncompartmental analysis method (NCA; model 200)."
