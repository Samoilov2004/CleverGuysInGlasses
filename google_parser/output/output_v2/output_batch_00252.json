The entire disclosure of each of these prior applications is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a novel class of sulfonamides which are aspartyl protease inhibitors. In one embodiment, this invention relates to a novel class of HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors characterize d by specific structural and physicochemical features. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are particularly well suited for inhibiting HIV-1 and HIV-2 protease activity and consequently, may be advantageously used as anti-viral agents against the HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses. This invention also relates to methods for inhibiting the activity of HIV aspartyl protease using the compounds of this invention and methods for screening compounds for anti-HIV activity.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”) is the causative agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (“AIDS”)—a disease characterized by the destruction of the immune system, particularly of CD4\n+\n T-cells, with attendant susceptibility to opportunistic infections—and its precursor AIDS-related complex (“ARC”)—a syndrome characterized by symptoms such as persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, fever and weight loss.\n\n\nAs in the case of several other retroviruses, HIV encodes the production of a protease which carries out post-translational cleavage of precursor polypeptides in a process necessary for the formation of infectious virions (S. Crawford et al., “A Deletion Mutation in the 5′ Part of the pol Gene of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Blocks Proteolytic Processing of the gag and pol Polyproteins”, \nJ. Virol., \n53, p. 899 (1985)). These gene products include pol, which encodes the virion RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase), an endonuclease, HIV protease, and gag, which encodes the core-proteins of the virion (H. Toh et al., “Close Structural Resemblance Between Putative Polymerase of a Drosophila Transposable Genetic Element 17.6 and pol gene product of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus”, \nEMBO J., \n4, p. 1267 (1985); L. H. Pearl et al., “A Structural Model for the Retroviral Proteases”, \nNature\n, pp. 329-351 (1987); M.D. Power-et al., “Nucleotide Sequence of SRV-1, a Type D Simian Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Retrovirus”, \nScience, \n231, p. 1567 (1986)).\n\n\nA number of synthetic anti-viral agents have been designed to target various stages in the replication cycle of HIV. These agents include compounds which block viral binding to CD4\n+\n T-lymphocytes (for example, soluble CD4), and compounds which interfere with viral replication by inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase (for example, didanosine and zidovudine (AZT)) and inhibit integration of viral DNA into cellular DNA (M. S. Hirsh and R. T. D'Aqulia, “Therapy for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection”, \nN. Eng. J. Med., \n328, p. 1686 (1993)). However, such agents, which are directed primarily to early stages of viral replication, do not prevent the production of infectious virions in chronically infected cells. Furthermore, administration of some of these agents in effective amounts has led to cell-toxicity and unwanted side effects, such as anemia and bone marrow suppression.\n\n\nMore recently, the focus of anti-viral drug design has been to create compounds which inhibit the formation of infectious virions by interfering with the processing of viral polyprotein precursors. Processing of these precursor proteins requires the action of virus-encoded proteases which are essential for replication (Kohl, N. E. et al. “Active HIV Protease is Required for Viral Infectivity” \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n85, p. 4686 (1988)). The anti-viral potential of HIV protease inhibition has been demonstrated using peptidyl inhibitors. Such peptidyl compounds, however, are typically large and complex molecules that tend to exhibit poor bioavailability and are not generally consistent with oral administration. Accordingly, the need still exists for compounds that can effectively inhibit the action of viral proteases, for use as agents for preventing and treating chronic and acute viral infections.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides a novel class of compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, that are useful as inhibitors of aspartyl proteases, in particular, HIV aspartyl protease. These compounds can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic or prophylactic agents, such as anti-virals, antibiotics, immunomodulators or vaccines, for the treatment or prophylaxis of viral infection.\n\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the compounds of this invention are capable of inhibiting HIV viral replication in human CD\n4\n \n+\nT-cells. These compounds are useful as therapeutic and prophylactic agents to treat or prevent infection by HIV-1 and related viruses which may result in asymptomatic infection, AIDS-related complex (“ARC”), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (“AIDS”), or similar disease of the immune system.\n\n\nIt is a principal object of this invention to provide a novel class of sulfonamides which are aspartyl protease inhibitors, and particularly, HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors.

Scheme I illustrates a general synthetic route to compounds of formula (I).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Step 1 of Scheme I, radical R′ is selected such that R′—CH\n2\n— is D′.\n\n\nThe synthetic approach illustrated in Scheme I can be readily extended to produce other compounds of the present invention. The above synthetic scheme is not intended to comprise a comprehensive list of all means by which compounds described and claimed in this application may be synthesized. Further methods will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nAs discussed above, the novel compounds of the present invention are excellent ligands for aspartyl proteases, particularly HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. Accordingly, these compounds are capable of targeting and inhibiting late stage events in HIV replication, i.e., the processing of the viral polyproteins by HIV encoded proteases. Such compounds inhibit the proteolytic processing of viral polyprotein precursors by inhibiting aspartyl protease. Because aspartyl protease is essential for the production of mature virions, inhibition of that processing effectively blocks the spread of virus by inhibiting the production of infectious virions, particularly from chronically infected cells. Compounds according to this invention advantageously inhibit the ability of the HIV-1 virus to infect immortalized human T cells over a period of days, as determined by an assay of extracellular p24 antigen—a specific marker of viral replication. Other anti-viral assays have confirmed the potency of these compounds.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention may be employed in a conventional manner for the treatment of viruses, such as HIV and HTLV, which depend on aspartyl proteases for obligatory events in their life cycle. Such methods of treatment, their dosage levels and requirements may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and techniques. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant for administration to a virally-infected patient in a pharmaceutically acceptable manner and in an amount effective to lessen the severity of the viral infection.\n\n\nAlternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in vaccines and methods for protecting individuals against viral infection over an extended period of time. The compounds may be employed in such vaccines either alone or together with other compounds of this invention in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of protease inhibitors in vaccines. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an extended period time against HIV infection. As such, the novel protease inhibitors of this invention can be administered as agents for treating or preventing HIV infection in a mammal.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I, especially those having a molecular weight of less than about 700 g/mole, may be readily absorbed by the bloodstream of mammals upon oral administration. Compounds of formula I having a molecular weight of less than about 600 g/mole are most likely to demonstrate oral availability. This surprisingly impressive oral availability makes such compounds excellent agents for orally-administered treatment and prevention regimens against HIV infection.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention may be administered to a healthy or HIV-infected patient either as a single agent or in combination with other anti-viral agents which interfere with the replication cycle of HIV. By administering the compounds of this invention with other anti-viral agents which target different events in the viral life cycle, the therapeutic effect of these compounds is potentiated. For instance, the co-administered anti-viral agent can be one which targets early events in the life cycle of the virus, such as cell entry, reverse transcription and viral DNA integration into cellular DNA. Anti-HIV agents targeting such early life cycle events include, didanosine (ddI), alcitabine (ddC), d4T, zidovudine (AZT), polysulfated polysaccharides, sT4 (soluble CD4), ganiclovir, dideoxycytidine, trisodium phosphonoformate, eflornithine, ribavirin, acyclovir, alpha interferon and trimenotrexate. Additionally, non-nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase, such as TIBO or nevirapine, may be used to potentiate the effect of the compounds of this invention, as may viral uncoating inhibitors, inhibitors of trans-activating proteins such as tat or rev, or inhibitors of the viral integrase.\n\n\nCombination therapies according to this invention exert a synergistic effect in inhibiting HIV replication because each component agent of the combination acts on a different site of HIV replication. The use of such combinations also advantageously reduces the dosage of a given conventional anti-retroviral agent which would be required for a desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect as compared to when that agent is administered as a monotherapy. These combinations may reduce or eliminate the side effects of conventional single anti-retroviral agent therapies while not interfering with the anti-retroviral activity of those agents. These combinations reduce potential of resistance to single agent therapies, while minimizing any associated toxicity. These combinations may also increase the efficacy of the conventional agent without increasing the associated toxicity. In particular, we have discovered that these compounds act synergistically in preventing the replication of HIV in human T cells. Preferred combination therapies include the administration of a compound of this invention with AZT, ddI, ddC or d4T.\n\n\nAlternatively, the compounds of this invention may also be co-administered with other HIV protease inhibitors such as Ro 31-8959 (Roche), L-735,524 (Merck), XM 323 (Du-Pont Merck) and A-80,987 (Abbott) to increase the effect of therapy or prophylaxis against various viral mutants or members of other HIV quasi species.\n\n\nWe prefer administering the compounds of this invention as single agents or in combination with retroviral reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as derivatives of AZT, or other HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors. We believe that the co-administration of the compounds of this invention with retroviral reverse transcriptase inhibitors or HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors may exert a substantial synergistic effect, thereby preventing, substantially reducing, or completely eliminating viral infectivity and its associated symptoms.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention can also be administered in combination with immunomodulators (e.g., bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon antibody, IL-2, GM-CSF, methionine enkephalin, interferon alpha, diethyldithiocarbamate, tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and rEPO); and antibiotics (e.g., pentamidine isethiorate) to prevent or combat infection and disease associated with HIV infections, such as AIDS and ARC.\n\n\nWhen the compounds of this invention are administered in combination therapies with other agents, they may be administered sequentially or concurrently to the patient. Alternatively, pharmaceutical or prophylactic compositions according to this invention may be comprised of a combination of an aspartyl protease inhibitor of this invention and another therapeutic or prophylactic agent.\n\n\nAlthough this invention focuses on the use of the compounds disclosed herein for preventing and treating HIV infection, the compounds of this invention can also be used as inhibitory agents for other viruses which depend on similar aspartyl proteases for obligatory events in their life cycle. These viruses include, as well as other AIDS-like diseases caused by retroviruses, such as simian immunodeficiency viruses, but are not limited to, HTLV-I and HTLV-II. In addition, the compounds of this invention may also be used to inhibit other aspartyl proteases, and in particular, other human aspartyl proteases, including renin and aspartyl proteases that process endothelin precursors. Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention comprise any of the compounds of the present invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, with any pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. We prefer oral administration or administration by injection. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may contain any conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example, as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are mannitol, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant such as Ph. Helv or a similar alcohol.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, and aqueous suspensions and solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are administered orally, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or flavoring and/or coloring agents may be added.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These compositions can be prepared by mixing a compound of this invention with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the active components. Such materials include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\nTopical administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is especially useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical application. For application topically to the skin, the pharmaceutical composition should be formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated with a suitable lotion or cream containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by rectal suppository formulation or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches are also included in this invention.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.\n\n\nDosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between about 0.5 and about 50 mg/kg body weight per day of the active ingredient compound are useful in the prevention and treatment of viral infection, including HIV infection. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered from about 1 to about 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). Preferably, such preparations contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound.\n\n\nUpon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained when the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level, treatment should cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms.\n\n\nAs the skilled artisan will appreciate, lower or higher doses than those recited above may be required. Specific dosage and treatment regimens for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health status, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity and course of the infection, the patient's disposition to the infection and the judgment of the treating physician.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention are also useful as commercial reagents which effectively bind to aspartyl proteases, particularly HIV aspartyl protease. As commercial reagents, the compounds of this invention, and their derivatives, may be used to block proteolysis of a target peptide or may be derivatized to bind to a stable resin as a tethered substrate for affinity chromatography applications. These and other uses which characterize commercial aspartyl protease inhibitors will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nAs used herein, the compounds according to the invention are defined to include pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives or prodrugs thereof. A “pharmaceutically acceptable derivative” or “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug” means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt of an ester, or other derivative of a compound of this invention which, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of this invention or an active metabolite or residue thereof. Particularly favored derivatives and prodrugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are administered to a mammal (e.g., by allowing an orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system) relative to the parent species.\n\n\nThe compounds according to the invention may be used in the form of salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. Included among such acid salts, for example, are the following: acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, flucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, pamoate, pectianate, persulfate, phenylproprionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and undecanoate.

Various Electrophiles Using Scavenger Resins:\n\n\n\nThe following reactions were carried out in parallel, in sets ranging from 9 to 48, and were done in teflon-capped glass vials using a rotary shaker for agitation. To vials containing 5 to 10 equiv. of either Amberlyst A-21 resin (Aldrich, prepared by washing twice each with MeOH, CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, THF, and then drying in vacuo at 60° C. overnight) or PS-DIEA resin (Argonaut Technologies, prepared as above) were added 2 mL of 16 mM solutions of the primary amine starting materials in anhydrous THF or anhydrous CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. These resins were not employed when isocyanates or isothiocyanates were used as electrophiles. This was followed by addition of 3 to 5 equivalents of electrophile (acid chlorides, chloroformates, carbamyl chlorides, sulfonyl chlorides, isocyanates, isothiocyanates) either neat or as solutions in anhydrous CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. The resulting mixtures were shaken at RT for 18 hours. The mixtures were then diluted two-fold with CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nand treated with 5-10 equiv. of PS-Trisamine resin (Argonaut Technologies, prepared as above). This was followed by shaking at RT for an additional 18 hours. The resins were then removed by filtration and the filtrates concentrated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen to afford the desired compounds.\n\n\nMass Spectral Data for Compounds

(1990)\n\n\nAntiviral Activity Assay in MT4 Cells\n\n\nAntiviral HIV activity and compound-induced cytotoxicity were measured in parallel by means of a propidium iodide based procedure in the human T-cell lymphotropic virus transformed cell line MT4. Aliquots of the test compounds were serially diluted in medium (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal-calf serum (FCS), and gentamycin) in 96-well plates (Costar 3598) using a Cetus Pro/Pette. Exponentially growing MT4 cells were harvested and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min in a Jouan centrifuge (model CR 4 12). Cell pellets were resuspended in fresh medium (RPMI 1640, 20% FCS, 20% IL-2, and gentamycin) to a density of 5×10\n5 \ncells/ml. Cell aliquots were infected by the addition of HIV-1 (strain IIIB) diluted to give a viral multiplicity of infection of 100×TCID\n50\n. A similar cell aliquot was diluted with medium to provide a mock-infected control. Cell infection was allowed to proceed for 1 hr at 370 in a tissue culture incubator with humidified 5% CO\n2 \natmosphere. After the 1 hr incubation the virus/cell suspensions were diluted 6-fold with fresh medium, and 125 μl of the cell suspension was added to each well of the plate containing pre-diluted compound. Plates were then placed in a tissue culture incubator with humidified 5% CO\n2 \nfor 5 days. At the end of the incubation period, 27 μl of 5% Nonidet-40 was added to each well of the incubation plate. After thorough mixing with a Costar multitip pipetter, 60 μl of the mixture was transferred to filter-bottomed 96-well plates. The plates were analyzed in an automated assay instrument (Screen Machine, Idexx Laboratories). The assay makes use of a propidium iodide dye to estimate the DNA content of each well.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1. Averett, D. R. 1989.

Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to phenyl pyrrole aminoguanidine derivatives. The present invention further relates to the use of such phenyl pyrrole aminoguanidine derivatives for the treatment of diseases associated with the melanocortin receptors or related systems, e.g. the melanocyte stimulating hormones.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nA number of large linear and cyclic peptides are known in the art which show high specific binding to melanocortin (MC) receptors. The agonistic and/or antagonistic properties of these peptides are also known. See, for example, WO 99/21571.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, a number of low molecular weight compounds are known, e.g., isoquinolines, spiropyridines and benzimidazoles, which show activity on the MC receptors.

A prophylactic treatment functions as a preventative treatment against a disease or disorder. A “prophylactic activity” is an activity of an agent, such as a compound disclosed herein, or a composition thereof, that, when administered to a subject who does not display signs or symptoms of pathology, disease or disorder, or who displays only early signs or symptoms of pathology, disease, or disorder, diminishes, prevents, or decreases the risk of the subject developing a pathology, disease, or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present context the term “therapeutic treatment”, or simply “treatment”, means a treatment administered to a subject who displays symptoms or signs of pathology, disease, or disorder, in which treatment is administered to the subject for the purpose of diminishing or eliminating those signs or symptoms of pathology, disease, or disorder.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention the subject is a being.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present context the term “tautomeric forms thereof” or “tautomer” refers to one of two or more structural isomers that exist in equilibrium and are readily converted from one isomeric form to another. Different tautomeric forms have the same molecular formula and are interchangeable forms involving the displacement of hydrogen atoms and electrons.

Furthermore, the compounds of the general formula (I) herein are all shown in their trans isomeric forms. It should be understood, however, that the compounds of the general formula (I) may also be in their cis isomeric form.

Nevertheless, in a preferred embodiment of the invention it is preferred that the aminoguanidine substituent is attached to the pyrrole ring at \nposition\n 2, i.e. in a preferred embodiment the compounds of the invention has the stereochemistry indicated in the general formula (Ia) and the formulae (II)-(VI) above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated above, n is an integer of 1, 2 or 3.

Thus, a compound of the general formula (Ia) or (Ib) above may be prepared essentially as described in WO 03/013509, i.e. a compound of the general formula (IIa) or (IIb)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis reacted with an aminoguanidine derivative of the general formula (III) in a suitable organic solvent:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein the individual substitutents have the same meaning as described above. Preferably, a compound of the general formula (IIa) or (IIb) is reacted with an aminoguanidine derivative of the general formula (III) where the aminoguanidine derivative is in the form of an acid addition salt, such as the bicarbonate salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound (IIa) may easily be prepared from the starting compound (IVa) by the well-known Wittig reaction:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormation of the intermediate compound (Va) is carried out in a suitable organic solvent, typically a protic solvent, such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, hexamethyl-phosphorotriamide, in the presence of a strong base, such as an alkoxide, e.g. sodium or potassium tert-butoxide. The intermediate (Va) is subsequently converted to the desired (IIa) by acidic hydrolysis using standard methods. As will be understood, compound (IIb) may be achieved in an analogous way by using the starting compound (IVb) rather than the starting compound (IVa):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compound of the invention is preferably administered in a composition including a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means a carrier or excipient that does not cause any untoward effects in patients to whom it is administered. Such pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients are well known in the art (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, A. R. Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Company [1990]; Pharmaceutical Formulation Development of Peptides and Proteins, S. Frokjaer and L. Hovgaard, Eds., Taylor & Francis [2000]; and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3rd edition, A. Kibbe, Ed., Pharmaceutical Press [2000]). The exact dose to be administered depends on the circumstances. Normally, the dose should be capable of preventing or lessening the severity or spread of the condition or indication being treated. It will be apparent to those of skill in the art that an effective amount of the compound of the invention depends, inter alia, upon the disease, the dose, the administration schedule, whether the compound of the invention is administered alone or in conjunction with other therapeutic agents, the general health of the patient, and the like. Generally, and in particular if administered via the oral route, the compound of the invention should be administered in a dose of 0.1 to 100 mg body weight per kilo throughout the treatment period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition may be formulated in a variety of forms, including liquid, gel, lyophilised, powder, compressed solid, or any other suitable form. The preferred form will depend upon the particular indication being treated and will be apparent to one of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition may be administered orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intracerebrally, intranasally, transdermally, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonary, vaginally, rectally, intraocularly, or in any other acceptable manner, e.g. using PowderJect or ProLease technology. The composition can be administered continuously by infusion, although bolus injection is acceptable, using techniques well known in the art, such as pumps or implantation. In some instances the composition may be directly applied as a solution or spray. The preferred mode of administration will depend upon the particular indication being treated and will be apparent to one of skill in the art. However, the currently preferred mode of administration is via the oral route.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be administered in conjunction with other therapeutic agents. These agents may be incorporated as part of the same pharmaceutical composition or may be administered separately from the composition of the invention, either concurrently or in accordance with any other acceptable treatment schedule.\n\n\n \nOral Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nFor oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in solid or liquid form, e.g. in the form of a capsule, tablet, suspension, emulsion or solution. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a given amount of the active ingredient. A suitable daily dose for a human or other mammal may vary widely depending on the condition of the patient and other factors, but can be determined by persons skilled in the art using routine methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid dosage forms for oral administration may include capsules, tablets, suppositories, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances, e.g. lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the invention may be admixed with adjuvants such as lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, stearic acid, talc, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulphuric acids, acacia, gelatin, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidine, and/or polyvinyl alcohol, and tableted or encapsulated for conventional administration. Alternatively, the compound of the invention may be dissolved in saline, water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, oils (such as corn oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil or sesame oil), tragacanth gum, and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of administration are well known in the pharmaceutical art. The carrier or diluent may include time delay material, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, or other materials well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations such as sterilisation and/or may contain conventional adjuvants such as preservatives, stabilisers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, buffers, fillers, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration may include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting agents, sweeteners, flavoring agents and perfuming agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of and pharmaceutical preparations comprising one or more of the compounds of the invention, as well as to their uses for various medical and veterinary practices related to melanocyte stimulating hormone receptors.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Use\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention have been tested in the melanocortin system and have surprisingly been shown to be capable of binding to MC receptors as well as showing activity in functional assays. The compounds of the present invention are either agonists or antagonists of a specific MC-receptor or of a number of MC-receptors, e.g. MC1, MC3, MC4 and/or MC5 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe MC-receptors belong to the class of G-protein coupled receptors which are all built from a single polypeptide forming 7 transmembrane domains. Five such receptors types, termed MC1, MC2, MC3, MC4 and MC5, have been described. The MC receptor's signalling is mainly mediated via cAMP, but other signal transduction pathways are also known. They are distinctly distributed in the body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMC-receptors are linked to a variety of physiological actions that are thought to be mediated by distinct subtypes of the MC-receptors. In many cases, however, it is not entirely clear which of the subtypes is responsible for the effect as exemplified by the finding that selective MC1 receptor agonists has marked anti-inflammatory action, but seems to lack the organ protective effect described for unspecific MC receptor agonists as α-MSH, where it has been suggested that additional MC3 and/or MC5 receptor stimulation are needed to get the organ protective effect. Another example is the central effects of melanocortin receptor stimulation where it is unclear whether both MC3 and MC4 receptor stimulation or only stimulation of one of the receptors are needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has long been known that MSH-peptides may affect many different processes such as motivation, learning, memory, behaviour (including feeding and sexual), inflammation (including immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive), body temperature, pain perception, blood pressure, heart rate, vascular tone, brain blood flow, trophic effects in different organs, nerve growth, placental development, endocrine and exocrine functions, aldosterone synthesis and release, thyroxin release, spermatogenesis, ovarian weight, prolactin and FSH secretion, effects or other hormones, uterine bleeding in women, sebum and pheromone secretion, blood glucose levels, natriuresis, intrauterine foetal growth, as well as other events surrounding parturition, (see, for example, Eberle: The melanotropins: Chemistry, physiology and mechanisms of action. Basel: Karger, Switzerland. 1988, ISBN 3-8055-4678-5; Gruber et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1989, 257, R681-R694; De Wildt et al., J. Cardiovascular Pharmacology. 1995, 25, 898-905) as well as inducing natriuresis (Tin et al., Hypertension. 1987, 10, 619-627).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, it is also well-known that the immunomodulatory action of α-MSH includes both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive effects. Several studies have shown that α-MSH antagonises the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα, and induces the production of the antiinflammatory cytokine, IL-10 (for review, see Catania & Lipton, Endocr Rev. 1993 October; 14(5):564-76).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEating behaviour is regulated by a complex network of physiological regulatory pathways that involve both the central nervous system and peripheral sites. Factors such as leptin, insulin, NPY (neuropeptide Y), orexins, CRF (Corticotropin-Releasing Factor, release hormone) and melanocortic peptides (Schwartz, \nNature Medicine\n 1998, 4, 385-386) are known to control the amount of food intake, which may affect body weight, body fat mass and growth rate. Recent studies have shown a role of MC-receptors, especially the MC4 receptor, for control of food intake, and there is evidence indicating that the melanocortins and the MC4 receptor are important factors downstream of leptin. Intracerebroventricular injections of the melanocortic peptides α-MSH and ACTH(1-24) have been shown to markedly inhibit feeding (Poggioli et al., Peptides, 1986, 7, 843-848; Vergoni et al., Neuropeptides, 1986, 7, 153-158).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe MC5-receptor has recently been attributed a role in control of exocrine gland function (van der Kraan, et al., Endocrinol. 1998, 139, 2348-2355; Chen et al., Cell. 1997, 91, 789-798).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the melanocortic peptides have distinct effects on sexual functions in that they cause erection in males (Donovan, Psychol. Med., 1978, 8, 305-316), presumably mediated by a central agonistic effect of the peptide on MC-receptors. It has also been shown that an MC-receptor blocker could inhibit the erectogenic effect of melanocortic peptides (Vergoni et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1998, 362; 95-101).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention has valuable therapeutic properties, making them useful for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, e.g. acute or chronic inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis, including diseases associated with arthritis, osteoartritis, rheumatoid arthritis, spondylarthropathies (e.g. ankylosing spondilitis), reactive arthritis (including arthritis following rheumatic fever), Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and Reiter's disease, connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, mixed connetive tissue disease, sarcoidosis and primary Sjogrens syndrome including keratoconjunctivitis sicca, polymyalgia rheumatica, and other types of vasculitis, crystal deposition diseases (including gout), pyrophosphate arthropathy, acute calcific periarthritis; inflammatory bowel disease (including Chrons disease and ulcertive colitis), diverticular disease of the colon, and irritable bowel syndrome, pancreatitis, inflammatory upper and lower airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), allergic and non-allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic and non-allergic conjunctivitis, allergic and non-allergic dermatitis, trauma and post operative stress syndromes, diabetes mellitus, insulin-resistance, metabolic syndrome, sexual dysfunction including dysfunction of male erection, eating disorders including anorexia, obesity, mental disorders, dysfunction of the endocrine system, drug-induced disorders of the blood and lymphoid system, allergy disorders, disorders of the cardiovascular system and pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the following the conditions and diseases of which the compounds of the present invention are useful for treating, are described in details.\n\n\n \nInflammatory Conditions\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (I) and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have valuable pharmacological properties, making them useful for the treatment of inflammation, an inflammatory condition or an inflammatory disease such as inflammation related to the production of nitric oxide, inflammation related to increased amounts (upregulated amounts) of inducible nitric oxide synthase, inflammation related to activation of transcriptional activators, inflammation related to nuclear factor kappa beta, inflammation related to macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, melanocytes, pigment cells and endothelial cells, inflammation related to increased production and/or release of inflammatory cytokines, such as e.g. interleukins, in particular interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-α).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present specification, “increased production” refers to increased formation, increased release, or increased amount of an endogenous compound locally, regionally or systemically in a patient compared to the amount of said endogenous compound in a healthy individual.

In short, murine B16-F1 melanoma cells expressing MC1, but not other MC receptors, were used for binding affinity studies against the murine MC1 receptor (Siegrist et al.; 1988, J. Recept. Res., 8(1-4):323-43). For human MC3, MC4 and MC5 receptor affinities human recombinant CHO cells were used (Schioth et al. 1997, Neuropeptides 31:565-71, 1997). Cells were suspended in HEPES buffer and by use of microwell plates radio-ligands, as well as test compound, in the concentration range of 10\n−10 \nto 10\n−6 \nwere added. After incubation at 37° C. (22° C. for the MC1 receptor assay) separation of bound and free [\n125\nI]-NDP-MSH was done by multiple washings with buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results were expressed as a percent of control specific binding obtained in the presence of the test compounds. Mean values for each assay are presented in Table I below. The IC\n50 \nvalues (concentration causing a half-maximal inhibition of control specific binding) and Hill coefficients (n\nH\n) were determined by non-linear regression analysis of the competition curves using Hill equation curve fitting. The inhibition constants (K\ni\n) were calculated from the Cheng Prusoff equation (K\ni\n=IC\n50\n/(1+(L/K\nD\n)), where L=concentration of radio-ligand in the assay, and K\nD\n=affinity of the radio-ligand for the receptor).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssay\n\n\nLigand\n\n\nConc.\n\n\nNon Specific\n\n\nIncubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMC\n1\n \n\n\n[\n125\nI]NDP-MSH\n\n\n0.05 nM\n\n\nNDP-MSH\n\n\n90 min/22° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1 μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMC\n3 \n(h)\n\n\n[\n125\nI]NDP-MSH\n\n\n0.075 nM \n\n\nNDP-\nMSH\n \n\n\n60 min/37° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1 μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMC\n4 \n(h)\n\n\n[\n125\nI]NDP-MSH\n\n\n0.05 nM\n\n\nNDP-MSH\n\n\n120 min/37° C. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1 μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMC\n5 \n(h)\n\n\n[\n125\nI]NDP-MSH\n\n\n0.05 nM\n\n\nNDP-\nMSH\n \n\n\n60 min/37° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1 μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree reference compounds, all belonging to the class of compounds disclosed in WO 03/013509, as well as three compounds according to the present invention were tested.

The aim of the methods is to test the compounds of the invention for anti-inflammatory effects and ability to inhibit or prevent the cell/tissue/organ impairment or destruction occurring as a result of ischemia, inflammation or toxic effects of a drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn inflammatory response or an exacerbation in chronic inflammation is characterized by production of cell-derived mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukins (IL-1β, IL-8, IL10), nitric oxide (NO), and free oxygen radicals, which eventually will induce widespread endothelial damage with loss of arteriolar tonus in systemic vessels, increased capillary permeability, sustained hypotension and organ dysfunction, which in the lung is associated with accumulation of leucocytes including neutrophils and eosinophils within the alveolar space. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), released from infectious agents, plays a central role in the inflammatory response to infection by inducing a number of inflammatory mediators including TNF-α. Treatments with the ability to inhibit TNF-α production are therefore believed to have marked anti-inflammatory effects. The inventor is using LPS stimulation to produce an inflammatory response in a number of experimental setups and the primary marker for an anti-inflammatory effect of the compounds according to the invention is the ability to inhibit TNF-α production.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nIn Vivo Effect—Inhibition of LPS-Induced TNF-α and IL10 Production in Rats\n\n\n \n \n \nExperimental animals. Female Wistar rats (˜250 g) were obtained from the Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany, and housed in a temperature- (22-24° C.) and moisture-controlled (40-70%) room with a 12 h light-dark cycle (light on from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.). The rats were maintained on a standard rodent diet with 140 mmol/kg of sodium, 275 mmol/kg potassium and 23% protein (Altromin International, Lage, Germany) and had free access to water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimal preparation. In isoflurane-nitrous oxide anesthesia, the animals were implanted with permanent medical grade Tygon catheters into the abdominal aorta and the inferior caval vein, respectively, via a femoral artery and vein. After instrumentation, the animals were housed individually for 7-10 days until the day of the experiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperimental protocol. Prior to the experiments all rats were adapted to the restraining cage used for the experiments by training. On the day of the experiment, the animal were transferred to a restraining cage, and an intravenous infusion of vehicle solution containing 150 mM glucose was started. The infusion rate was 0.5 ml/h throughout the experiment. After a short adaptation period, infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was started. LPS (\nE. coli \nserotype 0127 B8, L 3129, Sigma, St. Louis, USA) was given at a dose of 4 mg/kg body weight delivered as an i.v. infusion over 1 hour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nArterial blood samples of 0.3 ml were taken 120 minutes after start of the LPS infusion.\n\n\n \nExperimental Groups:\n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition to LPS infusion all rats were treated with a bolus injection of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVehicle (0.5 \nmL\n 20% PEG200) or test compound in one of the following doses:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n0.1; 1.0; 5.0 mg/kg given intravenously 5 min prior to initiation of the LPS infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest compounds: \nCompound\n 1 of the invention (\nFIG. 1\n, structure no. 1), \ncompound\n 2 of the invention (\nFIG. 1\n, structure no. 19) and \ncompound\n 3 of the invention (\nFIG. 1\n, structure no. 53).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeasurement of TNF-α and IL-10 in plasma: The blood samples were collected in a prechilled test tube with 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and 20×10\n6 \nIU/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation at 4° C., plasma samples were transferred to pre-chilled test tubes and stored at −20° C. for later measurements of TNF-α and IL-10. TNF-α and II-10 in plasma were determined by an ELISA (Biotrak, Amersham, UK).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStatistical analyses. Results are presented as means±SE. A two-way ANOVA for repeated measures was used to test for differences between groups. In case of P<0.05, the differences between corresponding periods are evaluated by unpaired t-tests with Bonferroni's correction of the level of significance.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nCompound no. 1 and compound no. 3 of the invention reduced LPS-induced TNF-α liberation as evaluated by the levels of serum TNF-α 120 min after initiation of the LPS infusion.

The rats are caged in \nstandard cages type\n 3 and housed in a temperature- (22-24° C.) and moisture-controlled (40-70%) room with a 12 h light-dark cycle (light on from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.). The diet is autoclaved Altromin 1324 special formulation, Produced by Altromin Denmark, Chr. Pedersen A/S, 4100 Ringsted, Denmark. Diet and water are administered ad libitum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter acclimatization the rats are randomly allocated to the experimental groups and dosed i.v. with test compound at start of LPS-induction and once again 8 hours after LPS-induction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRats in groups of 3 are anaesthetized with 0.1 ml hypnorm/dormicum pr. 100 g and dosed i.v with the test compound. Immediately after dosing they are placed in the inhalation chamber where they are subjected to a nebulized LPS solution. The concentration of LPS is 1 mg/ml. Dosing time is 15 minutes. The rats are euthanized 24 hours after dosing with the test substance. At termination the rats are eutanized with CO\n2\n/O\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThen bronchoalveolar lavage is performed by installing and withdrawing 6×2.5 ml of PBS to the right lung. Lavage is done with the lungs remaining in the thorax after removing sternum and costae. The connection to the left lung is tied off during this procedure. Bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) is centrifuged at 1000 rpm at 4° C. for 10 minutes. After removing the supernatant the cell pellet is resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS and total cell count performed. Two smears of BALF stained with May-Grüwald Giemsa stain is made from each rat. BALF from each rat is subjected to total cell count and to differential count of leucocytes.\n\n\n \nExperimental Groups:\n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition to LPS infusion all rats are treated with bolus injections of either:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVehicle (0.5 mL isotonic saline);\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference compound: e.g. reference-compound no. 1 (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg/bw) and/or reference-compound no. 2 (e.g 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg/bw) and/or reference-compound no. 3 (0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg/bw) and/or α-MSH (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg/bw). Finally a time control group without LPS inhalation is treated with Vehicle.\n\n\n \nStatistics\n\n\n \n \n \nData are presented as mean±S.E.

Differences are considered significant at the 0.05 level.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nInhibition of LPS-Induced Cytokine Release and Pulmonary Hypertension in Pigs In Vivo\n\n\n \n \n \nFemale Landrace pigs (˜30 kg) are fasted overnight but allowed free access to water. Then the pigs are premedicated with intramuscular ketamine (10 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.25 mg/kg). Anesthesia is induced with intravenous ketamine (5 mg/kg). The pigs are orally intubated, and anesthesia is maintained with a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl (60 μg/kg/h and midazolam (6 mg/kg/h). The animals are ventilated with a volume-controlled ventilator (Servo 900 ventilator; Siemens Elema, Solna, Sweden) with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H\n2\nO. Tidal volume is kept at 10-15 ml/kg, and the respiratory rate adjusted (20-25 breaths/min) to maintain normocapnia (arterial carbon dioxide tension [PaCO\n2\n] in the range of 34-45 mmHg). Ventilation is performed with oxygen in air aimed tot reach an arterial oxygen tension (PaO\n2\n) higher than 105 mmHg. One arterial and 2 venous sheaths are placed in the carotid artery and corresponding veins for infusion, blood pressure measurements through fluid filled catheter, blood sampling and for introducing catheters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Swan-Ganz catheter (Edwards Lifescience Corp., Irvine, Calif.) is inserted in the pulmonary artery via the right cava superior vein. Localization of the balloon-tipped catheter is determined by observing the characteristic pressure trace on the monitor as it is advance through the right side of the heart into the pulmonary artery as well as by x-ray. Another catheter (5 French; St. Jude Medical Company, St. Paul, Minn.) is inserted into the left carotid artery for continuous blood pressure monitoring and blood sampling. A urine catheter is inserted for urine collection. A temporary pace catheter is inserted through the venous sheath to the right atrium (x-ray guided) to standardise heart rate, when assessing cardiac performance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHemodynamic Monitoring. Continuous observations is performed of arterial blood pressure, heart rate (from the electrocardiogram), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLipopolysaccharide Infusion. \nEscherichia coli \nlipopolysaccharide endotoxin, (\nE. coli \n026:\n—\n6, Bacto Lipopolysaccharides; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) is dissolved in saline 120 min before each experiment to dissolve any precipitate. After a stabilization period, lipopolysaccharide infusion is started at baseline at a rate of 2.5 μg/kg/h and increased stepwise to 15 μg/kg/min during 30 min. After this, the fusion was kept at a rate of 2.5 μg/h kg/h during 150 min and thereafter discontinued.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterventional groups: The control group is given vehicle in equal volume to the intervention group immediately before LPS infusion is initiated. The interventional group is given a dose of reference compound (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg) or test compound (e.g 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg), as a single intravenous bolus injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCytokines. Fresh frozen plasma samples (−80° C.) obtained from EDTA-stabilized blood is used for measurements of TNFα by use of commercial available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStatistics. Data are presented as mean±S.E. Between group comparisons are performed by one way analysis of variance followed by Fishers Least Significant Difference test. Differences are considered significant at the 0.05 level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the following two examples of models of temporarily ischemia are described. Ischemia induced by reduced/complete arrest in arterial blood supply induces multiple tissue reactions including neutrophil accumulation, other inflammatory responses and cell death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdentification of compounds that could inhibit or prevent (either completely or partially) many of the cell/tissue/organ impairments or destructions occurring as a result of ischemia/inflammation is of great benefit. The inventor is using two models of temporarily ischemia: 1) the myocardial ischemia reperfusion model in rats, which mimics the development of acute myocardial infarction followed by restoration of blood supply as it is achieved by either fibrinolytic therapy or coronary angioplasty (example 8); and 2) bilateral renal artery occlusion, which induces acute renal failure (ARF) comparable to AFR induced by temporarily reduction in the renal blood supply as seen in patients undergoing major surgical interventions (an example could be surgical intervention due to abdominal aorta aneurism) (example 9).\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nInhibition of Myocardial Infarction Size, Induced by 60 Minutes Occlusion of the Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery in Rats\n\n\n \n \n \nBarrier-bred and specific pathogen-free female Wistar rats (250 g) are obtained from Charles River, Hannover, Germany. The animals are housed in a temperature (22-24° C.) and moisture (40-70%) controlled room with a 12-hour light-dark cycle (light on from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.). All animals are given free access to tap water and a pelleted rat diet containing approximately 140 mmol/kg of sodium, 275 mmol/kg potassium and 23% protein (Altromin catalogue no. 1310, Altromin International, Lage, Germany). The rats are instrumented with permanent medical grade Tygon catheters in the inferior caval vein and the abdominal aorta via the femoral vein and artery. One week later the Rats are anaesthetized in an inhalation chamber with 4% isoflurane in O\n2\n. After insertion of an endotracheal tube the animal is artificially ventilated with 1.0% isoflurane in O\n2 \nusing af Hugo Basile Rodent ventilator. Tidal volume is 8-10 ml/kg b.w. and \nrespiratory rate\n 75 min\n−1\n, which maintains arterial pH between 7.35 and 7.45. During surgery the animal is placed on a heated table that maintains rectal temperature at 37-38° C. Standard ECG (second lead) is measured using a Hugo Sachs ECG Coupler and collected on line at 4,000 Hz in PowerLab. After parasternal thoracotomy and opening of the pericardium the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) is localized visually. An atraumatic 6-0 silk suture with an occluder that allows reopening of the ligature is placed around the LAD between the pulmonary trunk and the lower right end of the left auricle. After 10 minutes the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) is occluded. Successful occluding is confirmed by alterations in ECG (ST-segment elevation and increase in R-wave amplitude) and by fall in MAP. Reperfusion is made after 60 minutes by opening the occluder. Control rats are sham-operated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rats are subjected to one of the following i.v treatments:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVehicle: 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference compound: e.g reference-compound no. 1, reference-compound no. 2 or reference-compound no. 3 (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg b.w.) or e.g. α-MSH (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg α-melanocyte stimulating hormone/kg b.w.) in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest compound e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5 mg test compound/kg b.w. in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment is given 5 minutes prior to reperfusion.\n\n\n \nDetermination Af the Size of the Ischemic and Necrotic Myocardium\n\n\n \n \n \nThe rats are kept anaesthetized after the ischemia/reperfusion and re-occluding of the LAD is performed after three hours reperfusion. During this period ECG and MAP are measured continuously. Then Evans Blue dye (1 ml; 2% w/v) is administered i.v. to determine the size of the ischemic area. The heart is removed and cut into horizontal slices to determine the size of the ischemic area and to separate the ischemic myocardium from the non-ischemic myocardium. The ischemic area is isolated and incubated in a 0.5% triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution for 10 minutes at 37° C. The size of the necrotic tissue is then measured by used of a computerized image program. An additional setup of animals are treated with buprenorphine post-surgical and returned to there cages for measurement of left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) two weeks later in order to evaluate the effect of the pharmacological treatment on the development of congestive heart failure. LVEDP is measured using a 2F microtip catheters inserted into the left ventricle via the right carotid artery. Isoflurane concentration is adjusted to stabilize mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 85-90 mmHg.\n\n\n \nStatistics\n\n\n \n \n \nData are presented as mean±S.E. Within group comparisons are analysed with Student's paired t test. Between group comparisons are performed by one way analysis of variance followed by Fishers Least Significant Difference test. Differences are considered significant at the 0.05 level.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nInhibition of Renal Failure Induced by 40 Minutes Bilateral Occlusion of the Renal Arteries in Rats\n\n\n \n \n \nBarrier-bred and specific pathogen-free female Wistar rats (250 g) are obtained from Charles River, Hannover, Germany. The animals are housed in a temperature (22-24° C.) and moisture (40-70%) controlled room with a 12-hour light-dark cycle (light on from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.). All animals are given free access to tap water and a pelleted rat diet containing approximately 140 mmol/kg of sodium, 275 mmol/kg potassium and 23% protein (Altromin catalogue no. 1310, Altromin International, Lage, Germany).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rats, which previously have been instrumented with a chronic venous catheter, are placed in metabolic cages and after a two days acclimation period to the metabolic cages, experimental ARF is induced by occlusion of both renal arteries for 60 min. During surgery, the rats are anesthetized with isoflurane-nitrous oxide and placed on a heated table to maintain rectal temperature at 37° C. Both kidneys are exposed through flank incisions, mobilized by being dissected free from the perirenal fat, then a small portion of the renal artery is gently dissected from the vein. The renal arteries are occluded with a smooth surfaced vascular clip (60 g pressure; World Precision Instruments, UK) for 40 min. Total ischemia is confirmed by observing blanching of the entire kidney surface. During the period of ischemia, the wounds are closed temporarily to maintain body temperature. After the clips are removed, the kidneys are observed for additional 2-5 min. to ensure color change, indicating blood reflow. Then the wound are closed with 3-0 silk ligatures. The rats returned to the metabolic cages, and daily 24 h urine output and water intake are measured for five days. As a control group, rats are subjected to sham operations identical to the ones used for ARF rats without occlusion of the renal arteries. Sham-operated rats are monitored in parallel with rats with ARF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rats are subjected to one of the following i.v treatments:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVehicle: 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference compound: e.g reference-compound no. 1, reference-compound no. 2 or reference-compound no. 3 (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg b.w.) or e.g. α-MSH (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg α-melanocyte stimulating hormone/kg b.w.) in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest compound: e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5 mg test compound/kg b.w. in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl. Treatment is given 5 minutes prior to reperfusion of the kidney and subsequently 6 and 24 hours later.\n\n\n \nStatistics\n\n\n \n \n \nData are presented as mean±S.E. Within group comparisons are analysed with Student's paired t test. Between group comparisons are performed by one way analysis of variance followed by Fishers Least Significant Difference test. Differences are considered significant at the 0.05 level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, an example (example 10) is given on a model of cisplatin-induced renal failure. Nephrotoxicity is a well-known side effect to cisplatin treatment. Though not necessarily dose limiting renal toxicity still affects the majority of patients and a significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate is observed during treatment. The renal toxicity of cisplatin is seen as a direct cytotoxic damage on the nephrons in the outer medulla especially in the S3 segment of the proximal tubules and in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Hence cisplatin treatment often results in tubular reabsorption defects including an impaired ability to dilute the urine. Hypomagnesemia is observed in approximately 50% of patients treated with cisplatin and is probably due to a defect in renal magnesium (Mg) reabsorption. A recent study has suggested that Mg supplementation is a crucial factor in protection against the nephrotoxic actions of Cyclosporin A and a possible relation between Mg loss and cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity has recently been suggested. Treatment aimed to prevent hypomagnesemia would therefore have beneficial effects in order not only to reduce the need of Mg supplementation, but also in order to reduce the renal toxicity of cisplatin.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nInhibition of Cisplatin Induced Renal Failure\n\n\n \n \n \nRats, which previously have been instrumented with a chronic venous catheter, are placed in metabolic cages and after a period of acclimation to the metabolic cages the rats are treated with an interperitoneal cisplatin injection 5.0 mg/kg bw in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl or vehicle (0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl). Five days later the rats are then returned to metabolic cages, and daily 24 h urine output and water intake are measured and collected for the next five days. All rats are then anesthetized in halothan/N\n2\nO and an arterial blood sample collected in prechilled EDTA coated vials. The blood samples are collected in a prechilled test tube with 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and 20×10\n6 \nIU/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation at 4° C., plasma samples are transferred to pre-chilled test tubes and stored at −20° C. for later measurements of creatinine and Magnesium (Mg). In addition to this creatinine is also measured in the urine collected in the last 24 hours period prior to the blood collection. Creatinine clearance (C\ncr\n), used as an index of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), can then be calculated as the C\ncr\n=V\nu\n×U\ncr\n/P\ncr\n, where V\nu \nis 24 hours urine production; U\ncr \nis the creatinine concentration on the urine and P\ncr \nis the creatinine concentration in plasma. Measurement of creatinine in urine and plasma is performed by use of the clinical chemistry systems VITROS 950 (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Inc., Johnson & Johnson, NJ) and Roche Hitachi Modular (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rats are subjected to one of the following i.v treatments:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVehicle: 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference compound: e.g reference-compound no. 1, reference-compound no. 2 or reference-compound no. 3 (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg b.w.) or e.g. α-MSH (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg α-melanocyte stimulating hormone/kg b.w.) in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest compound: e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5 mg test compound/kg b.w. in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.

Thereafter the mean plasma concentration of \ncompound\n 2 of the invention declined with an apparent terminal half-life of 2.25 h.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMean absolute oral bioavailability of \ncompound\n 2 of the invention in rats was 3.20%.\n\n\n \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe aim of this study was to determine the intravenous pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability of \n \n \ncompound\n \n \n 1, 2 and 3 of the invention following administration to Sprague Dawley rats at a dose level of 10 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo adverse affects were noted following either intravenous or oral administration of \n \n \ncompound\n \n \n 1, 2 and 3 of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing intravenous administration at 10 mg/kg, mean plasma concentrations of \ncompound\n 1 of the invention declined slowly with a mean apparent terminal half-life of 5.70 h. Systemic clearance of \ncompound\n 1 of the invention was moderate and volume of distribution exceeded the total body water suggesting extensive distribution to the tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing oral administration at a target dose of 10 mg/kg, the maximum plasma concentration of \ncompound\n 1 of the invention was observed at 8 h post dose. Thereafter mean plasma concentrations declined slowly with an apparent terminal half-life of 4.61 h. Mean absolute oral bioavailability of \ncompound\n 1 of the invention was 34.8%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing intravenous administration at 10 mg/kg, mean plasma concentrations of \ncompound\n 3 of the invention declined quickly with a mean apparent terminal half-life of 3.14 h. Systemic clearance of \ncompound\n 3 of the invention was high and volume of distribution exceeded the total body water suggesting extensive distribution to the tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing oral administration at a target dose of 10 mg/kg, the maximum plasma concentration of \ncompound\n 3 of the invention was observed at 4 h post dose. Thereafter the mean plasma concentrations declined quickly with an apparent terminal half-life of 3.30 h. Mean absolute oral bioavailability of \ncompound\n 3 of the invention was 20.6%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing intravenous administration at 10 mg/kg, mean plasma concentrations of \ncompound\n 2 of the invention declined quickly with a mean apparent terminal half-life of 3.25 h. Systemic clearance of \ncompound\n 2 of the invention was high and volume of distribution exceeded the total body water suggesting extensive distribution to the tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing oral administration at a target dose of 10 mg/kg, the maximum plasma concentration of \ncompound\n 2 of the invention was observed at 2.5 h post dose. Thereafter mean plasma concentration declined quickly with an apparent terminal half-life of 2.25 h.

and in temperature and humidity controlled rooms. The animals are allowed one week of acclimation in individual cages mounted with feeders containing powdered chow and tap water. During the acclimation period, rats are handled daily to accustom them to the po gavage procedure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe animals are randomized into weight-matched groups prior to dosing. Each animal can be doses up to 4 times with a 7 days drug wash-out period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter each dosing, food-, water intake and locomotor activity will be monitored on a repeated \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbase\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 hours post dosing.\n\n\n \nCompounds and Dosing\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention (\ne.g compound\n 1, \ncompound\n 2 and compound 3) will be dissolved on a weekly basis in vehicle (20% PEG200, 40% Cremophor RH40, 25% Labrasol or 30% Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin) and administered via oral gavage, intravenous injection or subcutaneous injection (volume up to 5 ml/kg) once or twice daily. Vehicle (20% PEG200, 40% Cremophor RH40, 25% Labrasol or 30% Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin) will be prepared on a weekly basis and administered via oral gavage, intravenous injection or subcutaneous injection (volume up to 5 ml/kg) once or twice daily."
