Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to 3-cyanopyridine compounds which are useful as kinase inhibitors.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein kinases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to an amino acid residue, such as tyrosine, serine, threonine or histidine, on a protein. Regulation of these protein kinases is essential for the control of a wide variety of cellular events including proliferation and migration. A large number of diseases are associated with abnormal cellular events that are mediated by these kinases, for example, various inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases such as asthma, psoriasis, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and joint inflammation. See, e.g., Salek-Ardakami, S., et al., \nJ. Immunology, \n2004, 173(10), 6440-47; Marsland, B., et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n2004, 200(2), 181-89; Tan, S, et al., \nJ.

Med., \n2003, 197(11), 1525-35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne class of serine/threonine kinases is the protein kinase C (PKC) family. This group of kinases consists of 10 members that share sequence and structural homology. The PKCs are divided into 3 groups and include the classic, the novel, and the atypical isoforms. The theta isoform (PKCθ) is a member of the novel calcium-independent class of PKCs (Baier, G. et al. (1993), \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n268: 4997-5004). PKCθ is highly expressed in T cells (Mischak, H. et al. (1993), \nFEBS Lett., \n326: 51-5), with some expression reported in mast cells (Liu, Y. et al. (2001), \nJ. Leukoc. Biol., \n69: 831-40), endothelial cells (Mattila, P. et al. (1994), \nLife Sci., \n55: 1253-60), and skeletal muscles (Baier, G. et al. (1994), \nEur. J. Biochem., \n225: 195-203). It has been shown that PKCθ plays an essential role in T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signaling (Tan, S. L. et al. (2003), \nBiochem. J., \n376: 545-52). Specifically, it has been observed that inhibiting PKCθ signal transduction, as demonstrated with two independent PKCθ knockout mouse lines, will result in defects in T cell activation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production (Sun, Z. et al. (2000), \nNature, \n404: 402-7; Pfeifhofer, C. et al. (2003), \nJ. Exp. Med., \n197: 1525-35). It also has been shown that PKCθ-deficient mice show impaired pulmonary inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in a Th2-dependent murine asthma model, with no defects in viral clearance and Th1-dependent cytotoxic T cell function (Berg-Brown, N. N. et al. (2004), \nJ. Exp. Med., \n199: 743-52; Marsland, B. J. et al. (2004), \nJ. Exp. Med., \n200: 181-9). The impaired Th2 cell responses result in reduced levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and immunoglobulin E (IgE), contributing to the AHR and inflammatory pathophysiology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEvidence also exists that PKCθ participates in the IgE receptor (FceRI)-mediated response of mast cells (Liu, Y. et al. (2001), \nJ. Leukoc. Biol., \n69: 831-840). In human-cultured mast cells (HCMC), it has been demonstrated that PKC kinase activity rapidly localizes (in less than five minutes) to the membrane following FceRI cross-linking (Kimata, M. et al. (1999), \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., \n257(3): 895-900). A recent study examining in vitro activation of bone marrow mast cells (BMMCs) derived from wild-type and PKCθ-deficient mice shows that upon FceRI cross-linking, BMMCs from PKCθ-deficient mice produced reduced levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), and interleukin-13 (IL-13) in comparision with BMMCs from wild-type mice, suggesting a potential role for PKCθ in mast cell cytokine production in addition to T cell activation (Ciarletta, A. B. et al. (2005), poster presentation at the 2005 American Thoracic Society International Conference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther serine/threonine kinases include those of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway which consists of the MAP kinases (MAPK) (e.g., erk) and the MAPK kinases (MAPKK) (e.g., mek and their substrates). Members of the raf family of kinases phosphorylate residues on mek. The cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), including cdc2/cyclin B, cdk2/cyclin A, cdk2/cyclin E and cdk4/cyclin D, and others, are serine/threonine kinases that regulate mammalian cell division. Additional serine/threonine kinases include the protein kinases A and B. These kinases, known as PKA or cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and PKB (Akt), play key roles in signal transduction pathways.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTyrosine kinases (TKs) are divided into two classes: the non-transmembrane TKs and transmembrane growth factor receptor TKs (RTKs). Growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), bind to the extracellular domain of their partner RTK on the cell surface which activates the RTK, initiating a signal transduction cascade that controls a wide variety of cellular responses. In addition to EGF, there are several other RTKs including FGFR (the receptor for fibroblast growth factor (FGF)); flk-1 (also known as KDR), and flt-1 (the receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)); and PDGFR (the receptor for platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)). Other RTKs include tie-1 and tie-2, colony stimulating factor receptor, the nerve growth factor receptor, and the insulin-like growth factor receptor. In addition to the RTKs there is another family of TKs termed the cytoplasmic protein or non-receptor TKs. The cytoplasmic protein TKs have intrinsic kinase activity, are present in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and participate in diverse signaling pathways. There are a large number of non-receptor TKs including Abl, Jak, Fak, Syk, Zap-70 and Csk, and the Src family of kinases (SFKs) which include Src, Lck, Lyn, Fyn and others.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention is directed to compounds of formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nI wherein G is\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein X, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4 \nand p are defined below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the present invention is directed to compositions comprising a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the present invention is directed to treating or inhibiting a pathological condition or disorder mediated by a protein kinase (e.g., protein kinase C) in a mammal (e.g., a human), comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the present invention is directed to methods of making the compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the present invention is directed to intermediate compounds useful for making the compounds of formula I.\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nExcept where otherwise indicated, the terms below have the following meanings everywhere in this specification and in the appended claims:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “include”, “includes”, “including” and the like are intended to be open-ended unless otherwise specified, i.e., e.g., “including” means “including but not limited to” in the absence of an express limitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of the singular herein includes the plural (and vice versa) unless specifically stated otherwise.

Similarly, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I having a basic moiety can be formed using organic and/or inorganic acids. Both mono and polycationic salts are contemplated, depending on the number of lone-pair electrons available for donation. For example, suitable salts can be formed from the following acids: acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, dichloroacetic, ethenesulfonic, formic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, malonic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, naphthalenesulfonic, nitric, oxalic, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, phthalic, propionic, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, and toluenesulfonic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEsters of the compounds of formula I can include various pharmaceutically acceptable esters known in the art that can be metabolized into the free acid form (e.g., a free carboxylic acid form) in a mammal. Examples of such esters include alkyl esters (e.g., of 1 to 10 carbon atoms), cycloalkyl esters (e.g., of 3-10 carbon atoms), aryl esters (e.g., of 6-14 carbon atoms, including of 6-10 carbon atoms), and heterocyclic analogues thereof (e.g., of 3-14 ring atoms, 1-3 of which can be selected from oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur heteroatoms), wherein the alcohol residue can include further substituents. In some embodiments, esters of the compounds disclosed herein can be C\n1-10 \nalkyl esters, such as methyl esters, ethyl esters, propyl esters, isopropyl esters, butyl esters, isobutyl esters, t-butyl esters, pentyl esters, isopentyl esters, neopentyl esters, and hexyl esters; C\n3-10 \ncycloalkyl esters, such as cyclopropyl esters, cyclopropylmethyl esters, cyclobutyl esters, cyclopentyl esters, and cyclohexyl esters; or aryl esters, such as phenyl esters, benzyl esters, and tolyl esters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present teachings also provide compositions that comprise or include at least one compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or diluents. Compositions may also consist essentially of one or more compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or diluents. Suitable excipients are those that do not adversely interact with the active ingredient are compatible with the other ingredients in the formulation and are biologically acceptable. Examples of such excipients are well known to those skilled in the art, e.g., as described in \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, \n5th edition, eds. R. C. Rowe, P. J. Sheskey and S. C. Owen, Pharmaceutical Press: London, UK (2003), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.

Oral formulations herein can utilize standard delay or time-release formulations to alter the absorption of the active compound(s). The oral formulation can also comprise a compound as described herein in water or fruit juice, containing appropriate solubilizers or emulsifiers as needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid carriers can be used in preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups, elixirs, and for inhaled delivery. A compound described herein can be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic solvent, or a mixture of both, or pharmaceutically acceptable oils or fats. The liquid carrier can contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, colors, viscosity regulators, stabilizers, and osmo-regulators. Examples of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral administration include water (particularly containing additives as described above, e.g., cellulose derivatives such as a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, e.g., glycols) and their derivatives, and oils (e.g., fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration, the carrier can be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Sterile liquid carriers are used in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration. The liquid carrier for pressurized compositions can be halogenated hydrocarbon or other pharmaceutically acceptable propellants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid pharmaceutical compositions, which are sterile solutions or suspensions, can be utilized by, for example, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection. Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously. Compositions for oral administration can be in either liquid or solid form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably the pharmaceutical composition is in unit dosage form, for example, as tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, granules, or suppositories. In such form, the pharmaceutical composition can be sub-divided in unit dose(s) containing appropriate quantities of the active compound. The unit dosage forms can be packaged compositions, for example, packeted powders, vials, ampoules, prefilled syringes or sachets containing liquids. Alternatively, the unit dosage form can be a capsule or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any such compositions in package form. Such unit dosage form may contain from about 1 mg/kg of active compound to about 500 mg/kg of active compound, and can be given in a single dose or in two or more doses. Such doses can be administered in any manner useful in directing the active compound(s) to the recipient's bloodstream, including orally, via implants, parenterally (including intravenous, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous injections), rectally, vaginally, and transdermally. Such administrations can be carried out using the compounds of the present teachings including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in lotions, creams, foams, patches, suspensions, solutions, and suppositories (rectal and vaginal).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen administered for the treatment or inhibition of a particular disease state or disorder, it is understood that an effective dosage can vary depending upon many factors such as the particular compound utilized, the mode of administration, and severity of the condition being treated, as well as the various physical factors related to the individual being treated. In therapeutic applications, a compound of the present teachings can be provided to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially ameliorate the symptoms of the disease and its complications. The dosage to be used in the treatment of a specific individual typically must be subjectively determined by the attending physician. The variables involved include the specific condition and its state as well as the size, age and response pattern of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, for example those in which the lung is the targeted organ, it may be desirable to administer a compound directly to the airways of the patient, using devices such as metered dose inhalers, breath-operated inhalers, multidose dry-powder inhalers, pumps, squeeze-actuated nebulized spray dispensers, aerosol dispensers, and aerosol nebulizers. For administration by intranasal or intrabronchial inhalation, the compounds of the present teachings can be formulated into a liquid composition, a solid composition, or an aerosol composition. The liquid composition can include, by way of illustration, one or more compounds of the present teachings dissolved, partially dissolved, or suspended in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvents and can be administered by, for example, a pump or a squeeze-actuated nebulized spray dispenser. The solvents can be, for example, isotonic saline or bacteriostatic water. The solid composition can be, by way of illustration, a powder preparation including one or more compounds of the present teachings intermixed with lactose or other inert powders that are acceptable for intrabronchial use, and can be administered by, for example, an aerosol dispenser or a device that breaks or punctures a capsule encasing the solid composition and delivers the solid composition for inhalation. The aerosol composition can include, by way of illustration, one or more compounds of the present teachings, propellants, surfactants, and co-solvents, and can be administered by, for example, a metered device. The propellants can be a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA), or other propellants that are physiologically and environmentally acceptable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds described herein can be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, or esters thereof can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxyl-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations typically contain a preservative to inhibit the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical forms suitable for injection can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In preferred embodiments, the form is sterile and its viscosity permits it to flow through a syringe. The form preferably is stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and can be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds described herein can be administered transdermally, i.e., administered across the surface of the body and the inner linings of bodily passages including epithelial and mucosal tissues. Such administration can be carried out using the compounds of the present teachings including pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, and esters thereof, in lotions, creams, foams, patches, suspensions, solutions, and suppositories (rectal and vaginal). Topical formulations that deliver active compound(s) through the epidermis can be useful for localized treatment of inflammation and arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransdermal administration can be accomplished through the use of a transdermal patch containing an active compound and a carrier that can be inert to the active compound, can be non-toxic to the skin, and can allow delivery of the active compound for systemic absorption into the blood stream via the skin. The carrier can take any number of forms such as creams and ointments, pastes, gels, and occlusive devices. The creams and ointments can be viscous liquid or semisolid emulsions of either the oil-in-water or water-in-oil type. Pastes comprised of absorptive powders dispersed in petroleum or hydrophilic petroleum containing the active compound can also be suitable. A variety of occlusive devices can be used to release the active compound into the blood stream, such as a semi-permeable membrane covering a reservoir containing the active compound with or without a carrier, or a matrix containing the active compound. Other occlusive devices are known in the literature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds described herein can be administered rectally or vaginally in the form of a conventional suppository. Suppository formulations can be made from traditional materials, including cocoa butter, with or without the addition of waxes to alter the suppository's melting point, and glycerin. Water-soluble suppository bases, such as polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights, can also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLipid formulations or nanocapsules can be used to introduce compounds of the present teachings into host cells either in vitro or in vivo. Lipid formulations and nanocapsules can be prepared by methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo increase the effectiveness of compounds of the present teachings, it can be desirable to combine a compound with other agents effective in the treatment of the target disease. For inflammatory diseases, other active compounds (i.e., other active ingredients or agents) effective in their treatment, and particularly in the treatment of asthma and arthritis, can be administered with active compounds of the present teachings. The other agents can be administered at the same time or at different times than the compounds disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout the description, where compositions are described as having, including, or comprising specific components, or where processes are described as having, including, or comprising specific process steps, it is contemplated that compositions of the present teachings also consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited components, and that the processes of the present teachings also consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited processing steps.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that the order of steps or order for performing certain actions is immaterial so long as the present teachings remain operable. Moreover, two or more steps or actions may be conducted simultaneously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain intermediate compounds useful for preparing the compounds of formula I are prepared as shown in Scheme 1:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 6-alkyl-4(1H)-pyridone-3-carboxylic acids i can be iodinated at C-5, for example, by using the method reported in WO9948892 to prepare 5-iodo-6-methyl-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridine-3-carboxylic acid (ii where R\n2 \nis methyl). The carboxylic acid group is converted to the primary amide iii by reaction with N,N-carbonyldiimidazole followed by treatment with aqueous ammonium hydroxide. Heating of the amide iii in phosphorus oxychloride, optionally in the presence of a catalytic amount of DMF, results in dehydration of the amide with concomitant chlorination at C-4 to give the key 4-chloro-5-iodo intermediate iv.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an analogous fashion, the 5-bromo-4-chloro intermediates can be prepared by the route shown in Scheme 2. The first step in the preparation of these intermediates is bromination of i at C-5 with bromine in acetic acid, containing an optional amount of pyridine.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I can be prepared from intermediates iv and vii as shown in Scheme 3. Reaction of the 4-chloro group of iv or vii with a compound of formula II where X is NR\n3 \ngives the 4-amino analog viii where X is NR\n3\n. This reaction can be performed in a solvent such as ethanol, propanol, butanol, or 2-ethoxyethanol, at elevated temperatures optionally in the presence of pyridine hydrochloride or triethylamine; or alternatively using an alkali base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide at elevated temperatures. Reaction of the 4-chloro group of iv or vii with a compound of formula II where X is O or S gives the 4-oxygen or sulfur analog viii where X is O or S, respectively. Palladium catalyzed coupling of viii with a boronic acid of formula R\n1\nB(OH)\n2\n, a boronic acid ester of formula R\n1\nB(OR)\n2 \nor a stannane of formula R\n1\nSnR\n3 \n(where R, in each case, is a C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl group), provides compounds of formula I. Alternatively, the order of the reactions can be reversed.

invention, a series of compounds were selected for stability testing in rat liver microsomes. A DMSO solution of each compound was incubated for 30 minutes in the presence of rat liver homogenate. The percentage of remaining compound was assessed by HPLC. An approximate half life was calculated from the percentage of remaining compound. Table II, below, illustrates a comparison of the in vitro microsomal half life of the selected compounds verses a series of related compounds lacking the C-6 alkyl group. From these results, it is apparent that the C-6 alkyl group imparts a beneficial effect on the in vitro metabolic stability of the compounds of the invention. It is generally accepted in the industry that improved in vitro metabolic stability frequently translates into improved in vivo metabolic stability. Improved metabolic stability may translate to increased in vivo exposure levels.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRat Microsome Stability of 6-H cyanopyridine Compounds\n\n\nRat Microsome Stability of 6-Me cyanopyridine Compounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 28 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5 min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 29\n\n\n20  min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3 min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 40\n\n\n13 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22 min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 38\n\n\n>30   min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6 min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 39\n\n\n14 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>30   min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 36\n\n\n>30   min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 35\n\n\n>30   min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 8 min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 33\n\n\n>30   min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>30   min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 37\n\n\n>30   min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 8  min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 30\n\n\n17 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>30   min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 22\n\n\n>30   min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>30    min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 23\n\n\n>30   min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21  min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 20\n\n\n>30   min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14  min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 14\n\n\n>30   min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 7 min\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n example 19\n\n\n>30   min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany variations of the present invention not illustrated herein will occur to those skilled in the art.

The entire contents of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a novel adenine compound having an aromatic ring, useful as a therapeutic and/or preventive agent for allergic disease, viral disease or cancer, etc.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nIn case that foreign substances including bacteria, virus or parasite invade living organisms, immune systems exist in order to exclude said substances. In acquired immune systems, antigen processing by antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) is carried out when the foreign substances invade, and naive Th cells functionally differentiate via interactions of DCs/Th cells into Th1 or Th2 cells which play a central role of immune response in a body. It is reported that immune diseases are developed by one-way deflection of immuno-balance of Th1 or Th2 cells in this process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, an excess amount of cytokine such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-5 (IL-5) secreted by Th2 cells is secreted in patients with allergic diseases, and the compound inhibiting immune response of Th2 cells may be expected to be a therapeutic agent for allergic disease. Also, the compound enhancing immune response of Th1 cells may be expected to be a therapeutic or preventive agent for viral disease or cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the meantime, it was believed until recently that natural immune system was caused by nonspecific phagocytosis, but it was proved that Toll-like receptor (TLR) exists and principle parts of natural immunity activation are carried out via TLR. Moreover, a ligand of TLR may be expected to have a function as a Th1/Th2 differentiation controlling agent and to be useful for treatment or prevention of immune diseases in that TLR recognizes a ligand to induce inflammatory cytokine such as IL-12, TNF, and IL-12 differentiates and induces naive T cell to Th1 cell. Actually, it is known that Th2 cell predominates in patients with asthma, atopic dermatitis, etc., and asthma-targeted clinical trials are carried out for DNA (CpGDNA) derived from microorganism, TLR9 agonist. Additionally, it is known that TLR7/8 agonist, imidazoquinoline derivative (see Patent Document 1) also shows an inhibitory activity toward the production of Th2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-5 (IL-5), and is actually useful for allergic diseases in experimental animal models.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeanwhile, compounds described in, for example, Patent Documents 2 to 4 are known as compounds with adenine structures which are effective for immune diseases such as viral diseases and allergic diseases.\n\n\n \n \nPatent Document 1: U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,338\n\n\n \nPatent Document 2: WO98/01448\n\n\nPatent Document 3: WO99/28321\n\n\nPatent Document 4: WO04/029054\n\n\nDISCLOSURE OF INVENTION\n\n\nProblems to be Resolved by the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nProblems to be resolved by the invention are directed to provide a TLR activator, more particularly a novel adenine compound which activates as a TLR7 activator, and an immune-response modifier comprising the same as an active ingredient, for example, a therapeutic or preventive agent for allergic disease such as asthma, COPD, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis or atopic dermatitis, viral disease such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV or HPV, bacterial infectious disease, cancer or dermatitis, etc.\n\n\n \nMeans of Solving the Problems\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors found the novel adenine compounds of the present invention according to their intensive study in order to obtain a therapeutic or preventive agent for immune diseases such as allergic disease, viral disease or cancer with excellent TLR activating action.

Tumor was surgically removed ten days after the tumor incubation under isoflurane anesthesia. On Day 11, Day 14, Day 17, Day 20, Day 24, Day 28, and Day 32, a test compound was administered via tail vein at the dose of 1 mg/kg. On Day 35, mouse was euthanized, and lung was collected from the mouse. Metastasized tumor nodules in lung was counted, and the frequency of the metastasized mice was calculated in each group. The results are shown in Table 8. The compounds tested significantly inhibited the metastasis into lung, showing antitumor activity.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntitumor activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFrequency of\n\n\nNumber of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nDose\n\n\nmetastasis\n\n\ntumor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 63\n\n\n 1 mg/kg\n\n\n0/6\n\n\n 0.0**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nvehicle\n\n\n10 mL/kg\n\n\n5/5\n\n\n>64.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n**p < 0.01 vs vehicle group (Wilcoxon)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 129\n\n\n6-Amino-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)-9-[6-(1-methylpiperidin-2-ylmethoxy)pyridin-4-ylmethyl]-7,9-dihydropurin-8-one\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1\nH NMR (DMSO-d\n6\n) δ 9.97 (1H, brs), 8.14 (1H, d, J=2.3 Hz), 7.65 (1H, dd, J=8.5 Hz, 2.3 Hz), 6.77 (1H, d, J=8.5 Hz), 6.49 (2H, brs), 4.80 (2H, s), 4.26-4.32 (3H, m), 4.17 (1H, m), 3.60 (2H, t, J=4.8 Hz), 3.28 (3H, s), 2.73 (1H, d, J=11.2 Hz), 2.19 (3H, s), 2.13-2.16 (1H, m), 1.99 (1H, m), 1.68 (2H, m), 1.19-1.50 (4H, m).\n\n\n \nExample 130\n\n\n6-Amino-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)-9-[6-(1-methylpyrrolidin-2-ylmethoxy)pyridin-3-ylmethyl]-7,9-dihydropurin-8-one\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1\nH NMR (DMSO-d\n6\n) δ 9.96 (1H, brs), 8.14 (1H, d, J=2.3 Hz), 7.64 (1H, dd, J=8.5 Hz, 2.3 Hz), 6.77 (1H, d, J=8.5 Hz), 6.49 (2H, brs), 4.80 (2H, s), 4.20-4.26 (3H, m), 4.08 (1H, m), 3.60 (2H, t, J=4.6 Hz), 3.27 (3H, s), 2.93 (1H, m), 2.31 (3H, s), 2.15 (1H, m), 1.85 (1H, m), 1.54-1.66 (3H, m).\n\n\n \nExample 131\n\n\n6-Amino-9-[6-(1-ethylpiperidin-3-yloxy)pyridin-3-ylmethyl]-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)-7,9-dihydropurin-8-one\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1\nH NMR (DMSO-d\n6\n) δ 9.97 (1H, brs), 8.14 (1H, d, J=2.3 Hz), 7.65 (1H, dd, J=8.5 Hz, 2.3 Hz), 6.75 (1H, d, J=8.5 Hz), 6.49 (2H, brs), 4.98 (1H, m), 4.79 (2H, s), 4.27 (2H, t, J=4.6 Hz), 3.59 (2H, t, J=4.6 Hz), 3.27 (3H, s), 2.94 (1H, d, J=8.4 Hz), 2.61 (1H, m), 2.33 (2H, m), 1.93-2.01 (3H, m), 1.68 (1H, m), 1.33 (1H, m), 1.49 (1H, m), 0.96 (3H, t, J=7.2 Hz).\n\n\n \nExample 132\n\n\n6-Amino-9-[6-(1-isopropylpyrrolidin-3-yloxy)pyridin-3-ylmethyl]-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)-7,9-dihydropurin-8-one\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1\nH NMR (DMSO-d\n6\n) δ 9.97 (1H, brs), 8.13 (1H, d, J=2.3 Hz), 7.64 (1H, dd, J=8.5 Hz, 2.3 Hz), 6.75 (1H, d, J=8.5 Hz), 6.50 (2H, brs), 5.29 (1H, m), 4.79 (2H, s), 4.28 (2H, t, J=4.8 Hz), 3.60 (2H, t, J=4.8 Hz), 3.28 (3H, s), 2.60-2.85 (3H, m), 2.10-2.40 (3H, ms), 1.73 (1H, m), 0.99 (6H, m).\n\n\n \nExample 133\n\n\n6-Amino-2-butoxy-9-{6-[2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)ethoxy]pyridin-3-ylmethyl}-7,9-dihydropurin-8-one\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1\nH NMR (DMSO-d\n6\n) δ 9.95 (1H, brs), 8.14 (1H, d, J=2.2 Hz), 7.64 (1H, dd, J=2.4, 8.4 Hz), 6.77 (1H, d, J=8.4 Hz), 6.46 (2H, s), 4.80 (2H, s), 4.31 (2H, t, J=6.0 Hz), 4.15 (2H, t, J=6.6 Hz), 2.63 (2H, t, J=5.8 Hz), 2.43 (4H, m), 2.32 (4H, m), 2.11 (3H, s), 1.63 (2H, m), 1.38 (2H, m), 0.92 (3H, t, J=7.0 Hz).\n\n\n \nExample 134\n\n\n6-Amino-2-butoxy-9-{6-[3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propoxy]pyridin-3-ylmethyl}-7,9-dihydropurin-8-one\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1\nH NMR (DMSO-d\n6\n) δ 9.95 (1H, s), 8.14 (1H, d, J=2.2 Hz), 7.64 (1H, dd, J=2.4, 8.4 Hz), 6.75 (1H, d, J=8.4 Hz), 6.46 (2H, s), 4.80 (2H, s), 4.22 (2H, t, J=6.6 Hz), 4.15 (2H, t, J=6.6 Hz), 2.35 (10H, m), 2.13 (3H, s), 1.82 (2H, m), 1.63 (2H, m), 1.38 (2H, m), 0.92 (3H, t, J=7.0 Hz).\n\n\n \nExample 135\n\n\n6-Amino-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)-9-[6-(1-propylpiperidin-4-yloxy)pyridin-3-ylmethyl]-7,9-dihydropurin-8-one\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1\nH NMR (DMSO-d\n6\n) δ 9.96 (1H, brs), 8.12 (1H, d, J=2.2 Hz), 7.63 (1H, dd, J=8.5, 2.2 Hz), 6.73 (1H, d, J=8.5 Hz), 6.48 (2H, s), 4.97-4.89 (1H, m), 4.78 (2H, s), 4.27 (2H, t, J=4.7 Hz), 3.59 (2H, t, J=4.7 Hz), 3.27 (3H, s), 2.70-2.60 (2H, m), 2.22 (2H, t, J=7.2 Hz), 2.16-2.08 (2H, m), 1.95-1.89 (2H, m), 1.65-1.55 (2H, m), 1.46-1.36 (2H, m), 0.83 (3H, t, J=7.4 Hz).\n\n\n \nExample 136\n\n\n6-Amino-9-[6-(1-isopropylpiperidin-4-yloxy)pyridin-3-ylmethyl]-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)-7,9-dihydropurin-8-one\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1\nH NMR (DMSO-d\n6\n) δ 9.96 (1H, brs), 8.12 (1H, d, J=2.3 Hz), 7.63 (1H, dd, J=8.5, 2.3 Hz), 6.73 (1H, d, J=8.5 Hz), 6.48 (2H, s), 4.95-4.86 (1H, m), 4.78 (2H, s), 4.27 (2H, t, J=4.7 Hz), 3.59 (2H, t, J=4.7 Hz), 3.27 (3H, s), 2.70-2.60 (3H, m), 2.34-2.25 (2H, m), 1.96-1.89 (2H, m), 1.62-1.53 (2H, m), 0.95 (6H, d, J=6.5 Hz)."
