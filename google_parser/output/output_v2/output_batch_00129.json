Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a benzazepine compound which is useful as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition, particularly a pharmaceutical composition for treating or preventing 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor-related diseases, particularly incontinence such as stress urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence, mixed urinary incontinence, and the like, sexual dysfunction such as erectile dysfunction syndrome and the like, obesity, and the like.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nA serotonin 2C (5-HT\n2C\n) receptor is one of the receptors for serotonin, a transmitter related to various physiological functions in the biological body. Its expression has been recognized mainly in the central nervous system (brain/spinal cord).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn anorectic action is known as a physiological function of the central 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor, and the lowering action on food intake in rats by various 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonists has been reported (Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2). Further, it has been confirmed that an anti-obesity action in humans is exhibited due to the anorectic action of the 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonist (Non-Patent Document 3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe central 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor is involved in the control of peripheral nerve functions and it has been reported that the rat penile erection is induced by a 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonist (Non-Patent Document 4) and that the time taken from insertion to ejaculation in the experiment for mating behavior of monkeys is prolonged (Non-Patent Document 5). Moreover, it has been reported that a 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonist increases the urethral resistance when the abdominal pressure is increased in rats (Non-Patent Document 6). In addition, it has been reported that in disease models with neurogenic/inflammatory pain in rats, efficacy is exhibited by intraspinal administration of a 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonist (Non-Patent Documents 7 and 8). Various clinical applications are considered for 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonists, particularly as anti-obesity drugs, drugs for treating male erectile dysfunction, drugs for treating premature ejaculation, drugs for treating stress urinary incontinence, drugs for treating neurogenic/inflammatory pain, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonist, a benzazepine derivative has been reported, and as a tricyclic benzazepine derivative, for example, Compound A (Patent Document 1) and Compound B (Patent Document 2) are known.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs other 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonists, bicyclic benzazepine derivatives have been reported (Patent Document 3, Patent Document 4, and Patent Document 5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a 2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10-octahydro-1H-azepino[4,5-g]quinoline derivative or a 3,4,6,7,9,10-hexahydro[1,4]oxazino[2,3-h][3]benzazepine derivative, which is a tricyclic benzazepine derivative, a compound of the formula (AA) is known to be a Dopamine D3 modulator and be useful for central drug abuse and drug dependence (Patent Document 6).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, in this document, the following compounds are disclosed as a synthetic intermediate for the formula (AA).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, there is a report on the structure-activity relationship of a specific compound of the formula (AA) (Non-Patent Document 9), and in this report, it is described that the following compound was used in the preparation of the compound of the formula (AA).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, there is a report on a 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonist (Non-Patent Document 10), and it is disclosed that for the compound below, potency on the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is lost by changing a ring condensed with benzazepine from a 5-membered ring to a 6-membered ring.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, in the documents which disclose such tricyclic benzazepine derivatives, there is no disclosure on the 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonist activity of the 2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10-octahydro-1H-azepino[4,5-g]quinoline derivative or the 3,4,6,7,9,10-hexahydro[1,4]oxazino[2,3-h][3]benzazepine derivative.\n\n\n \nPRIOR ART

During the preparation, replacing the relevant functional group with a suitable protective group (a group that can be easily converted into the functional group) at the stage from starting material to an intermediate may be effective depending on the type of the functional group in production technology in some cases. The protective group for such a functional group may include, for example, the protective groups described in “Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (4\nth \nEd., 2006)” written by P. G. M. Wuts and T. W. Greene, and one of these may be selected and used as necessary depending on the reaction conditions.

Further, the conditions for the de-carboxamide reaction, the de-carbamate reaction, the de-sulfonamide reaction described in “Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (4\nth \nEd., 2006)” above can be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious substituents defined as the groups in the compound of the formula (I), R\n1a\n, R\n1b\n, R\n2a\n, R\n2b\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, and R\n7 \ncan be easily converted to other functional groups by using the compound of the formula (I) as a starting material or using the synthetic intermediate of the compound of the formula (I) as a starting material by means of the reaction described in Examples as described later, the reaction apparent to a person skilled in the art, or modified methods thereof. For example, the step that can be usually employed by a person skilled in the art, such as O-alkylation, N-alkylation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, and the like can be arbitrarily combined and performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(Preparation of Starting Compound)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe starting compound in the preparation method above can be prepared by, for example, the following method, the method described in Preparation Examples as described later, known methods, or modified methods thereof.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound represented by the general formula (1) which is a starting material for synthesizing a compound of the general formula (2) is commercially available or prepared by a means known to a person skilled in the art.

For example, a number of known halogenation reactions can be used, examples of which include a method using N-bromosuccinimide or N-chlorosuccinimide, and the like. Then, the compound of the general formula (5) can be prepared from the compound of the general formula (4) by a coupling reaction using a transition metal catalyst.

In this case, it is preferable to carry out the reaction under a hydrogen atmosphere from normal pressure to 50 atmospheres under a temperature condition ranging from cooling to heating.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound of the general formula (IIIh) can be obtained by using the compound of the general formula (10) and a suitable halogenocarboxylic ester and reacting them in the presence of a base.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the general formula (IIIi) can be obtained by using the method described in the Starting Material Synthesis 4 above and carrying out reaction of a carbonyl group of the compound of the general formula (IIIh).\n\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n\n \n \n \n“Comprehensive Organic Functional Group Transformations II” written by A. R. Katritzky and R. J. K. Taylor, vol. 2, Elsevier Pergamon, 2005\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Courses in Experimental Chemistry (5\nth \nEd.)”, edited by The Chemical Society of Japan, vol. 14 (2005) (Maruzen)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the formula (I) can be isolated and purified as their free compounds, salts, hydrates, solvates, or polymorphic crystal substances thereof. The salts of the compound of the formula (I) can be prepared by carrying out the treatment of a conventional salt forming reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsolation and purification are carried out by employing ordinary chemical operations such as extraction, fractional crystallization, various types of fractional chromatography, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious isomers can be prepared by selecting an appropriate starting compound or separated by using the difference in the physicochemical properties between the isomers. For example, the optical isomers can be obtained by means of a general method for designing optical resolution of racemic products (for example, fractional crystallization for inducing diastereomer salts with optically active bases or acids, chromatography using a chiral column or the like, and others), and further, the isomers can also be prepared from an appropriate optically active starting material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacological activity of the compound of the formula (I) was confirmed by the tests shown below.\n\n\n \nTEST EXAMPLE 1\n\n\nEvaluation of 5-HT\n2C \nReceptor Agonist Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nThe agonist activity of the compound of the formula (I) on the 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor was confirmed by the method shown below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe human 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonist activity was evaluated by measuring the increase of the ligand-dependent intracellular calcium concentration. CHO cells which stably expressing a human 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor were used. The receptor-expressing cells were prepared by transfecting the genes of the human 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor (Accession numbers: AF498983 (5-HT\n2C\n)) into CHO cells (dihydrofolic acid-deficient strain, DS Pharma Biomedical Co., Ltd.)) using a pEF-BOS vector (Nucleic Acids Research, vol. 18, No. 17). After transcription, the 5-HT\n2C \nis known to be subjected to RNA editing to cause differences in three kinds of amino acids, resulting in fourteen receptor isoforms. Among them, cells stably expressing an INI type of 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor which had not been subjected to editing were used. Cells used for evaluation were cultured in a 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)-containing medium (trade name: α-MEM, Invitrogen) at 37° C. and 5% carbon dioxide. On the day before the evaluation, the cells were suspended in a serum-free medium (trade name: CD-CHO, Invitrogen) containing 8 mM L-glutamine (trade name: L-glutamine 200 mM, Invitrogen, added to the medium at a concentration at a time of use of 8 mM) and dispensed into a 96-well poly-D-lysine-coated plate (trade name: Biocoat PDL96W Black/Clear, Japan Becton, Dickinson and Company)) at 4×10\n4 \ncells/well and cultured at 37° C. and 5% carbon dioxide overnight. A solution including a washing solution (mixture of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS)-sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 20 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 2.5 mM probenecid, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)), and a 4 μM fluorescent reagent (trade name: Fluo4-AM, Dojindo Co., Ltd.) was used as a loading buffer and the medium of the 96-well plate which had been cultured overnight was replaced with a loading buffer. After leaving to stand (with light-shielding) at room temperature for 3 hours, the cells were washed with a plate washer (trade name: ELx405, BioTek Instruments, Inc.) in which a washing solution had been set up. The plates of the washed cells were set up in a system for measuring a calcium (Ca) concentration in a cell (trade name: FLIPR, Molecular Devices, Inc.). In this device, a test compound that had been dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted in the washing solution at a predetermined concentration was added and set up to measure a change in the Ca concentrations in a cell. The difference between a maximum value and a minimum value in the change of the intracellular Ca concentration was determined and kept as measurement data.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe agonist activity was calculated as an efficacy (EC50 (nM)) by determining the activating action (Emax (%)) of the present invention compound on the maximum reaction of the 5-HT, taking the maximum reaction of the 5-HT (agonist action with addition of 5-HT 10 μM) as 100% and the reaction of a solvent alone as 0%, and then applying a logistic regression method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of several compounds are shown in Table 1.

The guinea pigs were fixed in a supine position and catheters for administration of test compounds (PE-50; Clay Adams) were inserted into the jugular vein. Further, a catheters for cystometry (PE-160; Clay Adams), which are the catheters for an infusion of physiological saline into bladder and measurement of the intravesical pressure, were inserted through an incision into the dome of the bladder. Further, in order to measure the external urethral sphincter electromyography, two electrodes were inserted into both the left and right sides of the urethral opening to the urethral sphincter. The electrodes for measuring base voltages were placed under the skin of the hind part. The bladder catheter was branched over a three-way stopcock, and one was connected with a 50-mL syringe (Terumo) fixed to an infusion pump (Terumo). The other was connected to a pressure transducer (DX-100; Nihon Kohden Corporation) to transfer the signal of the transducer through an amplifier (AP-630G; Nihon Kohden Corporation) and a data acquisition system (PowerLab; AD Instruments) to a computer and record on a hard disk. The electrodes for electromyography measurement were connected to a control unit (JB-101J; Nihon Kohden Corporation) to transfer the signal through an amplifier (AP-651J; Nihon Kohden Corporation) and a data acquisition system (PowerLab; AD Instruments) to a computer and record on a hard disk. Further, the data were analyzed on the computer using a software (Chart; AD Instruments). Physiological saline was continuously injected into the bladder using an infusion pump at a rate of 18 mL/hour and it was confirmed that a micturition reflexes were stably induced. The electromyography activity was analyzed by taking the lowest potential amplitude as a standard during the stabilization period and using the firing frequency over the standard amplitude as an indicator. At intervals between the respective urinations (urine filling phase), the activity of the urethral sphincter electromyography was analyzed and its average value was calculated. After the stabilization period, the solvent and the test compound were administered at an increased dose at an interval of 40 minutes through the catheter placed into the jugular vein. The urethral sphincter electromyography activity after the administration of the solvent was taken as 100% and the urethral sphincter electromyography activity after the administration of the test compound was denoted as a percentage (%) of the electromyography activity after the administration of the solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, the compounds of Example 81, Example 59, Example 88, Example 104, Example 106, Example 141, Example 38, Example 135, Example 215, Example 243, Example 265, Example 287, Example 258, Example 263, Example 267, Example 268, Example 276, Example 277, Example 283, Example 288, Example 290, Example 291, Example 292, Example 297, Example 299, Example 313, and Example 315 as shown later showed an external urethral sphincter electromyography activity of 200% or more with intravenous administration at 3 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result of each test above, it was confirmed that the compound of the formula (I) has a 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonist activity, and the compound of the formula (I) can be used for treatment or prevention of 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor-related diseases, particularly incontinence such as stress urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence, mixed urinary incontinence, and the like, sexual dysfunction such as erectile dysfunction syndrome and the like, obesity, and the like as a pharmaceutical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the results obtained by the tests above, it is considered that the compound has a 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonist activity and thus has substantially the same or a higher activity value than Lorcaserin under development as an anti-obesity drug (The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics vol. 325, No. 2 p. 577-587 (2008)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition containing one or two or more kinds of the compound of the formula (I) or a salt thereof as an active ingredient can be prepared using excipients that are usually used in the art, that is, excipients for pharmaceutical preparation, carriers for pharmaceutical preparation, and the like according to the methods usually used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration can be accomplished either by oral administration via tablets, pills, capsules, granules, powders, solutions, and the like, or parenteral administration injections, such as intraarticular, intravenous, or intramuscular injections, and the like, suppositories, ophthalmic solutions, eye ointments, transdermal liquid preparations, ointments, transdermal patches, transmucosal liquid preparations, transmucosal patches, inhalations, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solid composition for oral administration is used in the form of tablets, powders, granules, or the like.

Such a composition may further contain a tonicity agent, an antiseptic, a moistening agent, an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent, a stabilizing agent, and a solubilization assisting agent. These are sterilized by filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, blending of a germicide, or irradiation. Furthermore, they may also be prepared in the form of sterile solid compositions and dissolved or suspended in sterile water or a sterile solvent for injecting prior to their use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of the formulation for external use include ointments, plasters, creams, jellies, patches, sprays, lotions, eye-drops, eye ointments, and the like. The drug contains generally used ointment bases, lotion bases, aqueous or non-aqueous liquid preparations, suspensions, emulsions, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransmucosal agents such as inhalers, transnasal agents, and the like are used in the form of solids, liquids, or semisolids and can be prepared according to conventional known methods. For example, known excipients, and further, pH adjusters, antiseptics, surfactants, lubricants, stabilizing agents, thickeners, or the like may also be added where appropriate. For administration, suitable devices for inhalation or insufflation can be used. For example, using known devices and sprayers such as a metered dose inhaler, the compound can be administered independently or in the form of prescribed mixture powders. Furthermore, the compound combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can also be administered in the form of solutions or suspensions. Dry powder inhalers and the like may be devices for single or multiple administrations, and dry powders or capsules containing powders can also be used. Still further, the devices may be in the form of a pressure aerosol spray or the like that use suitable ejection agents, for example, chlorofluoroalkane, hydrofluoroalkane, or a suitable gas such as carbon dioxide and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsually, in the case of oral administration, the daily dose is suitably from 0.001 to 100 mg/kg per body weight, preferably from 0.1 to 30 mg/kg, and more preferably from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, and this is administered in one portion or dividing it into 2 to 4 portions. In the case of intravenous administration, the daily dose is suitably from about 0.0001 to 10 mg/kg per body weight, and this is administered once a day or two or more times a day.

The structure of the compounds of the Examples are shown in Tables 97 to 147 and the preparation methods and the physicochemical data are shown in Tables 148 to 181.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the structures of the other compounds of the present invention are shown in Tables 182 to 190. These can be easily synthesized by the methods described in the preparation methods and Examples above, methods apparent to a person skilled in the art, or modified methods thereof.\n\n\n \n

Description\n\n\n\n\nAPPLICATION DATA\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims benefit is U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/095,335 filed Sep. 9, 2008.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to small molecule inhibitors which are useful in treating various diseases and conditions involving Chymase.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn cardiac tissue of cardiomyopathic patients, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which has been demonstrated to stimulate cardiac fibrosis in animal models (Kuwahara, et al. Circulation, 2002, 106, 130), is increased (Li et al., Circulation, 1997, 96, 874). In the myocardial fibrotic area, it is known that mast cells are increased in number and may contribute to the development of fibroblast proliferation in cardiac tissues of patients with cardiomyopathy (Patella et al., Circulation, 1998, 97, 971). Chymase is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease contained in the secretory granules of mast cells. Although the precise physiological roles of Chymase have not been completely revealed, Chymase is known to transform angiotensin I to angiotensin II and may contribute to activation of TGF-β, matrix proteases, and cytokines (Taipale et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 4689; Takai et al., Life Sci., 1996, 58, 591; Takai et al., Circulation, 1999, 100, 654).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA potent and selective Chymase inhibitor may have potential use as a treatment of chronic heart failure, atherosclerosis, restenosis, and myocardial infarction by inhibiting local production of angiotensin II in the heart and release of TGF-β, two independent mediators of cardiac remodeling. An inhibitor may also have potential use for treatment of mast cell mediated diseases such as dermatitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary inflammation, since Chymase is implicated in microvascular leakage, neutrophil accumulation, the stimulation of mucus secretion, and the modulation of cytokines (He et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1998, 352, 91).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral small molecule Chymase inhibitors have been reported to be efficacious in the cardiomyopathic hamster model of heart failure (Takai et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 305, 17), in carotid artery injury by a balloon catheter in dogs (Takai et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther, 2003, 304, 841), and in the hamster left anterior descending coronary artery ligation model of heart failure (WO 03/018061). Additionally, a Chymase inhibitor has been demonstrated to be efficacious in a sheep asthma model (WO 2005/073214). However, there is no example of commercialization of a Chymase inhibitor as a medicament.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is therefore an object of the invention to provide a small molecule a Chymase inhibitor as defined herein, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also an object of the invention to provide methods of using said Chymase inhibitors to treat various diseases and conditions related thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a further object of the invention to provide processes of preparing said Chymase inhibitors.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION

The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 uL rhodamine 110, bis-(succinoyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanylamide) (American Peptides, Sunnyvale, Calif.) in assay buffer containing 150 μM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, Pierce Chemical, Rockford, Ill.) using a Multidrop (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, Mass.). Final assay concentrations were 500 pM chymase, 100 nM substrate, 100 μM TCEP, and 1% DMSO. The plates were incubated at 28° C. and 80% humidity for 1 hour, at which time the fluorescence was read on a Viewlux 1430 Microplate Imager (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, Mass.) with 485 nm excitation, 530 nm emission, and a fluorescein dichroic mirror. The percentage of control values were calculated relative to assay blanks containing complete reaction minus chymase and a 100% control containing assay buffer with 1% DMSO in place of compound. IC50 values were obtained by fitting the data using XLFit4 (IDBS Software).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred compounds of the invention have an activity of 100 nanoMolar or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll patent and literature references cited in this application are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety."

More particularly, the present invention relates to novel cyclic pentadepsipeptides with excellent multidrug resistance-reversing activity and inhibitory activity against cancer cells, which are produced by a soil stain of the genus \nFusarium. \n \n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART \n\n\n \n \n \nA fungus of the genus \nFusarium \ndistributed in association with higher marine plants has proven to be a promising source for the production of sansalvamide, a kind of cytotoxic cyclic depsipeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSansalvamide A was first reported to be produced by \nHalodule wrightii, \na kind of marine microorganisms [Belofsky G N, Jensen P R, Fenical W. (1999) Sansalvamide: A new cytotoxic cyclic depsipeptide produced by a marine fungus of the genus \nFusarium. Tetrahedron Lett. \n40, 2913-2916]. It is composed of four hydrophobic amino acid residues (phenylalanine, two leucines, valine) and one hydroxy acid ((S)-2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid; O-Leu) with five stereogenic centers all having S-stereochemistry. Sansalvamide A was found to have marked anti-proliferative effects on 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute, with inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I. Anti-cancer effects of Sansalvamide A may be, at least in part, mediated by this mechanism. Further, the analogues formed by N-methylation or para-bromination of sansalvamide A of \nFIG. 1\n were also found to exhibit remarkable cytotoxicity against human pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that these cyclic compounds may be highly useful as anti-cancer agents [Ujiki M B, Milam B, Ding X Z, Roginsky A B, Salabat M R, Talamonti M S, Bell R H, Gu W, Silverman R B, Adrian T E. (2006) A novel peptide sansalvamide analogue inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth through G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest. Biochem. Bioph. Res. Co. 340, 1224-1228].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, N-methylsansalvamide, a sansalvamide analogue with N-methylation, has been produced from different \nFusarium \nspecies isolated from green algae. It consists of four amino acid residues (phenylalanine, leucine, N-methylleucine and valine) and one hydroxy acid (O-Leu). N-Methylsansalvamide was reported to exhibit in vitro cytotoxicity in the NCI human tumor cell line screen [Cueto M, Jensen P R, Fenical W. (2000) N-Methylsansalvamide, a cytotoxic cyclic depsipeptide from a marine fungus of the genus \nFusarium. Phytochemistry. \n55, 223-226].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMultidrug resistance (MDR) is arising as one of the major obstacles to successful chemotherapy for human cancer. A variety of biochemical, pharmacological and clinical strategies for overcoming MDR have been designed and suggested [Teodori E, Dei S, Scapecchi S, Gualtieri F. (2002) The medicinal chemistry of multidrug resistance (MDR) reversing drugs. \nII Farmaco \n57, 385-415]. Although there are several mechanisms associated with MDR, the overexpression of P-glycoproteins (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP) is known to be responsible for the development of MDR in cancer cells [Thomas H, Coley H M. (2003) Overcoming multidrug resistance in cancer: an update on the clinical strategy of inhibiting P-glycoprotein. \nCancer Control \n10, 159-165; Perez-Tomas R. (2006) Multidrug resistance: retrospect and prospects in anti-cancer drug treatment. \nCurr. Med. Chem. \n13, 1859-1876].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSansalvamide A is a lipophilic, cyclic depsipeptide, which is of protease resistance and membrane permeability, so that it may advantageously take an oral route, compared to other drugs. In addition, forming a cyclic core structure, composed of four amino acids and one hydroxy acid, in which rotation around C—C bonds is restricted, sansalvamide A has a firm conformation which is of excellent compatibility to the body and enjoys a long half life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough there have been a number of sansalvamide analogues synthesized to utilize the structural merits and the cytotoxicity against cancer cells of sansalvamide A or N-methylsansalvamide, none of them are concerned with separated, cyclic pentadepsipeptides.\n\n\n \nDISCLOSURE \n\n\nTechnical Problem\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a strain of the genus \nFusarium \nproducing novel cyclic pentadepsipeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is another object of the present invention to provide a method of producing the novel cyclic pentadepsipeptides by culturing a strain of the genus \nFusarium. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide novel cyclic pentadepsipeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a still further object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition for reversing multidrug resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is still another object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with an aspect thereof, the present invention pertains to a novel cyclic peptadepsipeptide represented by Chemical Formula 1 or 2:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic pentadepsipeptides, represented by Chemical Formulas 1 and 2, according to the present invention are 15-membered ring compounds which are proven novel with a difference from conventionally reported sansalvamide A and N-methylsansalvamide in the sequence of their constitutional amino acids and hydroxy acid. As seen in \nFIG. 1\n, conventional analogues synthesized on the basis of the core structure of sansalvamide A are intended to increase in cytotoxicity as a result of the bromination of the benzene ring of phenyl alanine or the methylation of leucine or valine. Nowhere has an attempt to change the sequence of the constitutional amino acids and hydroxy acid of sansalvamide A or N-methylsansalvamide been mentioned in previous reports. Further, organic synthesis for altering the sequence of the constitutional amino acids and hydroxy acid is accompanied by the interruption of the ester bond between the hydroxy acid ((S)-2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid; OLeu) and the phenylalanine within the core structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBeing different from sansalvamide A and N-methylsansalvamide in the sequence of the constitutional four amino acids and one hydroxy acid, the novel, cyclic pentadepsipeptides, represented by Chemical Formulas 1 and 2, according to the present invention have cytotoxicity over a wide spectrum of types of cancer that is as potent as that of sansalvamide A. Furthermore, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of Chemical Formulas 1 and 2 show the drug resistance-reversing activity which has not yet been reported in conventional analogues synthesized on the basis of the sansalvamide A or N-methylsansalvamide. Excellent drug resistance-reversing activity is found in the cyclic pentadepsipeptide of Chemical Formula 1. When pathogens or cells are exposed to chemotherapy, they may become resistant to the drug and possibly to other structurally unrelated drugs. The pathogens or cells are said to be drug-resistant when drugs meant to neutralize them have a reduced effect. As used herein, the term “drug resistance-reversing activity” is intended to mean not only suppressing the generation of drug-resistant cells or keeping the cells sensitive to the drugs, but also increasing or recuperating the sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to the drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHaving the ability to make drug-resistant cells sensitive to drugs or suppress the generation of drug-resistant cells, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 according to the present invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be useful in the treatment of multidrug-resistant cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be used in combination with conventional drug-resistant inhibitors such as cyclosporine or analogues, phenothiazine, thioxantheres, verapamil, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of Chemical Formulas 1 and 2 according to the present invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be used in combination with anticancer agents, that is, standard chemotherapy agents, in the treatment of cancer and preferably in the treatment of tumors resistant to drugs a priori or a posteriori.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with another aspect thereof, the present invention pertains to a \nFusarium \nstrain producing the cyclic pentadepsipeptide of Chemical Formula 1 or 2. Preferably, the \nFusarium \nstrain producing the novel compound is \nFusarium solani \nKCCM90040 [Accession No.: KCCM10881P].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with a further aspect thereof, the present invention pertains to a method for producing the cyclic pentadepsipeptide of Chemical Formula 1 or 2 by culturing the strain. This culturing is preferably conducted on a cereal substance. The cereal substance useful in the present invention is selected from among rice, wheat, maize, rye, Indian millet, barley and a combination thereof, preferably from among rice, wheat, maize and rye, more preferably from among rice and wheat, and most preferably rice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen cultured in a seawater-based medium, marine \nFusarium \nstrains were reported to produce sansalvamide in an amount of 0.642 g per 17 liters [Belofsky G N, Jensen P R, Fenical W. (1999) Sansalvamide: A new cytotoxic cyclic depsipeptide produced by a marine fungus of the genus \nFusarium. Tetrahedron Lett. \n40, 2913-2916]. As for the \nFusarium \nstrain CNL-619, its N-methylsansalvamide production was reportedly 3.1 mg/L in a seawater-based medium [Cueto M, Jensen P R, Fenical W. (2000) N-Methylsansalvamide, a cytotoxic cyclic depsipeptide from a marine fungus of the genus \nFusarium. Phytochemistry. \n55, 223-226].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBeing produced from the marine \nFusarium \nstrains, sansalvamide or N-methylsansalvamide requires a seawater-based medium for the production thereof. Further, the marine strains are very poor in the productivity of sansalvamide or N-methylsansalvamide per volume of medium. In contrast, the \nFusarium \nstrain of the present invention is of soil origin and can produce the compound of Chemical Formula 1 or 2 in high yield on a solid cereal substance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cereal substance useful for culturing the strain is preferably rice. In order to produce the compound of Chemical Formula 1 or 2, the strain of the present invention is preferably cultured at a temperature of from 20 to 30° C. and at an RH of from 20 to 50% for 10˜20 days. Optimally, it is cultured at 25.84° C. and 37.99% RH for 16.03 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA strain producing a cyclic depsipeptide was isolated from potatoes grown in Munkyoung Korea and identified as a strain of \nFusarium solani. \nIt was named \nFusarium solani \nKCCM90040 and deposited with the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms on Jan. 15, 2008 with accession No. KCCM10881P according to the Budapest Treaty.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of produced by the strain were analyzed to be 15-membered ring compounds different from sansalvamide A and N-methylsansalvamide in the sequence of constitutional amino acids and hydroxy acid and identified as cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formula\n \n 1 or 2 in accordance with the present invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof shows inhibitory activity against drug-resistant cells, which may be tumor cells or antibiotic-resistant cells, and thus can be used as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting the drug resistance of cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThanks to their suppressive activity against tumor proliferation, the pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formula\n \n 1 and 2 in accordance with the present invention may also be used as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt”, as used herein, means non-toxic organic or inorganic acid addition salts of the compounds of interest. Examples of the inorganic acids useful in the present invention include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, acid metal salts (e.g., sodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen sulfate), etc. Examples of the organic acid useful in the present invention include mono-, di- and tricarboxylic acid. Among the pharmaceutically acceptable acids, there may be mentioned, without implying any limitation, acetic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, benzoic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, cinnamic acid, salicylic acid and 2-phenoxybenzoic acid. Other organic acids may be exemplified by methane sulfonic acid and 2-hydroxyethane sulfonic acid. Such salts can be either in hydrated or anhydrous form. The acid addition salts of these compounds are prepared using a typical method, for example, by dissolving a free base in a suitable solvent such as an aqueous solvent, an alcohol solvent or another acid-containing solvent, and then evaporating the solvent, or by reacting the free base with the organic solvent (in this case, the salt may be directly separated or obtained via concentration). Generally, the acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention are crystalline materials which can be dissolved in water or various hydrophilic organic solvents and generally display higher melting points compared to the free base forms thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for the treatment of cancer or diseases associated with multidrug resistance may be administered to subjects in need thereof. As used herein, the term “subject” is intended to include mammals such as goats, horses, cow, pigs, dogs, cats, mice, rats, etc. as well as primates such as humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective dosages of the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may vary depending on various factors including dosage units, the duration of treatment, the age and sex of the patient, traits of the tumor to be treated, drug resistance, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn combination with other anticancer agents, particularly chemical agents useful for the treatment of tumors, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be used. For reversing multidrug resistance, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be administered at an effective dose of from 15 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg. A unit daily dosage may contain 25 to 500 mg of the cyclic pentadepsipeptide of \n \nChemical Formula\n \n 1 or 2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be in an oral or parenteral dosage form formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use in the treatment of tumors, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are preferably administered at an effective dose, in combination with an anticancer agent, particularly, an agent for chemotherapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the tumors which can be treated with the compounds of the present invention are benign or malignant tumors, neoplasms, melanoma, lymphoma, leukemia and sarcoma. Examples of the tumors include skin tumors (e.g., malignant melanoma and cutaneous mycosis fungoides), blood tumors (e.g, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia), lymphoma (e.g. Hodgkin's disease, malignant lymphoma), gynecologic tumors (ovarian tumor, uterine tumor), urologic tumors (prostate tumor, bladder tumor, seminoma), soft tissue sarcoma, osteo- or non-osteosarcoma, breast tumors, pituitary tumors, thyroid gland tumors, adrenal cortex tumors, gastrointestinal tumors (esophagus tumor, stomach tumors, intestine tumor, and colon tumor), pancreatic tumors, liver tumors, larynx tumors, papilloma and lung tumors. The best therapeutic effects may be elicited when the compounds of the present invention are applied to multidrug-resistant tumors or tumors which become multidrug resistant. Among these tumors are colon tumors, lung tumors, stomach tumors and liver tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA cytotoxic agent is typical of the chemical agents which can be applied together with the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Examples of the agents for chemotherapy include cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, prednisone, 6-mercaptopurine, procarbazine, daunorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine, chlorambucil, cytosine arabinoside, 6-thioguanine, thio TEPA, 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine, 5-azacytidine, nitrogen mustard, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), (1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea) (CCNU), busulfan, adriamycin, bleomycin, vindesine, Cycloleucine and methylglyoxal bis(guanyl hydrazone) (MGBG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective dosage of the chemical agent useful in the present invention may vary depending on various factors including the condition of the patient, the morphology and size of the tumor, kind of the agents, etc, and may be readily determined by those skilled in the art. Generally, the chemical agent may be administered in a smaller dose when administered in combination with the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof than when administered alone. The reason is because a large amount of the chemical agent may cause drug resistance. Also, a cocktail of chemical agents or surgery or radiotherapy may be used, together with the administration of the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Although the co-administration of the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and the chemical agent is described above, they may not be in the same dosage form or may not be administered at the same time. Accordingly, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and the chemical agent may be administered in a mixture or at different times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn oral route is preferable. For use in oral administration, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be formulated into solid or liquid forms, such as capsules, pills, tablets, troches, lozenge, melts, powders, liquids, suspensions and emulsions. Typical of the solid dosage forms is a capsule. A capsule with a soft or hard gelatin envelope may contain a surfactant, a lubricant, and an inert filler such as lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate and corn starch. In another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may be formulated into a tablet, together with a tablet base (e.g., lactose, sucrose, corn starch), a binder (e.g, acacia, corn starch or gelatin), a disintegrant (e.g., potato starch, alginic acid, corn starch and guar gum) for facilitating the degradation and dissolution of the tablet after administration, a lubricant (e.g., talc, stearic acid or magnesium stearate, calcium stearate or zinc stearate) for enhancing the release of tablet granules and preventing the attachment of the tablet drug to the tabletting die or punch, and a dye, a colorant and a fragrant for improving the color and taste of the tablet. Carriers suitable for use in oral liquid dosage forms include suspension agents, water mixed with or without an emulsifier, and a diluent such as an alcohol (ethanol, benzyl alcohol and polyethylene alcohol).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be administered in the form of a solution in a diluent, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, through a parenteral route, that is, a subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular or intraperitoneal route. Examples of the carrier for use in injection include pharmaceutically acceptable surfactants (e.g., soap or detergent), suspending agents (pectin, carbomer, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or carboxymethylcellulose), water or saline mixed with an emulsifier or another pharmaceutical adjuvant, aqueous solutions of dextrose or corresponding sugars, alcohols (e.g., ethanol, isopropanol, hexadecylalcohol), glycol (e.g., propylene glycol, or polyethylene glycol), glycerol ketal (e.g., 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-methanol), ethers (e.g., poly(ethylene-glycol)400), oils, and germ-free solutions or mixture containing fatty acids, fatty acid esters or glycerides, or acetylated fatty acid glycerides. Examples of the oil useful in the formulation of parenteral dosage forms include petroleum, animal oil, vegetable oil, or synthetic oil, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, cotton seed oil, corn oil, olive oil, mineral oil and inorganic oil. Among the fatty acids are oleic acid, stearic acid and isostearic acid. The fatty acid esters may be exemplified by oleic acid ethyl and myristic acid isopropyl. Alkaline metal salts, ammonium salt and triethanolamine salts of fatty acids may be suitable as the surfactant. Examples of the detergent include cationic detergents (e.g., dimethyl dialkyl ammonium halide, alkyl pyridium halide and alkylamine acetate), anionic detergents (e.g., alkyl, aryl and olefin sulfonate, alkyl, olefin, ether and monoglyceride sulfate and sulfosuccinate), non-ionic detergents (lipid amine oxide, fatty acid alkanolamide and polyoxyethylenepolypropylene copolymer), and amphiphatic detergents (e.g., alkyl-β-amino propionate and 2-alkylimidazolin quarternary ammonium salt) and a combination thereof. Typically, the parenteral compositions of this invention will contain from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of the active ingredient in solution. Preservatives and buffers may also be used advantageously. In order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, such compositions may contain a non-ionic surfactant having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such formulations ranges from about 5% to about 15% by weight. The surfactant can be a single component having the above HLB or can be a mixture of two or more components having the desired HLB.

[Samson R A, Hoekstra ES, Oorschot V, Connie A N. (1981) Introduction to food-borne fungi. Published and distributed by Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures; Nelson P E, Toussoun T A, Marasas W F. (1983) \nFusarium \nspecies: An illustrated manual for identification. The Pennsylvania State University Press].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe isolated \nFusarium \nstrain was transferred on carnation leaf agar (CLA) and real potato dextrose agar (RPDA) and analyzed for morphological characteristics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe microconidia were present in abundance generally in the form of single cells of an oval to kidney shape (\nFIG. 2\n). Conidiophores of the \nFusarium \nstrain put out branches as shown \nFIG. 3\n. The microconidia and conidiophores of \nF. solani \nare morphologically similar to those of \nFusarium oxysporum. \nThe microconidia of \nF. oxysporum \nwere observed to be larger in size and have thicker walls and conidiophores were formed on short monophialides, compared to those of \nF. solani \n(Nelson et al., 1983). The isolated \nFusarium \nstrains grew fast. The slant surface of the agar was almost covered with white mycelia with the back being a dark cream (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom these morphological characteristics, the \nFusarium \nstrain was identified as \nF. solani. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) Molecular Biological Identification\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA. DNA Isolation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe total genomic DNA of the isolated \nFusarium \nstrain was extracted from the mycelia grown on PDA (potato dextrose agar) using the method of Correll [Correll J C, Klittich C J R, Leslie J F. (1987) Nitrate nonutilizing mutants of \nFusarium oxysporum \nand their use in vegetative compatibility tests. \nPhytopathology, \n77, 16401646].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this regard, mycelium-covered agar was placed in a tube filled with liquid nitrogen, followed by evaporating the liquid nitrogen at room temperature. This procedure of liquid nitrogen filling and evaporation was repeated again. After evaporation of the liquid nitrogen, 0.5 mL of a lysis buffer [50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid(EDTA), 3% sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 m/ml proteinase K] warmed to 65° C. was added into the tube and incubated for 1 hr at 65° C. After incubation, 0.5 mL of a phenol solution was added and then spun for 5 min at 8,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge to separate a phenol phase and an aqueous phase from each other. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube. The phenol extraction was repeated again. Phenol residues in the aqueous phase were removed with 0.4 mL of a mixture of chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Ammonium acetate (0.05 ml, 7.5 M) was mixed gently with the aqueous phase. DNA was precipitated with 0.88 mL of 95% ethanol cold to −20° C. The DNA pellet was spun down for 20 min at 13,000 rpm. The pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol, spun down, and dried. The DNA was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and stored until use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. Identification by DNA Electrophoresis and Homology Comparison\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFusarium \nspecific primers, P28SL (5′-ACA AAT TAC AAC TCG GGC CCG AGA-3′) of SEQ ID NO: 1 and P58SL (5′-AGT ATT CTG GCG GGC ATG CCT GT-3′) of SEQ ID NO. 2, designed as described by Hue et al. [Hue, F. X., M. Huerre, M. A. Rouffault, and C. D. Bievre. Specified detection of \nFusarium \nspecies in blood and tissues by a PCR technique. Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 37: 2434-2438. 1999] were used for a control PCR assay. A pair of the \nFusarium \nspecific primers amplified a fragment of DNA coding for the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of \nFusarium \nstrains by PCR. The binding sites of the P28SL and P58SL primers, corresponding to the ITS2 region and a portion of 5.8s and 28s rDNA, are conserved among \nFusarium \nstrains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor PCR, 1 ng of the DNA isolated in A was used together with a primer pair of the primers P28SL and P58SL, and a PCR pre-mixture purchased from Promega. Starting by denaturation at 94° C. for 10 min, PCR was performed with 40 cycles of denaturation at 94° C. for 1 min, annealing at 60° C. for 1 min and extension at 72° C. for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72° C. for 10 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PCR product thus obtained was run on a 2% agarose gel in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer in the presence of an electric field. After completion of the electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PCR product (F) amplified from \nFusarium \nstains was detected at a position between 300 and 400 bp, which matched with the sizes of PCR products from two controls \nFusarium moniliforme \nNRRL 13569 and \nFusarium oxysporum \nKCTC 16909 (\nFIG. 5\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PCR product obtained with the \nFusarium\n-specific primers was purified and sequenced commercially (Macrogen Inc. Seoul, Korea). BLAST search for homology in the GenBank database showed that the ITS-5.8 rDNA sequence of the \nFusarium \nstrain of the present invention shared more than 98% homology with those of \nF. solani \n(\nFIG. 6\n). The ITS-5.8 rDNA sequence of the \nFusarium \nstrain is given in SEQ ID NO. 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis \nFusarium \nstrain was named \nFusarium solani \nKCCM90040 and deposited with the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms on Jan. 15, 2008 with accession No. KCCM10881P, according to the Budapest Treaty.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\nProduction and Separation of Cyclic Depsipeptide\n\n\n \n \n \n(1) Cultivation in \nFusarium \nDefined Medium\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFusarium solani \nKCCM90040 was inoculated at a density of 1×10\n5 \nspores/mL into 100 mL of a \nFusarium \ndefined medium (FDM) broth (25 g of sucrose, 4.25 g of NaNO\n3\n, 5 g of NaCl, 2.5 g of MgSO\n4\n7H2O, 1.36 g of KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.01 g of FeSO\n4\n7H2O, and 0.0029 g of ZnSO\n4\n7H2O per liter) and incubated at 25° C. for 7 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) Cultivation on Cereal Substrate\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFusarium solani \nKCCM90040 was inoculated at a density of 1×10\n5 \nspores/mL to a rice medium which was prepared from 50 g of autoclaved rice with the water content thereof adjusted to 40 wt % with sterile distilled water, followed by culturing at 25° C. for 7 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) Extraction of Cyclic Depsipeptide from the Culture\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo the \nFusarium \nstrain culture including the mycelia of (1) was added two volumes of chloroform. It was vigorously stirred and the bottom layer was evaporated to dryness. The residue was resuspended in methanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cereal medium in which the \nFusarium \nof (2) was cultured was dried at room temperature for 12 hrs. The mycelia thus dried were homogenized, extracted overnight with 75 ml of a solvent mixture of 16:3:1 (v/v/v) acetonitrile: MeOH: water, and filtered through sterile filter paper. The filtrate was defatted twice with 25 mL of n-heptane and the bottom layer was evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 50 mL of a solvent mixture of 55:45 (v/v) MeOH: water and extracted twice with 25 mL of CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. The CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nlayer was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was resuspended in methanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(4) Purification of Cyclic Depsipeptide from the Extracts\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the extracts from the cultures of (1) and (2) was flowed for 40 min at a constant flow rate (1 mL/min) along a Shiseido pack C18 column (0.46×25 cm) (Shiseido co., Japan) with a mixture of 70:30 (v/v) acetonitrile: water serving as an eluent. Peaks were read at 210 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo secondary metabolites were detected in the extract of the culture in FDM of (1) (\nFIG. 7\n). On the other hand, two main peaks could be eluted with a retention time of 9.7 and 13.4 minutes from the extract from the culture on the cereal substance of (2) (\nFIG. 8\n). The compounds detected at 9.7 and 13.4 min were named Compound A and B, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds were separated using a GROM-sil pack ODS preparative column (1.0×25 cm) with a mixture of acetonitrile: water solution (65:35, v/v) serving as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 3 ml/min for 60 min, followed by further purification through a Shiseido pack C18 column (0.46×25 cm) with a mixture of acetonitrile: water (70:30, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(5) Determination of Molecular Weight\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds A and B were found to have molecular weights of 586.36 and 600.36 m/z, respectively, as measured by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (\nFIGS. 9 and 10\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese mass data of the secondary metabolites (Compounds A and B) were very similar to previously reported ones for cyclic depsipeptides.

In this regard, the effects of the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 on paclitaxel's cytotoxicity against MDR tumor cells were measured (Table 6). Verapamil (VER), an MDR-reversing agent with inhibitory activity against P-glycoprotein, was used as a control.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\n\n\nMES-SA\n\n\nMES-SA/DX5\n\n\nHCT15\n\n\nHCT15/CL02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAX\n\n\n1.00 ± 0.20\n\n\n10.00 ± 0.53 \n\n\n0.85 ± 0.63\n\n\n>1,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCom. 1\n\n\n1.00 ± 0.30\n\n\n6.31 ± 0.91\n\n\n0.39 ± 0.08\n\n\n>1,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3 μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCom. 2\n\n\n1.00 ± 0.30\n\n\n1.58 ± 0.12\n\n\n0.10 ± 0.02\n\n\n288.40 ± 21.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3 μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVER\n\n\n1.00 ± 0.10\n\n\n1.78 ± 0.33\n\n\n0.11 ± 0.05\n\n\n33.89 ± 8.42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(10 μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic pentadepsipeptide of \nChemical Formula\n 2 increased the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel against MDR cell lines, but only slightly. On the other hand, the cyclic pentadepsipeptide of \nChemical Formula\n 1 remarkably enhanced the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel (\nFIGS. 21 to 24\n). Therefore, the N-methyl group in the cyclic pentadepsipeptide may be a factor crucial for the expression of the MDR reversal activity. The MDR-reversing activity of the cyclic pentadepsipeptide of \nChemical Compound\n 1 was similar to that of the positive control verapamil.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nAnti-Bacterial and Anti-Fungal Activities\n\n\n \n \n \n(1) Anti-Bacterial Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays for antibacterial activity were performed with Gram-positive (\nListeria monocytogenes \nATCC 14028, \nStaphylococcus aureus \nATCC 35556 and \nBacillus cereus \nATCC 13061) and 3 Gram-negative bacteria (\nEscherichia coli \nATCC 8739, \nPseudomonas aeruginosa \nATCC 9026 and \nSalmonella typhimurium \nATCC 14028). Each of the compounds of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 was dissolved in different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 mM) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The solutions were applied to a sterile paper disc (5 mm diameter), followed by evaporating the DMSO solvent. Bacteria was inoculated at a density of 1×10\n7 \nCFU/ml on Tryptic soy agar (TSA) and then, the paper disc was placed on the bacteria-inoculated agars. After incubation at 37° C. for 24 hr, the clear zone around each disc was observed and its diameter was measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeither the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 1 nor \nChemical Formula\n 2 showed inhibitory activity against all of the bacteria tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) Anti-Fungal Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitory activity was performed against four fungus strains (\nMucor rouxii, Penicillium citrinum, Fusarium oxysporum, \nand \nAspergillus oryzae\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrops of 1 and 10 mM solutions of compounds of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 in methanol were loaded onto sterile paper discs (8 mm diameter) and the methanol solvent was evaporated under a hood. The paper discs were placed on fungus mycelia grown on potato dextrose agar. After incubation at 25° C. for 48 hr, clear zones around the discs were observed and their diameters were measured. A filter treated with pure methanol was used as a negative control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibitory effects of compounds purified from \nF. solani \nKCCM 90040 on the mycelial growth of four fungal strains (\nMucor rouxii, Penicillium citrinum, Fusarium oxysporum, \nand \nAspergillus oryzae\n) are shown in \nFIG. 28\n. The results of the antifungal tests revealed that \n \ncompound\n \n 1 and 2 were inhibitory against \nMucor rouxii, \nand \nFusarium oxysporum, \nweakly. No inhibitory activities were detected at 1 mM of the compound of \n \nChemical Formula\n \n 1 or 2 against all of the four fungal strains. At 10 mM of the compounds of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2, no clear zones were observed on the agar in which \nMucor rouxii \nwas grown, but the hyphal growth of \nMucor rouxii \nwas reduced near the purified compounds containing paper disc (\nFIG. 25\n). While the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 2 did not produce a clear zone on the mycelium of \nFusarium oxysporum \nat 10 mM, the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 1 exhibited an inhibitory effect at 10 mM, weakly (\nFIG. 26\n).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\nSelection of Cereal Medium\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusarium solani \nKCCM90040 was inoculated at a density of 1>10\n5 \nspores/mL on a cereal medium which was prepared from 50 g of an autoclaved cereal substance with the water content thereof adjusted to 40 wt % with sterile distilled water. The microorganism was grown at 25° C. during which the medium was shaken once a day. The production of the compounds of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 by \nF. solani \nKCCM 90040 upon culturing on six different solid cereal substrates is quantitatively depicted in \nFIGS. 27 and 28\n, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe production of the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 2 peaked on the 2\nth \nweek after incubation on rice (Avg. 0.375 g/kg). The use of maize, wheat or Indian millet, instead of rice, decreased the productivity of the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 2 by about 80%. Particularly low production (0.112 g/kg) was observed on barley.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs for the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 1, its maximal production was obtained on the 2\nth \nweek after incubation on rice (Avg. 0.689 g/kg). On the 3\nrd \nweek after the incubation on wheat, its production peaked to 0.672 g/kg. Replacement of rice by maize or rye decreased the production of the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 1 by about 25%. The final production of the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 1 on rice was twice as great as that on Indian millet or barley.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nDetermination of Culture Conditions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe experimental data for the production of the compounds of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 from \nF. solani \nKCCM 90040 in different treatment conditions are given in Table 7, below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMoisture\n\n\n \n\n\ncom. 1\n\n\ncom. 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRun\n\n\nTemp.\n\n\n%\n\n\nTime\n\n\n(g/kg)\n\n\n(g/kg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n15\n\n\n30\n\n\n20\n\n\n0.005\n\n\n0.010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n35\n\n\n40\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.136\n\n\n0.262\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n35\n\n\n30\n\n\n20\n\n\n0.115\n\n\n0.230\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n35\n\n\n30\n\n\n20\n\n\n0.124\n\n\n0.248\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n25\n\n\n40\n\n\n20\n\n\n0.300\n\n\n0.522\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n15\n\n\n50\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.001\n\n\n0.005\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n25\n\n\n40\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.376\n\n\n0.580\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n25\n\n\n40\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.400\n\n\n0.772\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n25\n\n\n50\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.332\n\n\n0.480\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n25\n\n\n40\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.380\n\n\n0.628\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n25\n\n\n40\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.432\n\n\n0.702\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n25\n\n\n40\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.416\n\n\n0.802\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n35\n\n\n50\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.024\n\n\n0.068\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n15\n\n\n30\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.002\n\n\n0.003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n25\n\n\n40\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.350\n\n\n0.624\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n25\n\n\n30\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.320\n\n\n0.508\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n35\n\n\n50\n\n\n20\n\n\n0.005\n\n\n0.080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n25\n\n\n40\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.250\n\n\n0.200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n15\n\n\n40\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.008\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n15\n\n\n50\n\n\n20\n\n\n0.005\n\n\n0.009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen cultured in a seawater-based medium, marine \nFusarium \nstrains were reported to produce sansalvamide in an amount of about 0.642 g/17 L [Belofsky G N, Jensen P R, Fenical W.
