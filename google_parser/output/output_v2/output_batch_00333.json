Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §119(e), of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/871,854 filed Dec. 26, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n1. Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to disintegrin variants, and more specifically to disintegrin variants as selective αvβ3 integrin antagonists for treatment and prevention of αvβ3 integrin-associated diseases.\n\n\n2. Background of the Invention\n\n\nBone is a complex tissue composed of several cell types which are continuously undergoing a process of renewal and repair termed “bone remodeling.” The two major cell types responsible for bone remodeling are osteoclasts, which resorb bone, and osteoblasts, which form new bone. Bone remodeling has been known to be regulated by several systemic hormones (e.g., parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D\n3\n, sex hormones, and calcitonin) and local factors (e.g., nitric oxide, prostaglandins, growth factors, and cytokines) [1].\n\n\nIntegrins are heterodimeric matrix receptors that anchor cells to substrates and transmit externally derived signals across the plasma membrane [5]. Integrin αvβ3 is involved in the osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, both in vivo [6] and in vitro [7, 8]. This heterodimer molecule recognizes the amino acid motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD, SEQ ID NO: 2) contained in bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein [7, 8]. Integrin αvβ3 is expressed in an osteoclast [9] and its expression is modulated by resorptive steroids and cytokines [10]. Based on blocking experiments, αvβ3 integrin has been identified as a major functional adhesion receptor on osteoclasts. Inhibitors of integrin αvβ3 reduce the capacity of osteoclasts to bind to and resorb bone [7, 11]. Integrin αvβ3 plays a major role in the function of osteoclasts [7, 11, 12] and inhibitors of this integrin are being considered for preventing osteoporosis [11], osteolytic metastases [13] and malignancy-induced hypercalcemia.\n\n\nThere are many bone diseases that are related to osteolysis that is mediated by osteoclasts. Osteoporosis is the most common one that is induced when resorption and formation of bone are not coordinated and bone breakdown overrides bone building. Osteoporosis is also caused by other conditions, such as hormonal imbalance, diseases, or medications (e.g., corticosteroids or anti-epileptic agents) [2]. Bone is one of the most common sites of metastasis by human breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid cancers, as well as other cancers [3, 4]. Osteoporosis may also result from post-menopausal estrogen deficiency. Secondary osteoporosis may be associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Bone metastasis shows a very unique step of osteoclastic bone resorption that is not seen in metastasis of other organs. It is widely accepted that osteolysis that is associated with cancer is essentially mediated by osteoclasts, which seem to be activated and may be indirectly activated through osteoblasts or directly by tumor products [4]. In addition, hypercalcemia (increased blood-calcium concentration) is an important complication of osteolytic bone diseases. It occurs relatively frequently in patients with an extensive bone destruction, and is particularly common in breast, lung, renal, ovarian, and pancreatic carcinomas as well as in myeloma [4].\n\n\nDisintegrins are a family of low-molecular-weight RGD (SEQ ID NO: 2)-containing peptides that bind specifically to integrins αllbβ3, α5β1, and αvβ3 expressed on platelets and other cells including vascular endothelial cells and some tumor cells [14, 15]. In addition to their potent antiplatelet activity, studies of disintegrins have revealed new uses in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases and the design of therapeutic agents in arterial thrombosis, osteoporosis, and angiogenesis-related tumor growth and metastasis [15]. Rhodostomin (Rho), a disintegrin derived from the venom of \nColloselasma rhodostoma\n, has been found to inhibit platelet aggregation in vivo and in vitro [16, 17] through the blockade of platelet glycoprotein αllbβ3. Furthermore, rhodostomin is reported to inhibit the adhesion of breast and prostate carcinoma cells to both unmineralized and mineralized bone extracellular matrices in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting the viability of tumor cells. In addition, rhodostomin inhibits the migration and invasion of breast and prostate carcinoma cells [18]. Rhodostomin has also been shown to inhibit adipogenesis and obesity [19]. However, because rhodostomin non-specifically binds to integrins αllbβ3, α5β1, and avβ3, the pharmaceutical uses of rhodostomin cause serious side effects. For example, when applying rhodostomin in treating carcinomas, the inhibition of platelet aggregation is an undesirable side effect.\n\n\nTherefore, a need exists in the art to address these deficiencies and inadequacies, especially in connection with the making of a disintegrin variant that has a specific selectivity to integrin αvβ3.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn accordance with the invention, one aspect of the invention is a polypeptide that is selective for αvβ3 integrin. The polypeptide exhibits reduced binding to αllbβ3 and/or α5β1 integrin compared to a wild-type disintegrin. The polypeptide is encoded by a modified disintegrin nucleotide sequence that encodes a modified amino acid sequence, with reduced αllbβ3 and/or α5β1 integrin binding activity.

Certain terms that are used to describe the invention are discussed below, or elsewhere in the specification, to provide additional guidance to the practitioner regarding the description of the invention. Synonyms for certain terms are provided. A recital of one or more synonyms does not exclude the use of other synonyms. The use of examples anywhere in this specification including examples of any terms discussed herein is illustrative only, and in no way limits the scope and meaning of the invention or of any exemplified term. The invention is not limited to various embodiments given in this specification.\n\n\nUnless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains. In the case of conflict, the present document, including definitions will control.\n\n\n“Around,” “about” or “approximately” shall generally mean within 20 percent, within 10 percent, within 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 percent of a given value or range. Numerical quantities given are approximate, meaning that the term “around,” “about” or “approximately” can be inferred if not expressly stated.\n\n\nThe terms “polynucleotide,” “nucleotide,” “nucleic acid,” “nucleic acid molecule,” “nucleic acid sequence,” “polynucleotide sequence,” and “nucleotide sequence” are used interchangeably to refer to polymeric forms of nucleotides of any length. The polynucleotides can comprise deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, and/or their analogs or derivatives. The term includes variants. Variants may include insertions, additions, deletions, or substitutions. Nucleotide sequences are listed in the 5′ to 3′ direction.\n\n\nThe terms “polypeptide,” “peptide,” and “protein,” used interchangeably to refer to a polymeric form of amino acids of any length, which can include naturally-occurring amino acids, coded and non-coded amino acids, chemically or biochemically modified, derivatized, or designer amino acids, amino acid analogs, peptidomimetics, and depsipeptides, and polypeptides having modified, cyclic, bicyclic, depsicyclic, or depsibicyclic peptide backbones. The term includes single chain protein as well as multimers. The term also includes proteins conjugated to a label such as FITC, biotin, and radioisotopes, including, but not limited to \n64\nCu, \n67\nCu, \n90\nY, \n99\nmTc, \n111\nIn, \n124\nI, \n125\nI, \n131\nI, \n137\nCs, \n186\nRe, \n211\nAt, \n212\nBi, \n213\nBi, \n223\nRa \n241\nAm, and \n244\nCm; enzymes having detectable products (for example, luciferase, peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, and the like); fluorescers and fluorescent labels, fluorescence emitting metals, for example, \n152\nEu, or others of the lanthanide series, electrochemiluniescent compounds, chemiluminescent compounds, for example, luminol, isoluminol, or acridinium salts; specific binding molecules, for example, magnetic particles, microspheres, nanospheres, and the like. The term also includes peptides conjugated to therapeutic agents.\n\n\nThe terms also include fusion proteins, including, but not limited to, glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, fusion proteins with a heterologous amino acid sequence such as bioluminescent proteins, for example, luciferin, or aequorin (green fluorescent protein), with heterologous and homologous leader sequences, fusion proteins with or without N-terminal methionine residues, pegylated proteins, and immunologically tagged, or his-tagged proteins. Such fusion proteins also include fusions to epitopes. Such fusion proteins can comprise multimers of the peptides of the invention, e.g. homodimers or homomultimers, and heterodimers and heteromultimers. The term also includes peptide aptamers.\n\n\nThe term “hybridizes specifically,” in the context of a polynucleotide, refers to hybridization under stringent conditions. Conditions that increase stringency of both DNA/DNA and DNA/RNA hybridization reactions are widely known and published in the art. Examples of stringent hybridization conditions include hybridization in 4× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), at about 65-70° C., or hybridization in 4×SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50° C., followed by one or more washes in 1× SSC, at about 65-70° C.\n\n\nThe term “ligand” refers to a molecule that binds to another molecule, including a receptor.\n\n\nA “host cell” is an individual cell or cell culture which can be or has been a recipient of any recombinant vector(s) or polynucleotide. Host cells include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be completely identical (in morphology or in total DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation and/or change. A host cell includes cells transfected or infected in vivo or in vitro with a recombinant vector or a polynucleotide of the invention. A host cell which comprises a recombinant vector of the invention may be called a “recombinant host cell.”\n\n\n“Treatment,” covers any administration or application of remedies for disease in a mammal, including a human, and includes inhibiting the disease, arresting its development, or relieving the disease, for example, by causing regression, or restoring or repairing a lost, missing, or defective function; or stimulating an inefficient process. The term includes obtaining a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect, covering any treatment of a pathological condition or disorder in a mammal, including a human. The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing a disorder or symptom thereof and/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure for a disorder and/or adverse affect attributable to the disorder. Thus, the invention provides both treatment and prophylaxis. It includes (1) preventing the disorder from occurring or recurring in a subject who may be predisposed to the disorder but is not yet symptomatic, (2) inhibiting the disorder, such as arresting its development, (3) stopping or terminating the disorder or at least its associated symptoms, so that the host no longer suffers from the disorder or its symptoms, such as causing regression of the disorder or its symptoms, for example, by restoring or repairing a lost, missing or defective function, or stimulating an inefficient process, or (4) relieving, alleviating, or ameliorating the disorder, or symptoms associated therewith, where ameliorating is used in a broad sense to refer to at least a reduction in the magnitude of a parameter, such as inflammation, pain, and/or tumor size.\n\n\nA “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a non-toxic solid, semisolid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material, formulation auxiliary, or excipient of any conventional type. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation.\n\n\nA “composition” refers to a mixture that usually contains a carrier, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient that is conventional in the art and which is suitable for administration into a subject for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prophylactic purposes. It may include a cell culture in which the polypeptide or polynucleotide is present in the cells or in the culture medium. For example, compositions for oral administration can form solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, sustained release formulations, oral rinses, or powders.\n\n\n“Disease” refers to any condition, infection, disorder, or syndrome that requires medical intervention or for which medical intervention is desirable. Such medical intervention can include treatment, diagnosis, and/or prevention.\n\n\nPeptides\n\n\nThe peptides of the invention can be expressed using methods known in the art. Cell-based methods and cell-free methods are suitable for producing peptides of the invention. Cell-based methods generally involve introducing a nucleic acid construct into a host cell in vitro and culturing the host cell under conditions suitable for expression, then harvesting the peptide, either from the culture medium or from the host cell, (for example, by disrupting the host cell), or both. The invention also provides methods of producing a peptide using cell-free in vitro transcription/translation methods, which are well known in the art.\n\n\nSuitable host cells include prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, fungal, plant, insect, and mammalian cells.\n\n\nTypically, a heterologous peptide, whether modified or unmodified, may be expressed on its own, as described above, or as a fusion protein, and may include not only secretion signals, but also a secretory leader sequence. A secretory leader sequence of the invention may direct certain proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER separates the membrane-bound proteins from other proteins. Once localized to the ER, proteins can be further directed to the Golgi apparatus for distribution to vesicles, including secretory vesicles, the plasma membrane, lysosomes, and other organelles.\n\n\nAdditionally, peptide moieties and/or purification tags may be added to the peptides. Such regions may be removed prior to final preparation of the polypeptide. The addition of peptide moieties to polypeptides to engender secretion or excretion, to improve stability, and to facilitate purification, among other reasons, are familiar and routine techniques in the art. Suitable purification tags include, for example, V5, polyhistidines, avidin, and biotin. Conjugation of peptides to compounds such as biotin can be accomplished using techniques well known in the art. (Hermanson ed. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press). Peptides can also be conjugated with radioisotopes, toxins, enzymes, fluorescent labels, colloidal gold, nucleic acids, vinorelbine, and doxorubicin using techniques known in the art. (Hermanson ed. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press; Stefano et al. (2006).\n\n\nFusion partners suitable for use in the invention include, for example, fetuin, human serum albumin, Fc, and/or one or more of their fragments. Conjugated proteins, such as polyethylene glycol conjugates, are also provided.\n\n\nThe peptides of the invention can also be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art (e.g., see Hunkapiller et al., Nature, 310:105 111 (1984); Grant ed. (1992) Synthetic Peptides, A Users Guide, W.H. Freeman and Co.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,974,884)). For example, a polypeptide corresponding to a fragment of a polypeptide can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer or through the use of solid-phase methods known in the art.\n\n\nFurthermore, if desired, nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the polypeptide sequence. Non-classical amino acids include, but are not limited to, to the D-isomers of the common amino acids, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, a-amino isobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, Abu, 2-amino butyric acid, g-Abu, e-Ahx, 6-amino hexanoic acid, Aib, 2-amino isobutyric acid, 3-amino propionic acid, ornithine, norleucine, norvaline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, citrulline, homocitrulline, cysteic acid, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylglycine, cyclohexylalanine, b-alanine, fluoro-amino acids, designer amino acids such as b-methyl amino acids, Ca-methyl amino acids, Na-methyl amino acids, and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore, the amino acid can be D (dextrorotary) or L (levorotary).\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the invention can be recovered and purified from chemical synthesis and recombinant cell cultures by standard methods which include, but are not limited to, ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. In one embodiment, high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”) is employed for purification. Well known techniques for refolding protein may be employed to regenerate active conformation when the polypeptide is denatured during isolation and/or purification.\n\n\nA peptide or peptidomimetic of the invention can be modified with or covalently coupled to one or more of a variety of hydrophilic polymers to increase solubility and circulation half-life of the peptide. Suitable nonproteinaceous hydrophilic polymers for coupling to a peptide include, but are not limited to, polyalkylethers as exemplified by polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polyoxyalkenes, polyvinylalcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose and cellulose derivatives, dextran, and dextran derivatives. Generally, such hydrophilic polymers have an average molecular weight ranging from about 500 to about 100,000 daltons, from about 2,000 to about 40,000 daltons, or from about 5,000 to about 20,000 daltons. The peptide can be derivatized with or coupled to such polymers using any of the methods set forth in Zallipsky, S. (1995) Bioconjugate Chem., 6:150-165; Monfardini, C., et al. (1995) Bioconjugate Chem. 6:62-69; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192; 4,179,337, or WO 95/34326.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, a peptide of the invention is provided in formulation with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, and diluents, of which a wide variety are known in the art. These pharmaceutical carriers, excipients, and diluents include those listed in the USP pharmaceutical excipients listing. USP and NF Excipients, Listed by Categories, p. 2404-2406, \nUSP\n 24 NF 19, United States Pharmacopeial Convention Inc., Rockville, Md. (ISBN 1-889788-03-1). Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as vehicles, adjuvants, carriers, or diluents, are readily available to the public. Moreover, pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, stabilizers, wetting agents and the like, are readily available to the public.\n\n\nSuitable carriers include, but are not limited to, water, dextrose, glycerol, saline, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The carrier can contain additional agents such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, or adjuvants which enhance the effectiveness of the formulation. Topical carriers include liquid petroleum, isopropyl palmitate, polyethylene glycol, ethanol (95%), polyoxyethylene monolaurate (5%) in water, or sodium lauryl sulfate (5%) in water. Other materials such as anti-oxidants, humectants, viscosity stabilizers, and similar agents can be added as necessary. Percutaneous penetration enhancers such as Azone can also be included.\n\n\nIn pharmaceutical dosage forms, the compositions of the invention can be administered in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or they can also be used alone or in appropriate association, as well as in combination, with other pharmaceutically active compounds. The subject compositions are formulated in accordance to the mode of potential administration.\n\n\nMethods of Treatment\n\n\nAn αvβ3 integrin-associated disease, includes, but is not limited to, osteoporosis, bone tumor or cancer growth and symptoms related thereto, angiogenesis-related tumor growth and metastasis, tumor metastasis in bone, malignancy-induced hypercalcemia, angiogenesis-related eye diseases, Paget's disease, rheumatic arthritis and osteoarthritis.\n\n\nPeptides of the invention may be administered to a subject in need of treatment by injection systemically, such as by intravenous injection; or by injection or application to the relevant site, such as by direct injection, or direct application to the site when the site is exposed in surgery; or by topical application, such as if the disorder is on the skin, for example.\n\n\nPeptides of the invention can be used as monotherapy. Alternatively, the peptides of the invention can be used in combination with standard regimens to treat αvβ3 integrin associated diseases.\n\n\nAdministration of the agents can be achieved in various ways, including oral, buccal, nasal, rectal, parenteral, intraperitoneal, intradermal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intra-arterial, intracardiac, intraventricular, intracranial, intratracheal, and intrathecal administration, etc., or otherwise by implantation or inhalation. Thus, the subject compositions can be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, liquid, or gaseous forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granules, ointments, solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants and aerosols. The following methods and excipients are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.\n\n\nSuitable excipient vehicles are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, or the like, and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the vehicle can contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in the art. The composition or formulation to be administered will, in any event, contain a quantity of the agent adequate to achieve the desired state in the subject being treated.\n\n\nA peptides of the invention can be formulated into preparations for injection by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent, such as vegetable or other similar oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher aliphatic acids or propylene glycol; and if desired, with conventional additives such as solubilizers, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. Other formulations for oral or parenteral delivery can also be used, as conventional in the art.\n\n\n“Disintegrins” refer to a family of polypeptides that may be purified from snake venoms, which contain the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) (SEQ ID NO: 2) sequence. Without being bound by any theory or mechanism, it is believed that the RGD (SEQ ID NO: 2) tripeptide binds with high affinity to integrins to block the interaction of integrins with RGD (SEQ ID NO: 2)-containing proteins. Disintegrins thus block adhesive functions and act as platelet aggregation inhibitors.\n\n\nThe abbreviation “Rho” means “rhodostomin,” which is a disintegrin derived from the venom of \nColloselasma rhodostoma\n. Rhodostomin non-specifically binds to integrins αllbβ3, α5β1 and αvβ3, and prolongs blood clotting time by inhibiting platelet aggregation through the blockade of platelet glycoprotein αllbβ3.\n\n\nThe “disintegrin variant” or “rhodostomin variant” refers to a functionally active protein, or a polypeptide or any derivatives thereof, that comprises an amino acid sequence derived or modified or mutated from a wild-type disintegrin such as rhodostomin. A functionally active disintegrin/rhodostomin variant can specifically bind to and inhibit integrin αvβ3 activity. The disintegrin or rhodostomin variant of the present invention can be constructed by any method suitable to the aims of the present invention, and in one embodiment by a site-directed mutagenesis method, and in another embodiment by a polymerase chain reaction method. Variants may include insertions, additions, deletions, or substitutions compared with the subject peptides. Variants of polypeptide sequences include biologically active polymorphic variants.\n\n\nPeptides of the invention can include naturally-occurring and non-naturally occurring amino acids. Peptides can comprise D-amino acids, a combination of D- and L-amino acids, and various “designer” or “synthetic” amino acids (for example, β-methyl amino acids, Cα-methyl amino acids, and Nα-methyl amino acids, etc.) to convey special properties. Additionally, peptides can be cyclic. Peptides can include non-classical amino acids in order to introduce particular conformational motifs. Any known non-classical amino acid can be used. Amino acid analogs and peptidomimetics can be incorporated into a peptide to induce or favor specific secondary structures, including, but not limited to, LL-Acp (LL-3-amino-2-propenidone-6-carboxylic acid), a β-turn inducing dipeptide analog; β-sheet inducing analogs; β-turn inducing analogs; α-helix inducing analogs; γ-turn inducing analogs; Gly-Ala turn analogs; amide bond isostere; or tretrazol, and the like.\n\n\nA desamino or descarboxy residue can be incorporated at the terminal ends of the peptide, so that there is no terminal amino or carboxyl group, to decrease susceptibility to proteases or to restrict conformation. C-terminal functional groups include amide, amide lower alkyl, amide di (lower alkyl), lower alkoxy, hydroxy, and carboxy, and the lower ester derivatives thereof, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n\n\nThe term “IC\n50\n,” or “the half maximal inhibitory concentration” refers to the concentration of Rho or its variant that is required for 50% inhibition of its receptor. IC\n50 \nis a measure of how much of Rho or its variant is needed to inhibit a biological process by 50%,such as the variant's affinity to its receptor.\n\n\nThe term “therapeutically effective amount” as used refers to an amount which, when administered to a living subject, achieves a desired effect on the living subject. For example, an effective amount of the disintegrin or Rho variant of the invention for administration to the living subject is an amount that prevents and/or treats an integrin αvβ3-mediated disease. The exact amount will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques.

Disintegrin variants such as RD-related compounds potently inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro. They also inhibit osteoclast resorbing activity and ovariectomy-induced increase in osteoclast formation in animal studies. In addition, RD inhibits the tumor growth of human prostate and breast cancer cells in bone. Malignancy-induced hypercalcemia was also effectively blocked by RD-related proteins. Paget's disease (also known as osteitis deformans) is a chronic bone disorder that typically results in enlarged and deformed bones due to irregular breakdown and formation of bone tissues. Bisphosphonates have been approved for the treatment of Paget's disease. Osteoarthritis is also related to the increase in osteoclast activity. Based on the similar mechanism of action, RD derivatives should also be effective for treatment of these bone disorders. An intravenous injection of RD or PGP at a very large dose at 30 mg/kg did not affect the survival of mice (n=3). In addition, long term administration of PGP (I.V., 0.5 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks did not affect serum level of creatinine, GOT, and GPT, suggesting lack of side effects on kidney and liver. Therefore, RD and its derivatives are potential drug candidates for treatment of osteoporosis, bone tumor, malignancy-induced hypercalcemia, Paget's disease, rheumatic arthritis, osteoarthritis and angiogenesis-related eye diseases.\n\n\nMany kinds of snake venom contain proteins that comprise an RGD (SEQ ID NO: 2) domain. These RGD (SEQ ID NO: 2) domain-containing proteins are called disintegrins. A modification in the sequence spanning the RGD (SEQ ID NO: 2) domain resulted in a very unique polypeptide variant with a reduced binding affinity to other kinds of integrins but an increased selectivity to αvβ3 integrin. The disintegrin variants including rhodostomin variants prove to be potential therapeutic candidates for, among others, osteoporosis, suppression of tumor growth in bone, and angiogenesis-related eye diseases. Moreover, disintegrin variants including rhodostomin variants having a RGD (SEQ ID NO: 2)-motif region with at least one amino acid substitution may be valuable tools for developing selective antagonists of αvβ3 integrin.\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention is a polypeptide that has integrin αvβ3 receptor-antagonist activity and reduced integrin αllbβ3 and/or α5β1 receptor-blocking activity as compared to a wild-type disintegrin.

The cDNA of human serum albumin was purchased from Invitrogen, and the structural gene of albumin was fused at N-terminus of Rho gene with a GSGSGS (SEQ ID NO: 137) linker amino acid sequence and with six histidine residues at the N-terminus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimer\n\n\nSequence\n\n\nSEQ ID NO:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRLD-1\n\n\nSense\n\n\nGAATCCCAAGA\nCTT\nGACATGCCAG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRLD-2\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\nCTGGCATGTC\nAAG\nTCTTGGGATTC\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRHD-1\n\n\nSense\n\n\nAGAATCCCAAGA\nCAC\nGACATGCCAGAC\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRHD-2\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\nGTCTGGCATGTC\nGTG\nTCTTGGGATTCT\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRID-1\n\n\nSense\n\n\nAGAATCCCAAGA\nATC\nGACATGCCAGAC\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRID-2\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\nGTCTGGCATGTC\nGAT\nTCTTGGGATTCT\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nP48A-1\n\n\nSense\n\n\nTGTAGAATC\nGCT\nAGAGGTGACATG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nP48A-2\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\nCATGTCACCTCT\nAGC\nGATTCTACA\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nARGD-2\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\nGTCACCTCT\nTGC\nGATTCTACAG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGDNP-1\n\n\nSense\n\n\nCAAGAGGTGAC\nAAC\nCCAGACGACAG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGDNP-2\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\nCTGTCGTCTGG\nGTT\nGTCACCTCTTG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGDDP-1\n\n\nSense\n\n\nCAAGAGGTGAC\nGAC\nCCAGACGACAG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGDDP-2\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\nCTGTCGTCTGG\nGTC\nGTCACCTCTTG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 17)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGDGP-1\n\n\nSense\n\n\nCAAGAGGTGAC\nGGT\nCCAGACGACAGATG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGDGP-2\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\nCATCTGTCGTCTGG\nACC\nGTCACCTCTTG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 19)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGDDL-1\n\n\nSense\n\n\nCAAGAGGTGAC\nGACCTA\nGACGACAGATG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGDDL-2\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\nCATCTGTCGTC\nTAGGTC\nGTCACCTCTTG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 21)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGDDM-1\n\n\nSense\n\n\nCAAGAGGTGAC\nGACATG\nGACGACAGATG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 22)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGDDM-2\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\nCATCTGTCGTC\nCATGTC\nGTCACCTCTTG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 23)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGDDV-1\n\n\nSense\n\n\nCAAGAGGTGAC\nGACGTA\nGACGACAGATG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 24)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGDDV-2\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\nCATCTGTCGTC\nTACGTC\nGTCACCTCTTG\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 25)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-factor\n\n\n \n\n\nTATTGCCAGCATTGCTGC\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 26)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5′-AOX1\n\n\nSense\n\n\nGACTGGTTCCAATTGACAAGC\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 27)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3′-AOX1\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\nGCAAATGGCATTCTGACATCC\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 28)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRLDDL-1\n\n\nSense\n\n\nCAAGA\nCTT\nGAC\nGACCTA\nGAC\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 74)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRLDD-2\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\n \nGTC\nGTC\nAAG\nTCTTGGGATTC\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 75)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGDDL-1\n\n\nSense\n\n\nCAAGA\nCTT\nGAC\nGACCTA\nGAC\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 76)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nARLDD-2\n\n\nAntisense\n\n\n \nGTC\nGTC\nAAG\nTCT\nTGC\nGATTC\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 77)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Primer α-factor was used as a sequencing primer; 5′-AOX1 & 3′-AOX1 primers were used for checking for the presence of the inserted DNA.\n\n\nThe polymerase chain reactions were carried out at 95° C. for 1 min, 55° C. for 1 min, then 72° C. for 1 min for 25 cycles.

Briefly, a total of 10 μg plasmids containing DNA encoding rhodostomin or its variants were purified and digested with Sac I to linearize the plasmids. \nPichia \nstrain X33 was transformed with the linearized constructs by a heat shock method, using a \nPichia \nEasyComp™ kit from Invitrogen®. The transformant integrated at the 5′ AOX1 locus by a single crossover. PCR was used to analyze \nPichia \nintegrants to determine if the Rho gene had been integrated into the \nPichia \ngenome, and cells were lysed by Lyticase (Sigma). Colonies were selected on agar plates containing YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, and 2% agar) and 100 μg/ml Zeocin. A number of clones with multiple copies of Rho gene insertions were selected to pick the clone having the highest Rho protein expression.\n\n\nRecombinant Rho and its variants were produced as follows: Selected colonies were grown in the YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) containing 100 μg/ml Zeocin at 30° C. After 48 hours, cells were collected by centrifugation and grown in 1 liter of minimal methanol medium (containing 1.34% yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate without amino acids and 4×10\n−5\n% biotin). A total of 1% methanol was added once every 24 hours to induce Rho or variant expression for 2 days. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and dialyzed twice against 5 liter buffer A (5 mM EDTA, 8M urea and 10 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 7.7). The final solution was loaded into a nickel-chelating column and eluted with a gradient of 200 mM imidazole. The recombinant rhodostomin and its variants were further purified by HPLC (reverse phase C18 HPLC). The purified recombinant Rho had a purity of greater than 95% as judged by tricine-SDS-PAGE.\n\n\nRho and its variants were subsequently subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry analyses for checking the molecular weight. The amino acid sequences of the RGD (SEQ ID NO: 2) motifs of Rho and variants are shown in Table 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\n\n\nRGD (SEQ ID NO: 2)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO.\n\n\nMotif and \nVariants thereof\n \n \nAbbreviation\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2\n\n\n \n49\nArg-Gly-Asp\n51\n \n\n\n \n49\nRGD\n51\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n \n48\nPro-Arg-Gly-Asp-Met-Pro\n53\n (Wild type)\n\n\n \n48\n \nP\nRGD\nMP\n \n \n \n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n \n48\nAla-Arg-Gly-Asp-Asp-Pro\n53\n \n\n\n \n48\nA\nRGD\nDP\n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n \n48\nAla-Arg-Gly-Asp-Asp-VaI\n53\n \n\n\n \n48\nA\nRGD\nDV\n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n \n48\nAla-Arg-Gly-Asp-Asp-Leu\n53\n \n\n\n \n48\nA\nRGD\nDL\n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n \n48\nPro-Arg-Gly-Asp-Asp-Leu\n53\n \n\n\n \n48\nP\nRGD\nDL\n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\n \n48\nAla-Arg-Gly-Asp-Asp-Met\n53\n \n\n\n \n48\nA\nRGD\nDM\n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n \n48\nPro-Arg-Gly-Asp-Asp-Met\n53\n \n\n\n \n48\nP\nRGD\nDM\n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\n \n48\nPro-Arg-Leu-Asp-Met-Pro\n53\n \n\n\n \n48\nPRLDMP\n53\n(\nRD\n)(\nRLD\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\n \n48\nPro-Arg-Leu-Asp-Met-Pro\n53\n (pegylated)\n\n\n*\n48\nPRLDMP\n53\n-5K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\n \n48\nPro-Arg-Leu-Asp-Asp-Leu\n53\n \n\n\n \n48\nPRLDDL\n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n \n48\nAla-Arg-Leu-Asp-Asp-Leu\n53\n \n\n\n \n48\nARLDDL\n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n\n \n48\nPro-Arg-Ile-Asp-Met-Pro\n53\n \n\n\n \n48\nPRIDMP\n53\n(\nRID\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n \n48\nPro-Arg-His-Asp-Met-Pro\n53\n \n\n\n \n48\nPRHDMP\n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\n \n48\nPro-Arg-Gly-Asp-Asn-Pro\n53\n \n\n\n \n48\nP\nRGD\nNP\n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n \n48\nPro-Arg-Gly-Asp-Gly-Pro\n53\n \n\n\n \n48\nP\nRGD\nGP\n53\n(\nPGP\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n48\nPRLDMP\n53\n-5K refers to pegylated \n48\nPRLDMP\n53 \n(SEQ ID NO: 36).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\nEffects of RD and its Derivatives on Bleeding Time\n\n\nMeasurement of bleeding time was performed as follows: Mice were anaesthetized with trichloroacetaldehyde (200 mg/kg), and bleeding time was measured by a method described previously, with minor modifications [21]. Saline or proteins were injected intravenously through the tail vein of the mouse (ICR, male, with an average body weight of 23.5±1.8 g). A sharp cut of 0.5 mm from the tail tip of the mouse was made 5 min after injection. The tail was then immediately immersed in a saline-filled beaker, kept at 37° C., and the bleeding time was measured.\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n shows the effects of RD and ARLDDL (SEQ ID NO: 38) proteins on tail bleeding time in mice. Tail bleeding time was measured 5 min after intravenous administration of saline, RD, ARLDDL (SEQ ID NO: 38), rhodostomin (0.6 mg/kg for each) of HSA-RD (5 mg/kg). An intravenous injection of rhodostomin (0.5 mg/kg) exerted a pronounced effect in prolonging the clotting time in mice. However, both RD and ARLDDL (SEQ ID NO: 38) (0.5 mg/kg), which exerted selectivity for avβ3 integrin, only slightly affected the clotting time in mice as compared to rhodostomin. Results are expressed as the mean ±S.E.M (n=6).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nPlatelet Aggregation Assay\n\n\nVenous blood (9 parts) samples from healthy donors who had not received any medication for at least two weeks were collected in 3.8% sodium citrate (1 part). Blood samples were centrifuged at 150×g for 10 min to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and allowed to stand for 5 min, and PRP was collected. The platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was prepared from the remaining blood by centrifuging at 2000×g for 25 min. The PPP platelet count was measured on a hematology analyzer and diluted to 250,000 platelets/μl. A solution of 190 μl of PRP and 10 μl of either Rho or PBS buffer were incubated for 5 min in a Hema Tracer 601 aggregometer at 37° C. Ten microliters of 200 μM adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were further added to monitor the response of platelet aggregation by light transmission.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\nCell Adhesion Inhibition Assay\n\n\nCell adhesion inhibition assays were performed as described previously [27]. Briefly, wells of 96-well Immulon-2 microtiter plates (Costar, Corning, USA) were coated with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 10 mM phosphate buffer, 0.15M NaCl, pH 7.4) containing substrates at a concentration of 50-500 nM, and incubated overnight at 4° C. The substrates and their coating concentrations were fibrinogen (Fg) 200 μg/ml, vitronectin (Vn) 50 μg/ml, and fibronectin (Fn) 25 μg/ml. Non-specific protein binding sites were blocked by incubating each well with 200 μl of heat-denatured 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Calbiochem) at room temperature (25° C.) for 1.5 hr The heat-denatured BSA was discarded and each well was washed twice with 200 μl of PBS.\n\n\nChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing αvβ3 (CHO-αvβ3) and αllbβ3 (CHO-αllbβ3) integrins were maintained in 100 μl of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) medium. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing integrins αvβ3 (CHO-αvβ3) and αllbβ3 (CHO-αllbβ3) were kindly provided by Dr. Y. Takada (Scripps Research Institute). Human erythroleukemia K562 cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in the RPMI-1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. CHO and K562 cells growing in log phase were detached by trypsinization and used in the assay at 3×10\n5 \nand 2.5×10\n5 \ncells/ml, respectively. Rho and its variants were added to the cultured cells and incubated at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nfor 15 minutes. Rho and its variants were used as inhibitors at the concentrations of 0.001-500 μM. The treated cells were then added into the coated plate and reacted at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nfor 1 hour. The incubation solution was then discarded and non-adhered cells were removed by washing twice with 200 μl PBS. Bound cells were quantified by crystal violet staining. Briefly, the well was fixed with 100 μl of 10% formalin for 10 minutes and dried. Fifty microliters of 0.05% crystal violet were then added into the well at room temperature for 20 minutes. Each well was washed with 200 μl of distilled water four times and dried. Colorization was carried out by adding 150 μl of colorizing solution (50% alcohol and 0.1% acetic acid). The resulting absorbance was read at 600 nm and the readings were correlated with the number of adhering cells. Inhibition was defined as % inhibition=100−[OD\n600 \n(rhodostomin variant-treated sample)/OD\n600 \n(untreated sample)]×100.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nInhibitory Effects of RD and its Derivatives on Integrins αvβ3, αllbβ3, and α5β1\n\n\nThe IC\n50 \nof RD and its derivatives on integrin binding was obtained by the cell adhesion assay as described in Example 5 above. Briefly, matrix proteins such as fibronectin, vitronectin, or fibrinogen, were coated at a fixed concentration on microtiter plates, as described in Example 5, and Rho and its variants were added to the cells expressing integrin at different concentrations ranging from 0.001˜500 μM to obtain an IC\n50\n. The lower the IC\n50\n, the greater the specificity or potency of the variant.\n\n\nThe modification of the RGD (SEQ ID NO: 2) motif of Rho had unique effects on Rho's biological activities: the activity in inhibiting the integrin αllbβ3 or α5β1's binding to the matrix proteins was reduced and the selectivity to the integrin αvβ3 was increased as a result of the sequence modification.

As shown in Table 4, for example, the IC\n50 \nof RD (i.e., PRLDMP (SEQ ID NO: 63) in inhibition of integrins αllbβ3 and α5β1 increased more than 104 and 10-fold, respectively, as compared to that of the Rho. Moreover, the IC\n50 \nof ARLDDL (SEQ ID NO: 65) in inhibition of integrins αllbβ3 and α5β1 increased more than 2000-fold and 90-fold, respectively, compared to that of the Rho. The IC\n50 \nof pegylated RD and human albumin-conjugated RD on αllbβ3 binding increased 113.7- and 129.9-fold, respectively, as compared to that of the Rho (Table 5). Therefore, the variants' affinities to platelets were markedly reduced compared to that of Rho (Table 5).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\nEffects of RD and Its Derivatives on Osteoclastogenesis\n\n\nOsteoclasts are specialized monocyte/macrophage family members that differentiate from bone marrow hematopoietic precursors. Cultures of osteoclast precursors in the presence of M-CSF (20 ng/ml) and sRANKL (50 ng/ml) for 8 days induced the formation of large mature osteoclasts with multi-nuclei, which were characterized by the acquisition of mature phenotypic markers, such as TRAP. The method of osteoclastogenesis from cultured hematopoietic cells of bone marrow and the effects of RD and its derivatives on osteoclastogenesis were investigated as follows.\n\n\nBone marrow cells were prepared by removing femurs from 6˜8-week-old SD rats and flushing the bone marrow cavity with a-MEM which was supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The non-adherent cells (hematopoietic cells) were collected and used as osteoclast precursors after 24 hr. Cells were seeded at 1×10\n6 \ncells/well (0.5 ml) in 24-well plates in the presence of human recombinant soluble RANKL (50 ng/ml) and murine M-CSF (20 ng/ml). The culture medium was replaced every 3 days. Osteoclast formation was confirmed by an assay of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) on day-8. In brief, adherent cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min. After treatment with ethanol/acetone (50:50 v/v) for 1 min, the cell surface was air-dried and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in an acetate buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0) containing 0.01% naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma) and 0.03% fast red violet LB salt (Sigma) in the presence of 50 mM sodium tartrate. Osteoclast-like TRAP-positive cells in each well were scored by counting the number of TRAP-positive and multinucleated cells containing more than three nuclei.\n\n\nRD derivatives markedly inhibited the differentiation of osteoclasts, which was correlated with their inhibitory activities on αvβ3 (Table 5). On the other hand, AKGDWN (SEQ ID NO: 138) and PRGEMP (SEQ ID NO: 139) were less effective in inhibiting integrin αvβ3 and differentiation of osteoclasts (Table 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of Platelet Aggregation, Cell adhesion, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOsteoclastogenesis by RD and its Derivatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlatelet\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\naggregation\n\n\nαvβ3\n\n\nα5β1\n\n\nαIIbβ3\n\n\nOsteoclastogenesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhodostomin\n\n\n83\n\n\n13\n\n\n257\n\n\n21\n\n\n5.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARGDDL\n\n\n455\n\n\n41\n\n\n527\n\n\n1518\n\n\n8.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n32)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPGP\n\n\n283\n\n\n24\n\n\n4000\n\n\n500\n\n\n5.76\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\n\n433\n\n\n35\n\n\n3043\n\n\n2220\n\n\n3.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRID\n\n\n448\n\n\n120\n\n\n>5850\n\n\n>5850\n\n\n5.82\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRGDDL\n\n\n396\n\n\n76\n\n\n3017\n\n\n1224\n\n\n3.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n33)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nARLDDL\n\n\n10380\n\n\n37\n\n\n23171\n\n\n59217\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n38)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRPDDL\n\n\n3530\n\n\n188\n\n\n21381\n\n\n13590\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n140)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAKGDWN\n\n\n138\n\n\n96637\n\n\n>119000\n\n\n69\n\n\n78400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n138)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRGEMP\n\n\n4908\n\n\n>17850\n\n\n>5950\n\n\n>59500\n\n\n68200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n139)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPegylated-RD\n\n\n398\n\n\n115\n\n\n>5880\n\n\n2408\n\n\n3.88\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHSA-RD\n\n\n438\n\n\n45\n\n\n>5880\n\n\n2750\n\n\n6.68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nOvariectomy-Induced Osteoporosis\n\n\nFemale Sprague-Dawley rats (3 months old, 270˜290 g) or ICR mice (4 weeks old, 22˜28 g) were used for this study. Rats or mice were ovariectomized (OVX) bilaterally under trichloroacetaldehyde anesthesia and control rats were sham-operated (Sham) for comparison. The animals were all kept under controlled conditions at the room temperature (22±1° C.) and a 12-hr light-dark cycle. Animals were fed with Purina Laboratory Rodent Diet (PMI; St. Louis, Mo.) (0.95% calcium) and water ad libitum. The body weights of the rats were recorded weekly.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nAnalysis of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and Content (BMC)\n\n\nAt the end of the experiment, rats or mice were sacrificed by decapitation. The tibia and femur were removed, cleaned of soft tissue, and the length and weight of the tibia and femur were measured with a precision caliper (±0.05 mm) as described by Weinreb et al. [26]. BMD and BMC of the tibia were measured with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometer (DEX, XR-26; Norland, Fort Atkinson, Wis.). The mode adapted to the measurements of small subjects was adopted. See Chih-Hsin et al., “Enhancement of Fibronectin Fibrillogenesis and Bone Formation by Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor via Protein Kinase C-Dependent Pathway in Rat Osteoblasts,” Mol. Pharmacol: 66: 440-449, (2004). A coefficient of variation of 0.7% was calculated from daily measurements of BMD on a lumbar phantom for more than 1 year [22, 23]. The whole tibia and femur were scanned and BMD and BMC were measured by an absorptiometer.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 10\n\n\nHistomorphometry of Bone\n\n\nTibiae were fixed by 4% formaldehyde and then decalcified with 12% EDTA and dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol solution and acetone, and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (5 mm) were cut longitudinally and stained with Mayer's hematoxylin-eosin solution. Images of the growth plate and proximal tibia were photographed using an Olympus microscope. The bone volume was measured using an image analysis software (Image-pro plus 3.0) in the secondary spongiosa, which was located under the primary spongiosa and characterized by a network of larger trabeculae. To measure the number of osteoclasts, the sections were stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\nBiomechanical Three-Point Bending Test\n\n\nMechanical properties of bone tissues were measured by performing three-point bending test in a material testing system (MTS-858, MTS System Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.). The span of the two support points was 20 millimeters and the deformation rate was 1 mm/min. Load/deformation curves were input to a computer and analyzed by Team 490 software (version 4.10, Nicolet Instrument Technologies Inc., Madison, Wis.). Cross-sectional parameters were measured from the photographs and used in the calculation of the cross-sectional moment of inertia. The cross-sectional moment of inertia was calculated under the assumption that the cross-sections were elliptically shaped [24]:\n\n\n\nI\n=π[(\nab\n3×(\na×\n2\nt\n)(\nb×\n2\nt\n)3)/64\n\n\n\nwhere a is the width of the cross section in the mediolateral direction, b is the width of the cross section in the anteroposterior direction, and t is the average of the cortical thickness. All of these parameters were obtained using the image software Image Pro Plus 3.0 for Windows (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, Md.). The maximal stress, ultimate stress, and elastic modulus (Young's modulus) were calculated using the following equations [25]:\n\n\nσ=\nFLc/\n4\nI \n\n\n\n\nE=F/d\n \n \nL\n3/48\nI \n\n\n\nwhere σ is ultimate stress, c is the distance from the center of mass (equal to ½ b as described above), F is the applied load (N), d is the displacement (mm), and L is the span between the two support points of the bending fixture (mm). In addition, the energies in the ultimate stress were measured by computing the respective areas under the stress-strain curve.\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 12\n\n\nInhibition of OVX-induced Bone Loss by RD Derivatives in Mice\n\n\nTo examine the effects of RD derivatives on bone loss, osteoporosis was induced in female mice by ovariectomy (OVX), as described in Example 8. OVX mice showed a decrease in BMD and BMC of total body. Treatment with RD derivatives (I.M., 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) or alendronate (p.o., 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) for 2 weeks inhibited the loss of BMD and BMC (Table 6). The blood concentration of the C-terminal telopeptide of collagen can reflect the osteoclastic activity. As shown in Table 6, RD derivatives or alendronate also inhibited ovariectomy-induced increase in osteoclast activity (Table 6). It appeared that some of the RD derivatives were much more effective than alendronate. In addition, treatment with RD (I.M., 1.5 mg/kg) once per week for 2 weeks also inhibited the loss of BMD and BMC (Table 6). These data indicate that RD and its derivatives may inhibit osteoporosis at longer dosing intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of OVX-induced bone loss by RD and its derivatives in mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nC-terminal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ntelopeptide of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCOL(1)α1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nchain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBMD (g/cm\n2\n)\n\n\nBMC (g)\n\n\n(ng/ml)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Alternate day)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSham\n\n\n0.095 ± 0.001\n\n\n0.649 ± 0.011\n\n\n395 ± 11.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX\n\n\n0.075 ± 0.002*\n\n\n0.517 ± 0.007*\n\n\n686 ± 12.1*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + RD\n\n\n0.091 ± 0.001§\n\n\n0.627 ± 0.008§\n\n\n391 ± 8.3§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + PGP\n\n\n0.092 ± 0.001§\n\n\n0.621 ± 0.006§\n\n\n372 ± 24.2§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + ARGDDL\n\n\n0.093 ± 0.001§\n\n\n0.624 ± 0.007§\n\n\n389 ± 16.4§\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 32)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + RID\n\n\n0.091 ± 0.001§\n\n\n0.622 ± 0.004§\n\n\n391 ± 12§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + Rhodostomin\n\n\n0.090 ± 0.001§\n\n\n0.619 ± 0.006§\n\n\n397 ± 13.6§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + PRLDDL\n\n\n0.091 ± 0.002§\n\n\n0.563 ± 0.056§\n\n\n410 ± 25.1§\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 37)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + Alendronate\n\n\n0.086 ± 0.002§\n\n\n0.607 ± 0.051§\n\n\n504 ± 19.6§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + pegylated-RD\n\n\n0.092 ± 0.002§\n\n\n0.629 ± 0.008§\n\n\n398 ± 9.2§\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Once/week)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + RD\n\n\n0.085 ± 0.002§\n\n\n0.582 ± 0.009§\n\n\n533 ± 27.4§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + pegylated-RD\n\n\n0.087 ± 0.005§\n\n\n0.595 ± 0.009§\n\n\n538 ± 19.8§\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues are means ± SE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Compared with Sham-group, p < 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§Compared with OVX-group, p < 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 13\n\n\nInhibition of Ovariectomy-induced Bone Loss by PGP and RD Derivatives in Rats\n\n\nPGP (a RD derivative) was chosen to examine in more detail the protection from ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss in rats. Adult female rats (3 month-old) were ovariectomized, as in Example 8, and bone volumes measured 6 weeks after the ovariectomy, as in Examples 9-11. It was shown that PGP protein inhibited both ovariectomy-induced bone volume decrease and osteoclast number increase.\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 2A\n, compared to the sham-operated rats (Sham), ovariectomy (OVX) caused a significant loss of the trabecular bone. However, treatment with PGP (IV, 0.3 mg/kg/day or IM, 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) significantly inhibited the ovariectomy-induced loss of the trabecular bone in secondary spongiosa.\n\n\nIn \nFIG. 2B\n, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining showed that osteoclasts were predominantly localized around the trabecular bone, and that PGP inhibited the OVX-induced increase in osteoclast formation.\n\n\nOVX rats also showed an increase in body weight at the end of the experiment. Treatment with PGP (I.V., 0.3 mg/kg/day or I.M., 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) significantly inhibited the OVX-induced increase in body weight.\n\n\nRats also showed a decrease in wet weight, BMD and BMC in both femur and \ntibia\n 6 weeks after the ovariectomy (Table 7). Treatment with PGP (either I.V. or I.M.) inhibited the reduction in wet weight, BMD and BMC of both tibia and femur in OVX rats. Histomorphometry demonstrated that ovariectomy caused the loss of trabecular bone in secondary spongiosa (\nFIG. 2\n). Treatment with PGP markedly reversed the loss of bone volume (\nFIG. 2\n and Table 7). In addition, TRAP staining demonstrated that osteoclasts were predominantly localized around the trabecular bone and OVX increased the osteoclast number. A long-term administration of PGP antagonized the OVX-induced osteoclastic formation (\nFIG. 2\n and Table 7). The serum level of the C-terminal telopeptide of collagen reflects osteoclast activity. It was found that the value was markedly increased in the OVX-group compared with that of the Sham-group, whereas treatment with PGP effectively antagonized the OVX-induced increase in osteoclast activity (Table 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of Ovariectomy-induced Bone Loss by PGP Protein in Rats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOVX + PGP (IV)\n\n\nOVX + PGP (IM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSham (n = 22)\n\n\nOVX (n = 22)\n\n\n(n = 13)\n\n\n(n = 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone length, mm\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n 4.04 ± 0.01\n\n\n 4.04 ± 0.01\n\n\n 4.05 ± 0.01\n\n\n 4.04 ± 0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n 3.62 ± 0.01\n\n\n 3.62 ± 0.02\n\n\n 3.60 ± 0.02\n\n\n 3.64 ± 0.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWet weight, mg\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n755.5 ± 6.3\n\n\n647.5 ± 8.5*\n\n\n735.8 ± 8.5§\n\n\n740.6 ± 8.7§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n946.0 ± 10.9\n\n\n  850 ± 9.9*\n\n\n904.9 ± 10.2§\n\n\n904.0 ± 13.5§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMD, g/cm\n2\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n0.108 ± 0.002\n\n\n0.099 ± 0.015*\n\n\n0.109 ± 0.002§\n\n\n0.111 ± 0.002§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n0.131 ± 0.012\n\n\n0.126 ± 0.003*\n\n\n0.130 ± 0.002§\n\n\n0.136 ± 0.002§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMC, g\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n0.301 ± 0.011\n\n\n0.269 ± 0.011*\n\n\n0.286 ± 0.010§\n\n\n0.316 ± 0.009§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n0.420 ± 0.005\n\n\n0.369 ± 0.011*\n\n\n0.422 ± 0.013§\n\n\n0.437 ± 0.009§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone volume, %\n\n\n 18.1 ± 1.5\n\n\n 9.4 ± 1.5*\n\n\n 14.3 ± 1.5§\n\n\n 16.8 ± 1.8§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN.Oc/BS (No/mm)\n\n\n 1.77 ± 0.09\n\n\n 2.06 ± 0.17*\n\n\n 1.83 ± 0.10§\n\n\n 1.81 ± 0.09§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-terminal\n\n\n  230 ± 5.1\n\n\n  459 ± 18.4*\n\n\n  259 ± 22.8§\n\n\n  221 ± 15.1§\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntelopeptide of\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncollagen (n = 5 for\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\neach)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nALP, alkaline phosphatase;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN.Oc/BS, osteoclast number/mm bone surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues are means ± SE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Compared with Sham-group, p < 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§Compared with OVX-group OVX, p < 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA three-point bending test was performed in the femur to examine the mechanical activity of the bone.

Compared with sham-operated rats (Sham), ovariectomy (OVX) caused a significant increase in the osteoclast activity. Measurement of the serum level of the C-terminal telopeptide of COL(1)α1 chain showed an increase in the osteoclast activity in OVX rats. The C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen increased from a basal level of 361±25.6 (n=15) to 708±50.7 ng/ml (n=15) 28 days after the ovariectomy.\n\n\nRD or alendronate was then post-treated one month after the ovariectomy. The post-treatment with RD (I.M., 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) or alendronate (p.o., 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) reversed the ovariectomy-induced increase in osteoclast activity, and RD was much more effective than alendronate (\nFIG. 3\n). Osteoclast activity recovered after the withdrawal of the RD or alendronate treatment. The recovery of osteoclast activity was much faster in the alendronate-treated group than the RD-treated group. However, re-application of RD effectively inhibited the ovariectomy-induced increase in osteoclast activity. The value of the osteoclast in response to the RD treatment was much lower than that in response to the alendronate treatment (\nFIG. 3\n). These results indicate that RD-related proteins have therapeutic effects on the bone loss caused by ovariectomy-induced osteoclastic activation.\n\n\nAfter the second drug treatment period, rats were sacrificed, and BMD and BMC of the tibia and femur were measured. As shown in Table 9, posttreatment of RD effectively reversed the bone loss effect of ovariectomy. With regard to the preservation of the bone volume, RD was more effective than alendronate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-treatment of RD inhibits OVX-induced bone loss in rats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSham\n\n\nOVX\n\n\nRD\n\n\nAlendronate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone length, mm\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n 4.04 ± 0.03\n\n\n 4.05 ± 0.03\n\n\n 4.01 ± 0.03\n\n\n 4.02 ± 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n 3.69 ± 0.03\n\n\n 3.68 ± 0.02\n\n\n 3.71 ± 0.06\n\n\n 3.68 ± 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWet weight, mg\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n 766.6 ± 19.9\n\n\n  661 ± 18.2*\n\n\n  749 ± 20.1§\n\n\n712.1 ± 10.1§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n1002.6 ± 17.4\n\n\n  861 ± 10.7*\n\n\n985.3 ± 9.8§\n\n\n912.4 ± 10.9§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMD, g/cm\n2\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n 0.114 ± 0.003\n\n\n0.101 ± 0.002*\n\n\n0.113 ± 0.009§\n\n\n0.108 ± 0.002§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n 0.137 ± 0.002\n\n\n0.121 ± 0.002*\n\n\n0.135 ± 0.004§\n\n\n0.131 ± 0.003§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMC, g\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n 0.315 ± 0.013\n\n\n0.272 ± 0.006*\n\n\n0.299 ± 0.011§\n\n\n0.289 ± 0.009§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n 0.442 ± 0.012\n\n\n0.391 ± 0.008*\n\n\n0.441 ± 0.018§\n\n\n0.401 ± 0.017§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone volume, %\n\n\n 18.1 ± 1.2\n\n\n 7.9 ± 2.1*\n\n\n 16.3 ± 2.7§\n\n\n 12.1 ± 1.3§\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMD is the abbreviation of bone mineral density;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMC is the abbreviation of bone mineral content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues are means ± SD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Compared with Sham-group, P < 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§Compared with OVX-group OVX, P < 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRD: I.M. injection (1.5/mg/kg/alternate day)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlendronate: p.o.

Surgery involved anterior cruciate ligation transaction and partial medial meniscectomy. After the surgery, RD protein was administered via intramuscular route (1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) or local joint injection (once/week) until the last day when the rats were sacrificed 6 weeks after the surgery. Each joint was embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned and stained with 0.1% safranin-O and haematoxylin. As shown in \nFIG. 4B\n, the chondrocyte layer in the right knee joint was damaged by arthritis and RD in either intramuscular injection (\nFIG. 4D\n) or local application (\nFIG. 4C\n) inhibited the chondrocyte layer destruction.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 16\n\n\nInhibition of Blood Cytokine Elevation by RD in Osteoarthritis Rat\n\n\nOsteoarthritis rats were generated by surgery as described above. Six weeks after surgery, serum was obtained to measure the blood level of cytokines. As shown in \nFIGS. 5A-5C\n, the serum levels of cytokines, such as c-reactive protein, IL-1β and IL-6, increased in osteoarthritic rats, and RD administration markedly inhibited the osteoarthritis-induced elevation of cytokines.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 17\n\n\nInhibition of Blood Cytokine Elevation by RD in Osteoarthritis Mice\n\n\nOsteoarthritis mice were generated by surgery as described above. Six weeks after the surgery, the serum was obtained to measure the level of cytokines. As shown in \nFIG. 6A-6C\n, the serum levels of cytokines, such as c-reactive protein, IL-1□ ? and IL-6, increased in osteoarthritic mice, and RD administration markedly inhibited the osteoarthritis-induced elevation of cytokines.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 18\n\n\nIntra-tibia Injection of Prostate or Breast Cancer Cells in Mice\n\n\nSevere Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) male mice or BALB/c-nu/nu male mice weighing 20-22 g (6 weeks old) bred in an animal isolator (IVC racks) under a specific pathogen-free (SPF) condition at 22±2° C were used. Human prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 cells or human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (1×10\n6 \ncells in 15 ml sterile PBS) were injected into the bone marrow of both the left and right tibia of the SCID mice or nude mice on day-1, respectively. On day-11, the animals were randomly assigned into three groups and the administration of test substances was initiated. RD (1.5 mg/kg) was administered by intramuscular (IM) injection and alendronate (1.5 mg/kg) was given by subcutaneous (SC) injection, once daily for a total of 15 doses (5 days on, 2 days off for 3 weeks). The body weight and tumor growth condition were observed and recorded every week during the experimental period. After one month, the mice were sacrificed and the weight of the hind legs was measured. The weight of the control leg was subtracted to reflect the relative tumor weight. In addition, blood samples were collected at the end of the experiment for the blood count of red blood cells (RBC), white blood cell (WBC) and platelet, and for the measurement of the C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX) and serum calcium concentration.\n\n\nIn order to determine bone osteolysis, radiographs were taken by a soft X-ray generating unit (Young-kid Enterprise Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan). Animals were deeply anesthetized with trichloroacetaldehyde monohydrate, laid down in a prone position on a Kodak Scientific Imaging film (13×18 cm), and X-ray exposure was performed at 45 kV for 5 seconds. The degree of osteolysis was measured using image analysis software (Image-pro plus 3.0).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 19\n\n\nInhibition of Tumor Growth in Bone and Hypercalcemia\n\n\nThe tumor cell growth in bone is related to the bone resorption activity. The effect of RD protein on the tumor growth of prostate cancer cells in bone was thus examined. PC-3 cells (1×10\n6\n) were locally injected into the bone marrow cavities of both tibia in SCID mice. RD or alendronate was administered 10 days after the implantation of tumor cells. RD at 1.5 mg/kg was given by the intramuscular (IM) route while alendronate was given at 1.5 mg/kg by the subcutaneous (SC) injection, once daily for a total of 15 doses (5 days on, 2 days off for 3 weeks). The swelling of hind legs was calculated to reflect the tumor growth on day 33. The body weight was measured throughout the experimental period. The results indicated that RD at 1.5 mg/kg caused a significant inhibition in tumor cell-induced swelling in hind legs on day-33 (43.8±4.1%, n=21-22) (\nFIG. 7\n). However, the subcutaneous administration of alendronate at 1.5 mg/kg did not inhibit the tumor growth in legs (\nFIG. 7\n).\n\n\n \nFIG. 8\n shows the effect of RD on the decrease in body weight in response to the tumor growth in SCID mice. Untreated control mice showed a decrease in body weight at the end of the experiment. Treatment with RD prevented the loss of body weight caused by the tumor growth. Alendronate was used as a positive control.\n\n\n \nFIG. 9\n shows the inhibition of tumor growth and osteolytic bone lesion by RD in SCID mice. In order to determine bone osteolysis, radiographs were taken by a soft X-ray generating unit. In \nFIG. 9A\n, photographs were taken 33 days after the intratibial injection of PC-3 cells. A visible spherical tumor grew up from the proximal tibia. Treatment with RD (I.M., 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) inhibited tumor growth. In FIG. \n9\nB, radiographs taken on day-33 revealed that osteolytic lesions appeared in the cancer cell-injected tibia and treatment of RD inhibited osteolysis. \nFIG. 9C\n shows the quantitation of the data. \nFIG. 9D\n shows that RD inhibited a tumor-induced increase in C-terminal telopeptides of type-collagen (a marker for the osteoclast activity) using an ELISA method. \nFIG. 9E\n demonstrates that RD and alendronate (1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) also inhibited a tumor-induced increase in the serum calcium concentration (i.e., hypercalcemia). *: p<0.05, as compared with control. #: p<0.05, as compared with the PC-3-injected group.\n\n\nBreast cancer has a strong predilection for metastasizing to bone. \nFIG. 10\n shows an inhibition of tumor growth by RD in nude mice. Human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 (1×10\n6\n) were locally injected into the bone marrow cavities of both tibia in nude mice. RD (I.M., 1 mg/kg/day) was administered 10 days after the implantation of tumor cells for a total of 14 days. Treatment with RD (IM, 1.5 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks inhibited MDA-MB-231 -induced increase in tumor growth in bone (\nFIG. 10A\n). Furthermore, RD also prevented the tumor-induced increase in osteoclast activity (\nFIG. 10B\n) and hypercalcemia (\nFIG. 10C\n), but did not affect the blood counts of RBC, WBC and platelet (\nFIGS. 10D-10F\n). *: p<0.05, as compared with the control. #: p<0.05, as compared with the MDA-MB-231-injected group.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 20\n\n\nPegylation of RD Protein\n\n\nA pegylated product or a conjugation with albumin can prolong the duration and decrease the antigenecity of a protein drug. In order to minimize the antigenecity and prolong the duration of RD protein, pegylated RD protein was prepared as follows: RD protein (4 mg) in 20 mM NaCNBH\n3 \nat pH 5 was reacted with 5 mM PEGk5-propionaldehyde (O-Methyl-O′-[2-(6-oxocaproylamino)ethyl]polyethylene glycol 5,000)(Sigma) at 4° C for 12 h. The pegylated RD protein was purified by reverse phase C18 HPLC. The final yield of pegylated RD protein after purification was greater than 60%.\n\n\nAs shown in Table 6, pegylated-RD inhibited the differentiation of osteoclasts. In addition, treatment with pegylated-RD (I.M., 1.5 mg/kg, once/week) for 2 weeks inhibited the loss of BMD and BMC (Table 6). These data indicate that pegylated-RD did not lose its activity in vivo.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21\n\n\nMATRIGEL™ Plug Antiangiogenesis Assays\n\n\nIt has been reported that integrin αvβ3 is related to angiogenesis. Whether RD protein can inhibit angiogenesis was thus investigated using MATRIGEL™ plug angiogenesis assays as described previously with minor modifications [32]. Briefly, an aliquot (500 μl) of MATRIGEL™ (Becton Dickinson Lab.) containing 200 ng/ml VEGF was injected subcutaneously into the dorsal region of 6-8 week-old C57BL/6 mice. The MATRIGEL™ formed a plug rapidly. RD was administered intramuscularly (3 mg/kg) daily (RD/1d) or the other day (RD/2d or HSA-RD) before sacrifice. After 8 days, plugs were taken and photographed (\nFIG. 11A\n). Neovessels were quantified by measuring the hemoglobin of the plugs as an indication of blood vessel formation with the Drabkin method and Drabkin reagent kit 525 (Sigma) (\nFIG. 11B\n). As shown in \nFIGS. 11A and 11B\n, RD protein was effective in inhibiting angiogenesis using MATRIGEL™ plug assays. *: P<0.05 versus control group.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 22\n\n\nRadioligand-Binding Assay: Specificity of RD-related Proteins\n\n\nTo determine whether RD and its derivative PGP bind to other receptors besides αvβ3 integrin, RD and its derivative PGP were used to analyze the target specificity toward receptors whose ligands are proteins (assayed by MDS Pharma services, Taipei, Taiwan).\n\n\nAs shown in Table 10, RD and PGP did not affect the binding activity of calcitonin, endothelin ETA, endothelin ETB, insulin, leptin, sodium channel, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to their respective receptors. This indicates that RD-related proteins exert selective binding activity toward target protein αvβ3 in vivo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe binding assay of RD and PGP protein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInhibition\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTarget\n\n\n \nRD\n \n \nPGP\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCalcitonin\n \n \n \n \n\n\n4%\n\n\n−6\n%\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nEndothelin ET\n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\n \n\n\n26%\n\n\n−3\n%\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nEndothelin ET\n \n \n \n \n \n \nB\n \n\n\n10%\n\n\n−7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInsulin\n\n\n−6%\n\n\n−8\n%\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nLeptin\n \n \n \n \n\n\n1%\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSodium Channel (Site 2)\n\n\n2%\n\n\n−14%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTGF-\nβ\n \n\n\n14%\n\n\n−10\n%\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nTNF\n \n \n \n \n\n\n4%\n\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVEGF\n\n\n−14%\n\n\n19%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTGF-β: transforming growth factor-β\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTNF: tumor necrosis factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 23\n\n\nInhibition of Angiogenesis by RD in a Mouse Model of Retinopathy of Prematurity\n\n\nAn animal model for retinopathy of prematurity in mice was generated by using hypoxic-induced angiogenesis as described in Wilkinson-Berka et al. [28]. Briefly, seven-day-old pups and their mother were housed in sealed chambers containing 75% O\n2 \nand air. Mice remained in the chamber for five days (hyperoxic period, P7 to P12) and were then housed in room air for a further seven days (hypoxic-induced angiogenic period, postnatal 12 days to postnatal 19 days, or P12 to P19). RD (2 μg) was administered via an intravitreous route on day-12 and the mice were sacrificed on day-19.\n\n\nThree sections from one of the eyes of each animal were made, deparaffinized, and stained with hematxylin and eosin. Blood vessel profiles (BVPs) were counted in the inner retina, and included vessels adherent to the inner limiting membrane. Counting was performed on a photomicroscope (Leica) at a magnification of 100×.\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 12A\n, RD protein inhibited angiogenesis in a mouse model of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). \nFIG. 12B\n shows reduced BVPs in a mouse model of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) treated with RD protein. Angiogenesis was quantitated by counting blood vessel profiles (BVPs) in the inner retina and extending into the vitreous cavity from three hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections. The ROP group treated with RD (2 μg) (i.e., ROP+RD) reduced about 46% of angiogenesis compared to the ROP group treated with vehicle (ROP). (n=7 for each ROP group; n=2 for sham group.) Data are presented as Mean±SE. #: p<0.01, as compared to the sham group. **: p<0.001, as compared to the ROP group.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 24\n\n\nInhibition of Ovariectomy-induced Osteoporosis by Albumin-conjugated RD\n\n\nThe effect of albumin-conjugated RD on osteoporosis was examined in ovariectomized female mice. Human serum albumin-conjugated RD (i.e., RD-albumin) was administered as indicated by arrows shown in \nFIGS. 13A and 13B\n. The data for RD was incorporated into \nFIGS. 13A-13D\n for comparison. Serum levels of the c-terminal peptide of type I collagen and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured as indicators of osteoclast and osteoblast activity, respectively. The BMD and BMC were also measured every 2 weeks, as shown in \nFIGS. 13C and 13D\n. Treatment of RD-albumin (15 mg/kg/week) markedly reduced osteoclast, but increased ALP, activities in a reversible manner.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 25\n\n\nInhibition of Rheumatoid Arthritis by RD\n\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology characterized by invasive synovial hyperplasia that leads to progressive joint destruction. Osteoclasts, derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage, play a crucial role in sdbchondral bone destructions in rheumatoid arthritis. Radiographic studies have shown that in rheumatoid arthritis, osteopenia of the subchondral bone and bone erosion begin at an early stage of the disease, and are gradually exacerbated [29]. Bone-resorbing osteoclasts are observed at the erosive synovium/bone interface [30]. A recent review discusses the role of osteoclasts in rheumatoid arthritis [31]. Therefore, RD-related proteins, which markedly inhibit osteoclast functions, may be useful for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nLewis rats are given intradermal/subcutaneous (SC) injections of bovine type II collagen (2 mg/ml in Freund's incomplete adjuvant). As rats develop the rheumatoid disease, they are randomly divided into several study groups. Treatment is initiated on the first day when the clinical signs of arthritis are clearly visible, as evidenced, for example, by ankle joint swelling. After measuring the paw volume, rats are sacrificed, and ankle and knee joints are collected for the examination of histopathological change.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 14A-D\n show amino acid sequences of Rho and its variants, SEQ ID NOs: 1, and 57-69, respectively. \nFIGS. 15A-C\n show nucleotide sequences of rhodostomin variants, SEQ ID NOs: 43-56. \nFIGS. 16A-H\n show amino acid and nucleotide sequences of disintegrin variants, SEQ ID NOs: 78-135.\n\n\nThe foregoing description of the exemplary embodiments of the invention has been presented only for the purposes of illustration and description and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching.\n\n\nOther embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims.\n\n\nLIST OF REFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[1] van't Hof R J, Ralston S H.

These definitions apply to the terms as they are used throughout this specification, unless otherwise limited in specific instances, either individually or as part of a larger group.\n\n\nThe term “alkyl” or “lower alkyl” refers to straight or branched chain hydrocarbon groups of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 7 carbon atoms. The expression “lower alkyl” refers to unsubstituted or substituted alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. When a subscript is used with reference to an alkyl or other group, the subscript refers to the number of carbon atoms that the group may contain. For example, the term “C\n0-4\nalkyl” includes a bond and alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms.\n\n\nThe alkyl group may be optionally substituted by one to four substituents selected from halogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, keto (═O), alkanoyl, aryloxy, alkanoyloxy, NR\na\nR\nb\n, alkanoylamino, aroylamino, aralkanoylamino, alkanoylamino, arylamino, substituted aralkanoylamino, thiol, alkylthio, arylthio, aralkylthio, alkylthiono, arylthiono, aralkylthiono, alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, aralkylsulfonyl, —SO\n2\nNR\na\nR\nb\n, nitro, cyano, —CO\n2\nH, —CONR\na\nR\nb\n, alkoxycarbonyl, aryl, guanidino and heteroaryls or heterocyclos (such as indolyl, imidazolyl, furyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, pyrrolidyl, pyridyl, pyrimidyl and the like), wherein R\na \nand R\nb \nare selected from hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, heterocyclo, and heterocycloalkyl. The substituent on the alkyl optionally in turn may be further substituted, in which case it will be with substituted one or more of C\n1-4\nalkyl, C\n2-4\nalkenyl, halogen, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, cyano, nitro, amino, C\n1-4\nalkylamino, aminoC\n1-4\nalkyl, hydroxy, hydroxyC\n1-4\nalkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, phenyl, benzyl, phenyloxy, and/or benzyloxy.\n\n\nThe term “alkenyl” refers to straight or branched chain substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon groups of 2 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 15 carbon atoms, and most preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms, having at least one double bond, and depending on the number of carbon atoms, up to four double bonds.\n\n\nThe alkenyl group may be optionally substituted by one to two substituents selected from those recited above for substituted alkyl groups.\n\n\nThe term “alkynyl” refers to straight or branched chain substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon groups of 2 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 15 carbon atoms, and most preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms, having at least one triple bond, and depending on the number of carbon atoms, up to four triple bonds.\n\n\nThe alkynyl group may be optionally substituted by one to two substituents selected from those recited above for alkyl groups.\n\n\nWhen the term alkyl is used in connection with another group, as in heterocycloalkyl or cycloalkylalkyl, this means the identified (first named) group is bonded directly through an alkyl group which may be branched or straight chain (e.g., cyclopropylC\n1-4\nalkyl means a cyclopropyl group bonded through a straight or branched chain alkyl group having one to four carbon atoms.).

In general, the time taken to complete a reaction procedure will be judged by the person performing the procedure, preferably with the aid of information obtained by monitoring the reaction by methods such as HPLC or TLC. A reaction does not have to go to completion to be useful to this invention. The preparation of heterocycles useful to this invention are described in the series of books: Katritzky, A. R. et al., eds., \nComprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry. The Structure, Reactions, Synthesis and Uses, of Heterocyclic Compounds\n, Pergamon Press, New York, First Edition (1984), and Katritzky, A.

Larock, \nComprehensive Organic Transformations. A Guide to Functional Group Preparation\n, pp. 385-439, VCH Publishers, Inc. (1989).\n\n\nGeneral methods for the synthesis of compounds useful for this invention are outlined in the following schemes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound 1 can be prepared according to U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,758. As depicted in Scheme 1, compound 2 is prepared from compound 1 by reacting with a cyanide reagent, such as copper cyanide, in a suitable solvent such as NMP. Reduction of 2 in the presence of a suitable reducing agent such as NaBH\n4 \nin a suitable solvent such as ethanol affords alcohol 3. Conversion of alcohol 3 to amine 4 is undertaken by reaction of 3 with DPPA in the presence of a suitable base such as DBU in a solvent such as toluene followed by reduction of the intermediate azide with a reducing reagent such as PPh\n3 \nin a solvent such as acetonitrile. Finally, the racemic amine 4 can be resolved by chiral HPLC methods to afford the optically pure enantiomers 4R and 4S.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that the R\n1 \nCN moiety in compounds 2 to 4 may be replaced with any of the R\n1 \nmoieties included in the definition of R\n1 \nand such compounds may be prepared employing procedures as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,758.\n\n\nAs illustrated in Scheme 2, amine 4 (which can be prepared as shown in Scheme 1) is coupled to acid 5 to afford amide 6 using conventional methods known in the art for amide bond formations.

The PDE4 inhibitor useful in this invention may be any compound that is known to inhibit the PDE4 enzyme or which is discovered to act in as PDE4 inhibitor, and which is only or essentially only a PDE4 inhibitor, not compounds which inhibit to a degree of exhibiting a therapeutic effect other members of the PDE family as well as PDE4. There are at least two binding forms on human monocyte recombinant PDE4 (hPDE4) at which inhibitors bind. One explanation for these observations is that hPDE4 exists in two distinct forms. One binds the likes of rolipram and denbufylline with a high affinity while the other binds these compounds with a low affinity. The most suitable PDE4 inhibitors of for use in this invention will be those compounds which have a salutary therapeutic ratio, i.e., compounds which preferentially inhibit cAMP catalytic activity where the enzyme is in the form that binds rolipram with a low affinity, thereby reducing the side effects which apparently are linked to inhibiting the form which binds rolipram with a high affinity. Generally it is most advantageous to use a PDE4 antagonists which has an IC\n50 \nratio of about 0.1 or greater as regards the IC\n50 \nfor the PDE4 catalytic form which binds rolipram with a high affinity divided by the IC\n50 \nfor the form which binds rolipram with a low affinity. Most suitable are those PDE4 inhibitors which have an IC\n50 \nratio of greater than 0.5, and particularly those compounds having a ratio of greater than 1.0. Reference is made to U.S. Pat.

Description\n\n\n\n\nThis application is a Continuation-In-Part of co-pending PCT International Applications No. PCT/JP2004/011312 filed on Jul. 30, 2004, which designated the United States and on which priority is claimed under 35 U.S.C. §120, which claims priority of Provisional Application No. 60/491,534 filed Aug. 1, 2003, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a novel compound having an inhibitory activity against sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT) being present in the intestine or kidney.\n\n\nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\nDiet therapy and exercise therapy are essential in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. When these therapies do not sufficiently control the conditions of patients, insulin or an oral antidiabetic agent is additionally used for the treatment of diabetes. At the present, there have been used as an antidiabetic agent biguanide compounds, sulfonylurea compounds, insulin resistance improving agents and α-glucosidase inhibitors. However, these antidiabetic agents have various side effects. For example, biguanide compounds cause lactic acidosis, sulfonylurea compounds cause significant hypoglycemia, insulin resistance improving agents cause edema and heart failure, and α-glucosidase inhibitors cause abdominal bloating and diarrhea. Under such circumstances, it has been desired to develop novel drugs for treatment of diabetes mellitus having no such side effects.\n\n\nRecently, it has been reported that hyperglycemia participates in the onset and progressive impairment of diabetes mellitus, i.e., glucose toxicity theory. Namely, chronic hyperglycemia leads to decrease of insulin secretion and further to decrease of insulin sensitivity, and as a result, the blood glucose concentration is increased so that diabetes mellitus is self-exacerbated [cf., Diabetologia, vol. 28, p. 119 (1985); Diabetes Care, vol. 13, p. 610 (1990), etc.]. Therefore, by treating hyperglycemia, the aforementioned self-exacerbating cycle is interrupted so that the prophylaxis or treatment of diabetes mellitus is made possible.\n\n\nAs one of the methods for treating hyperglycemia, it is considered to excrete an excess amount of glucose directly into urine so that the blood glucose concentration is normalized. For example, by inhibiting sodium-dependent glucose transporter being present at the proximal convoluted tubule of kidney, the re-absorption of glucose at the kidney is inhibited, by which the excretion of glucose into urine is promoted so that the blood glucose level is decreased. In fact, it is confirmed that by continuous subcutaneous administration of phlorizin having SGLT inhibitory activity to diabetic animal models, hyperglycemia is normalized and the blood glucose level thereof can be kept normal for a long time so that the insulin secretion and insulin resistance are improved [cf., Journal of Clinical Investigation, vol. 79, p. 1510 (1987); ibid., vol. 80, p. 1037 (1987); ibid., vol. 87, p. 561 (1991), etc.].\n\n\nIn addition, by treating diabetic animal models with SGLT inhibitory agents for a long time, insulin secretion response and insulin sensitivity of the animals are improved without incurring any adverse affects on the kidney or imbalance in blood levels of electrolytes, and as a result, the onset and progress of diabetic nephropathy and diabetic neuropathy are prevented [cf., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, vol. 42, p. 5311 (1999); British Journal of Pharmacology, vol. 132, p. 578 (2001), Ueta, Ishihara, Matsumoto, Oku, Nawano, Fujita, Saito, Arakawa, Life Sci., in press (2005), etc.].\n\n\nFrom the above, SGLT inhibitors may be expected to improve insulin secretion and insulin resistance by decreasing the blood glucose level in diabetic patients and further prevent the onset and progress of diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications.\n\n\nWO 01/27128 discloses an aryl C-glycoside compound having the following structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis compound is disclosed to be useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of diabetes mellitus, etc., as an SGLT inhibitor.\n\n\nDISCLOSURE OF INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a compound of the following formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a prodrug thereof:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein Ring A and Ring B are one of the followings: (1) Ring A is an optionally substituted unsaturated monocyclic heterocyclic ring, and Ring B is an optionally substituted unsaturated monocyclic heterocyclic ring, an optionally substituted unsaturated fused heterobicyclic ring, or an optionally substituted benzene ring, (2) Ring A is an optionally substituted benzene ring, and Ring B is an optionally substituted unsaturated monocyclic heterocyclic ring, or an optionally substituted unsaturated fused heterobicyclic ring wherein Y is linked to the heterocyclic ring of the fused heterobicyclic ring, or (3) Ring A is an optionally substituted unsaturated fused heterobicyclic ring, wherein the sugar moiety X— (sugar) and the moiety —Y— (Ring B) are both on the same heterocyclic ring of the fused heterobicyclic ring, and Ring B is an optionally substituted unsaturated monocyclic heterocyclic ring, an optionally substituted unsaturated fused heterobicyclic ring, or an optionally substituted benzene ring;\n\n\n\nX is a carbon atom or a nitrogen atom; and\n\n\nY is —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n— (wherein n is 1 or 2).\n\n\nThe compound of the formula I exhibits an inhibitory activity against sodium-dependent glucose transporter being present in the intestine and the kidney of mammalian species, and is useful in the treatment of diabetes mellitus or diabetic complications such as diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy, obesity, and delayed wound healing.\n\n\nBEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION\n\n\nHereinafter, the present compound (I) is illustrated in more detail.\n\n\nThe definitions for each term used in the description of the present invention are listed below.\n\n\nThe term “halogen atom” or “halo” means chlorine, bromine, fluorine and iodine, and chlorine and fluorine are preferable.\n\n\nThe term “alkyl group” means a straight or branched saturated monovalent hydrocarbon chain having 1 to 12 carbon atoms.

Assay for SGLT2 Inhibition\n\n\nTest Compounds:\n\n\nCompounds described in the above examples were used for the SGLT2 inhibition assay.\n\n\nMethod:\n\n\nCHOK1 cells expressing human SGLT2 were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 400,000 cells/well in F-12 nutrient mixture (Ham's F-12) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 400 μg/ml Geneticin, 50 units/ml sodium penicillin G (Gibco-BRL) and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. After 2 days of culture at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2\n, cells were washed once with the assay buffer (137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 50 mM Hepes, and 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4) and incubated with 250 μl of the buffer containing test compounds for 10 min at 37° C. Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO was 0.5%. The transport reaction was initiated by addition of 50 μl [\n14\nC]-methyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (\n14\nC-AMG) solution (final concentration, 0.5 mM). After incubation for 2 hours at 37° C., the uptake was stopped by aspiration of the incubation mixture, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Then, cells were solubilized with 0.3 N NaOH and aliquots were taken for determination of radioactivity by a liquid scintillation counter. Nonspecific AMG uptake was defined as that which occurred in the presence of 100 μM of phlorizin, a specific inhibitor of sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter. Specific uptake was normalized for the protein concentrations measured by the method of Bradford. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC\n50\n) values were calculated from dose-response curves by least square method.\n\n\nResults:\n\n\nResults are shown in the following table:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTest Compounds (Example No.)\n \nIC50 (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n69\n \n7.9\n \n \n \n70\n \n7.0\n \n \n \n71\n \n6.6\n \n \n \n72\n \n4.6\n \n \n \n78\n \n1.7\n \n \n \n79\n \n9.0\n \n \n \n80\n \n6.8\n \n \n \n83\n \n1.3\n \n \n \n84\n \n2.2\n \n \n \n86\n \n2.8\n \n \n \n87\n \n3.4\n \n \n \n88\n \n2.6\n \n \n \n89\n \n3.0\n \n \n \n90\n \n2.0\n \n \n \n120\n \n3.4\n \n \n \n122\n \n8.2\n \n \n \n123\n \n1.4\n \n \n \n127\n \n1.3\n \n \n \n130\n \n2.4\n \n \n \n140\n \n5.9\n \n \n \n142\n \n5.6\n \n \n \n144\n \n4.1\n \n \n \n145\n \n4.0\n \n \n \n146\n \n2.2\n \n \n \n148\n \n2.8\n \n \n \n151\n \n2.5\n \n \n \n155\n \n1.7\n \n \n \n156\n \n1.1\n \n \n \n168\n \n2.3\n \n \n \n169\n \n3.6\n \n \n \n170\n \n3.5\n \n \n \n173\n \n8.0\n \n \n \n176\n \n7.7\n \n \n \n177\n \n6.7\n \n \n \n178\n \n5.1\n \n \n \n179\n \n9.8\n \n \n \n183\n \n9.5\n \n \n \n185\n \n5.6\n \n \n \n186\n \n5.4\n \n \n \n187\n \n4.3\n \n \n \n188\n \n1.6\n \n \n \n189\n \n2.4\n \n \n \n190\n \n3.1\n \n \n \n191\n \n7.7\n \n \n \n192\n \n7.4\n \n \n \n193\n \n0.9\n \n \n \n194\n \n2.6\n \n \n \n197\n \n2.0\n \n \n \n201\n \n8.2\n \n \n \n202\n \n8.7\n \n \n \n204\n \n1.4\n \n \n \n207\n \n0.6\n \n \n \n208\n \n2.4\n \n \n \n209\n \n3.9\n \n \n \n210\n \n1.0\n \n \n \n211\n \n1.2\n \n \n \n212\n \n2.6\n \n \n \n213\n \n5.6\n \n \n \n214\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n215\n \n4.3\n \n \n \n216\n \n3.3\n \n \n \n217\n \n3.6\n \n \n \n218\n \n2.4\n \n \n \n219\n \n6.7\n \n \n \n221\n \n5.5\n \n \n \n222\n \n1.8\n \n \n \n223\n \n3.1\n \n \n \n224\n \n5.9\n \n \n \n225\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n226\n \n1.2\n \n \n \n227\n \n3.2\n \n \n \n228\n \n3.6\n \n \n \n229\n \n2.7\n \n \n \n230\n \n4.0\n \n \n \n231\n \n3.5\n \n \n \n232\n \n4.0\n \n \n \n233\n \n2.9\n \n \n \n234\n \n2.4\n \n \n \n235\n \n2.6\n \n \n \n236\n \n4.4\n \n \n \n237\n \n2.8\n \n \n \n238\n \n1.6\n \n \n \n240\n \n1.2\n \n \n \n241\n \n1.0\n \n \n \n242\n \n4.6\n \n \n \n244\n \n1.2\n \n \n \n246\n \n6.4\n \n \n \n247\n \n2.5\n \n \n \n248\n \n5.1\n \n \n \n249\n \n4.3\n \n \n \n250\n \n4.2\n \n \n \n251\n \n3.6\n \n \n \n252\n \n1.4\n \n \n \n253\n \n1.6\n \n \n \n254\n \n1.7\n \n \n \n255\n \n6.5\n \n \n \n256\n \n3.1\n \n \n \n257\n \n3.3\n \n \n \n260\n \n2.3\n \n \n \n264\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n265\n \n3.4\n \n \n \n266\n \n3.2\n \n \n \n267\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n268\n \n2.5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2.

Description\n\n\n\n\nPRIORITY TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of European Patent Application No. 07122293.9, filed Dec. 4, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nReceptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer composed principally of α, β and γ subunits.\n\n\nPresently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced. Three types of subunits (α, β and γ) are required for the construction of recombinant GABA A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the α and γ subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, α1β2γ2 mimics many effects of the classical type-I BzR subtypes, whereas α2β2γ2, α3β2γ2 and α5β2γ2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.\n\n\nIt has been shown by McNamara and Skelton in \nPsychobiology, \n21:101-108 that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist β-CCM enhances spatial learning in the Morris watermaze. However, β-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A α5 receptor partial or full inverse agonist which is relatively free of activity at GABA A α1 and/or α2 and/or α3 receptor binding sites can be used to provide a medicament which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A α5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A α1 and/or α2 and/or α3 receptor binding sites but which are functionally selective for α5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A α5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A α1, α2 and α3 receptor binding sites are preferred.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides isoxazolo-pyridazine derivatives having affinity and selectivity for the GABA A α5 receptor binding site, their manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as cognitive enhancers or for the treatment of cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nIn particular, the present invention provides with isoxazolo-pyridazine derivatives of formula I\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1 \nto R\n5 \nand X are as described in claim \n1\n.\n\n\n\nThe most preferred indication in accordance with the present invention is Alzheimer's disease\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe following definitions of the general terms used in the present description apply irrespective of whether the terms in question appear alone or in combination.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “alkyl” denotes a saturated straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbon group containing from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl and the like.

One or two ring heteroatoms are preferred. Preferred are 4 to 6 membered heterocycloalkyl or 5 to 6 membered heterocycloalkyl, each containing one or two ring heteroatoms selected from N, O and S. “Heterocycloalkyl” is hence a subgroup of “heterocyclyl” as defined below.

of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. Compounds of the present invention are ligands for GABA A receptors containing the α5 subunit and are therefore useful in the therapies where cognitive enhancement is required.\n\n\nThe compounds were investigated in accordance with the test given hereinafter:\n\n\nMembrane Preparation and Binding Assay\n\n\nThe affinity of compounds at GABA A receptor subtypes was measured by competition for [3H]flumazenil (85 Ci/mmol; Roche) binding to HEK293 cells expressing rat (stably transfected) or human (transiently transfected) receptors of composition α1β3γ2, α2β3γ2, α3β3γ2 and α5β3γ2.\n\n\nCell pellets were suspended in Krebs-tris buffer (4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 120 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris; pH 7.5; binding assay buffer), homogenized by polytron for ca. 20 sec on ice and centrifuged for 60 min at 4° C. (50000 g; Sorvall, rotor: SM24=20000 rpm). The cell pellets were resuspended in Krebs-tris buffer and homogenized by polytron for ca. 15 sec on ice. Protein was measured (Bradford method, Bio-Rad) and aliquots of 1 mL were prepared and stored at −80° C.\n\n\nRadioligand binding assays were carried out in a volume of 200 μL (96-well plates) which contained 100 μL of cell membranes, [3H]flumazenil at a concentration of 1 nM for α1, α2, α3 subunits and 0.5 nM for α5 subunits and the test compound in the range of 10-10\n−3\n×10\n−6 \nM. Nonspecific binding was defined by 10\n−5 \nM diazepam and typically represented less than 5% of the total binding. Assays were incubated to equilibrium for 1 hour at 4° C. and harvested onto GF/C uni-filters (Packard) by filtration using a Packard harvester and washing with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris; pH 7.5). After drying, filter-retained radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Ki values were calculated using Excel-Fit (Microsoft) and are the means of two determinations.\n\n\nThe compounds of the accompanying examples were tested in the above described assay, and the preferred compounds were found to possess a Ki value for displacement of [3H]flumazenil from α5 subunits of the rat GABA A receptor of 100 nM or less. Most preferred are compounds with a Ki (nM)<35. In a preferred embodiment the compounds of the invention are binding selective for the α5 subunit relative to the α1, α2 and α3 subunit.\n\n\nRepresentative test results are shown in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nhKi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEx.\n\n\n[nM]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n9.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n7.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n5.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n5.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n12.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n7.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n5.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n10.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n8.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n13.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n6.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n5.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n8.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n36\n\n\n9.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n37\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n8.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n42\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n49\n\n\n9.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n6.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n52\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n8.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n57\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n58\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n59\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n62\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n63\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n66\n\n\n11.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n86\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n91\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n92\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n93\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n94\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n95\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n96\n\n\n25.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n97\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n98\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n99\n\n\n18.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n101\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n102\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n103\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n104\n\n\n27.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n105\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n106\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n107\n\n\n23.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n108\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n109\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n110\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n111\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n112\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n113\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n114\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n115\n\n\n14.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n118\n\n\n28.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n119\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n121\n\n\n27.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n122\n\n\n34.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n124\n\n\n31.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the invention, for example, compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragées, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The pharmaceutical compositions also can be in the form of suppositories or injectable solutions.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, in addition to one or more compounds of the invention, contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc. can be used as such excipients e.g. for tablets, dragées and hard gelatin capsules. Suitable excipients for soft gelatin capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semisolid and liquid polyols etc. Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are e.g. water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose etc. Suitable excipients for injection solutions are e.g. water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils etc. Suitable excipients for suppositories are e.g. natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols etc.\n\n\nMoreover, the pharmaceutical compositions can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides a method for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Such process comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I and/or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.\n\n\nThe dosage at which compounds of the invention can be administered can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily dosage of about 0.1 to 1000 mg per person of a compound of general formula I should be appropriate, although the above upper limit can also be exceeded when necessary.\n\n\nThe following examples illustrate the present invention without limiting it.
