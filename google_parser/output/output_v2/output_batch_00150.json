Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to compounds including a peptide therapeutic bound to a peptide vector and uses thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides, such as peptide hormones, have found a variety of therapeutic uses. One of the challenges in treatment of patients using peptides is to ensure delivery of peptides to the desired tissue. In particular, delivery to brain tissues is often reduced or prevented by the blood-brain barrier (BBB).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the development of a new therapy for brain pathologies, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is considered a major obstacle for the potential use of drugs for treating disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). The global market for CNS drugs was $68 billion in 2006, which was roughly half that of global market for cardiovascular drugs, even though in the United States, nearly twice as many people suffer from CNS disorders as from cardiovascular diseases. The reason for this imbalance is, in part, that more than 98% of all potential CNS drugs do not cross the BBB. In addition, more than 99% of worldwide CNS drug development is devoted solely to CNS drug discovery, and less than 1% is directed to CNS drug delivery. This may explain the lack of therapeutic options available for major neurological diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe brain is shielded against potentially toxic substances by the presence of two barrier systems: the BBB and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). The BBB is considered to be the major route for the uptake of serum ligands since its surface area is approximately 5000-fold greater than that of BCSFB. The brain endothelium, which constitutes the BBB, represents the major obstacle for the use of potential drugs against many disorders of the CNS. As a general rule, only small lipophilic molecules may pass across the BBB, i.e., from circulating systemic blood to brain. Many drugs that have a larger size or higher hydrophobicity show high efficacy in CNS targets but are not efficacious in animals as these drugs cannot effectively cross the BBB. Thus, peptide and protein therapeutics are generally excluded from transport from blood to brain, owing to the negligible permeability of the brain capillary endothelial wall to these drugs. Brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) are closely sealed by tight junctions, possess few fenestrae and few endocytic vesicles as compared to capillaries of other organs. BCECs are surrounded by extracellular matrix, astrocytes, pericytes, and microglial cells. The close association of endothelial cells with the astrocyte foot processes and the basement membrane of capillaries are important for the development and maintenance of the BBB properties that permit tight control of blood-brain exchange.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, there exists a need for improved delivery of peptide therapeutics to tissues, including tissues protected by the BBB.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nWe have developed compounds that include (a) a peptide such as a peptide therapeutic (e.g., any peptide therapeutic described herein) and (b) a peptide vector. These compounds are useful in treating any disorder where increased transport of the peptide therapeutic across the BBB or into particular cell types is desired. In one particular example, the compound includes a GLP-1 agonist as a peptide therapeutic, which may be used to treat metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. The peptide vector is capable of transporting the peptide therapeutic either across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or into a particular cell type (e.g., liver, lung, kidney, spleen, and muscle). Surprisingly, we have shown that lower doses of exemplary peptide therapeutics, exendin-4 analogs, when conjugated to a peptide vectors as described herein, are effective in treating glycemia. Because the conjugates are targeted across the BBB or to particular cell types, therapeutic efficacy can be achieved using lower doses or less frequent dosing as compared to unconjugated peptide therapeutics, thus reducing the severity of or incidence of side effects and/or increasing efficacy. The compound may also exhibit increased stability, improved pharmacokinetics, or reduced degradation in vivo, as compared to the unconjugated peptide therapeutic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in a first aspect the invention features a compound having the formula:\n\n\n \n \n \nA-X-B\n\n\n \n \nwhere A is a peptide vector capable of being transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or into a particular cell type (e.g., liver, lung, kidney, spleen, and muscle), X is a linker, and B is a peptide therapeutic (e.g., a peptide therapeutic described herein). The transport across the BBB or into the cell may be increased by at least 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 200%, 500%, 750%, 1000%, 1500%, 2000%, 5000%, or 10,000%. The compound may be substantially pure. The compound may be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (e.g., any described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention features methods of making the compound A-X-B. In one embodiment, the method includes conjugating the peptide vector (A) to a linker (X), and conjugating the peptide vector-linker (A-X) to a peptide therapeutic (B), thereby forming the compound A-X-B. In another embodiment, the method includes conjugating the peptide therapeutic (B) to a linker (X), and conjugating the peptide therapeutic/linker (X-B) to a peptide vector (A), thereby forming the compound A-X-B. In another embodiment, the method includes conjugating the peptide vector (A) to a peptide therapeutic (B), where either A or B optionally include a linker (X), to form the compound A-X-B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention features a nucleic acid molecule that encodes the compound A-X-B, where the compound is a polypeptide. The nucleic acid molecule may be operably linked to a promoter and may be part of a nucleic acid vector. The vector may be in a cell, such as a prokaryotic cell (e.g., bacterial cell) or eukaryotic cell (e.g., yeast or mammalian cell, such as a human cell).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention features methods of making a compound of the formula A-X-B, where A-X-B is a polypeptide. In one embodiment, the method includes expressing a nucleic acid vector of the previous aspect in a cell to produce the polypeptide; and purifying the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention features a method of treating (e.g., prophylactically) a subject having a metabolic disorder.

The method includes administering a compound of the first aspect of the invention (e.g., where the peptide therapeutic that reduces food intake) to a subject in an amount sufficient to reduce food intake or reduce body weight. The subject may be overweight, obese, or bulimic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention features a method of treating (e.g., prophylactically) a disorder selected from the group consisting of anxiety, movement disorder, aggression, psychosis, seizures, panic attacks, hysteria, sleep disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The method includes administering a compound of the first aspect of the invention to a subject in an amount sufficient to treat or prevent the disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also features a method of increasing neurogenesis in a subject. The method includes administering a compound of the first aspect to a subject. The subject may desire, or may be in need of neurogenesis. In certain embodiments, the subject may be suffering from a disease or disorder of the central nervous system such as Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, ALS, stroke, ADD, and neuropsychiatric syndromes. In other embodiments, the increase in neurogenesis can improve learning or enhance neuroprotection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention features a method for converting liver stem/progenitor cells into functional pancreatic cells; preventing beta-cell deterioration and stimulation of β-cell proliferation; treating obesity; suppressing appetite and inducing satiety; treating irritable bowel syndrome; reducing the morbidity and/or mortality associated with myocardial infarction and stroke; treating acute coronary syndrome characterized by an absence of Q-wave myocardial infarction; attenuating post-surgical catabolic changes; treating hibernating myocardium or diabetic cardiomyopathy; suppressing plasma blood levels of norepinepherine; increasing urinary sodium excretion, decreasing urinary potassium concentration; treating conditions or disorders associated with toxic hypervolemia, e.g., renal failure, congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, pulmonary edema, and hypertension; inducing an inotropic response and increasing cardiac contractility; treating polycystic ovary syndrome; treating respiratory distress; improving nutrition via a non-alimentary route, i.e., via intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, peritoneal, or other injection or infusion; treating nephropathy; treating left ventricular systolic dysfunction (e.g., with abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction); inhibiting antro-duodenal motility (e.g., for the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, postoperative dumping syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome, and as premedication in endoscopic procedures; treating critical illness polyneuropathy (CIPN) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS; modulating triglyceride levels and treating dyslipidemia; treating organ tissue injury caused by reperfusion of blood flow following ischemia; or treating coronary heart disease risk factor (CHDRF) syndrome in a subject by administering and effective amount of a compound of the first aspect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention features a method of treating (e.g., prophylactically) a cancer, a neurodegenerative disease, or a lysosomal storage disorder (e.g., any disease described herein).

The gastrointestinal or pancreatic peptide may be a cholecystokinin, gastrin, glucagon, epidermal growth factor, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), insulin, or a GLP-1 agonist. The hypothalamic or pituitary hormone may be a pituitary hormone-releasing hormone (e.g., corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, growth hormone-releasing hormone, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a pituitary hormone release inhibiting hormone (e.g., MSH release inhibiting hormone and somatostatin), pro-opiomelanocortin or an analog or derivative (e.g., cleavage product) thereof (e.g., adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), α-endorphin, β-endorphin, γ-endorphin, β-lipotropin, γ-lipotropin, and melanocyte-stimulating hormone), growth hormones, thyrotropin, vasotocin, and oxytocin. The neuropeptide may be any of angiotensin, bombesin, bradykinin, calcitonin, a cholecystokinin, delta sleep inducing peptide, galanin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, gastrin, neuropeptide Y, neurotensin, an opioid peptide (e.g., a dynorphin, an endorphin, an enkephalin, and a nociceptin), vasoactive intestinal peptides, secretin, tachykinin, and vasopressin. Other peptide hormones include adiponectins, adrenomedullins, ghrelin, gonadotropins, inhibins, natriuretic peptides, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP), peptide YY, thymosin, and relaxins. In other embodiments, the peptide therapeutic is a distintegrin. In certain embodiments, the peptide therapeutic is not a nutriceutical, an antibody, an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment, F(ab)2, F(ab)2′, or Fab, a cellular toxin, an endotoxin, an exotoxin, or an anti-angiogenic compound such as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or VEGF inhibitor. Other peptide therapeutics include disintegrins, endothelins, and secretory protein inhibitor proteins. The peptide therapeutic may an analog or fragment of any of these peptides (e.g., any described herein).

The peptide may be amidated, acetylated, or both. Such modifications may be at the amino or carboxy terminus of the polypeptide. The polypeptide may also include peptidomimetics (e.g., those described herein) of any of the polypeptides described herein. The polypeptide may be in a multimeric form, for example, dimeric form (e.g., formed by disulfide bonding through cysteine residues).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the peptide vector or peptide therapeutic has an amino acid sequence described herein with at least one amino acid substitution (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 substitutions), insertion, or deletion. The polypeptide may contain, for example, 1 to 12, 1 to 10, 1 to 5, or 1 to 3 amino acid substitutions, for example, 1 to 10 (e.g., to 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2) amino acid substitutions.

In some embodiments, the polypeptides and conjugates of the invention exclude the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOs:102, 103, 104, and 105.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any of the above aspects, the linker (X) may be any linker known in the art or described herein. In particular embodiments, the linker is a covalent bond (e.g., a peptide bond), a chemical linking agent (e.g., those described herein), an amino acid or a peptide (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, or more amino acids). In certain embodiments, the linker has the formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere n is an integer between 2 and 15 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15); and either Y is a thiol on A and Z is a primary amine on B or Y is a thiol on B and Z is a primary amino on A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “peptide vector” is meant a compound or molecule such as a polypeptide or a polypeptide mimetic that can be transported into a particular cell type (e.g., liver, lungs, kidney, spleen, or muscle) or across the BBB. The vector may be attached to (covalently or not) or conjugated to peptide therapeutic and thereby may be able to transport the peptide therapeutic into a particular cell type or across the BBB. In certain embodiments, the vector may bind to receptors present on cancer cells or brain endothelial cells and thereby be transported into the cancer cell or across the BBB by transcytosis. The vector may be a molecule for which high levels of transendothelial transport may be obtained, without affecting the cell or BBB integrity. The vector may be a polypeptide or a peptidomimetic and may be naturally occurring or produced by chemical synthesis or recombinant genetic technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “peptide therapeutic” is meant any polypeptide sequence or fragment thereof having at least one biological activity. As used herein, the term “peptide therapeutic” excludes leptin, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), diphtheria toxin, botunilum toxin, tetanus toxin, pertussis toxin, \nstaphylococcus \nenterotoxins, toxin shock syndrome toxin TSST-1, adenylate cyclase toxin, shiga toxin, cholera enterotoxin, endostatin, catechins, chemokine IP-10, inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPIs), anastellin, vironectin, antithrombin, herceptin, avastin, panitumumab, a green fluorescent protein, a His tag protein, galactosidase, luciferase, peroxidase and phosphatase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “GLP-1 agonist” is meant any compound capable of activating a GLP-1 receptor (e.g., a mammalian or human GLP-1 receptor). Agonists can include peptides or small molecule compounds (e.g., any of those described herein). Assays for determining whether a particular compound is a GLP-1 agonist are known in the art and described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “treating” a disease, disorder, or condition in a subject is meant reducing at least one symptom of the disease, disorder, or condition by administrating a therapeutic agent to the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “treating prophylactically” a disease, disorder, or condition in a subject is meant reducing the frequency of occurrence of (e.g., preventing) a disease, disorder or condition by administering a therapeutic agent to the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a subject who is being treated for a metabolic disorder is one who a medical practitioner has diagnosed as having such a condition. Diagnosis may be performed by any suitable means, such as those described herein. A subject in whom the development of diabetes or obesity is being treated prophylactically may or may not have received such a diagnosis. One in the art will understand that subject of the invention may have been subjected to standard tests or may have been identified, without examination, as one at high risk due to the presence of one or more risk factors, such as family history, obesity, particular ethnicity (e.g., African Americans and Hispanic Americans), gestational diabetes or delivering a baby that weighs more than nine pounds, hypertension, having a pathological condition predisposing to obesity or diabetes, high blood levels of triglycerides, high blood levels of cholesterol, presence of molecular markers (e.g., presence of autoantibodies), and age (over 45 years of age). An individual is considered obese when their weight is 20% (25% in women) or more over the maximum weight desirable for their height. An adult who is more than 100 pounds overweight, is considered to be morbidly obese. Obesity is also defined as a body mass index (BMI) over 30 kg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “a metabolic disorder” is meant any pathological condition resulting from an alteration in a subject's metabolism. Such disorders include those resulting from an alteration in glucose homeostasis resulting, for example, in hyperglycemia. According to this invention, an alteration in glucose levels is typically an increase in glucose levels by at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or even 100% relative to such levels in a healthy individual. Metabolic disorders include obesity and diabetes (e.g., diabetes type I, diabetes type II, MODY, and gestational diabetes), satiety, and endocrine deficiencies of aging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “reducing glucose levels” is meant reducing the level of glucose by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 100% relative to an untreated control. Desirably, glucose levels are reduced to normoglycemic levels, i.e., between 150 to 60 mg/dL, between 140 to 70 mg/dL, between 130 to 70 mg/dL, between 125 to 80 mg/dL, and preferably between 120 to 80 mg/dL. Such reduction in glucose levels may be obtained by increasing any one of the biological activities associated with the clearance of glucose from the blood (e.g., increase insulin production, secretion, or action).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “subject” is meant a human or non-human animal (e.g., a mammal).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “increasing GLP-1 receptor activity” is meant increasing the level of receptor activation measured using standard techniques (e.g., cAMP activation) by, for example, at least 10%, 20%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 200%, or 500% as compared to an untreated control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “equivalent dosage” is meant the amount of a compound of the invention required to achieve the same molar amount of the peptide therapeutic (e.g., a GLP-1 agonist) in the compound of the invention, as compared to the unconjugated peptide therapeutic. For example, the equivalent dosage of 1.0 μg exendin-4 is about 1.6 μg of the [Lys\n39\n-MHA]exendin-4/Angiopep-2-Cys-NH\n2 \nconjugate described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy a polypeptide which is “efficiently transported across the BBB” is meant a polypeptide that is able to cross the BBB at least as efficiently as Angiopep-6 (i.e., greater than 38.5% that of Angiopep-1 (250 nM) in the in situ brain perfusion assay described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/807,597, filed May 29, 2007, hereby incorporated by reference). Accordingly, a polypeptide which is “not efficiently transported across the BBB” is transported to the brain at lower levels (e.g., transported less efficiently than Angiopep-6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy a polypeptide or compound which is “efficiently transported to a particular cell type” is meant that the polypeptide or compound is able to accumulate (e.g., either due to increased transport into the cell, decreased efflux from the cell, or a combination thereof) in that cell type to at least a 10% (e.g., 25%, 50%, 100%, 200%, 500%, 1,000%, 5,000%, or 10,000%) greater extent than either a control substance, or, in the case of a conjugate, as compared to the unconjugated agent. Such activities are described in detail in International Application Publication No. WO 2007/009229, hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following Detailed Description, the drawings, and the claims.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n is table and schematic diagram showing exendin-4 and the exendin-4 analogs used in experiments described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n is a schematic diagram of the synthetic scheme used to conjugate Cys-AngioPep2, Angiopep-2-Cys-NH\n2\n, and Angiopep-1 to [Lys\n39\n-MHA]exendin-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n is a schematic diagram of the synthetic scheme used to conjugate [Cys\n32\n]exendin-4 to (maleimido propionic acid (MPA))-Angiopep-2, (maleimido hexamoic acid (MHA))-Angiopep-2, and (maleimido undecanoic acid (MUA))-Angiopep-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n is a graph showing transport of exendin-4 and exendin-4/Angiopep-2 across the BBB.

The peptide conjugates of the invention thus include a therapeutic peptide and a peptide vector that enhance transport across the BBB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly, we have also shown that lower doses of the compounds of the invention, as compared to unconjugated GLP-1 agonists, are effective in treating GLP-1 related disorders, including a reduction in glycemia. By administering lower doses of the conjugated peptides, side effects such as vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea observed with the unconjugated agonists can be reduced or eliminated. Alternatively, increased efficacy at higher doses may be obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide therapeutic can be any peptide having biological known in the art and including peptides such as those described below. Particular GLP-1 agonists include exendin-4, GLP-1, and exendin-3 fragments, substitutions (e.g., conservative or nonconservative substitutions, or substitutions of non-naturally occurring amino acids), and chemical modifications to the amino acid sequences (e.g., those described herein).

As described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,924,264, the polypeptide can be bound to a polymer to increase its molecular weight. Exemplary polymers include polyethylene glycol polymers, polyamino acids, albumin, gelatin, succinyl-gelatin, (hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide, fatty acids, polysaccharides, lipid amino acids, and dextran.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one case, the polypeptide is modified by addition of albumin (e.g., human albumin), or an analog or fragment thereof, or the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin. Such an approach is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,271,149.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the polypeptide is modified by addition of a lipophilic substituent, as described in PCT Publication WO 98/08871. The lipophilic substituent may include a partially or completely hydrogenated cyclopentanophenathrene skeleton, a straight-chain or branched alkyl group; the acyl group of a straight-chain or branched fatty acid (e.g., a group including CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\nCO— or HOOC(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCO—, where n or m is 4 to 38); an acyl group of a straight-chain or branched alkane α,ω-dicarboxylic acid; CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\np\n((CH\n2\n)\nq\n,COOH)CHNH—CO(CH\n2\n)\n2\nCO—, where p and q are integers and p+q is 8 to 33; CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nr\nCO—NHCH(COOH)(CH\n2\n)\n2\nCO—, where r is 10 to 24; CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\ns\nCO—NHCH((CH\n2\n)\n2\nCOOH)CO—, where s is 8 to 24; COOH(CH\n2\n)\nt\nCO—, where t is 8 to 24; —NHCH(COOH)(CH\n2\n)\n4\nNH—CO(CH\n2\n)\nu\nCH\n3\n, where u is 8 to 18; —NHCH(COOH)(CH\n2\n)\n4\nNH—COCH((CH\n2\n)\n2\nCOOH)NH—CO(CH\n2\n)\nw\nCH\n3\n, where w is 10 to 16; —NHCH(COOH)(CH\n2\n)\n4\nNH—CO(CH\n2\n)\n2\nCH(COOH)NH—CO(CH\n2\n)\nx\nCH\n3\n, where x is 10 to 16; or —NHCH(COOH)(CH\n2\n)\n4\nNH—CO(CH\n2\n)\n2\nCH(COOH)NHCO(CH\n2\n)\ny\nCH\n3\n, where y is 1 to 22.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the peptide therapeuticis modified by addition of a chemically reactive group such as a maleimide group, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,593,295. These groups can react with available reactive functionalities on blood components to form covalent bonds and can extending the effective therapeutic in vivo half-life of the modified insulinotropic peptides. To form covalent bonds with the functional group on a protein, one can use as a chemically reactive group a wide variety of active carboxyl groups (e.g., esters) where the hydroxyl moiety is physiologically acceptable at the levels required to modify the peptide. Particular agents include N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), N-hydroxy-sulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS), maleimide-benzoyl-succinimide (MBS), gamma-maleimido-butyryloxy succinimide ester (GMBS), maleimido propionic acid (MPA) maleimido hexanoic acid (MHA), and maleimido undecanoic acid (MUA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary amines are the principal targets for NHS esters. Accessible α-amine groups present on the N-termini of proteins and the ε-amine of lysine react with NHS esters. An amide bond is formed when the NHS ester conjugation reaction reacts with primary amines releasing N-hydroxysuccinimide. These succinimide containing reactive groups are herein referred to as succinimidyl groups. In certain embodiments of the invention, the functional group on the protein will be a thiol group and the chemically reactive group will be a maleimido-containing group such as gamma-maleimide-butrylamide (GMBA or MPA). Such maleimide containing groups are referred to herein as maleido groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe maleimido group is most selective for sulfhydryl groups on peptides when the pH of the reaction mixture is 6.5-7.4. At pH 7.0, the rate of reaction of maleimido groups with sulfhydryls (e.g., thiol groups on proteins such as serum albumin or IgG) is 1000-fold faster than with amines. Thus, a stable thioether linkage between the maleimido group and the sulfhydryl is formed, which cannot be cleaved under physiological conditions.\n\n\n \nPeptide Vectors\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can feature any of polypeptides described herein, for example, any of the peptides described in Table 1 (e.g., Angiopep-1 or Angiopep-2), or a fragment or analog thereof as a peptide vector. In certain embodiments, the peptide vector may have at least 35%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, or even 100% identity to a polypeptide described herein. The peptide vector may have one or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15) substitutions relative to one of the sequences described herein. Other modifications are described in greater detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also features fragments of these polypeptides (e.g., a functional fragment). In certain embodiments, the fragments are capable of efficiently being transported to or accumulating in a particular cell type (e.g., liver, eye, lung, kidney, or spleen) or are efficiently transported across the BBB. Truncations of the polypeptide may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or more amino acids from either the N-terminus of the polypeptide, the C-terminus of the polypeptide, or a combination thereof. Other fragments include sequences where internal portions of the polypeptide are deleted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional peptide vectors may be identified by using one of the assays or methods described herein. For example, a candidate polypeptide may be produced by conventional peptide synthesis, conjugated with paclitaxel and administered to a laboratory animal. A biologically-active polypeptide conjugate may be identified, for example, based on its ability to increase survival of an animal injected with tumor cells and treated with the conjugate as compared to a control which has not been treated with a conjugate (e.g., treated with the unconjugated agent). For example, a biologically active polypeptide may be identified based on its location in the parenchyma in an in situ cerebral perfusion assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays to determine accumulation in other tissues may be performed as well. Labelled conjugates of a polypeptide can be administered to an animal, and accumulation in different organs can be measured. For example, a polypeptide conjugated to a detectable label (e.g., a near-IR fluorescence spectroscopy label such as Cy5.5) allows live in vivo visualization. Such a polypeptide can be administered to an animal, and the presence of the polypeptide in an organ can be detected, thus allowing determination of the rate and amount of accumulation of the polypeptide in the desired organ. In other embodiments, the polypeptide can be labelled with a radioactive isotope (e.g., \n125\nI). The polypeptide is then administered to an animal. After a period of time, the animal is sacrificed and the organs are extracted. The amount of radioisotope in each organ can then be measured using any means known in the art. By comparing the amount of a labeled candidate polypeptide in a particular organ relative to the amount of a labeled control polypeptide, the ability of the candidate polypeptide to access and accumulate in a particular tissue can be ascertained. Appropriate negative controls include any peptide or polypeptide known not to be efficiently transported into a particular cell type (e.g., a peptide related to Angiopep that does not cross the BBB, or any other peptide).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional sequences are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,980 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:102 herein), 5,780,265 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:103), 5,118,668 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:105).

Other examples of aprotinin analogs may be found by performing a protein BLAST (Genbank: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) using the synthetic aprotinin sequence (or portion thereof) disclosed in International Application No. PCT/CA2004/000011. Exemplary aprotinin analogs are also found under accession Nos. CAA37967 (GI:58005) and 1405218C (GI:3604747).\n\n\n \nModified Polypeptides\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptide vectors and peptide therapeutics used in the invention may have a modified amino acid sequence. In certain embodiments, the modification does not destroy significantly a desired biological activity (e.g., ability to cross the BBB). The modification may reduce (e.g., by at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 25%, 35%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 90%, or 95%), may have no effect, or may increase (e.g., by at least 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%, 200%, 500%, or 1000%) the biological activity of the original polypeptide. The modified peptide may have or may optimize a characteristic of a polypeptide, such as in vivo stability, bioavailability, toxicity, immunological activity, immunological identity, and conjugation properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications include those by natural processes, such as posttranslational processing, or by chemical modification techniques known in the art. Modifications may occur anywhere in a polypeptide including the polypeptide backbone, the amino acid side chains and the amino- or carboxy-terminus. The same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide, and a polypeptide may contain more than one type of modification. Polypeptides may be branched as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched, and branched cyclic polypeptides may result from posttranslational natural processes or may be made synthetically. Other modifications include pegylation, acetylation, acylation, addition of acetomidomethyl (Acm) group, ADP-ribosylation, alkylation, amidation, biotinylation, carbamoylation, carboxyethylation, esterification, covalent attachment to flavin, covalent attachment to a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of drug, covalent attachment of a marker (e.g., fluorescent or radioactive), covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphatidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent crosslinks, formation of cystine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation and ubiquitination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA modified polypeptide can also include an amino acid insertion, deletion, or substitution, either conservative or non-conservative (e.g., D-amino acids, desamino acids) in the polypeptide sequence (e.g., where such changes do not substantially alter the biological activity of the polypeptide). In particular, the addition of one or more cysteine residues to the amino or carboxy terminus of any of the polypeptides of the invention can facilitate conjugation of these polypeptides by, e.g., disulfide bonding. For example, Angiopep-1 (SEQ ID NO:67), Angiopep-2 (SEQ ID NO:97), or Angiopep-7 (SEQ ID NO:112) can be modified to include a single cysteine residue at the amino-terminus (SEQ ID NOS: 71, 113, and 115, respectively) or a single cysteine residue at the carboxy-terminus (SEQ ID NOS: 72, 114, and 116, respectively). Amino acid substitutions can be conservative (i.e., wherein a residue is replaced by another of the same general type or group) or non-conservative (i.e., wherein a residue is replaced by an amino acid of another type). In addition, a non-naturally occurring amino acid can be substituted for a naturally occurring amino acid (i.e., non-naturally occurring conservative amino acid substitution or a non-naturally occurring non-conservative amino acid substitution).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides made synthetically can include substitutions of amino acids not naturally encoded by DNA (e.g., non-naturally occurring or unnatural amino acid). Examples of non-naturally occurring amino acids include D-amino acids, an amino acid having an acetylaminomethyl group attached to a sulfur atom of a cysteine, a pegylated amino acid, the omega amino acids of the formula NH\n2\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\nCOOH wherein n is 2-6, neutral nonpolar amino acids, such as sarcosine, t-butyl alanine, t-butyl glycine, N-methyl isoleucine, and norleucine. Phenylglycine may substitute for Trp, Tyr, or Phe; citrulline and methionine sulfoxide are neutral nonpolar, cysteic acid is acidic, and ornithine is basic. Proline may be substituted with hydroxyproline and retain the conformation conferring properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalogs may be generated by substitutional mutagenesis and retain the biological activity of the original polypeptide. Examples of substitutions identified as “conservative substitutions” are shown in Table 2. If such substitutions result in a change not desired, then other type of substitutions, denominated “exemplary substitutions” in Table 3, or as further described herein in reference to amino acid classes, are introduced and the products screened.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantial modifications in function or immunological identity are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation.

Polypeptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template polypeptide. The non-peptide compounds are termed “peptide mimetics” or peptidomimetics (Fauchere et al., \nInfect. Immun. \n54:283-287, 1986 and Evans et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n30:1229-1239, 1987). Peptide mimetics that are structurally related to therapeutically useful peptides or polypeptides may be used to produce an equivalent or enhanced therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to the paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biological or pharmacological activity) such as naturally-occurring receptor-binding polypeptides, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by linkages such as —CH\n2\nNH—, —CH\n2\nS—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH═CH— (cis and trans), —CH\n2\nSO—, —CH(OH)CH\n2\n—, —COCH\n2\n— etc., by methods well known in the art (Spatola, \nPeptide Backbone Modifications, Vega Data, \n1:267, 1983; Spatola et al., \nLife Sci. \n38:1243-1249, 1986; Hudson et al., \nInt. J. Pept. Res. \n14:177-185, 1979; and Weinstein, 1983, Chemistry and Biochemistry, of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins, Weinstein eds, Marcel Dekker, New York). Such polypeptide mimetics may have significant advantages over naturally occurring polypeptides including more economical production, greater chemical stability, enhanced pharmacological properties (e.g., half-life, absorption, potency, efficiency), reduced antigenicity, and others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the peptide vectors described herein may efficiently cross the BBB or target particular cell types (e.g., those described herein), their effectiveness may be reduced by the presence of proteases. Likewise, the effectiveness of GLP-1 agonists used in the invention may be similarly reduced. Serum proteases have specific substrate requirements, including L-amino acids and peptide bonds for cleavage. Furthermore, exopeptidases, which represent the most prominent component of the protease activity in serum, usually act on the first peptide bond of the polypeptide and require a free N-terminus (Powell et al., \nPharm. Res. \n10:1268-1273, 1993). In light of this, it is often advantageous to use modified versions of polypeptides. The modified polypeptides retain the structural characteristics of the original L-amino acid polypeptides, but advantageously are not readily susceptible to cleavage by protease and/or exopeptidases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSystematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., an enantiomer; D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used to generate more stable polypeptides. Thus, a polypeptide derivative or peptidomimetic as described herein may be all L-, all D-, or mixed D, L polypeptides. The presence of an N-terminal or C-terminal D-amino acid increases the in vivo stability of a polypeptide because peptidases cannot utilize a D-amino acid as a substrate (Powell et al., \nPharm. Res. \n10:1268-1273, 1993). Reverse-D polypeptides are polypeptides containing D-amino acids, arranged in a reverse sequence relative to a polypeptide containing L-amino acids. Thus, the C-terminal residue of an L-amino acid polypeptide becomes N-terminal for the D-amino acid polypeptide, and so forth. Reverse D-polypeptides retain the same tertiary conformation and therefore the same activity, as the L-amino acid polypeptides, but are more stable to enzymatic degradation in vitro and in vivo, and thus have greater therapeutic efficacy than the original polypeptide (Brady and Dodson, \nNature \n368:692-693, 1994 and Jameson et al., \nNature \n368:744-746, 1994). In addition to reverse-D-polypeptides, constrained polypeptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods well known in the art (Rizo et al., \nAnn. Rev. Biochem. \n61:387-418, 1992). For example, constrained polypeptides may be generated by adding cysteine residues capable of forming disulfide bridges and, thereby, resulting in a cyclic polypeptide. Cyclic polypeptides have no free N- or C-termini. Accordingly, they are not susceptible to proteolysis by exopeptidases, although they are, of course, susceptible to endopeptidases, which do not cleave at polypeptide termini. The amino acid sequences of the polypeptides with N-terminal or C-terminal D-amino acids and of the cyclic polypeptides are usually identical to the sequences of the polypeptides to which they correspond, except for the presence of N-terminal or C-terminal D-amino acid residue, or their circular structure, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA cyclic derivative containing an intramolecular disulfide bond may be prepared by conventional solid phase synthesis while incorporating suitable S-protected cysteine or homocysteine residues at the positions selected for cyclization such as the amino and carboxy termini (Sah et al., \nJ. Pharm. Pharmacol. \n48:197, 1996). Following completion of the chain assembly, cyclization can be performed either (1) by selective removal of the S-protecting group with a consequent on-support oxidation of the corresponding two free SH-functions, to form a S—S bonds, followed by conventional removal of the product from the support and appropriate purification procedure or (2) by removal of the polypeptide from the support along with complete side chain de-protection, followed by oxidation of the free SH-functions in highly dilute aqueous solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic derivative containing an intramolecular amide bond may be prepared by conventional solid phase synthesis while incorporating suitable amino and carboxyl side chain protected amino acid derivatives, at the position selected for cyclization. The cyclic derivatives containing intramolecular —S-alkyl bonds can be prepared by conventional solid phase chemistry while incorporating an amino acid residue with a suitable amino-protected side chain, and a suitable S-protected cysteine or homocysteine residue at the position selected for cyclization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother effective approach to confer resistance to peptidases acting on the N-terminal or C-terminal residues of a polypeptide is to add chemical groups at the polypeptide termini, such that the modified polypeptide is no longer a substrate for the peptidase. One such chemical modification is glycosylation of the polypeptides at either or both termini. Certain chemical modifications, in particular N-terminal glycosylation, have been shown to increase the stability of polypeptides in human serum (Powell et al., \nPharm. Res. \n10:1268-1273, 1993). Other chemical modifications which enhance serum stability include, but are not limited to, the addition of an N-terminal alkyl group, consisting of a lower alkyl of from one to twenty carbons, such as an acetyl group, and/or the addition of a C-terminal amide or substituted amide group. In particular, the present invention includes modified polypeptides consisting of polypeptides bearing an N-terminal acetyl group and/or a C-terminal amide group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included by the present invention are other types of polypeptide derivatives containing additional chemical moieties not normally part of the polypeptide, provided that the derivative retains the desired functional activity of the polypeptide. Examples of such derivatives include (1) N-acyl derivatives of the amino terminal or of another free amino group, wherein the acyl group may be an alkanoyl group (e.g., acetyl, hexanoyl, octanoyl) an aroyl group (e.g., benzoyl) or a blocking group such as F-moc (fluorenylmethyl-O—CO—); (2) esters of the carboxy terminal or of another free carboxy or hydroxyl group; (3) amide of the carboxy-terminal or of another free carboxyl group produced by reaction with ammonia or with a suitable amine; (4) phosphorylated derivatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLonger polypeptide sequences which result from the addition of additional amino acid residues to the polypeptides described herein are also encompassed in the present invention. Such longer polypeptide sequences can be expected to have the same biological activity and specificity (e.g., cell tropism) as the polypeptides described above. While polypeptides having a substantial number of additional amino acids are not excluded, it is recognized that some large polypeptides may assume a configuration that masks the effective sequence, thereby preventing binding to a target (e.g., a member of the LRP receptor family such as LRP or LRP2). These derivatives could act as competitive antagonists. Thus, while the present invention encompasses polypeptides or derivatives of the polypeptides described herein having an extension, desirably the extension does not destroy the cell targeting activity of the polypeptides or its derivatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther derivatives included in the present invention are dual polypeptides consisting of two of the same, or two different polypeptides, as described herein, covalently linked to one another either directly or through a spacer, such as by a short stretch of alanine residues or by a putative site for proteolysis (e.g., by cathepsin, see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,126,249 and European Patent No. 495 049). Multimers of the polypeptides described herein consist of a polymer of molecules formed from the same or different polypeptides or derivatives thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also encompasses polypeptide derivatives that are chimeric or fusion proteins containing a polypeptide described herein, or fragment thereof, linked at its amino- or carboxy-terminal end, or both, to an amino acid sequence of a different protein. Such a chimeric or fusion protein may be produced by recombinant expression of a nucleic acid encoding the protein. For example, a chimeric or fusion protein may contain at least 6 amino acids shared with one of the described polypeptides which desirably results in a chimeric or fusion protein that has an equivalent or greater functional activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays to Identify Peptidomimetics\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, non-peptidyl compounds generated to replicate the backbone geometry and pharmacophore display (peptidomimetics) of the polypeptides described herein often possess attributes of greater metabolic stability, higher potency, longer duration of action, and better bioavailability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptidomimetics compounds can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art, including biological libraries, spatially addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries, synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution, the ‘one-bead one-compound’ library method, and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library approach is limited to peptide libraries, while the other four approaches are applicable to peptide, non-peptide oligomer, or small molecule libraries of compounds (Lam, \nAnticancer Drug Des. \n12:145, 1997). Examples of methods for the synthesis of molecular libraries can be found in the art, for example, in: DeWitt et al. (\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n90:6909, 1993); Erb et al. (\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n91:11422, 1994); Zuckermann et al. (\nJ. Med. Chem. \n37:2678, 1994); Cho et al. (\nScience \n261:1303, 1993); Carell et al. (\nAngew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl. \n33:2059, 1994 and ibid 2061); and in Gallop et al. (\nMed. Chem. \n37:1233, 1994). Libraries of compounds may be presented in solution (e.g., Houghten, \nBiotechniques \n13:412-421, 1992) or on beads (Lam, \nNature \n354:82-84, 1991), chips (Fodor, \nNature \n364:555-556, 1993), bacteria or spores (U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), plasmids (Cull et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n89:1865-1869, 1992) or on phage (Scott and Smith, \nScience \n249:386-390, 1990), or luciferase, and the enzymatic label detected by determination of conversion of an appropriate substrate to product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce a polypeptide as described herein is identified, it can be isolated and purified by any number of standard methods including, but not limited to, differential solubility (e.g., precipitation), centrifugation, chromatography (e.g., affinity, ion exchange, and size exclusion), or by any other standard techniques used for the purification of peptides, peptidomimetics, or proteins. The functional properties of an identified polypeptide of interest may be evaluated using any functional assay known in the art. Desirably, assays for evaluating downstream receptor function in intracellular signaling are used (e.g., cell proliferation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the peptidomimetics compounds of the present invention may be obtained using the following three-phase process: (1) scanning the polypeptides described herein to identify regions of secondary structure necessary for targeting the particular cell types described herein; (2) using conformationally constrained dipeptide surrogates to refine the backbone geometry and provide organic platforms corresponding to these surrogates; and (3) using the best organic platforms to display organic pharmocophores in libraries of candidates designed to mimic the desired activity of the native polypeptide. In more detail the three phases are as follows. In \nphase\n 1, the lead candidate polypeptides are scanned and their structure abridged to identify the requirements for their activity. A series of polypeptide analogs of the original are synthesized. In \nphase\n 2, the best polypeptide analogs are investigated using the conformationally constrained dipeptide surrogates. Indolizidin-2-one, indolizidin-9-one and quinolizidinone amino acids (I\n2\naa, I\n9\naa and Qaa respectively) are used as platforms for studying backbone geometry of the best peptide candidates. These and related platforms (reviewed in Halab et al., \nBiopolymers \n55:101-122, 2000 and Hanessian et al., \nTetrahedron \n53:12789-12854, 1997) may be introduced at specific regions of the polypeptide to orient the pharmacophores in different directions. Biological evaluation of these analogs identifies improved lead polypeptides that mimic the geometric requirements for activity. In \nphase\n 3, the platforms from the most active lead polypeptides are used to display organic surrogates of the pharmacophores responsible for activity of the native peptide. The pharmacophores and scaffolds are combined in a parallel synthesis format. Derivation of polypeptides and the above phases can be accomplished by other means using methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStructure function relationships determined from the polypeptides, polypeptide derivatives, peptidomimetics or other small molecules described herein may be used to refine and prepare analogous molecular structures having similar or better properties. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention also include molecules that share the structure, polarity, charge characteristics and side chain properties of the polypeptides described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, based on the disclosure herein, those skilled in the art can develop peptides and peptidomimetics screening assays which are useful for identifying compounds for targeting an agent to particular cell types (e.g., those described herein). The assays of this invention may be developed for low-throughput, high-throughput, or ultra-high throughput screening formats. Assays of the present invention include assays amenable to automation.\n\n\n \nLinkers\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptide therapeutic may be bound to the vector peptide either directly (e.g., through a covalent bond such as a peptide bond) or may be bound through a linker. Linkers include chemical linking agents (e.g., cleavable linkers) and peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the linker is a chemical linking agent. The peptide therapeutic and vector peptide may be conjugated through sulfhydryl groups, amino groups (amines), and/or carbohydrates or any appropriate reactive group. Homobifunctional and heterobifunctional cross-linkers (conjugation agents) are available from many commercial sources. Regions available for cross-linking may be found on the polypeptides of the present invention. The cross-linker may comprise a flexible arm, e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 carbon atoms. Exemplary cross-linkers include BS3 ([Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate]; BS3 is a homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide ester that targets accessible primary amines), NHS/EDC(N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-′(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodimide; NHS/EDC allows for the conjugation of primary amine groups with carboxyl groups), sulfo-EMCS ([N-e-Maleimidocaproic acid]hydrazide; sulfo-EMCS are heterobifunctional reactive groups (maleimide and NHS-ester) that are reactive toward sulfhydryl and amino groups), hydrazide (most proteins contain exposed carbohydrates and hydrazide is a useful reagent for linking carboxyl groups to primary amines), and SATA (N-succinimidyl-S-acetylthioacetate; SATA is reactive towards amines and adds protected sulfhydryls groups).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo form covalent bonds, one can use as a chemically reactive group a wide variety of active carboxyl groups (e.g., esters) where the hydroxyl moiety is physiologically acceptable at the levels required to modify the peptide. Particular agents include N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), N-hydroxy-sulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS), maleimide-benzoyl-succinimide (MBS), gamma-maleimido-butyryloxy succinimide ester (GMBS), maleimido propionic acid (MPA) maleimido hexanoic acid (MHA), and maleimido undecanoic acid (MUA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary amines are the principal targets for NHS esters. Accessible α-amine groups present on the N-termini of proteins and the ε-amine of lysine react with NHS esters. An amide bond is formed when the NHS ester conjugation reaction reacts with primary amines releasing N-hydroxysuccinimide. These succinimide containing reactive groups are herein referred to as succinimidyl groups. In certain embodiments of the invention, the functional group on the protein will be a thiol group and the chemically reactive group will be a maleimido-containing group such as gamma-maleimide-butrylamide (GMBA or MPA). Such maleimide containing groups are referred to herein as maleido groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe maleimido group is most selective for sulfhydryl groups on peptides when the pH of the reaction mixture is 6.5-7.4. At pH 7.0, the rate of reaction of maleimido groups with sulfhydryls (e.g., thiol groups on proteins such as serum albumin or IgG) is 1000-fold faster than with amines. Thus, a stable thioether linkage between the maleimido group and the sulfhydryl can be formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the linker includes at least one amino acid (e.g., a peptide of at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 40, or 50 amino acids). In certain embodiments, the linker is a single amino acid (e.g., any naturally occurring amino acid such as Cys). In other embodiments, a glycine-rich peptide such as a peptide having the sequence [Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser]\nn \nwhere n is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 is used, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,271,149. In other embodiments, a serine-rich peptide linker is used, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,491. Serine rich peptide linkers include those of the formula [X-X-X-X-Gly]\ny\n, where up to two of the X are Thr, and the remaining X are Ser, and y is 1 to 5 (e.g., Ser-Ser-Ser-Ser-Gly, where y is greater than 1). In some cases, the linker is a single amino acid (e.g., any amino acid, such as Gly or Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable linkers are succinic acid, Lys, Glu, and Asp, or a dipeptide such as Gly-Lys. When the linker is succinic acid, one carboxyl group thereof may form an amide bond with an amino group of the amino acid residue, and the other carboxyl group thereof may, for example, form an amide bond with an amino group of the peptide or substituent. When the linker is Lys, Glu, or Asp, the carboxyl group thereof may form an amide bond with an amino group of the amino acid residue, and the amino group thereof may, for example, form an amide bond with a carboxyl group of the substituent. When Lys is used as the linker, a further linker may be inserted between the ε-amino group of Lys and the substituent. In one particular embodiment, the further linker is succinic acid which, e.g., forms an amide bond with the ε-amino group of Lys and with an amino group present in the substituent. In one embodiment, the further linker is Glu or Asp (e.g., which forms an amide bond with the ε-amino group of Lys and another amide bond with a carboxyl group present in the substituent), that is, the substituent is a N\nε\n-acylated lysine residue.\n\n\n \nGLP-1 Agonist Activity Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nDetermination of whether a compound has GLP-1 agonist activity can be performed using any method known in the art. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) production from cells expressing a GLP-1 receptor (e.g., a human receptor) can be measured in the presence and in the absence of a compound, where an increase in cAMP production indicates the compound to be a GLP-1 agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0207507, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing the cloned human GLP-1 receptor (BHK-467-12A) were grown in DMEM media with the addition of 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5% fetal calf serum, and 0.5 mg/mL Geneticin G-418 (Life Technologies). The cells were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline and harvested with Versene. Plasma membranes were prepared from the cells by homogenisation with an Ultraturrax in buffer 1 (20 mM HEPES-Na, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000×g for 15 min at 4° C. The pellet was suspended by homogenization in buffer 2 (20 mM HEPES-Na, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), then centrifuged at 48,000×g for 15 min at 4° C. The washing procedure was repeated one more time. The final pellet was suspended in \nbuffer\n 2 and used immediately for assays or stored at −80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe functional receptor assay was carried out by measuring cAMP as a response to stimulation by the insulinotropic agent. cAMP formed was quantified by the AlphaScreen™ cAMP Kit (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Incubations were carried out in half-area 96-well microtiter plates in a total volume of 50 μL buffer 3 (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, pH 7.4) and with the following additions: 1 mM ATP, 1 μM GTP, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 0.01% Tween-20, 0.1% BSA, 6 μg membrane preparation, 15 μg/ml acceptor beads, 20 μg/ml donor beads preincubated with 6 nM biotinyl-cAMP. Compounds to be tested for agonist activity were dissolved and diluted in \nbuffer\n 3. GTP was freshly prepared for each experiment. The plate was incubated in the dark with slow agitation for three hours at room temperature followed by counting in the Fusion™ instrument (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Concentration-response curves were plotted for the individual compounds and EC\n50 \nvalues estimated using a four-parameter logistic model with Prism v. 4.0 (GraphPad, Carlsbad, Calif.).\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Applications\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can be used in any appropriate therapeutic application where the activity of the peptide therapeutic is beneficial. The compounds of the invention can be used to treat infections (e.g., where the peptide therapeutic is antimicrobial or antibiotic peptide), to treat neoplasms such as a cancer (e.g., using a agent having antiproliferative activity, such as a tumor antibiotic or thyrotropin), for treating pain (e.g., using an opioid), to treat metabolic disorders (e.g., using a GLP-1 agonist, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, insulin, growth hormone-releasing hormone, or an analog thereof), neurological disorder such as seizures (e.g., using galanin or an analog thereof), for bone diseases such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease (e.g., using PTH, PTHrP, calcintonin, or an analog thereof), and hypertension (e.g., using bradykinin or an analog thereof). Compounds containing any of the human peptides described herein (or analogs or fragments thereof) as a peptide thereapeutic may be used to treat a subject suffering a deficiency of that peptide. Additional indications are described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can be used to treat any cancer, but, in the case of conjugates including a vector that is efficiently transported across the BBB, are particularly useful for the treatment of brain cancers and other cancers protected by the BBB. These cancers include astrocytoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, oligodendrogliomas, ependymoma, glioblastoma multiforme, mixed gliomas, oligoastrocytomas, medulloblastoma, retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, germinoma, and teratoma. Other types of cancer include hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, cancers of the head and neck including various lymphomas such as mantle cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, adenoma, squamous cell carcinoma, laryngeal carcinoma, cancers of the retina, cancers of the esophagus, multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer (including non-small cell lung carcinoma), pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, skin cancers, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, liposarcoma, epithelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, gallbladder adenocarcinoma, parotid adenocarcinoma, endometrial sarcoma, multidrug resistant cancers; and proliferative diseases and conditions, such as neovascularization associated with tumor angiogenesis, macular degeneration (e.g., wet/dry AMD), corneal neovascularization, diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, myopic degeneration and other proliferative diseases and conditions such as restenosis and polycystic kidney disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeurological Disease\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause polypeptides described herein are capable of transporting an agent across the BBB, the compounds of the invention are also useful for the treatment of neurological diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases or other conditions of the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system, or the autonomous nervous system (e.g., where neurons are lost or deteriorate). Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by ataxia (i.e., uncoordinated muscle movements) and/or memory loss. Neurodegenerative diseases include Alexander disease, Alper disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; i.e., Lou Gehrig's disease), ataxia telangiectasia, Batten disease (Spielmeyer-Vogt-Sjogren-Batten disease), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), Canavan disease, Cockayne syndrome, corticobasal degeneration, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Huntington's disease, HIV-associated dementia, Kennedy's disease, Krabbé disease, Lewy body dementia, Machado-Joseph disease (Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3), multiple sclerosis, multiple system atrophy, narcolepsy, neuroborreliosis, Parkinson's disease, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Pick's disease, primary lateral sclerosis, prion diseases, Refsum's disease, Schilder's disease (i.e., adrenoleukodystrophy), schizophrenia, spinocerebellar ataxia, spinal muscular atrophy, Steele-Richardson, Olszewski disease, and tabes dorsalis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLysosomal Storage Disorders\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugates of the invention may also be used to treat a lysosomal storage disease or disorder, many of which affect the central nervous system (CNS) and cause or exacerbate neurodegenerative disease. Lysosomal storage diseases include any of the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS; including MPS-I (Hurler syndrome, Scheie syndrome), MPS-II (Hunter syndrome), MPS-IIIA (Sanfilippo syndrome A), MPS-IIIB (Sanfilippo syndrome B), MPS-IIIC (Sanfilippo syndrome C), MPS-IIID (Sanfilippo syndrome D), MPS-IV (Morquio syndrome), MPS-VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome), MPS-VII (Sly syndrome), and MPS-IX (hyaluronidase deficiency)), lipidoses (including Gaucher' disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Fabry disease, Farber's disease, and Wolman's disease), gangliosidoses (including GM1 and GM2 gangliosidoses, Tay-Sachs disease, and Sandhoff disease), leukodystrophies (including adrenoleukodystrophy (i.e., Schilder's disease), Alexander disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbé disease, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Canavan disease, childhood ataxia with central hypomyelination (CACH), Refsum's disease, and cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis), mucolipidoses (ML; including ML-I (sialidosis), ML-II (I-cell disease), ML-III (pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy), and ML-IV), and glycoproteinoses (including aspartylglucosaminuria, fucosidosis, and mannosidosis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP-1 Related Disorders\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the peptide therapeutic is a GLP-1 agonist. Such compounds can be used in any therapeutic application where a GLP-1 agonist activity in the brain, or in particular tissues, is desired. GLP-1 agonist activity is associated with stimulation of insulin secretion (i.e., to act as an incretin hormone) and inhibition glucagon secretion, thereby contributing to limit postprandial glucose excursions. GLP-1 agonists can also inhibit gastrointestinal motility and secretion, thus acting as an enterogastrone and part of the “ileal brake” mechanism. GLP-1 also appears to be a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake. Because of these actions, GLP-1 and GLP-1 receptor agonists can be used for therapy of metabolic disorders, as reviewed in, e.g., Kinzig et al., J Neurosci 23:6163-6170, 2003. Such disorders include obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, syndrome X, insulin resistance, IGT, diabetic dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia, a cardiovascular disease, and hypertension.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP-1 is also has neurological effects including sedative or anti-anxiolytic effects, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,937. Thus, GLP-1 agonists can be used in the treatment of anxiety, aggression, psychosis, seizures, panic attacks, hysteria, or sleep disorders. GLP-1 agonists can also be used to treat Alzheimer's disease, as GLP-1 agonists have been shown to protect neurons against amyloid-β peptide and glutamate-induced apoptosis (Perry et al., Curr Alzheimer Res 2:377-85, 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther therapeutic uses for GLP-1 agonists include improving learning, enhancing neuroprotection, and alleviating a symptom of a disease or disorder of the central nervous system, e.g., through modulation of neurogenesis, and e.g., Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, ALS, stroke, ADD, and neuropsychiatric syndromes (U.S. Pat. No. 6,969,702 and U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0115605). Stimulation of neurogenesis using GLP-1 agonists has been described, for example, in Bertilsson et al., J Neurosci Res 86:326-338, 2008.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill other therapeutic uses include converting liver stem/progenitor cells into functional pancreatic cells (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0053588); preventing beta-cell deterioration (U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,259,233 and 6,569,832) and stimulation of beta-cell proliferation (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0224983); treating obesity (U.S. Pat. No. 7,211,557); suppressing appetite and inducing satiety (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0232754); treating irritable bowel syndrome (U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,447); reducing the morbidity and/or mortality associated with myocardial infarction (U.S. Pat. No. 6,747,006) and stroke (PCT Publication No. WO 00/16797); treating acute coronary syndrome characterized by an absence of Q-wave myocardial infarction (U.S. Pat. No. 7,056,887); attenuating post-surgical catabolic changes (U.S. Pat. No. 6,006,753); treating hibernating myocardium or diabetic cardiomyopathy (U.S. Pat. No. 6,894,024); suppressing plasma blood levels of norepinepherine (U.S. Pat. No. 6,894,024); increasing urinary sodium excretion, decreasing urinary potassium concentration (U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,359); treating conditions or disorders associated with toxic hypervolemia, e.g., renal failure, congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, pulmonary edema, and hypertension (U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,359); inducing an inotropic response and increasing cardiac contractility (U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,359); treating polycystic ovary syndrome (U.S. Pat. No. 7,105,489); treating respiratory distress (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0235726); improving nutrition via a non-alimentary route, i.e., via intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, peritoneal, or other injection or infusion (U.S. Pat. No. 6,852,690); treating nephropathy (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0209803); treating left ventricular systolic dysfunction, e.g., with abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (U.S. Pat. No. 7,192,922); inhibiting antro-duodenal motility, e.g., for the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, postoperative dumping syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome, and as premedication in endoscopic procedures (U.S. Pat. No. 6,579,851); treating critical illness polyneuropathy (CIPN) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0199445); modulating triglyceride levels and treating dyslipidemia (U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2003/0036504 and 2003/0143183); treating organ tissue injury caused by reperfusion of blood flow following ischemia (U.S. Pat. No. 6,284,725); treating coronary heart disease risk factor (CHDRF) syndrome (U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,520); and others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional Indications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugates of the invention can also be used to treat diseases found in other organs or tissues. For example, Angiopep-7 (SEQ ID NO:112) is efficiently transported into liver, lung, kidney, spleen, and muscle cells, allowing for the preferential treatment of diseases associated with these tissues (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer). The compounds of the presents invention may also be used to treat genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome (i.e., trisomy 21), where down-regulation of particular gene transcripts may be useful.\n\n\n \nAdministration and Dosage\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also features pharmaceutical compositions that contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. The composition can be formulated for use in a variety of drug delivery systems. One or more physiologically acceptable excipients or carriers can also be included in the composition for proper formulation. Suitable formulations for use in the present invention are found in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\n, Mack Publishing Company, Philadelphia, Pa., 17th ed., 1985. For a brief review of methods for drug delivery, see, e.g., Langer (\nScience \n249:1527-1533, 1990).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions are intended for parenteral, intranasal, topical, oral, or local administration, such as by a transdermal means, for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment. The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered parenterally (e.g., by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection), or by oral ingestion, or by topical application or intraarticular injection at areas affected by the vascular or cancer condition. Additional routes of administration include intravascular, intra-arterial, intratumor, intraperitoneal, intraventricular, intraepidural, as well as nasal, ophthalmic, intrascleral, intraorbital, rectal, topical, or aerosol inhalation administration. Sustained release administration is also specifically included in the invention, by such means as depot injections or erodible implants or components. Thus, the invention provides compositions for parenteral administration that comprise the above mention agents dissolved or suspended in an acceptable carrier, preferably an aqueous carrier, e.g., water, buffered water, saline, PBS, and the like. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, wetting agents, detergents and the like. The invention also provides compositions for oral delivery, which may contain inert ingredients such as binders or fillers for the formulation of a tablet, a capsule, and the like. Furthermore, this invention provides compositions for local administration, which may contain inert ingredients such as solvents or emulsifiers for the formulation of a cream, an ointment, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese compositions may be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably between 5 and 9 or between 6 and 8, and most preferably between 7 and 8, such as 7 to 7.5. The resulting compositions in solid form may be packaged in multiple single dose units, each containing a fixed amount of the above-mentioned agent or agents, such as in a sealed package of tablets or capsules. The composition in solid form can also be packaged in a container for a flexible quantity, such as in a squeezable tube designed for a topically applicable cream or ointment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions containing an effective amount can be administered for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments. In prophylactic applications, compositions can be administered to a subject with a clinically determined predisposition or increased susceptibility to a metabolic disorder or neurological disease. Compositions of the invention can be administered to the subject (e.g., a human) in an amount sufficient to delay, reduce, or preferably prevent the onset of clinical disease. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a subject (e.g., a human) already suffering from disease (e.g., a metabolic disorder such as those described herein, or a neurological disease) in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the condition and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this purpose is defined as a “therapeutically effective amount,” an amount of a compound sufficient to substantially improve some symptom associated with a disease or a medical condition. For example, in the treatment of a metabolic disorder (e.g., those described herein), an agent or compound which decreases, prevents, delays, suppresses, or arrests any symptom of the disease or condition would be therapeutically effective. A therapeutically effective amount of an agent or compound is not required to cure a disease or condition but will provide a treatment for a disease or condition such that the onset of the disease or condition is delayed, hindered, or prevented, or the disease or condition symptoms are ameliorated, or the term of the disease or condition is changed or, for example, is less severe or recovery is accelerated in an individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be administered in equivalent doses of as specified for the unconjugated peptide therapeutic, may be administered in higher equivalent doses (e.g., 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%, 200%, 500%, 1000% greater doses), or can be administered in lower equivalent doses (e.g., 90%, 75%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 15%, 12%, 10%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% of the equivalent dose). Amounts effective for this use may depend on the severity of the disease or condition and the weight and general state of the subject, but generally range from about 0.05 μg to about 10,000 μg (e.g., 0.5-1000 μg) of an equivalent amount of the peptide therapeutic the agent or agents per dose per subject. Suitable regimes for initial administration and booster administrations are typified by an initial administration followed by repeated doses at one or more hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly intervals by a subsequent administration. The total effective amount of an agent present in the compositions of the invention can be administered to a mammal as a single dose, either as a bolus or by infusion over a relatively short period of time, or can be administered using a fractionated treatment protocol, in which multiple doses are administered over a more prolonged period of time (e.g., a dose every 4-6, 8-12, 14-16, or 18-24 hours, or every 2-4 days, 1-2 weeks, once a month). Alternatively, continuous intravenous infusion sufficient to maintain therapeutically effective concentrations in the blood are contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutically effective amount of one or more agents present within the compositions of the invention and used in the methods of this invention applied to mammals (e.g., humans) can be determined by the ordinarily-skilled artisan with consideration of individual differences in age, weight, and the condition of the mammal. Because certain compounds of the invention exhibit an enhanced ability to cross the BBB, the dosage of the compounds of the invention can be lower than (e.g., less than or equal to about 90%, 75%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 15%, 12%, 10%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% of) the equivalent dose of required for a therapeutic effect of the unconjugated peptide therapeutic. The agents of the invention are administered to a subject (e.g. a mammal, such as a human) in an effective amount, which is an amount that produces a desirable result in a treated subject (e.g. reduction in glycemia, reduced weight gain, increased weight loss, and reduced food intake). Therapeutically effective amounts can also be determined empirically by those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject may also receive an agent in the range of about 0.05 to 10,000 μg equivalent dose as compared to peptide therapeutic per dose one or more times per week (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 or more times per week), 0.1 to 2,500 (e.g., 2,000, 1,500, 1,000, 500, 100, 10, 1, 0.5, or 0.1) μg dose per day, more than once per day, or per week. A subject may also receive an agent of the composition in the range of 0.1 to 3,000 μg per dose once every two or three weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle or multiple administrations of the compositions of the invention comprising an effective amount can be carried out with dose levels and pattern being selected by the treating physician. The dose and administration schedule can be determined and adjusted based on the severity of the disease or condition in the subject, which may be monitored throughout the course of treatment according to the methods commonly practiced by clinicians or those described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with either conventional methods of treatment or therapy or may be used separately from conventional methods of treatment or therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compounds of this invention are administered in combination therapies with other agents, they may be administered sequentially or concurrently to an individual. Alternatively, pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be comprised of a combination of a compound of the present invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, as described herein, and another therapeutic or prophylactic agent known in the art.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nSynthesizing GLP-1 Agonist-Angiopep Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nThe exemplary GLP-1 conjugates, exendin-4-cysAn2 N-terminal, and Exendin-4-cysAn2 C-terminal, and Angiopep-1/\nExendin\n 4 conjugates were made by conjugating [Lys(maleimido hexanoic acid)\n39\n]exendin-4 to the sulfide in cys-An2 (SEQ ID NO:113), in An2-cys (SEQ ID NO:114), or in Angiopep-1 (SEQ ID NO:67) in 1×PBS buffer for 1 hour. This resulted in production of exendin-4/Angiopep conjugates, as shown in \nFIG. 2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second set of exendin-4/Angiopep conjugates was made by reacting Angiopep-2 having maleimido propionic acid (MPA), maleimido hexanoic acid (MHA), or maleimido undecanoic acid (MUA) bound to its N-terminus with [Cys\n32\n]Exendin-4 to form a conjugate, as shown in \nFIG. 3\n.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nBrain Uptake of Exendin-4/Angiopep-2 Conjugates In Situ\n\n\n \n \n \nTo measure brain uptake of the exendin-4/Angiopep-2 conjugates, we used an in situ perfusion assay. The assay, which is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0189515, is performed as follows. The uptake of labeled exendin-4 and the exendin-4/Angiopep-2 conjugates was measured using the in situ brain perfusion method adapted in our laboratory for the study of drug uptake in the mouse brain (Dagenais et al., J Cereb Blood Flow Metab. 20:381-6, 2000; Cisternino et al., Pharm Res 18, 183-190, 2001). Briefly, the right common carotid artery of mice anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (140/8 mg/kg i.p.) was exposed and ligated at the level of the bifurcation of the common carotid, rostral to the occipital artery. The common carotid was then catheterized rostrally with polyethylene tubing filled with heparin (25 U/ml) and mounted on a 26-gauge needle. The syringe containing the perfusion fluid ([\n125\nI]-proteins or [\n125\nI]-peptides in Krebs/bicarbonate buffer at pH 7.4, gassed with 95% O\n2 \nand 5% CO\n2\n) was placed in an infusion pump (\nHarvard pump PHD\n 2000; Harvard Apparatus) and connected to the catheter. Prior to the perfusion, the contralateral blood flow contribution was eliminated by severing the heart ventricles. The brain was perfused for 5 min at a flow rate of 1.15 ml/min. After perfusion of radiolabeled molecules, the brain was further perfused for 60 s with Krebs buffer, to wash away excess [\n125\nI]-proteins. Mice were then decapitated to terminate perfusion and the right hemisphere was isolated on ice before being subjected to capillary depletion. Aliquots of homogenates, supernatants, pellets, and perfusates were taken to measure their contents and to evaluate the apparent volume of distribution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom these experiments, brain distribution of both exendin-4/Angiopep-2 conjugates was increased 15-50 fold over that of unconjugated exendin-4. The brain distribution of exendin-4 was observed at 0.2 ml/100 g/2 min, whereas the conjugate modified at its N-terminal was observed at 3 ml/100 g/2 min, and the conjugate modified at its C-terminal was observed at 10 ml/100 g/2 min. Results are shown in \nFIG. 4\n.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nTreatment of Obese Mice with Exendin-4/Angiopep-2 Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nObese mice (ob/ob mice) were administered the [Lys\n39\n-MHA]exendin-4/Angiopep-2-Cys-NH\n2 \nconjugate (Exen-An2).\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Study to Determine the Efficacy of Exendin-4-Angiopep-2 Conjugate\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDose\n\n\nDose\n\n\nDose\n\n\nmice/\n\n\n \nQ1Dx\n 28 days\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroups\n\n\n(μg/kg)\n\n\n(nmol/kg)\n\n\n(μg/mouse)\n\n\ngroup\n\n\n(Total amount μg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nControl\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n5\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExendin-4\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.72\n\n\n0.18\n\n\n5\n\n\n20.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n5\n\n\n201.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExen-An2\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n0.72\n\n\n0.288\n\n\n5\n\n\n32.256\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n48\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n2.88\n\n\n5\n\n\n322.56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 1.6 μg/kg dose of Exen-An2 is equivalent to a 1 μg/kg dose of exendin-4. The body weight of each mouse was measured daily. Food intake was estimated based on the mean values for each group, and glycemia was measured one hour following treatment. After 10 days of treatment, body weight gain and food intake of mice treated at the higher doses of either exendin-4 or the conjugate are lower than the control (\nFIG. 5\n). Food intake was also reduced in the mice receiving the higher doses of either exendin-4 or the conjugate (\nFIG. 6\n) as compared to the control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycemia measurements showed that the lower dose of the conjugate had the same effect as the higher doses of either exendin-4 or Exen-An2 (\nFIG. 7\n). Surprisingly, a similar effect of 1/10 the dosage on glycemia is observed using the conjugate, as compared to exendin-4.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nGeneration of an Exendin-4-Angiopep-2 Dimer Conjugate\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing the conjugation chemistry described herein or similar chemistry, an Exendin-4-Angiopep-2 dimer was generated having the structure shown in \nFIG. 8A\n. Briefly, the amine group in the C-terminal lysine of [Lys\n39\n]Exendin-4 was conjugated to an Angiopep-2 dimer through an MHA linker at the N-terminal threonine of the first Angiopep-2 peptide. A N-Succinimidyl-5-acetylthiopropionate (SATP) linker was attached to an Angiopep-2-Cys peptide at its N-terminus. Through this cysteine, the Angiopep-2-Cys peptide was conjugated to a second Angiopep-2 peptide, which had been modified to contain an MPA linker. The dimer was the linked to the [Lys\n39\n]Exendin-4 through an MHA linker A control molecule (Exen-S4) was also generated using a scrambed form of Angiopep-2 conjugated at its N-terminal to the cysteine of [Cys\n32\n]Exendin-4 through an MHA linker (\nFIG. 8B\n). These conjugates were prepared as trifluoroacetate (TFA) salts.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nCharacterization of an Exendin-4-Angiopep-2 Dimer Conjugate\n\n\n \n \n \nBrain uptake of the exemplary GLP-1 agonist, exendin-4, was measured in situ when unconjugated, conjugated to a single Angiopep-2, conjugated to a scrambled Angiopep-2 (S4), or conjugated to a dimeric form of Angiopep-2. The experiments were performed as described in Example 2 above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom these results, we observed that conjugation of the exendin-4 analog to the dimeric form of Angiopep-2 results in a conjugate with a surprisingly greater ability to cross the BBB as compared to either the unconjugated exendin-4 or to the exendin-4 conjugated to a single Angiopep-2 (\nFIG. 9\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also tested the ability of the exendin-4-Angiopep-2 dimer conjugate to reduce glycemia in DIO mice. Mice were injected with a bolus containing a control, exendin-4, or the exendin-4-Angiopep-2 dimer conjugate. Mice receiving either exendin-4 or the conjugate exhibited reduced glycemia as compared to mice receiving the control (\nFIG. 10\n).\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nCharacterization of an Exendin-4-Angiopep-2 Dimer Conjugate\n\n\n \n \n \nBrain uptake of the exemplary GLP-1 agonist, exendin-4, was measured in situ when unconjugated, conjugated to a single Angiopep-2, conjugated to S4, or conjugated to a dimeric form of Angiopep-2. The experiments were performed as described in Example 2 above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom these results, we observed that conjugation of the exendin-4 analog to the dimeric form of Angiopep-2 results in a conjugate with a surprisingly greater ability to cross the BBB as compared to either the unconjugated exendin-4 or to the exendin-4 conjugated to a single Angiopep-2 (\nFIG. 8\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also tested the ability of the exendin-4-Angiopep-2 dimer conjugate to reduce glycemia in DIO mice. Mice were injected with a bolus containing a control, exendin-4, or the exendin-4-Angiopep-2 dimer conjugate. Mice receiving either exendin-4 or the conjugate exhibited reduced glycemia as compared to mice receiving the control (\nFIG. 9\n).\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nPancreatic Uptake and Insulin Response of Exen-4-An2 Conjugate\n\n\n \n \n \nWe also tested the brain and pancreatic uptake of both Exendin-4 and the Exen-4-An2 conjugate in \nmice\n 15 minutes following an intravenous bolus injection of either compound. As seen in \nFIG. 11A\n, brain uptake was enhanced in the Exen-4-An2 as compared to the unconjugated Exendin-4 peptide, whereas similar levels of pancreatic concentration were observed with both compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of either Exendin-4 or Exen-4-An2 to induce an increase in insulation secretion was measured using RIN-m5F pancreatic cells. As shown in \nFIG. 12\n, the conjugate, at all concentrations tested, surprisingly exhibited a stronger level of insulin secretion, as compared to Exendin-4.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nSynthesis of a Leptin Conjugate\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following procedure was used to generate a Leptin-(C11)-AN2 conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMUA-AN2 (264.6 mg, 91.5 μmol, 1.2 eq., 82% peptide content) was dissolved in H\n2\nO/ACN (9/1) (14 ml) by adjusting pH from 3.9 to 5.00 with addition of a 0.1 N NaOH solution (1.5 ml).

Other length carbon linker conjugates, were also generated, including Leptin-AN2 (C3) and Leptin AN2 (C6) using similar procedures.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nIn Situ Brain Perfursion of Leptin\n116-130 \nAngiopep-2 Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine which of the leptin conjugates most effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier, we tested each conjugate in the in situ brain perfusion assay. This assay is or a similar assay is described, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20060189515, which was based on a method described in Dagenais et al., 2000, J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 20(2):381-386. The BBB transport constants were determined as previously described by Smith (1996, Pharm. Biotechnol. 8:285-307). From these experiments, Leptin-AN2 (C11) exhibed the greatest transport across the BBB as compared to the conjugates having C3 or a C6 linker and was thus selected for further experimentation (\nFIG. 15\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransport of leptin was compared to the Leptin-AN2 (C11) conjugate using the in situ perfusion assay in lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice (available, e.g., from the Jackson laboratories). From these results, transport of leptin across the BBB in DIO mice was reduced as compared to in lean mice. By contrast, the Leptin-AN2 (C11) conjugate crossed the brain much more efficiently in both lean and DIO mice, and no statistically significant difference between the lean and DIO mice in transport of the conjugate was observed (\nFIG. 16A\n). Plasma leptin levels were observed to increase after 3 weeks on a high fat (60%) diet, suggesting that the mice were becoming leptin resistant (\nFIG. 16B\n).\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nEffect of Leptin Conjugates on Food Intake and Weight Gain\n\n\n \n \n \nMice were injected with an intravenous bolus of either Leptin-AN2 (C11) (eq. of 1 mg of leptin\n116-30 \nper mouse), leptin\n116-130 \n(1 mg/mouse), or a control (saline) (n=5 per group). Food intake of the mice was monitored at 4 hours (\nFIG. 17A\n) and at 15 hours (\nFIG. 17B\n). In both cases, the conjugate exhibited significantly greater reduction in food intake, as compared to either the control mice, or mice receiving leptin\n116-130\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also compared weight changes in DIO mice receiving the conjugate (2.5 mg/mouse; equivalent of 1 mg leptin\n116-130 \nmg/mouse), leptin\n116-130 \n(1 mg/mouse), and a control over a period of six days. Each mouse received daily treatment by intraperitoneal injection. Mice receiving leptin or the control exhibited similar amounts of weight gain over the six days, whereas mice receiving the conjugate showed marked reduction in weight gain (\nFIG. 18\n) as compared to the control mice and mice receiving leptin\n116-130\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe further compared weight changes in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice receiving the conjugate (2.5 mg/mouse; equivalent of 1 mg leptin\n116-130 \nmg/mouse), leptin\n116-130 \n(1 mg/mouse), and a control over a period of six days. Each mouse (n=5 per group) received daily treatment by intraperitoneal injection. The mice receiving the conjugate exhibited lower weight gain than the mice receiving either leptin\n116-130 \nor the control (\nFIG. 19\n) during the period of administration.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nDevelopment of Recombinant Angiopep-2 and Angiopep-2 Leptin Fusion Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nWe also developed an Angiopep-2 fusion protein. As an initial step, a cDNA (ACC TTT TTC TAT GGC GGC AGC CGT GGC AAA CGC AAC AAT TTC AAG ACC GAG GAG TAT; SEQ ID NO:117) was created. This sequence was inserted into a pGEX vector system for bacterial expression, and sequence of the insert was verified (\nFIG. 20\n). The GST-An2-Leptin\n116-130 \nconstruct was made using an overlap extension PCR strategy (\nFIG. 21\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant Angiopep-2 was expressed in a bacterial expression system and purified using a GSH-Sepharose column. A chromatogram from this procedure is shown (\nFIG. 22\n). The purified Angiopep-2 was analyzed by Western blot using an Angiopep-2 antibody (\nFIG. 23A\n), by liquid chromatography (\nFIG. 23B\n), and by mass spectroscopy (\nFIG. 23C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe in situ brain perfusion assay was performed using recombinant Angiopep-2. The results were compared to synthetic Angiopep-2 (\nFIG. 24\n). Similar levels of uptake were observed with both forms of Angiopep-2. Uptake into the parenchyma between GST, GST-Angiopep-2, GST-Leptin\n116-130\n, and GST-Angiopep-2-Leptin\n116-130 \nwas compared (\nFIG. 25\n). These results show that fusion proteins containing the Angiopep-2 sequence are efficiently taken up into the parenchyma, whereas proteins lacking the Angiopep-2 sequence are taken up much less efficiently.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA His-tagged Angiopep-2/mouse leptin fusion protein containing the full length leptin sequence has been generated (\nFIG. 26\n). This fusion protein has been expressed in a bacterial expression system (\nFIG. 27\n). Exemplary purification schemes for the fusion protein are shown in \nFIGS. 29A and 29B\n. Results from a small scale purification are shown in \nFIG. 30\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe thrombin cleavage step resulted in production of two products, suggesting the possibility that the Angiopep-2 sequence contains a low-affinity thrombin cleavage site, as shown in \nFIG. 31\n. As the leptin-Angiopep-2 has a propensity to agregate in solution, purification conditions to reduce the aggregation and improve yields are being tested.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nBrain Uptake and Activity of Leptin Fusion Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nWe then examined the ability of the Angiopep-2-leptin fusion protein to be taken up into the parenchyma of the brain of DIO mice as compared to leptin using the in situ brain perfusion assay (\nFIG. 32\n). From this experiment, we observed that the fusion protein exhibited increased uptake as compared to leptin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a control, we tested the ability of recombinant leptin to reduce body weight in ob/ob mice using either 0.1 mg/mouse or 0.25 mg/mouse daily. As shown in \nFIG. 33\n, leptin did indeed reduce body weight in these mice in a dose-dependent manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDIO mice were also treated with a control or with 50 μg his-tagged fusion protein, leptin, or the his-tagged leptin. Mice received two treatments, on days three and four as indicated. Based on these results, the greatest weight loss was observed in mice receiving the fusion protein (\nFIG. 34\n).\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nSynthesis of a Neurotensin-Angiopep-2 Conjugate\n\n\n \n \n \nAn exemplary neurotensin-Angiopep-2 conjugate was synthesized using the scheme described below. As used in these examples, the abbreviation NT refers to the pE-substituted neurotensin peptide described below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeurotensin Peptide Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \n \npELYENKPRRPYIL-OH, where the unusual amino acid L-pyroglutamic acid (pE) is used, was synthesized using SPPS (Solid phase peptide synthesis). SPPS was carried out on a Protein Technologies, Inc. Symphony® peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) amino-terminus protection. The peptide was synthesized on a 100 μmol scale using a 5-fold excess of Fmoc-amino acids (200 mM) relative to the resin. Coupling was performed by a pre-loaded Fmoc-Leu-Wang resin (0.48 mmol/g) for carboxyl-terminus acids using 1:1:2 amino acid/activator/NMM in DMF with HBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) and NMM (N-methylmorpholine). Deprotection was carried out using 20% piperidine/DMF. The resin-bound product was routinely cleaved using a solution comprised of TFA/water/TES:95/2.5/2.5 for 2 hours at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPre-loaded Fmoc-Leu-Wang resin (0.48 mmol/g) was purchased from ChemPep, Fmoc-amino acids, HBTU from ChemImpex, and the unusual L-pyroglutamic acid from Sigma-Aldrich. Side protecting groups for amino acids were Trt (trityl) for aspargine, tBu (ter-butyl) for glutamic acid and tyrosine, Pbf (pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl) for arginine, and tBoc (tButyloxycarbonyl) for lysine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crude peptide was precipitated using ice-cold ether, and purified by RP-HPLC chromatography (Waters Delta Prep 4000). Acetonitrile was evaporated from the collected fractions and lyophilized to give a pure white solid (204 mg, 61%, purity>98%). The mass was confirmed by ESI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics; calculated 1672.92. found 1671.90, m/z 558.31 (+3), 836.96 (+2)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEMCS-NT\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe N-lysine primary amine of NT was activated by treating a solution of NT (25 mg, 14.9 μmol, 1 eq. in 3.5 ml of \nPBS\n 4×, pH 7.64), with a solution of sulfo-EMCS(N-[ε-maleimidocaproyloxy]sulfosuccinimide ester) (Pierce Biotechnology) (6.1 mg, 14.9 μmol, 1 eq. in 1 ml of \nPBS\n 4×). Monitoring of the reaction was done with the analytical method described below (see chromatograms 1-2 in \nFIGS. 35A and 35B\n). The reaction (3.32 mM, pH 7.61) allowed proceeding at room temperature for 1 h. The modification was repeated once for 1 h with addition of sulfo-EMCS (4.5 mg, 10.9 μmol, 0.73 eq. in 1 ml of \nPBS\n 4×). The mixture was purified by FPLC chromatography (AKTA explorer, see \nchromatogram\n 3 in \nFIG. 36\n). Purification of EMCS-NT was performed on a column containing 30 RPC resin (polystyrene/divinyl benzene), 30 ml. Sample was loaded as 35 mg in reaction buffer (4 ml), 10% acetonitrile (ACN) in H\n2\nO, 0.05% TFA (200 μl). Solution A was H\n2\nO, 0.05% TFA, and Solution B was ACN, 0.05% TFA. Flow rate 5-9 ml/min with a gradient of 10-25% of Solution B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the acetonitrile was evaporated, the volume of water was reduced to 5 ml for the next step. A colorless solution of the pure EMCS-modified NT (purity>98%) was obtained. The mass was checked by ESI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics), was calculated to be 1867.13, and was found to be 1866.00, m/z 623.01 (+3), 934.00 (+2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNT-AN2Cys-NH2\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugation was performed with the maleimido-containing EMCS-NT and the free thiol residue of AN2Cys-NH\n2\n. The pH of the solution of EMCS-NT was adjusted from 1.65 to 6.42 by a slow addition of a 0.1N NaOH solution. A hydrolysis side reaction can occur during adjustment of pH (≦5%, hydrolyzed EMCS-NT Mw=1833). A solution of AN2Cys-NH\n2 \n(46.4 mg, 14.9 μmol, 1 eq. in 2.5 ml of \nPBS\n 4×, pH 7.64) was added to the solution of EMCS-NT. The analytical method below was used to monitoring the reaction (see chromatograms 4-5 in \nFIGS. 37A and 37B\n). The reaction (1.9 mM, pH 6.3) was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 minutes. The mixture was purified by FPLC chromatography (AKTA explorer, see \nchromatogram\n 6 in \nFIG. 38\n). Purification of NT-AN2Cys-NH2 was performed using a column (GE Healthcare) containing 30 RPC resin (Polystyrene/divinyl benzene), 30 ml, Sample was loaded in the amount of 74 mg in 4 ml reaction buffer (10% ACN in H\n2\nO, 0.05% TFA (200 ul)). Solution A was H\n2\nO, 0.05% TFA, and Solution B was ACN, 0.05% TFA. The flow rate was 5-9 ml/min, using a gradient of 10% to 25% of Solution B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter evaporation of acetonitrile and lyophilization, the conjugated NT-AN2Cys-NH\n2 \nwas obtained as a pure white solid (5.5 mg, 9% over 2 steps, purity>95%). The mass was confirmed by ESI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics); MW was calculated to be 4270.76 and was found to be 4269.17 (m/z 712.54 (+6), 854.84 (+5), 1068.29 (+4), 1424.04 (+3)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugate was stored under nitrogen atmosphere, below −20° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalytical Method\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following method was used as described above.

The temperature of mice was unaffected by intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg NT or the saline control. By contrast, intravenous administration of an equivalent dose of the conjugate (2.5 mg/kg) resulted in a rapid decrease in the body temperature, leading to hypothermia. The injection of a higher dose (5 mg/kg) of NT-An2 caused a stronger decrease in body temperature indicating that the effect of NT-An2 is dose dependent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also tested whether higher doses of the conjugate would results in greater induction of hypothermia. Mice were administered 5, 15, or 20 mg/kg of the conjugate, and the reduction in body temperature following administration was monitored for 120 minutes following administration. Small differences between these higher doses were observed (\nFIG. 40\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis experiment was repeated again with a second small batch of the NT-An2 compound, which resulted in similar activity. A third batch, which was produced as a part of an attempt to scale up the production, exhibited similar but somewhat lower activity, as shown in \nFIG. 41\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo confirm that the NT-An2 conjugate crosses the BBB, both NT and the conjugate were iodinated using standard procedures, and in situ brain perfusion was performed using methods standard in the art. The initial transport was measured as a function of time (\nFIG. 42\n). Results clearly indicate that the initial brain uptake for the NT-An2 conjugate is higher than for the unconjugated NT. Furthermore, after a 2 min in situ perfusion, capillary depletion was done to quantify the amount of NT-An2 found in the brain parenchyma (\nFIG. 43\n). Higher levels of NT-An2 were found in the brain parenchyma when compared to NT. In addition, these results indicate that NT-An2 is not trapped in the brain capillaries. Overall, our results demonstrate that the new NT-An2 derivative crosses the BBB at a sufficient concentration required to activate its receptors involved in the control of the body temperature.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nInduction of Sustained Hypothermia Using Angiopep-NT Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nWe performed an additional experiments to test whether the conjugates were able to induce sustained hypothermia in mice and rats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a first experiment, mice first received an intravenous 5 mg/kg bolus injection of NT-An2, followed by an intravenous infusion (10 mg/kg/hr) 1 hour later for a duration of 2.5 hours. The body temperature continued to decrease during the infusion, reaching a nadir of −11° C. (\nFIG. 44\n). After the end of the infusion, body temperature slowly returned to 37° C., and the animals recovered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar experiment was performed in rats. Here the rats were administered an intravenous bolus injection of 20 mg/kg NT-An2 immediately followed by a 20 mg/kg/hr infusion for 3.5 hours. This resulted in a maximal temperature drop of about 3.5° C. after 90 minutes (\nFIG. 45\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSustained hypothermia experiments were performed using a intravenous bolus injection of 20 mg/kg of NT-An2 immediately followed by a 20 mg/kg/hr infusion for 2.5 hours. At this time, the infusion was increased to 40 mg/kg/hr. A reduction in body temperature for the initial 37° C. was observed over the 360 minute time course of the experiment (\nFIG. 46\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar experiment was conducted in rats. In this experiment, rats were injected intravenously with 20 mg/kg of NT-An2 immediately followed by a 20 mg/kg/hr infusion. A sustained reduction in body temperature was also observed during the 360-minute time course of this experiment (\nFIG. 47\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further experiment, conducted over a 12-hour period, was also performed in rats. This experiment involved a 40 mg/kg intravenous bolus injection of NT-An2 followed immediately by a 20 mg/kg/hr infusion of NT-An2. As shown in \nFIG. 48\n, this resulted in a prolonged reduction of body temperature over the course of the experiment.\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nAnalgesia Induction by NT-An2\n\n\n \n \n \nWe also tested the ability of NT-An2 to induce analgesia in mice. We tested the latency between hot plate foot exposure and foot licking behavior in control mice, mice receiving 20 mg/kg NT-An2, and mice receiving 1 mg/kg of buprenorphine (an opiate analgesic) as a positive control. Both the NT-An2 and the buprenorphine increased the latency of foot licking behavior in a statistically \nsignificant manner\n 15 minutes following injection, thus indicating that NT-An2 can act as an analgesic (\nFIG. 49\n).\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nGeneration of Shorter Neurotensin Analogs\n\n\n \n \n \nWe further generated several shorter neurotensin analogs. These analogs include NT(8-13) (RRPYIL), Ac-LysNT(8-13), Ac-Lys-[D-Tyr\n11\n]NT(8-13), pGlu-LysNT(8-13), MHA-NT(8-13), and β-mercaptoMHA-NT(8-13) (see below).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMw \n\n\nQtty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nSequence\n\n\n(g/mol)\n\n\n(mg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNT native\n\n\npELYENKPRRPYIL\n\n\n1672.97\n\n\n800, ≧95%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNT(8-13)\n\n\nRRPYIL\n\n\n 816.99\n\n\n 45, ≧95%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAc-LysNT (8-13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 987.20\n\n\n 78, ≧95%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAc-Lys-[D- Tyr\n11\n]NT (8-13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 987.20\n\n\n 55, ≧95%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\npGlu-LysNT (8-13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1056.26\n\n\n 86, ≧95%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMHA-NT (8-13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1010.19\n\n\n 55, ≧95%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nβ- mercaptoMHA- NT(8-13) (desactive)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1088.32\n\n\n 12, ≧95%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNT and the NT(8-13) analogs were synthesized by using a SPPS method on a Protein Technologies, Inc.

NT was synthesized using the unusual \nL\n-pyroglutamic acid (pE) and a 5 fold excess of Fmoc-AA (200 mM) relative to the resin. Coupling was performed from a pre-loaded Fmoc-Leu-Wang resin (0.48 mmol/g) for carboxyl-terminus acids using 1:1:4 AA/HBTU/NMM in DMF. Deprotection was carried out using 20% piperidine/DMF.

The same procedure was used as for NT. A 100 mM Fmoc-AA solution, and TBTU were used. Prior to cleavage, the N-terminal MHA group was introduced on SPPS by treating the free N-terminal amino peptide bound to the resin with an 18 mM solution of Sulfo-EMCS (1.2 eq. in DMF) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The crude peptide was purified by RP-HPLC chromatography, Waters Delta Prep 4000, Waters BEH Phenyl, H\n2\nO/ACN with 0.05% TFA (“Method B”).

The same procedure was used as for NT. \nD\n-Tyrosine, a 100 mM Fmoc-AA solution, and TBTU were used. Before cleavage, a subsequent capping reaction was carried out using a large excess of 1:1:3 v/v/v acetic anhydride/DIEA/DMF for 10 min at room temperature. The peptide was purified by Method A. This resulted in the formation of a white and fluffy solid, 426 mg, 82% yield, purity HPLC≧95%, calc. 987.20. found 987.58, m/z 494.30 (+2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of ANG-Cys-NH\n2 \n(H-T\n1\nFFYGG\n6\nS\n7\nRGKRNNFKTEEYC-NH2).

Coupling was performed from a Rink amide MBHA resin with Nle (0.40 mmol/g) for carboxyl-terminus amides using 1:1:4 AA/HCTU/NMM in DMF. Cleavage of the resin-bound product was carried out using TFA/water/EDT/TES:94/2.5/2.5/1 for 2 h at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crude peptide was precipitated using ice-cold ether, and purified by RP-HPLC chromatography twice successively, Waters Delta Prep 4000, Kromasil 100-10-C18 and Waters BEH Phenyl, H\n2\nO/ACN with 0.05% TFA (“Method C”).

To this solution was added a solution of Sulfo-EMCS (1 eq. in \nPBS\n 4×). Monitoring of the reaction was done with an analytical method. The reaction (9.0 mM, pH 7.1) allowed proceeding at RT for 2 h. The pH of reaction was adjusted from 5.2 to 7 with addition of NaOH 0.1 N solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter a second addition of sulfo-EMCS (0.3 eq. in \nPBS\n 4×), the reaction was repeated for 1 h. The mixture was purified by FPLC chromatography, AKTA explorer, 30RPC resin, H\n2\nO/ACN without acid (“Method D”). Before evaporation, the resulting pure pooled fractions were acidified to \npH\n 4 with a solution of water, 0.1% TFA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter acetonitrile was evaporated, the volume of water was reduced to a minimum volume to be engaged directly in the subsequent conjugation step.

Little difference between the control and the unconjugated NT, some effect was observed with the NT(8-13)-An2 conjugate, and a larger effect was observed with both the NT-An2 and Ac-Lys-[D-Tyr\n11\n]NT(8-13)-An2 conjugates (\nFIG. 51\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also compared the ability of unconjugated Ac-Lys-[D-Tyr\n11\n]NT(8-13) at 1 mg/kg to the Ac-Lys-[D-Tyr\n11\n]NT(8-13)-An2 conjugate at 6.25 mg/kg to reduce body temperature. From these experiments, it was observed that the conjugate reduced body temperature to a greater extent than the unconjugated compound (\nFIG. 52\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA bolus injection (6.25 mg/kg) of the Ac-Lys-[D-Tyr\n11\n]NT(8-13)-An2 conjugate followed by a 6.25 mg/kg/hr infusion of this conjugate after one hour was also performed (\nFIG. 53\n).\n\n\n \nExample 21\n\n\nBinding of NT and NT Analogs and Conjugates Thereof to the NT Receptor NTSR1\n\n\n \n \n \nTo further characterize NT, the NT analogs, and conjugates of NT, or NT analogs, a competitive binding assay using HT29 cells (human colon adenocarcinoma grade II cell line) that express the high affinity NTSR1 receptor was employed. As an initial test, we were able to demonstrate that [\n3\nH]-neurotensin could be completely displaced from the cells by 40 nM of unlabeled NT (\nFIG. 54\n). We then performed a dose response test between 0.4 nM and 40 nM. From these results, we determined that NT has an IC\n50 \nof 1.4 nM in this system (\nFIG. 55\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe then compared the binding of NT to that of Ac-Lys-[D-Tyr\n11\n]NT(8-13)-An2. From this experiment, the binding of this analog was observed to be over 1000-fold weaker than the native NT (IC\n50 \nof 3.5 nM vs. 5389 nM, as shown in \nFIG. 56\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing these methods, we compared both the binding and the induced body temperature reduction between neurotensin, NT analogs, and the conjugates.
