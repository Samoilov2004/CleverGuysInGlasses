No. 60/870,867, filed Dec. 20, 2006, which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides novel bicyclic lactam derivatives, and analogues thereof, which are selective inhibitors of the serine protease blood coagulation factor VIIa. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and methods of using the same.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThromboembolic diseases remain the leading cause of death in developed countries despite the availability of anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin®), heparin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and synthetic pentasaccharides and antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix®). The oral anticoagulant warfarin, inhibits the post-translational maturation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X and prothrombin, and has proven effective in both venous and arterial thrombosis. However, its usage is limited due to its narrow therapeutic index, slow onset of therapeutic effect, numerous dietary and drug interactions, and a need for monitoring and dose adjustment. Thus discovering and developing safe and efficacious oral anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of thromboembolic disorders has become increasingly important.\n\n\nOne approach is to inhibit thrombin generation by targeting the inhibition of coagulation factor VIIa (FVIIa). Factor VII is a plasma serine protease involved in the initiation of the coagulation cascade. It is present in human blood at a concentration of approximately 500 ng/mL, with about 1% of the total amount in the proteolytically active form factor VIIa (Morrissey, J. H. et al. \nBlood \n1993, 81, 734-744). Factor VIIa binds with high affinity to its cofactor, tissue factor, in the presence of calcium ions to form a complex with enhanced proteolytic activity (Carson, S. D. and Brozna, J. P. \nBlood Coag. Fibrinol. \n1993, 4, 281-292). Tissue factor is normally expressed in cells surrounding the vasculature, and is exposed to factor VIIa in blood by vessel injury or atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Once formed, the tissue factor/factor VIIa complex initiates blood coagulation by proteolytic cleavage of factor X to factor Xa, factor IX to factor IXa and autoactivation of additional factor VII to VIIa. Factor Xa, generated either directly by tissue factor/factor VIIa or indirectly through action of factor IXa, catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, which polymerizes to form the structural framework of a blood clot, and activates platelets, which are a key cellular component of coagulation (Hoffman, M. \nBlood Reviews \n2003, 17, S1-S5). In addition, there is evidence that tissue factor is present in blood, likely in an encrypted, form that is de-encrypted during clot formation. (Giesen, P. L. A. et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci \n1999, 96, 2311-2315; Himber, J. et al. \nJ. Thromb. Haemost. \n2003, 7, 889-895). The tissue factor/factor VIIa complex derived from blood borne tissue factor may play an important role in propagation of the coagulation cascade (clot growth) and in thrombus formation in the absence of vessel wall injury (i.e., stasis induced deep vein thrombosis or sepsis). The source of blood borne tissue factor is an area of active research (Morrissey, J. H. \nJ. Thromb. Haemost. \n2003, 1, 878-880). Therefore, factor VIIa plays a key role in propagating this amplification loop and is thus an attractive target for antithrombotic therapy.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides bicyclic lactam derivatives, and analogues thereof, which are useful as selective inhibitors of factor VIIa, including stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides processes and intermediates for making the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and at least one of the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment or prophylaxis a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof, for use in therapy.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides the use of the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder.\n\n\nThese and other

CHEMISTRY\n\n\nCompounds of this invention may have one or more asymmetric centers. Compounds of the present invention containing an asymmetrically substituted atom may be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis using optically active starting materials or optically active catalysts. Geometric isomers of double bonds such as olefins and C═N double bonds can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. All chiral, (enantiomeric and diastereomeric) racemic forms and all geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated. When no specific mention is made of the configuration (cis, trans or R or S) of a compound (or of an asymmetric carbon), then any one of the isomers or a mixture of more than one isomer is intended. The processes for preparation can use racemates, enantiomers, or diastereomers as starting materials. All processes used to prepare compounds of the present invention and intermediates made therein are considered to be part of the present invention.

Preferred carbocycles, unless otherwise specified, are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl, and indanyl. When the term “carbocycle” is used, it is intended to include “aryl”. A bridged ring occurs when one or more carbon atoms link two non-adjacent carbon atoms. Preferred bridges are one or two carbon atoms. It is noted that a bridge always converts a monocyclic ring into a tricyclic ring. When a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the ring may also be present on the bridge,\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “bicyclic carbocycle” or “bicyclic carbocyclic group” is intended to mean a stable 9 or 10-membered carbocyclic ring system that contains two fused rings and consists of carbon atoms. Of the two fused rings, one ring is a benzo ring fused to a second ring; and the second ring is a 5 or 6 membered carbon ring which is saturated, partially unsaturated, or unsaturated.

The heterocyclic rings described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resulting compound is stable. If specifically noted, a nitrogen in the heterocycle may optionally be quaternized. It is preferred that when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. It is preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more than 1.

Of the two fused rings, one ring is a 5 or 6-membered monocyclic aromatic ring comprising a 5 membered heteroaryl ring, a 6-membered heteroaryl ring or a benzo ring, each fused to a second ring. The second ring is a 5 or 6 membered monocyclic ring which is saturated, partially unsaturated, or unsaturated, and comprises a 5 membered heterocycle, a 6 membered heterocycle or a carbocycle (provided the first ring is not benzo when the second ring is a carbocycle).\n\n\nThe bicyclic heterocyclic group may be attached, to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom which, results in a stable structure. The bicyclic heterocyclic group described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resulting compound is stable. It is preferred that when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. It is preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more than 1.\n\n\nExamples of a bicyclic heterocyclic group are, but not limited to, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, phthalazinyl, quinazolinyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, indolinyl, 1H-indazolyl, benzimidazolyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolinyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-quinolinyl, 2,3-dihydro-benzofuranyl, chromanyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoxalinyl, and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinazolinyl.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “aromatic heterocyclic group” or “heteroaryl” is intended to mean stable monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that include at least one heteroatom ring member such as sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen.

Heteroaryl groups are substituted or unsubstituted.\n\n\nBridged rings are also included in the definition of heterocycle. A bridged ring occurs when one or more atoms (i.e., C, O, N, or S) link two non-adjacent carbon or nitrogen atoms. Examples of bridge rings include, but are not limited to, one carbon atom, two carbon atoms, one nitrogen atom, two nitrogen atoms, and a carbon-nitrogen group. It is noted that a bridge always converts a monocyclic ring into a tricyclic ring. When a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the ring may also be present on the bridge.\n\n\nThe term “counterion” is used to represent a small, negatively charged species such as chloride, bromide, hydroxide, acetate, and sulfate.\n\n\nWhen a dotted ring is used within a ring structure, this indicates that the ring structure may be saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated.\n\n\nThe term “substituted,” as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valency is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substituent is keto (i.e., ═O), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. When a ring system (e.g., carbocyclic or heterocyclic) is said to be substituted with a carbonyl group or a double bond, it is intended that the carbon atom of the carbonyl group or one carbon atom of the double bond be part of (i.e., within) the ring. Ring double bonds, as used herein, are double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (e.g., C═C, C═N, or N═N).\n\n\nIn cases wherein there are nitrogen atoms (e.g., amines) on compounds of the present invention, these may be converted to N-oxides by treatment with an oxidizing agent (e.g., mCPBA and/or hydrogen peroxides) to afford other compounds of this invention. Thus, shown and claimed nitrogen atoms are considered to cover both the shown nitrogen and its N-oxide (N→O) derivative. In cases wherein there are quarternary carbon atoms on compounds of the present invention, these may be replaced by silicon atoms, provided they do not form Si—N or Si—O bond.\n\n\nWhen any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-3 R\nf\n, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to three Regroups and R\nf \nat each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of R\nf\n. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.\n\n\nWhen a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom via which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.\n\n\nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and/or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.\n\n\nAs used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic groups such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n18\nth \nEdition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1990, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIn addition, compounds of formula I may have prodrug forms. Any compound that will be converted in vivo to provide the bioactive agent (i.e., a compound of formula I) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the invention. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art. For examples of such prodrug derivatives, see:\n\n \n \n \n \na) \nDesign of Prodrugs\n, edited by H.

Such prodrugs are preferably administered orally since hydrolysis in many instances occurs principally under the influence of the digestive enzymes. Parenteral administration may be used where the ester per se is active, or in those instances where hydrolysis occurs in the blood. Examples of physiologically hydrolyzable esters of compounds of formula I include C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkylbenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, indanyl, phthalyl, methoxymethyl, C\n1-6\nalkanoyloxy-C\n1-6\nalkyl (e.g. acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl or propionyloxymethyl), C\n1-6 \nalkoxycarbonyloxy-C\n1-6\nalkyl, e.g. methoxycarbonyl-oxymethyl or ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, glycyloxymethyl, phenylglycyloxymethyl, (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)-methyl and other well known physiologically hydrolyzable esters used, for example, in the penicillin and cephalosporin arts. Such esters may be prepared by conventional techniques known in the art.\n\n\nPreparation of Prodrugs is Well Known in the Art and Described in, for example, \nMedicinal Chemistry: Principles and Practice\n, ed. F. D. King, The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK, 1994.\n\n\nIsotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, i.e., wherein one or more of the atoms described are replaced by an isotope of that atom (e.g., \n12\nC replaced by \n13\nC or by \n14\nC; and isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium), are also provided herein. Such compounds have a variety of potential uses, e.g., as standards and reagents in determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical compound to bind to target proteins or receptors, or for imaging compounds of this invention bound to biological receptors in vivo or in vitro.\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention are, subsequent to their preparation, preferably isolated and purified to obtain a composition containing an amount by weight equal to or greater than 98%, preferably 99%, compound of the present invention (“substantially pure”), which is then used or formulated as described herein. Such “substantially pure” compounds are also contemplated herein as part of the present invention.\n\n\n“Stable compound” and “stable structure” are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. It is preferred that compounds of the present invention do not contain a N-halo, S(O)\n2\nH, or S(O)H group.\n\n\nThe term “solvate” means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding.

The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using the methods described below, together with synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or by variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below. The reactions are performed in a solvent or solvent mixture appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and suitable for the transformations being effected. It will be understood by those skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on the molecule should be consistent with the transformations proposed. This will sometimes require a judgment to modify the order of the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme over another in order to obtain a desired compound of the invention.\n\n\nA particularly useful compendium of synthetic methods which may be applicable to the preparation of compounds of the present invention may be found in Larock, R. C. \nComprehensive Organic Transformations\n, VCH: New York, 1989. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below. All references cited herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.\n\n\nIt will also be recognized that another major consideration in the planning of any synthetic route in this field is the judicious choice of the protecting group used for protection of the reactive functional groups present in the compounds described in this invention. An authoritative account describing the many alternatives to the trained practitioner is Greene and Wuts (\nProtective Groups In Organic Synthesis\n, Wiley-Interscience, 3 nd Edition, 1999).\n\n\nCompounds having the general Formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein A, B, C, W, Y, Z\n1\n, Z\n2\n, Z\n3\n, Z\n4\n, R\n8\n, and R\n9 \nare each as defined above, can be prepared by coupling an acid of Formula (Ia):\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwith an amine of Formula (Ib):\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nunder conditions suitable for forming an amide bond between the acid and the amine. Coupling conditions can be found in Bodanszky, “Principles of Peptide Synthesis, Second Edition” Springer Verlag Ed, Berlin (1993). Coupling reagents include CDI, DIC, and EDCI. Optionally, an intermediate activated ester can be prepared by adding one equivalent of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole. Other coupling reagents include HATU, HBTU, and Py-Brop which are usually reacted in the presence of one equivalent of a tertiary base such as DIEA or TEA. Protection and deprotection of functional groups may be required before or after the amide formation step to afford a compound of Formula (I).\n\n\n\nThe intermediate acid of Formula (Ia) can be prepared in several different ways. For example, it can be prepared according to the steps described in Scheme 1. Thus, amines 1 (prepared following the methods shown in later Schemes and in the Examples) react with phenyl or pyridyl acetate derivatives 2 (Y is substituted phenyl or pyridyl) under basic conditions to give 3. X is a leaving group such as Cl, Br, OSO\n2\nMe or OSO\n2\nCF\n3 \nand P is a protecting group such as methyl or benzyl. Deprotection of P in 3 by hydrolysis or hydrogenation gives acid intermediates Ia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcids Ia with Y as substituted phenyl and W as NH can be prepared by a Petasis boronic acid Mannich reaction (\nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n1997, 119, 445-446) shown in Scheme 2. Amines 1 react with phenyl boronic acid, derivatives 4 and glyoxylic acid 5 in a suitable solvent such as 1,2-dichloroethane and toluene or acetonitrile and DMF to give the acids 6 directly. Many phenyl boronic acid derivatives are commercial available. They can also be prepared by methods known in the art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcids 6 can also be prepared by reductive amination (\nTetrahedron, \n1996, 52, 9777-9784) of α-keto acids 7 with amines 1 as shown in Scheme 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively to Schemes 2 and 3, as exemplified in Scheme 4, acids 6 can be prepared from amino-esters 9. Amino-esters 9 can be accessed through a Strecker type synthesis, by condensation of aldehydes 8 with trimethylsilylcyanide in presence of ammonia, followed by treatment with hydrochloric acid in MeOH. Compounds 9 can be converted to 11 via coupling with aryl halides or sulfonates 10 by methods known in the art (Huang, X. et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n2003, 125, 6653-6655). For example, amino-esters 9 may be coupled to aryl halides 10 in the presence of a palladium catalyst, an appropriate ligand, for example, BINAP, and a base such as cesium carbonate to provide esters 11. Deprotection of 11 under controlled condition gives 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmines of Formula (Ib) may be prepared in different ways depending on the ring size and substituents. A general method to prepare N-heterocycles of formula Ib may be via palladium catalyzed coupling of lactam-derived ketene animal with aryl boronic acids, as shown in Scheme 5. Thus, treatment of properly protected lactam 12 with base such as LDA at low temperature and trapping the enolate with diphenylphosphoryl chloride gives the ketene aminal diphenylphosphate 13. Diphenylphosphate 13 undergoes palladium catalyzed coupling with arylboronic acid 14 to give the coupled intermediate 15. Hydrogenation of the double bond in 15 and removal of the protecting group in 16 should give rise to α-aryl substituted N-heterocycle 17. The sequences described in scheme 5 are particularly useful for preparation of 5-, 6-, 7- and 8-membered N-heterocycles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 6 illustrate another general method to prepare N-heterocycles of Formula (Ib), particularly for the preparation of α-aryl substituted pyrrolidine and piperidine. Condensation of benzylamine 18 with diphenylketone gives Shiff base 19. Treatment of the Schiff base 19 with 1.0 equivalent of base such as LDA and mono-alkylation with a dielectrophile 20 gives intermediate amine 21 after acid hydrolysis. Intramolecular cyclization of 21 in the presence of base such as K\n2\nCO\n3 \nshould, give rise to α-aryl substituted N-heterocycle 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctionalized phenylpyrrolidines can be prepared by the procedures described in Schemes 7-11. In Scheme 7, palladium catalyzed coupling of Boc protected 2-pyrrole boronic acid 23 with substituted phenyl halide 24 (X═Br or I) gives α-aryl pyrrole 25. Aryl pyrrole 25 can be hydrogenated with a catalyst such as Pt/C, PtO\n2\n/C and Pd(OH)\n2\n/C in a solvent such as MeOH to Boc-protected aryl pyrrolidine 26. At this stage, the R\n10a \nand R\n10b \ngroups can be manipulated to the desired functional groups. Treatment of the Boc protected 2-aryl pyrrolidine 26 with acid, such as HCl in dioxane or TFA gives the pyrrolidine 27.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Scheme 8, reduction of chloro ketone 28 gives hydroxy chlorides 29. Hydroxy chloride 29 can be converted to azides 30, e.g. by the action of DPPA/DBU, Reduction of the azides with PPh\n3 \nto amines 31, followed by base-promoted intramolecular cyclization gives the functionalized phenylpyrrolidines 27. It is known that the reduction of the aryl ketones like 28 can be achieved enantioselectively with chiral boranes, e.g. B-chlorodiisopinocamphenyl borane (Dip-Cl, Brown, H. C. et al, \nTetrahedron Lett. \n1994, 35, 2141-2144). It is possible that both enantiomers of 27 can be prepared with the proper choice of chiral borane reagent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 9 illustrate the preparation of arylpyrrolidine carboxylate. Condensation of aryl aldehyde 32 with γ-aminobutyric ester 33 (R=Me, Et) gives imine 34. Intramolecular cyclization of 34 in the presence of catalyst such as TiCl\n4 \nand base Et\n3\nN gives rise to arylpyrrolidine carboxylate 35.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 10 illustrates a ring closing metathesis (RCM) route to functionalized phenylpyrroldine derivative 43. Condensation of aldehyde 32 with sulfinamide 36 (racemic or chiral, R is tert-butyl or p-tolyl) in the presence of titanium tetraethoxide gives activated imine 37. Sulfinimine 37 is then treated with vinyl Grignard reagent to give intermediate 38. High diastereoselectivity towards 38 may be achieved with a chiral sulfinamide 36 and with a proper choice of reaction condition. N-allylation of 38 with a substituted allylbromide 39 gives a diene intermediate 40 which can undergo ring closing metathesis (RCM) to give dihydropyrrole 41. Sulfinamide in 41 can be removed under acidic condition and the dihydropyrrole re-protected with a more common protecting group, e.g. a Boc to intermediate 42. Hydrogenation and deprotection of 42 gives rise to functionalized phenylpyrrolidine 43.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 11 illustrate a variation of scheme 10 using RCM to the synthesis of phenylpyrrolidine derivative 50 from Baylis-Hillman adduct 46. Thus three component condensation of aldehyde 32, sulfonamide 44 (R is tert-butyl or p tolyl) and acrylate or vinyl ketone 45 in the presence of a base, e.g. DABCO, gives Baylis-Hillman adduct 46. N-allylation of 46 with allylbromide gives a diene intermediate 47 which can undergo ring closing metathesis (RCM) to give dihydropyrrole 48. Sulfonamide in 48 can be removed and the dihydropyrrole re-protected with a more common protecting group, e.g. a Boc to intermediate 49. Hydrogenation and deprotection of 49 gives rise to functionalized phenylpyrrolidine 50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compound of the instant invention herein described may have asymmetric centers. For example, the chiral carbon atoms in Formula (I) as indicated below, exist in either as S or R configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the stereoisomeric configurations of each compound of the present invention are considered part of the invention. For example, but not limited to therein, in compounds of Formula (II), the following four stereoisomeric configurations are possible:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThey are collectively, as well as individually, considered part of the invention. In a preferred stereoisomeric embodiment the present invention provides for a stereoisomeric configuration of isomer-1 for all embodiments of Formula (I), (II) or (III), or tautomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or prodrug form thereof.\n\n\n\nIn the following experimental procedures, solution ratios express a volume relationship, unless stated otherwise. NMR chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm).\n\n\nProducts were analyzed by reverse phase analytical HPLC carried out on a Shimadzu Analytical HPLC system running DiscoveryVP software using Method A: Phenomenex Luna C18 column (4.6×50 mm or 4.6×75 mm) eluted at 4 mL/min with a 4 or 8 min gradient from 100% A to 100% B (A: 10% methanol, 89.9% water, 0.1% TFA; B: 10% water, 89.9% methanol, 0.1% TFA, UV 220 nm), or Method B: Phenomenex Luna C18 column (4.6×50 mm) eluted at 4 mL/min with a 4 min gradient from 100% A to 100% B (A: 10% acetonitrile, 89.9% water, 0.1% TFA; B: 10% water, 89.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA, UV 220 nm).

LCMS chromatograms were obtained on a Shimadzu HPLC system running DiscoveryVP software, coupled with a Waters ZQ mass spectrometer running MassLynx version 3.5 software using the same columns and conditions as utilized for analytical described above.\n\n\nIV. BIOLOGY\n\n\nWhile blood coagulation is essential to the regulation of an organism's hemostasis, it is also involved in many pathological conditions. In thrombosis, a blood clot, or thrombus, may form and obstruct circulation locally, causing ischemia and organ damage. Alternatively, in a process known as embolism, the clot may dislodge and subsequently become trapped in a distal vessel, where it again causes ischemia and organ damage. Diseases arising from pathological thrombus formation are collectively referred to as thromboembolic disorders and include acute coronary syndrome, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, thrombosis in the cavity of the heart, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, transient ischemic attack, and pulmonary embolism, hi addition, thrombosis occurs on artificial surfaces in contact with blood, including catheters, stents, and artificial heart valves.\n\n\nSome conditions contribute to the risk of developing thrombosis. For example, alterations of the vessel wall, changes in the flow of blood, and alterations in the composition of the vascular compartment. These risk factors are collectively known as Virchow's triad. (Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Basic Principles and Clinical practice, page 853, 5\nth \nEdition, 2006, edited by Colman, R. W. et al. Published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)\n\n\nAntithrombotic agents are frequently given to patients at risk of developing thromboembolic disease because of the presence of one or more predisposing risk factors from Virchow's triad to prevent formation of an occlusive thrombus (primary prevention). For example, in an orthopedic surgery setting (e.g., hip and knee replacement), an antithrombotic agent is frequently administered prior to a surgical procedure. The antithrombotic agent counterbalances the prothrombotic stimulus exerted by vascular flow alterations (stasis), potential surgical vessel wall injury, as well as changes in the composition of the blood due to the acute phase response related to surgery. Another example of the use of an antithrombotic agent for primary prevention is dosing with aspirin, a platelet activation inhibitor, in patients at risk for developing thrombotic cardiovascular disease. Well recognized risk factors in this setting include age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lipid alterations, and obesity.\n\n\nAntithrombotic agents are also indicated for secondary prevention, following an initial thrombotic episode. For example, patients with mutations in factor V (also known as factor V Leiden) and additional risk factors (e.g., pregnancy), are dosed with anticoagulants to prevent the reoccurrence of venous thrombosis. Another example entails secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. In a clinical setting, a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel (or other thienopyridines) may be used to prevent a second thrombotic event.\n\n\nAntithrombotic agents are also given to treat the disease state (i.e., by arresting its development) after it has already started. For example, patients presenting with deep vein thrombosis are treated with anticoagulants (i.e. heparin, warfarin, or LMWH) to prevent further growth of the venous occlusion. Over time, these agents also cause a regression of the disease state because the balance between prothrombotic factors and anticoagulant/profibrinolytic pathways is changed in favor of the latter. Examples on the arterial vascular bed include the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome with aspirin and clopidogrel to prevent further growth of vascular occlusions and eventually leading to a regression of thrombotic occlusions.\n\n\nThus, antithrombotic agents are used widely for primary and secondary prevention (i.e., prophylaxis or risk reduction) of thromboembolic disorders, as well as treatment of an already existing thrombotic process. Drugs that inhibit blood coagulation, or anticoagulants, are “pivotal agents for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders” (Hirsh, J, et al. \nBlood \n2005, 105, 453-463).\n\n\nBecause of its key role in the coagulation cascade, researchers have postulated that inhibition of factor VIIa could be used to treat or prevent thromboembolic diseases. (Girard, T. J.; Nicholson, N. S. \nCurr. Opin. Pharmacol. \n2001, 1, 159-463; Lazarus, R. A., et al. \nCurr. Med. Chem. \n2004, 11, 2275-2290; Frederick, R. et al. \nCurr. Med. Chem. \n2005, 12, 397-417.) Several studies have confirmed that various biological and small molecule inhibitors of factor VIIa have in vivo antithrombotic efficacy with a low bleeding liability. For instance, it has been demonstrated that a biological factor VIIa inhibitor XK1, comprising a hybrid of Factor X light chain and tissue factor pathway inhibitor first kunitz domain, prevents thrombus formation in a rat model of arterial thrombosis, with no change in bleeding time or total blood loss (Szalony, J. A, et al. \nJ. Thrombosis and Thrombolysis \n2002, 14, 113-121). In addition, small molecule active site directed, factor VIIa inhibitors have demonstrated, antithrombotic efficacy in animal models of arterial thrombosis (Suleymanov, O., et al. \nJ Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics \n2003, 306, 1115-1121; Olivero, A. G. et al. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n2005, 280, 9160-9169; Young, W. B., et al. \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. \n2006, 16, 2037-2041; Zbinden, K. G. et al. \nBioorg. Med. Chem. \n2006, 14, 5357-5369) and venous thrombosis (Szalony, J. A., et al, Thrombosis Research 2003, 112, 167-174; Arnold, C. S., et al. \nThrombosis Research \n2006, 117, 343-349), with little impact on bleeding time or blood loss. Moreover, the biological factor VIIa inhibitor recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2(rNAPc2) is currently under clinical investigation for treatment of acute coronary syndromes. Results of initial clinical trials demonstrate that rNAPc2 prevents deep vein thrombosis in patients undergoing total knee replacement (Lee, A., et al. \nCirculation \n2001, 104, 74-78), reduces systemic thrombin generation in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty (Moons, A. H. M. \nJ. Am. Coll. Cardiol. \n2003, 41, 2147-2153) and reduces magnitude and duration of ischemic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (Giugliano, R. P. et al. World Congress of Cardiology 2006, Barcelona, Poster #3897).\n\n\nWork has accordingly been performed to identify and optimize factor VIIa inhibitors. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,542 describes recombinant nematode anticoagulant proteins which inhibit factor VIIa. U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,442 discloses monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments possessing factor VIIa inhibitory activity, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,236 presents tripeptides and tripeptide derivatives that inhibit factor VIIa.\n\n\nWhile a number of factor VIIa inhibitors have been discussed in the art, improved inhibitors, especially non-peptide inhibitors, of serine proteases for the treatment of thromboembolic disorders are always desirable. The present invention discloses bicyclic lactam derivatives, and analogues thereof, as inhibitors of coagulation Factor VIIa and, as such, their utility in the treatment of thromboembolic disorders.\n\n\nAlso, it is preferred to find new compounds with improved activity in in vitro clotting assays, compared with known serine protease inhibitors, such as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or the prothrombin time (PT) assay. (For a description of the aPTT and PT assays see, Goodnight, S. H.; Hathaway, W. E. Screening Tests of Hemostasis. \nDisorders of Thrombosis and Hemostasis: a clinical guide, \n2\nnd \nedition, McGraw-Hill: New York, 2001 pp. 41-51).\n\n\nIt is also desirable to find new compounds with improved pharmacological characteristics compared with known factor VIIa inhibitors. For example, it is preferred to find new compounds with improved factor VIIa inhibitory activity and improved selectivity for factor VIIa versus other serine proteases. It is also desirable and preferable to find compounds with advantageous and improved characteristics in one or more of the following categories that are given as examples, and not intended to be limiting: (a) pharmacokinetic properties, including oral bioavailability, half life, and clearance; (b) pharmaceutical properties; (c) dosage requirements; (d) factors which decrease blood concentration peak-to-trough characteristics; (e) factors that increase the concentration of active drug at the receptor; (f) factors that decrease the liability for clinical drug-drug interactions; (g) factors that decrease the potential for adverse side-effects, including selectivity versus other biological targets; and (h) factors that improve manufacturing costs or feasibility.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “patient” encompasses all mammalian species.\n\n\nAs used herein, “treating” or “treatment” cover the treatment of a disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, and include: (a) inhibiting the disease-state, i.e., arresting its development; and/or (b) relieving the disease-state, i.e., causing regression of the disease state.\n\n\nAs used herein, “prophylaxis” or ‘prevention’ cover the preventive treatment of a subclinical disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, aimed at reducing the probability of the occurance of a clinical disease-state. Patients are selected for preventative therapy based on factors that are known to increase risk of suffering a clinical disease state compared to the general population. “Prophylaxis” therapies can be divided into (a) primary prevention and (b) secondary prevention. Primary prevention is defined as treatment in a subject that has not yet presented with a clinical disease state, whereas secondary prevention is defined as preventing a second occurance of the same or similar clinical disease state.\n\n\nAs used herein, “risk reduction” covers therapies that lower the incidence of development of a clinical disease state. As such, primary and secondary prevention therapies are examples of risk reduction.\n\n\n“Therapeutically effective amount” is intended to include an amount of a compound of the present invention that is effective when administered alone or in combination with other active ingredients to inhibit factor VIIa or to prevent or treat the disorders listed herein. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the preventive or therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously.\n\n\nThe term “thrombosis”, as used herein, refers to formation or presence of a thrombus (pl. thrombi); clotting within a blood vessel that may cause ischemia or infarction of tissues supplied by the vessel. The term “embolism”, as used herein, refers to sudden blocking of an artery by a clot or foreign material that has been brought to its site of lodgment by the blood current. The term “thromboembolism”, as used herein, refers to obstruction of a blood vessel with thrombotic material carried by the blood stream from the site of origin to plug another vessel. The term “thromboembolic disorders” entails both “thrombotic” and “embolic” disorders (defined vide supra).\n\n\nThe term “thromboembolic disorders (or conditions)” as used herein includes arterial or venous cardiovascular or cerebovascular thromboembolic disorders, and thromboembolic disorders in the chambers of the heart or in the peripheral circulation. The term “thromboembolic disorders” as used herein also includes specific disorders selected from, but not limited to, unstable angina or other acute coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, first or recurrent myocardial infarction, ischemic sudden death, transient ischemic attack, stroke, atherosclerosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, arterial embolism, coronary arterial thrombosis, cerebral arterial thrombosis, cerebral embolism, kidney embolisms, pulmonary embolisms, and thrombosis resulting from medical implants, devices, of procedures in which blood is exposed to an artificial surface that promotes thrombosis. The medical implants or devices include, but are not limited to: prosthetic valves, artificial valves, indwelling catheters, stents, blood oxygenators, shunts, vascular access ports, and vessel grafts. The procedures include, but are not limited to: cardiopulmonary bypass, percutaneous coronary intervention, and hemodialysis. In another embodiment, the term “thromboembolic disorders” includes acute coronary syndrome, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from unstable angina, an acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, atherosclerosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, arterial embolism, coronary arterial thrombosis, cerebral arterial thrombosis, cerebral embolism, kidney embolism, pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis resulting from medical implants, devices, or procedures in which blood is exposed to an artificial surface that promotes thrombosis. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from acute coronary syndrome, stroke, venous thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, and thrombosis resulting from medical implants and devices.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the primary prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from unstable angina, an acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, ischemic sudden death, transient ischemic attack, stroke, atherosclerosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, arterial embolism, coronary arterial thrombosis, cerebral arterial thrombosis, cerebral embolism, kidney embolism, pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis resulting from medical implants, devices, or procedures in which blood is exposed to an artificial surface that promotes thrombosis. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the primary prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from acute coronary syndrome, stroke, venous thrombosis, and thrombosis resulting from medical implants and devices.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the secondary prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from unstable angina, an acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, recurrent myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, atherosclerosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, arterial embolism, coronary arterial thrombosis, cerebral arterial thrombosis, cerebral embolism, kidney embolism, pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis resulting from medical implants, devices, or procedures in which blood is exposed to an artificial surface that promotes thrombosis. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the secondary prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from acute coronary syndrome, stroke, atrial fibrillation and venous thrombosis.\n\n\nThe term “stroke”, as used herein, refers to embolic stroke or atherothrombotic stroke arising from occlusive thrombosis in the carotid communis, carotid interna, or intracerebral arteries.\n\n\nIt is noted that thrombosis includes vessel occlusion (e.g. after a bypass) and reocclusion (e.g., during or after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty). The thromboembolic disorders may result from conditions including but not limited to atherosclerosis, surgery or surgical complications, prolonged immobilization, atrial fibrillation, congenital thrombophilia, cancer, diabetes, effects of medications or hormones, and complications of pregnancy.\n\n\nThromboembolic disorders are frequently associated with patients with atherosclerosis. Risk factors for atherosclerosis include but are not limited to male gender, age, hypertension, lipid disorders, and diabetes mellitus. Risk factors for atherosclerosis are at the same time risk factors for complications of atherosclerosis, i.e., thromboembolic disorders.\n\n\nSimilarly, arterial fibrillation is frequently associated with thromboembolic disorders. Risk factors for arterial fibrillation and subsequent thromboembolic disorders include cardiovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, nonrheumatic mitral valve disease, hypertensive cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, and a variety of miscellaneous cardiac abnormalities as well as thyrotoxicosis.\n\n\nDiabetes mellitus is frequently associated with atherosclerosis and thromboembolic disorders. Risk factors for the more common type 2 include but are not limited to are family history, obesity, physical inactivity, race/ethnicity, previously impaired fasting glucose or glucose tolerance test, history of gestational diabetes mellitus or delivery of a ‘big baby’, hypertension, low HDL cholesterol, and polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\n\nRisk factor for congenital thrombophilia include gain of function mutations in coagulation factors or loss of function mutations in the anticoagulant- or fibrinolytic pathways.\n\n\nThrombosis has been associated with a variety of tumor types, e.g., pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, brain tumors, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, gastrointestinal malignancies, and Hodgkins or non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Recent studies suggest that the frequency of cancer in patients with thrombosis reflects the frequency of a particular cancer type in the general population. (Levitan, N. et al. \nMedicine \n(Baltimore) 1999, 78(5):285-291; Levine M. et al \nN Engl J Med \n1996, 334(11):677-681; Blom, J. W. et al. \nJAMA: \n2005, 293(6); 715-722.) Hence, the most common cancers associated with thrombosis in men are prostate, colorectal, brain, and lung cancer, and in women are breast, ovary, and lung cancer. The observed rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients is significant. The varying rates of VTE between different tumor types are most likely related to the selection of the patient population. Cancer patients at risk for thrombosis may possess any or all of the following risk factors: (i) the stage of the cancer (i.e. presence of metastases), (ii) the presence of central vein catheters, (iii) surgery and anticancer therapies including chemotherapy, and (iv) hormones and antiangiogenic drugs. Thus, it is common clinical practice to dose patients having advanced tumors with heparin or low molecular heparin to prevent thromboembolic disorders. A number of low molecular heparin preparations have been approved by the FDA for these indications.\n\n\nThere are three main clinical situations when considering the prevention of VTE in a medical cancer patient: (i) the patient is bedridden for prolonged periods of time; (ii) the ambulatory patient is receiving chemotherapy or radiation; and (iii) the patient is with indwelling central vein catheters. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are effective antithrombotic agents in cancer patients undergoing surgery. (Mismetti, P. et al. \nBritish Journal of Surgery \n2001, 88:913-930.)\n\n\nA. In Vitro Assays\n\n\nThe effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as inhibitors of the coagulation factors VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa or thrombin, can be determined using a relevant purified serine protease, respectively, and an appropriate synthetic substrate. The rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate by the relevant serine protease was measured both in the absence and presence of compounds of the present invention. Hydrolysis of the substrate resulted, in the release of para-nitroaniline (pNA), which was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the increase in absorbance at 405 nM, or the release of aminomethylcoumarin (AMC), which was monitored spectrofluorometrically by measuring the increase in emission at 460 nM with excitation at 380 nM. A decrease in the rate of absorbance change at 405 nM in the presence of inhibitor is indicative of enzyme inhibition. Such methods are known to one skilled in the art. The results of this assay are expressed as inhibitory constant, K\ni\n.\n\n\nFactor VIIa determinations were made in 0.005 M calcium chloride, 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.05 M HEPES buffer containing 0.5% PEG 8000 at a pH of 7.5. Determinations were made using purified human Factor VIIa (Haematologic Technologies) or recombinant human Factor VIIa (Novo Nordisk) at a final assay concentration of 1-5 nM, recombinant soluble tissue factor at a concentration of 10-40 nM and the synthetic substrate H-D-Ile-Pro-Arg-pNA (S-2288; Chromogenix or BMPM-2; AnaSpec) at a concentration of 0.001-0.0075 M.\n\n\nFactor IXa determinations were made in 0.005 M calcium chloride, 0.1M sodium chloride, 0.0001 M Refludan (Berlex), 0.05 M TRIS base and 0.5% PEG 8000 at a pH of 7.4. Refludan was added to inhibit small amounts of thrombin in the commercial preparations of human Factor IXa. Determinations were made using purified human Factor IXa (Haematologic Technologies) at a final assay concentration of 20-100 nM and the synthetic substrate PCIXA2100-B (CenterChem) or Pefafluor IXa 3688 (H-D-Leu-Phe-Gly-Arg-AMC; CenterChem) at a concentration of 0.0004-0.0005 M.\n\n\nFactor Xa determinations were made in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.4 containing 0.2 M sodium chloride and 0.5% PEG 8000. Determinations were made using purified human Factor Xa (Haematologic Technologies) at a final assay concentration of 150-1000 pM and the synthetic substrate S-2222 (Bz-Ile-Glu(gamma-OMe, 50%)-Gly-Arg-pNA; Chromogenix) at a concentration of 0.0002-0.00035 M.\n\n\nFactor XIa determinations were made in 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 containing 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, and 0.1% PEG 8000 (polyethylene glycol; JT Baker or Fisher Scientific). Determinations were made using purified human Factor XIa at a final concentration of 75-200 pM (Haematologic Technologies) and the synthetic substrate S-2366 (pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA; Chromogenix) at a concentration of 0.0002-0.001 M.\n\n\nFactor XIIa determinations were made in 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 containing 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, and 0.1% PEG 8000. Determinations were made using purified human Factor XIIa at a final concentration of 4 nM (American Diagnostica) and the synthetic substrate Spectrozyme #312 (pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA; American Diagnostica) at a concentration of 0.00015 M.\n\n\nThrombin determinations were made in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.5 containing 0.2 M sodium chloride and 0.5% PEG 8000. Determinations were made using purified human alpha thrombin (Haematologic Technologies or Enzyme Research Laboratories) at a final assay concentration of 200-250 pM and the synthetic substrate S-2366 (pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA; Chromogenix) at a concentration of 0.0002-0.00026 M.\n\n\nThe Michaelis constant, K\nm\n, for substrate hydrolysis by each protease was determined at 25° C. using the method of Lineweaver and Burk. Values of K\ni \nwere determined by allowing the protease to react with the substrate in the presence of the inhibitor. Reactions were allowed to go for periods of 20-180 minutes (depending on the protease) and the velocities (rate of absorbance change vs time) were measured. The following relationship was used to calculate K\ni \nvalues:\n\n\n(\nv\n \nO\n \n−v\n \ns\n)/\nv\n \nS\n \n=I\n/(\nK\n \ni\n(1\n+S/K\n \nm\n)) for a competitive inhibitor with one binding site; or\n\n\n\nv\n \nS\n \n/v\n \nO\n \n=A\n+((\nB−A\n)/1+(\nIC\n \n50\n/(\nI\n)\nn\n))) and\n\n\n\nK\n \ni\n \n=IC\n \n50\n/(1\n+S/K\n \nm\n) for a competitive inhibitor\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere:\n \nv\nO \nis the velocity of the control in the absence of inhibitor;\n \nv\nS \nis the velocity in the presence of inhibitor;\n \nI is the concentration of inhibitor;\n \nA is the minimum activity remaining (usually locked at zero);\n \nB is the maximum activity remaining (usually locked at 1.0);\n \nn is the Hill coefficient, a measure of the number and cooperativity of potential inhibitor binding sites;\n \nIC\n50 \nis the concentration of inhibitor that produces 50% inhibition under the assay conditions;\n \nK\ni \nis the dissociation constant of the enzyme:inhibitor complex;\n \nS is the concentration of substrate; and\n \nK\nm \nis the Michaelis constant for the substrate.\n \n \n \n\n\nThe selectivity of a compound may be evaluated by taking the ratio of the K\ni \nvalue for a given protease with the K\ni \nvalue for the protease of interest (i.e., selectivity for FVIIa versus protease P=K\ni \nfor protease P/K\ni \nfor FVIIa). Compounds with selectivity ratios >20 are considered selective. Compounds with selectivity ratios >100 are preferred, and compounds with selectivity ratios >500 are more preferred.\n\n\nThe effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as inhibitors of coagulation can be determined using a standard or modified clotting assay. An increase in the plasma clotting time in the presence of inhibitor is indicative of anticoagulation. Relative clotting time is the clotting time in the presence of an inhibitor divided by the clotting time in the absence of an inhibitor. The results of this assay may be expressed as IC1.5× or IC2×, the inhibitor concentration required to increase the clotting time by 50 or 100 percent, respectively. The IC1.5× or IC2× is found by linear interpolation from relative clotting time versus inhibitor concentration plots using inhibitor concentration that spans the IC1.5× or IC2×.\n\n\nClotting times are determined using citrated normal human plasma as well as plasma obtained from a number of laboratory animal species (e.g., rat, or rabbit). A compound is diluted into plasma beginning with a 10 mM DMSO stock solution. The final concentration of DMSO is less than 2%. Plasma clotting assays are performed in an automated coagulation analyzer (Sysmex, Dade-Behring, Ill.). Similarly, clotting times can be determined from laboratory animal species or humans dosed with compounds of the invention.\n\n\nActivated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) is determined using Alexin (Trinity Biotech, Ireland) following the directions in the package insert. Plasma (0.05 mL) is warmed to 37° C. for 1 minute. Alexin (0.05 mL) is added to the plasma and incubated for an additional 2 to 5 minutes. Calcium chloride (25 mM, 0.05 mL) is added to the reaction to initiate coagulation. The clotting time is the time in seconds from the moment calcium chloride is added until a clot is detected.\n\n\nProthrombin Time (PT) is determined using thromboplastin (Thromboplastin C Plus, Dade-Behring, Illinois) following the directions in the package insert. Plasma (0.05 mL) is warmed to 37° C. for 1 minute. Thromboplastin (0.1 mL) is added to the plasma to initiate coagulation. The clotting time is the time in seconds from the moment thromboplastin is added until a clot is detected.\n\n\nB. In Vivo Assays\n\n\nThe effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as antithrombotic agents can be determined using relevant in vivo thrombosis models, including In Vivo Electrically-induced Carotid Artery Thrombosis Models and In Vivo Rabbit Arterio-venous Shunt Thrombosis Models.\n\n\na. In Vivo Electrically-induced Carotid Artery Thrombosis (ECAT) Model\n\n\nThe rabbit ECAT model, described by Wong et al. (\nJ Pharmacol Exp Ther \n2000, 295, 212-218), can be used in this study. Male New Zealand White rabbits are anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg+50 mg/kg/h IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg+10 mg/kg/h IM). These anesthetics are supplemented as needed. An electromagnetic flow probe is placed on a segment of an isolated carotid artery to monitor blood flow. Test agents or vehicle will be given (i.v., i.p., s.c., or orally) prior to or after the initiation of thrombosis. Drug treatment prior to initiation of thrombosis is used to model the ability of test agents to prevent and reduce the risk of thrombus formation, whereas dosing after initiation is used to model the ability to treat existing thrombotic disease. Thrombus formation is induced by electrical stimulation of the carotid artery for 3 min at 4 mA using an external stainless-steel bipolar electrode. Carotid blood flow is measured continuously over a 90-min period to monitor thrombus-induced occlusion. Total carotid blood flow over 90 min is calculated by the trapezoidal rule. Average carotid flow over 90 min is then determined by converting total carotid blood flow over 90 min to percent of total control carotid blood flow, which would result if control blood flow had been maintained continuously for 90 min. The ED\n50 \n(dose that increased average carotid blood flow over 90 min to 50% of the control) of compounds are estimated by a nonlinear least square regression program using the Hill sigmoid E\nmax \nequation (DeltaGraph; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill.).\n\n\nb. In Vivo Rabbit Arterio-venous (AV) Shunt Thrombosis Model\n\n\nThe rabbit AV shunt model, described by Wong et al. (Wong, P. C. et al. \nJ Pharmacol Exp Ther \n2000, 292, 351-357), can be used in this study. Male New Zealand White rabbits are anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg+50 mg/kg/h IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg+10 mg/kg/h IM). These anesthetics are supplemented as needed. The femoral artery, jugular vein and femoral vein are isolated and catheterized. A saline-filled AV shunt device is connected between the femoral arterial and the femoral venous cannulae. The AV shunt device consists of an outer piece of tygon tubing (length=8 cm; internal diameter=7.9 mm) and an inner piece of tubing (length=2.5 cm; internal diameter=4.8 mm). The AV shunt also contains an 8-cm-long 2-0 silk thread (Ethicon, Somerville, N.J.). Blood flows from the femoral artery via the AV-shunt into the femoral vein. The exposure of flowing blood to a silk thread induces the formation of a significant thrombus. Forty minutes later, the shunt is disconnected and the silk thread covered with thrombus is weighed. Test agents or vehicle will be given (i.v., i.p., s.c, or orally) prior to the opening of the AV shunt. The percentage inhibition of thrombus formation is determined for each treatment group. The ID\n50 \nvalues (dose which produces 50% inhibition of thrombus formation) are estimated by a nonlinear least square regression program using the Hill sigmoid E\nmax \nequation (DeltaGraph; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill.).\n\n\nV. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS, FORMULATIONS AND COMBINATIONS\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention can be administered in such oral dosage forms as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups, and emulsions. They may also be administered in intravenous (bolus or infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular form, all using dosage forms well known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. They can be administered alone, but generally will be administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutical composition” means a composition comprising a compound of the invention in combination with at least one additional pharmaceutical acceptable carrier. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to media generally accepted in the art for the delivery of biologically active agents to animals, in particular, mammals, including, i.e., adjuvant, excipient or vehicle, such as diluents, preserving agents, fillers, flow regulating agents, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, lubricating agents and dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of those of ordinary skill in the art. These include, without limitation: the type and nature of the active agent being formulated; the subject to which the agent-containing composition is to be administered; the intended route of administration of the composition; and, the therapeutic indication being targeted. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include both aqueous and non-aqueous liquid media, as well as a variety of solid and semi-solid dosage forms. Such carriers can include a number of different ingredients and additives in addition to the active agent, such additional ingredients being included in the formulation for a variety of reasons, e.g., stabilization of the active agent, binders, etc., well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and factors involved in their selection, are found in a variety of readily available sources such as, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n18\nth \nEdition, 1990.\n\n\nThe dosage regimen for the compounds of the present invention will, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the species, age, sex, health, medical condition, and weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; the route of administration, the renal and hepatic function of the patient, and the effect desired. A physician or veterinarian can determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the thromboembolic disorder.\n\n\nBy way of general guidance, the daily oral dosage of each active ingredient, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.001 to about 1000 mg/kg of body weight, preferably between about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, and most preferably between about 0.1 to about 20 mg/kg/day. Intravenously, the most preferred doses will range from about 0.001 to about 10 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. Compounds of this invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily.\n\n\nCompounds of this invention can also be administered by parenteral administration (e.g., intra-venous, intra-arterial, intra-musculary, or sub-cutaneously. When administered intra-venous or intra-arterial, the dose can be given continuously or intermittend. Furthermore, formulation can be developed for intramusculary and subcutaneous delivery that ensure a gradual release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.\n\n\nCompounds of this invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using transdermal skin patches. When administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.\n\n\nThe compounds are typically administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients, or carriers (collectively referred to herein as pharmaceutical carriers) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, e.g., oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, and syrups, and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices.\n\n\nFor instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, starch, sucrose, glucose, methyl callulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like; for oral administration in liquid form, the oral drug components can be combined with any oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth, or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, and the like.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phosphatidylcholines.\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxide-polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacylates, and crosslinked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.\n\n\nDosage forms (pharmaceutical compositions) suitable for administration may contain from about 1 milligram to about 1000 milligrams of active ingredient per dosage unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.1-95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.\n\n\nGelatin capsules may contain the active ingredient and powdered carriers, such as lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and flavoring to increase patient acceptance.\n\n\nIn general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose (glucose), and related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid, either alone or combined, are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In addition, parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propylparaben, and chlorobutanol.\n\n\nSuitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\n, Mack Publishing Company, a standard reference text in this field.\n\n\nWhere the compounds of this invention are combined, with other anticoagulant agents, for example, a daily dosage may be about 0.1 to about 100 milligrams of the compound of the present invention and about 0.1 to about 100 milligrams per kilogram of patient body weight. For a tablet dosage form, the compounds of this invention generally may be present in an amount of about 5 to about 100 milligrams per dosage unit, and the second anti-coagulant in an amount of about 1 to about 50 milligrams per dosage unit.\n\n\nWhere the compounds of the present invention are administered in combination with an anti-platelet agent, by way of general guidance, typically a daily dosage may be about 0.01 to about 25 milligrams of the compound of the present invention and about 50 to about 150 milligrams of the anti-platelet agent, preferably about 0.1 to about 1 milligrams of the compound of the present invention and about 1 to about 3 milligrams of antiplatelet agents, per kilogram of patient body weight.\n\n\nWhere the compounds of the present invention are administered in combination with thrombolytic agent, typically a daily dosage may be about 0.1 to about 1 milligrams of the compound of the present invention, per kilogram of patient body weight and, in the case of the thrombolytic agents, the usual dosage of the thrombolyic agent when administered alone may be reduced by about 50-80% when administered with a compound of the present invention.\n\n\nParticularly when provided as a single dosage unit, the potential exists for a chemical interaction between the combined active ingredients. For this reason, when the compound of the present invention and a second therapeutic agent are combined in a single dosage unit they are formulated such that although the active ingredients are combined in a single dosage unit, the physical contact between the active ingredients is minimized (that is, reduced). For example, one active ingredient may be enteric coated. By enteric coating one of the active ingredients, it is possible not only to minimize the contact between the combined active ingredients, but also, it is possible to control the release of one of these components in the gastrointestinal tract such that one of these components is not released in the stomach but rather is released in the intestines. One of the active ingredients may also be coated with a material that affects a sustained-release throughout the gastrointestinal tract and also serves to minimize physical contact between the combined active ingredients. Furthermore, the sustained-released component can be additionally enteric coated such that the release of this component occurs only in the intestine. Still another approach would involve the formulation of a combination product in which the one component is coated with a sustained and/or enteric release polymer, and the other component is also coated with a polymer such as a low viscosity grade of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or other appropriate materials as known in the art, in order to further separate the active components. The polymer coating serves to form an additional barrier to interaction with the other component.\n\n\nThese as well as other ways of minimizing contact between the components of combination products of the present invention, whether administered in a single dosage form or administered in separate forms but at the same time by the same manner, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition further comprising additional therapeutic agent(s) selected from potassium channel openers, potassium channel blockers, calcium channel blockers, sodium hydrogen exchanger inhibitors, antiarrhythmic agents, antiatherosclerotic agents, anticoagulants, antithrombotic agents, prothrombolytic agents, fibrinogen antagonists, diuretics, antihypertensive agents, ATPase inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, antidiabetic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, antioxidants, angiogenesis modulators, antiosteoporosis agents, hormone replacement therapies, hormone receptor modulators, oral contraceptives, antiobesity agents, antidepressants, antianxiety agents, antipsychotic agents, antiproliferative agents, antitumor agents, antiulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease agents, growth hormone agents and/or growth hormone secretagogues, thyroid mimetics, anti-infective agents, antiviral agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, cholesterol/lipid lowering agents and lipid profile therapies, and agents that mimic ischemic preconditioning and/or myocardial stunning, or a combination thereof.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition further comprising additional therapeutic agent(s) selected from an anti-arrhythmic agent, an anti-hypertensive agent, an anti-coagulant agent, an anti-platelet agent, a thrombin inhibiting agent, a thrombolytic agent, a fibrinolytic agent, a calcium channel blocker, a potassium channel blocker, a cholesterol/lipid lowering agent, or a combination thereof.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition further comprising additional therapeutic agent(s) selected from warfarin, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, synthetic pentasaccharide, hirudin, argatroban, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulindac, indomethacin, mefenamate, dipyridamol, droxicam, diclofenac, sulfinpyrazone, piroxicam, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, tirofiban, eptifibatide, abciximab, melagatran, ximelagatran, disulfatohirudin, tissue plasminogen activator, modified tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase, urokinase, and streptokinase, or a combination thereof.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition wherein the additional therapeutic agent is an antihypertensive agent selected from ACE inhibitors, AT-1 receptor antagonists, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, ETA receptor antagonists, dual ETA7AT-1 receptor antagonists, renin inhibitors (alliskerin) and vasopepsidase inhibitors, an antiarrythmic agent selected from IKur inhibitors, an anticoagulant selected from thrombin inhibitors, antithrombin-III activators, heparin co-factor II activators, other factor VIIa inhibitors, other kallikrein inhibitors, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) antagonists, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) inhibitors, factor XIa inhibitors, factor IXa inhibitors, and factor Xa inhibitors, or an antiplatelet agent selected from GPIIb/IIIa blockers, GP Ib/IX blockers, protease activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) antagonists, protease activated receptor 4 (PAR-4) antagonists, prostaglandin E2 receptor EP3 antagonists, collagen receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-III inhibitors, P2Y\n1 \nreceptor antagonists, P2Y\n12 \nantagonists, thromboxane receptor antagonists, cyclooxygense-1 inhibitors, and aspirin, or a combination thereof.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides pharmaceutical composition, wherein the additional therapeutic agent(s) are an anti-platelet agent or a combination thereof.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, wherein the additional therapeutic agent is the anti-platelet agent clopidogrel.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents.

In most mammals, including humans and mice, antibodies are constructed from paired heavy and light polypeptide chains. Each chain is made up of individual immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, and thus the generic term immunoglobulin is used for such proteins. Each chain is made up of two distinct regions, referred to as the variable and constant regions. The light and heavy chain variable regions show significant sequence diversity between antibodies, and are responsible for binding the target antigen. The constant regions show less sequence diversity, and are responsible for binding a number of natural proteins to elicit important biochemical events. In humans there are five different classes of antibodies including IgA (which includes subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG (which includes subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), and IgM. The distinguishing features between these antibody classes are their constant regions, although subtler differences may exist in the V region. \nFIG. 1\n shows an IgG1 antibody, used here as an example to describe the general structural features of immunoglobulins. IgG antibodies are tetrameric proteins composed of two heavy chains and two light chains. The IgG heavy chain is composed of four immunoglobulin domains linked from N- to C-terminus in the order V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3, referring to the heavy chain variable domain, \nconstant gamma\n 1 domain, \nconstant gamma\n 2 domain, and \nconstant gamma\n 3 domain respectively. The IgG light chain is composed of two immunoglobulin domains linked from N- to C-terminus in the order V\nL\n-C\nL\n, referring to the light chain variable domain and the light chain constant domain respectively.\n\n\nThe variable region of an antibody contains the antigen binding determinants of the molecule, and thus determines the specificity of an antibody for its target antigen. The variable region is so named because it is the most distinct in sequence from other antibodies within the same class. The majority of sequence variability occurs in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). There are 6 CDRs total, three each per heavy and light chain, designated V\nH \nCDR1, V\nH \nCDR2, V\nH \nCDR3, V\nL \nCDR1, V\nL \nCDR2, and V\nL \nCDR3. The variable region outside of the CDRs is referred to as the framework (FR) region. Although not as diverse as the CDRs, sequence variability does occur in the FR region between different antibodies. Overall, this characteristic architecture of antibodies provides a stable scaffold (the FR region) upon which substantial antigen binding diversity (the CDRs) can be explored by the immune system to obtain specificity for a broad array of antigens. A number of high-resolution structures are available for a variety of variable region fragments from different organisms, some unbound and some in complex with antigen. The sequence and structural features of antibody variable regions are well characterized (Morea et al., 1997\n, Biophys Chem \n68:9-16; Morea et al., 2000\n, Methods \n20:267-279), and the conserved features of antibodies have enabled the development of a wealth of antibody engineering techniques (Maynard et al., 2000\n, Annu Rev Biomed Eng \n2:339-376). For example, it is possible to graft the CDRs from one antibody, for example a murine antibody, onto the framework region of another antibody, for example a human antibody. This process, referred to in the art as “humanization”, enables generation of less immunogenic antibody therapeutics from nonhuman antibodies. Fragments comprising the variable region can exist in the absence of other regions of the antibody, including for example the antigen binding fragment (Fab) comprising V\nH\n-Cγ1 and V\nH\n-C\nL\n, the variable fragment (Fv) comprising V\nH \nand V\nL\n, the single chain variable fragment (scFv) comprising V\nH \nand V\nL \nlinked together in the same chain, as well as a variety of other variable region fragments (Little et al., 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:364-370).\n\n\nThe Fc region of an antibody interacts with a number of Fc receptors and ligands, imparting an array of important functional capabilities referred to as effector functions. For IgG the Fc region, as shown in \nFIG. 1\n, comprises Ig domains Cγ2 and Cγ3 and the N-terminal hinge leading into Cγ2. An important family of Fc receptors for the IgG class are the Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs). These receptors mediate communication between antibodies and the cellular arm of the immune system (Raghavan et al., 1996\n, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol \n12:181-220; Ravetch et al., 2001\n, Annu Rev Immunol \n19:275-290). In humans this protein family includes FcγRI (CD64), including isoforms FcγRIa, FcγRIb, and FcγRIc; FcγRII (CD32), including isoforms FcγRIIa (including allotypes H131 and R131), FcγRIIb (including FcγRIIb-1 and FcγRIIb-2), and FcγRIIc; and FcγRIII (CD16), including isoforms FcγRIIIa (including allotypes V158 and F158) and FcγRIIIb (including allotypes FcγRIIIb-NA1 and FcγRIIIb-NA2) (Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65). These receptors typically have an extracellular domain that mediates binding to Fc, a membrane spanning region, and an intracellular domain that may mediate some signaling event within the cell. These receptors are expressed in a variety of immune cells including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, B cells, large granular lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and γγ T cells. Formation of the Fc/FcγR complex recruits these effector cells to sites of bound antigen, typically resulting in signaling events within the cells and important subsequent immune responses such as release of inflammation mediators, B cell activation, endocytosis, phagocytosis, and cytotoxic attack. The ability to mediate cytotoxic and phagocytic effector functions is a potential mechanism by which antibodies destroy targeted cells. The cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Raghavan et al., 1996\n, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol \n12:181-220; Ghetie et al., 2000\n, Annu Rev Immunol \n18:739-766; Ravetch et al., 2001\n, Annu Rev Immunol \n19:275-290). The cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). A number of structures have been solved of the extracellular domains of human FcγRs, including FcγRIIa (pdb accession code 1H9V) (Sondermann et al., 2001\n, J Mol Biol \n309:737-749) (pdb accession code 1FCG) (Maxwell et al., 1999\n, Nat Struct Biol \n6:437-442), FcγRIIb (pdb accession code 2FCB) (Sondermann et al., 1999\n, Embo J \n18:1095-1103); and FcγRIIIb (pdb accession code 1E4J) (Sondermann et al., 2000\n, Nature \n406:267-273). All FcγRs bind the same region on Fc, at the N-terminal end of the Cγ2 domain and the preceding hinge, shown in \nFIG. 2\n. This interaction is well characterized structurally (Sondermann et al., 2001\n, J Mol Biol \n309:737-749), and several structures of the human Fc bound to the extracellular domain of human FcγRIIIb have been solved (pdb accession code 1E4K) (Sondermann et al., 2000\n, Nature \n406:267-273) (pdb accession codes 1IIS and 1IIX) (Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16469-16477), as well as has the structure of the human IgE Fc/Fc□RI□ complex (pdb accession code 1F6A) (Garman et al., 2000\n, Nature \n406:259-266).\n\n\nThe different IgG subclasses have different affinities for the FcγRs, with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the receptors than IgG2 and IgG4 (Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65). All FcγRs bind the same region on IgG Fc, yet with different affinities: the high affinity binder FcγRI has a Kd for IgG1 of 10\n−8 \nM\n−1\n, whereas the low affinity receptors FcγRII and FcγRIII generally bind at 10\n−6 \nand 10\n−5 \nrespectively. The extracellular domains of FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb are 96% identical, however FcγRIIIb does not have a intracellular signaling domain. Furthermore, whereas FcγRI, FcγRIIa/c, and FcγRIIIa are positive regulators of immune complex-triggered activation, characterized by having an intracellular domain that has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), FcγRIIb has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and is therefore inhibitory. Thus the former are referred to as activation receptors, and FcγRIIb is referred to as an inhibitory receptor. The receptors also differ in expression pattern and levels on different immune cells. Yet another level of complexity is the existence of a number of FcγR polymorphisms in the human proteome. A particularly relevant polymorphism with clinical significance is V158/F158 FcγRIIIa. Human IgG1 binds with greater affinity to the V158 allotype than to the F158 allotype. This difference in affinity, and presumably its effect on ADCC and/or ADCP, has been shown to be a significant determinant of the efficacy of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan®, a registered trademark of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation). Patients with the V158 allotype respond favorably to rituximab treatment; however, patients with the lower affinity F158 allotype respond poorly (Cartron et al., 2002\n, Blood \n99:754-758). Approximately 10-20% of humans are V158/V158 homozygous, 45% are V158/F158 heterozygous, and 35-45% of humans are F158/F158 homozygous (Lehrnbecher et al., 1999\n, Blood \n94:4220-4232; Cartron et al., 2002\n, Blood \n99:754-758). Thus 80-90% of humans are poor responders, that is they have at least one allele of the F158 FcγRIIIa.\n\n\nAn overlapping but separate site on Fc, shown in \nFIG. 1\n, serves as the interface for the complement protein C1q. In the same way that Fc/FcγR binding mediates ADCC, Fc/C1q binding mediates complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). C1q forms a complex with the serine proteases C1r and C1s to form the C1 complex. C1q is capable of binding six antibodies, although binding to two IgGs is sufficient to activate the complement cascade. Similar to Fc interaction with FcγRs, different IgG subclasses have different affinity for C1q, with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the FcγRs than IgG2 and IgG4 (Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65). There is currently no structure available for the Fc/C1q complex; however, mutagenesis studies have mapped the binding site on human IgG for C1q to a region involving residues D270, K322, K326, P329, and P331, and E333 (Idusogie et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n164:4178-4184; Idusogie et al., 2001\n, J Immunol \n166:2571-2575).\n\n\nA site on Fc between the Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains, shown in \nFIG. 1\n, mediates interaction with the neonatal receptor FcRn, the binding of which recycles endocytosed antibody from the endosome back to the bloodstream (Raghavan et al., 1996\n, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol \n12:181-220; Ghetie et al., 2000\n, Annu Rev Immunol \n18:739-766). This process, coupled with preclusion of kidney filtration due to the large size of the full length molecule, results in favorable antibody serum half-lives ranging from one to three weeks. Binding of Fc to FcRn also plays a key role in antibody transport. The binding site for FcRn on Fc is also the site at which the bacterial proteins A and G bind. The tight binding by these proteins is typically exploited as a means to purify antibodies by employing protein A or protein G affinity chromatography during protein purification. Thus the fidelity of this region on Fc is important for both the clinical properties of antibodies and their purification. Available structures of the rat Fc/FcRn complex (Martin et al., 2001\n, Mol Cell \n7:867-877), and of the complexes of Fc with proteins A and G (Deisenhofer, 1981\n, Biochemistry \n20:2361-2370; Sauer-Eriksson et al., 1995\n, Structure \n3:265-278; Tashiro et al., 1995\n, Curr Opin Struct Biol \n5:471-481) provide insight into the interaction of Fc with these proteins.\n\n\nA key feature of the Fc region is the conserved N-linked glycosylation that occurs at N297, shown in \nFIG. 1\n. This carbohydrate, or oligosaccharide as it is sometimes referred, plays a critical structural and functional role for the antibody, and is one of the principle reasons that antibodies must be produced using mammalian expression systems. While not wanting to be limited to one theory, it is believed that the structural purpose of this carbohydrate may be to stabilize or solubilize Fc, determine a specific angle or level of flexibility between the Cγ3 and Cγ2 domains, keep the two Cγ2 domains from aggregating with one another across the central axis, or a combination of these. Efficient Fc binding to FcγR and C1q requires this modification, and alterations in the composition of the N297 carbohydrate or its elimination affect binding to these proteins (Umaña et al., 1999\n, Nat Biotechnol \n17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001\n, Biotechnol Bioeng \n74:288-294; Mimura et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:45539-45547; Radaev et al., 2001\n, Biol Chem \n276:16478-16483; Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Shields et al., 2002\n, J Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740; Simmons et al., 2002\n, J Immunol Methods \n263:133-147). Yet the carbohydrate makes little if any specific contact with FcγRs (Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16469-16477), indicating that the functional role of the N297 carbohydrate in mediating Fc/FcγR binding may be via the structural role it plays in determining the Fc conformation. This is supported by a collection of crystal structures of four different Fc glycoforms, which show that the composition of the oligosaccharide impacts the conformation of Cγ2 and as a result the Fc/FcγR interface (Krapp et al., 2003\n, J Mol Biol \n325:979-989).\n\n\nThe features of antibodies discussed above—specificity for target, ability to mediate immune effector mechanisms, and long half-life in serum—make antibodies powerful therapeutics. Monoclonal antibodies are used therapeutically for the treatment of a variety of conditions including cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. There are currently over ten antibody products on the market and hundreds in development. In addition to antibodies, an antibody-like protein that is finding an expanding role in research and therapy is the Fc fusion (Chamow et al., 1996\n, Trends Biotechnol \n14:52-60; Ashkenazi et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Immunol \n9:195-200). An Fc fusion is a protein wherein one or more polypeptides is operably linked to Fc. An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an antibody, and thus its favorable effector functions and pharmacokinetics, with the target-binding region of a receptor, ligand, or some other protein or protein domain. The role of the latter is to mediate target recognition, and thus it is functionally analogous to the antibody variable region. Because of the structural and functional overlap of Fc fusions with antibodies, the discussion on antibodies in the present invention extends directly to Fc fusions.\n\n\nDespite such widespread use, antibodies are not optimized for clinical use. Two significant deficiencies of antibodies are their suboptimal anticancer potency and their demanding production requirements. These deficiencies are addressed by the present invention\n\n\nThere are a number of possible mechanisms by which antibodies destroy tumor cells, including anti-proliferation via blockage of needed growth pathways, intracellular signaling leading to apoptosis, enhanced down regulation and/or turnover of receptors, CDC, ADCC, ADCP, and promotion of an adaptive immune response (Cragg et al., 1999\n, Curr Opin Immunol \n11:541-547; Glennie et al., 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:403-410). Anti-tumor efficacy may be due to a combination of these mechanisms, and their relative importance in clinical therapy appears to be cancer dependent. Despite this arsenal of anti-tumor weapons, the potency of antibodies as anti-cancer agents is unsatisfactory, particularly given their high cost. Patient tumor response data show that monoclonal antibodies provide only a small improvement in therapeutic success over normal single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. For example, just half of all relapsed low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients respond to the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (McLaughlin et al., 1998\n, J Clin Oncol \n16:2825-2833). Of 166 clinical patients, 6% showed a complete response and 42% showed a partial response, with median response duration of approximately 12 months. Trastuzumab (Herceptin®, a registered trademark of Genentech), an anti-HER2/neu antibody for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, has less efficacy. The overall response rate using trastuzumab for the 222 patients tested was only 15%, with 8 complete and 26 partial responses and a median response duration and survival of 9 to 13 months (Cobleigh et al., 1999\n, J Clin Oncol \n17:2639-2648). Currently for anticancer therapy, any small improvement in mortality rate defines success. Thus there is a significant need to enhance the capacity of antibodies to destroy targeted cancer cells.\n\n\nA promising means for enhancing the anti-tumor potency of antibodies is via enhancement of their ability to mediate cytotoxic effector functions such as ADCC, ADCP, and CDC. The importance of FcγR-mediated effector functions for the anti-cancer activity of antibodies has been demonstrated in mice (Clynes et al., 1998\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95:652-656; Clynes et al., 2000\n, Nat Med \n6:443-446), and the affinity of interaction between Fc and certain FcγRs correlates with targeted cytotoxicity in cell-based assays (Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Presta et al., 2002\n, Biochem Soc Trans \n30:487-490; Shields et al., 2002\n, J Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740). Additionally, a correlation has been observed between clinical efficacy in humans and their allotype of high (V158) or low (F158) affinity polymorphic forms of FcγRIIIa (Cartron et al., 2002\n, Blood \n99:754-758). Together these data suggest that an antibody with an Fc region optimized for binding to certain FcγRs may better mediate effector functions and thereby destroy cancer cells more effectively in patients. The balance between activating and inhibiting receptors is an important consideration, and optimal effector function may result from an Fc with enhanced affinity for activation receptors, for example FcγRI, FcγRIIa/c, and FcγRIIIa, yet reduced affinity for the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. Furthermore, because FcγRs can mediate antigen uptake and processing by antigen presenting cells, enhanced Fc/FcγR affinity may also improve the capacity of antibody therapeutics to elicit an adaptive immune response.\n\n\nMutagenesis studies have been carried out on Fc towards various goals, with substitutions typically made to alanine (referred to as alanine scanning) or guided by sequence homology substitutions (Duncan et al., 1988\n, Nature \n332:563-564; Lund et al., 1991\n, J Immunol \n147:2657-2662; Lund et al., 1992\n, Mol Immunol \n29:53-59; Jefferis et al., 1995\n, Immunol Lett \n44:111-117; Lund et al., 1995\n, Faseb J \n9:115-119; Jefferis et al., 1996\n, Immunol Lett \n54:101-104; Lund et al., 1996\n, J Immunol \n157:4963-4969; Armour et al., 1999\n, Eur J Immunol \n29:2613-2624; Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,573; PCT WO 00/42072; PCT WO 99/58572). The majority of substitutions reduce or ablate binding with FcγRs. However some success has been achieved at obtaining Fc variants with higher FcγR affinity. (See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821, and PCT WO 00/42072). For example, Winter and colleagues substituted the human amino acid at position 235 of mouse IgG2b antibody (a glutamic acid to leucine mutation) that increased binding of the mouse antibody to human FcγRI by 100-fold (Duncan et al., 1988\n, Nature \n332:563-564) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821). Shields et al. used alanine scanning mutagenesis to map Fc residues important to FcγR binding, followed by substitution of select residues with non-alanine mutations (Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Presta et al., 2002\n, Biochem Soc Trans \n30:487-490) (PCT WO 00/42072). Several mutations disclosed in this study, including S298A, E333A, and K334A, show enhanced binding to the activating receptor FcγRIIIa and reduced binding to the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. These mutations were combined to obtain double and triple mutation variants that show additive improvements in binding. The best variant disclosed in this study is a S298A/E333A/K334A triple mutant with approximately a 1.7-fold increase in binding to F158 FcγRIIIa, a 5-fold decrease in binding to FcγRIIb, and a 2.1-fold enhancement in ADCC.\n\n\nEnhanced affinity of Fc for FcγR has also been achieved using engineered glycoforms generated by expression of antibodies in engineered or variant cell lines (Umaña et al., 1999\n, Nat Biotechnol \n17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001\n, Biotechnol Bioeng \n74:288-294; Shields et al., 2002\n, J Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al., 2003\n, J Biol Chem \n278:3466-3473). This approach has generated substantial enhancements of the capacity of antibodies to bind FcγRIIIa and to mediate ADCC. Although there are practical limitations such as the growth efficiency of the expression strains under large scale production conditions, this approach for enhancing Fc/FcγR affinity and effector function is promising. Indeed, coupling of these alternate glycoform technologies with the Fc variants of the present invention may provide additive or synergistic effects for optimal effector function.\n\n\nAlthough there is a need for greater effector function, for some antibody therapeutics reduced or eliminated effector function may be desired. This is often the case for therapeutic antibodies whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism but not killing of the cells bearing target antigen. In these cases depletion of target cells is undesirable and can be considered a side effect. For example, the ability of anti-CD4 antibodies to block CD4 receptors on T cells makes them effective anti-inflammatories, yet their ability to recruit FcγR receptors also directs immune attack against the target cells, resulting in T cell depletion (Reddy et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n164:1925-1933). Effector function can also be a problem for radiolabeled antibodies, referred to as radioconjugates, and antibodies conjugated to toxins, referred to as immunotoxins. These drugs can be used to destroy cancer cells, but the recruitment of immune cells via Fc interaction with FcγRs brings healthy immune cells in proximity to the deadly payload (radiation or toxin), resulting in depletion of normal lymphoid tissue along with targeted cancer cells (Hutchins et al., 1995\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n92:11980-11984; White et al., 2001\n, Annu Rev Med \n52:125-145). This problem can potentially be circumvented by using IgG isotypes that poorly recruit complement or effector cells, for example IgG2 and IgG4. An alternate solution is to develop Fc variants that reduce or ablate binding (Alegre et al., 1994\n, Transplantation \n57:1537-1543; Hutchins et al., 1995\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n92:11980-11984; Armour et al., 1999\n, Eur J Immunol \n29:2613-2624; Reddy et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n164:1925-1933; Xu et al., 2000\n, Cell Immunol \n200:16-26; Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,194,551; 5,885,573; PCT WO 99/58572). A critical consideration for the reduction or elimination of effector function is that other important antibody properties not be perturbed. Fc variants should be engineered that not only ablate binding to FcγRs and/or C1q, but also maintain antibody stability, solubility, and structural integrity, as well as ability to interact with other important Fc ligands such as FcRn and proteins A and G.\n\n\nThe present invention addresses another major shortcoming of antibodies, namely their demanding production requirements (Garber, 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19:184-185; Dove, 2002\n, Nat Biotechnol \n20:777-779). Antibodies must be expressed in mammalian cells, and the currently marketed antibodies together with other high-demand biotherapeutics consume essentially all of the available manufacturing capacity. With hundreds of biologics in development, the majority of which are antibodies, there is an urgent need for more efficient and cheaper methods of production. The downstream effects of insufficient antibody manufacturing capacity are three-fold. First, it dramatically raises the cost of goods to the producer, a cost that is passed on to the patient. Second, it hinders industrial production of approved antibody products, limiting availability of high demand therapeutics to patients. Finally, because clinical trials require large amounts of a protein that is not yet profitable, the insufficient supply impedes progress of the growing antibody pipeline to market.\n\n\nAlternative production methods have been explored in attempts at alleviating this problem. Transgenic plants and animals are being pursued as potentially cheaper and higher capacity production systems (Chadd et al., 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n12:188-194). Such expression systems, however, can generate glycosylation patterns significantly different from human glycoproteins. This may result in reduced or even lack of effector function because, as discussed above, the carbohydrate structure can significantly impact FcγR and complement binding. A potentially greater problem with nonhuman glycoforms may be immunogenicity; carbohydrates are a key source of antigenicity for the immune system, and the presence of nonhuman glycoforms has a significant chance of eliciting antibodies that neutralize the therapeutic, or worse cause adverse immune reactions. Thus the efficacy and safety of antibodies produced by transgenic plants and animals remains uncertain. Bacterial expression is another attractive solution to the antibody production problem. Expression in bacteria, for example \nE. coli\n, provides a cost-effective and high capacity method for producing proteins. For complex proteins such as antibodies there are a number of obstacles to bacterial expression, including folding and assembly of these complex molecules, proper disulfide formation, and solubility, stability, and functionality in the absence of glycosylation because proteins expressed in bacteria are not glycosylated. Full length unglycosylated antibodies that bind antigen have been successfully expressed in \nE. coli \n(Simmons et al., 2002\n, J Immunol Methods \n263:133-147), and thus, folding, assembly, and proper disulfide formation of bacterially expressed antibodies are possible in the absence of the eukaryotic chaperone machinery. However the ultimate utility of bacterially expressed antibodies as therapeutics remains hindered by the lack of glycosylation, which results in lack effector function and may result in poor stability and solubility. This will likely be more problematic for formulation at the high concentrations for the prolonged periods demanded by clinical use.\n\n\nAn aglycosylated Fc with favorable solution properties and the capacity to mediate effector functions would be significantly enabling for the alternate production methods described above. By overcoming the structural and functional shortcomings of aglycosylated Fc, antibodies can be produced in bacteria and transgenic plants and animals with reduced risk of immunogenicity, and with effector function for clinical applications in which cytotoxicity is desired such as cancer. The present invention describes the utilization of protein engineering methods to develop stable, soluble Fc variants with effector function. Currently, such Fc variants do not exist in the art.\n\n\nIn summary, there is a need for antibodies with enhanced therapeutic properties. Engineering of optimized or enhanced Fc variants is a promising approach to meeting this need. Yet a substantial obstacle to engineering Fc variants with the desired properties is the difficulty in predicting what amino acid modifications, out of the enormous number of possibilities, will achieve the desired goals, coupled with the inefficient production and screening methods for antibodies. Indeed one of the principle reasons for the incomplete success of the prior art is that approaches to Fc engineering have thus far involved hit-or-miss methods such as alanine scans or production of glycoforms using different expression strains. In these studies, the Fc modifications that were made were fully or partly random in hopes of obtaining variants with favorable properties. The present invention provides a variety of engineering methods, many of which are based on more sophisticated and efficient techniques, which may be used to overcome these obstacles in order to develop Fc variants that are optimized for the desired properties. The described engineering methods provide design strategies to guide Fc modification, computational screening methods to design favorable Fc variants, library generation approaches for determining promising variants for experimental investigation, and an array of experimental production and screening methods for determining the Fc variants with favorable properties.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides Fc variants that are optimized for a number of therapeutically relevant properties.\n\n\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide novel Fc positions at which amino acid modifications may be made to generate optimized Fc variants.

Antibody structure and function. Shown is a model of a full length human IgG1 antibody, modeled using a humanized Fab structure from pdb accession code 1CE1 (James et al., 1999\n, J Mol Biol \n289:293-301) and a human IgG1 Fc structure from pdb accession code 1DN2 (DeLano et al., 2000\n, Science \n287:1279-1283). The flexible hinge that links the Fab and Fc regions is not shown. IgG1 is a homodimer of heterodimers, made up of two light chains and two heavy chains. The Ig domains that comprise the antibody are labeled, and include V\nL \nand C\nL \nfor the light chain, and V\nH\n, Cgamma1 (Cγ1), Cgamma2 (Cγ2), and Cgamma3 (Cγ3) for the heavy chain. The Fc region is labeled. Binding sites for relevant proteins are labeled, including the antigen binding site in the variable region, and the binding sites for FcγRs, FcRn, C1q, and proteins A and G in the Fc region.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n. The Fc/FcγRIIIb complex structure 1IIS. Fc is shown as a gray ribbon diagram, and FcγRIIIb is shown as a black ribbon. The N297 carbohydrate is shown as black sticks.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n. The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain of the antibody alemtuzumab (Campath®, a registered trademark of Ilex Pharmaceuticals LP), illustrating positions numbered sequentially (2 lines above the amino acid sequence) and positions numbered according to the EU index as in Kabat (2 lines below the amino acid sequence. The approximate beginnings of Ig domains VH1, Cγ1, the hinge, Cγ2, and Cγ3 are also labeled above the sequential numbering. Polymorphisms have been observed at a number of Fc positions, including but not limited to \nKabat\n 270, 272, 312, 315, 356, and 358, and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the prior art may exist.\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n. Experimental library residues mapped onto the Fc/FcγRIIIb complex structure 1IIS. Fc is shown as a gray ribbon diagram, and FcγRIIIb is shown as a black ribbon. Experimental library residues are shown as black ball and sticks. The N297 carbohydrate is shown as black sticks.\n\n\n \nFIG. 5\n. The human IgG1 Fc sequence showing positions relevant to the design of the Fc variant experimental library. The sequence includes the hinge region, domain Cγ2, and domain Cγ3. Residue numbers are according to the EU index as in Kabat. Positions relevant to the experimental library are underlined. Because of observed polymorphic mutations at a number of Fc positions, slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the literature may exist.\n\n\n \nFIG. 6\n. Expression of Fc variant and wild type (WT) proteins of alemtuzumab in 293T cells. Plasmids containing alemtuzumab heavy chain genes (WT or variants) were co-transfected with plasmid containing the alemtuzumab light chain gene. Media were harvested 5 days after transfection. For each transfected sample, 10 ul medium was loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel for Western analysis. The probe for Western was peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG (Jackson Immuno-Research, catalog #109-035-088). WT: wild type alemtuzumab; 1-10: alemtuzumab variants. H and L indicate antibody heavy chain and light chain, respectively.\n\n\n \nFIG. 7\n. Purification of alemtuzumab using protein A chromatography. WT alemtuzumab proteins was expressed in 293T cells and the media was harvested 5 days after transfection. The media were diluted 1:1 with PBS and purified with protein A (Pierce, Catalog #20334). O: original sample before purification; FT: flow through; E: elution; C: concentrated final sample. The left picture shows a Simple Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel, and the right shows a western blot labeled using peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG.\n\n\n \nFIG. 8\n. Production of deglycosylated antibodies. Wild type and variants of alemtuzumab were expressed in 293T cells and purified with protein A chromatography. Antibodies were incubated with peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase F) at 37° C. for 24 h. For each antibody, a mock treated sample (-PNGase F) was done in parallel. WT: wild-type alemtuzumab; #15, #16, #17, #18, #22: alemtuzumab variants F241E/F243R/V262E/V264R, F241E/F243Q/V262T/V264E, F241R/F243Q/V262T/V264R, F241E/F243Y/V262T/V264R, and I332E respectively. The faster migration of the PNGase F treated versus the mock treated samples represents the deglycosylated heavy chains.\n\n\n \nFIG. 9\n. Alemtuzumab expressed from 293T cells binds its antigen. The antigenic CD52 peptide, fused to GST, was expressed in \nE. coli \nBL21 (DE3) under IPTG induction. Both uninduced and induced samples were run on a SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane. For western analysis, either alemtuzumab from Sotec (□-CD52, Sotec) (final concentration 2.5 ng/ul) or media of transfected 293T cells (Campath, Xencor) (final alemtuzumab concentration approximately 0.1-0.2 ng/ul) were used as primary antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG was used as secondary antibody. M: pre-stained marker; U: un-induced sample for GST-CD52; I: induced sample for GST-CD52.\n\n\n \nFIG. 10\n. Expression and purification of extracellular region of human V158 FcγRIIIa. Tagged FcγRIIIa was transfected in 293T cells, and media containing secreted FcγRIIIa were harvested 3 days later and purified using affinity chromatography. 1: media; 2: flow through; 3: wash; 4-8: serial elutions. Both simple blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel and western result are shown. For the western blot, membrane was probed with anti-GST antibody.\n\n\n \nFIG. 11\n. Binding to human V158 FcγRIIIa by select alemtuzumab Fc variants from the experimental library as determined by the AlphaScreen™ assay, described in Example 2. In the presence of competitor antibody (Fc variant or WT alemtuzumab) a characteristic inhibition curve is observed as a decrease in luminescence signal. Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) alone was used as the negative control. These data were normalized to the maximum and minimum luminescence signal provided by the baselines at low and high concentrations of competitor antibody respectively. The curves represent the fits of the data to a one site competition model using nonlinear regression. These fits provide IC50s for each antibody, illustrated for WT and S239D by the dotted lines.\n\n\n \nFIG. 12\n. AlphaScreen™ assay showing binding of select alemtuzumab Fc variants to human FcγRIIb. The data were normalized, and the curves represent the fits of the data to a one site competition model. PBS was used as a negative control.\n\n\n \nFIG. 13\n. AlphaScreen™ assay showing binding of select alemtuzumab Fc variants to human Val158 FcγRIIIa. The data were normalized, and the curves represent the fits of the data to a one site competition model.

These positions are numbered according to the EU index as in Kabat, and thus do not correspond to the sequential order in the sequence.\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn order that the invention may be more completely understood, several definitions are set forth below. Such definitions are meant to encompass grammatical equivalents.\n\n\nBy “ADCC” or “antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity” as used herein is meant the cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell.\n\n\nBy “ADCP” or antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis as used herein is meant the cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell.\n\n\nBy “amino acid modification” herein is meant an amino acid substitution, insertion, and/or deletion in a polypeptide sequence. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution. **TT\n\n\nBy “antibody” herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by all or part of the recognized immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes, for example in humans, include the kappa (□), lambda (□), and heavy chain genetic loci, which together comprise the myriad variable region genes, and the constant region genes mu (□), delta (□), gamma (γ), sigma (□), and alpha (□) which encode the IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA isotypes respectively. Antibody herein is meant to include full length antibodies and antibody fragments, and may refer to a natural antibody from any organism, an engineered antibody, or an antibody generated recombinantly for experimental, therapeutic, or other purposes as further defined below. Thus, “antibody” includes both polyclonal and monoclonal antibody (mAb). Methods of preparation and purification of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are known in the art and e.g., are described in Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988). As outlined herein, “antibody” specifically includes Fc variants described herein, “full length” antibodies including the Fc variant fragments described herein, and Fc variant fusions to other proteins as described herein.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, antibodies can be neutralizing or inhibitory, or stimulatory, and in preferred embodiments, as described herein, the stimulatory activity is measured by an increase in affinity of a variant antibody to a receptor, as compared to either the parent antibody (e.g. when a non-naturally occurring variant is used as the starting point for the computation analysis herein), or to the original wild-type antibody. Accordingly, by “neutralization,” “neutralize,” “neutralizing” and grammatical equivalents herein is meant to inhibit or lessen the biological effect of the antibody, in some cases by binding (e.g. competitively) to a antigen and avoiding or decreasing the biological effect of binding, or by binding that results in decreasing the biological effect of binding.\n\n\nThe term “antibody” include antibody fragments, as are known in the art, such as Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)2, Fcs or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies, such as, single chain antibodies (Fv for example), chimeric antibodies, etc., either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA technologies. Particularly preferred are Fc variants as described herein. The term “antibody” further comprises polyclonal antibodies and mAbs which can be agonist or antagonist antibodies.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention specifically bind to Fc receptors, as outlined herein. By “specifically bind” herein is meant that the LC antibodies have a binding constant in the range of at least 10\n−4\n-10\n−6 \nM\n−1\n, with a preferred range being 10\n−7\n-10\n−9 \nM\n−1\n.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are humanized. Using current monoclonal antibody technology one can produce a humanized antibody to virtually any target antigen that can be identified [Stein, Trends Biotechnol. 15:88-90 (1997)]. Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric molecules of immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fc, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues form a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin [Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992)].\n\n\nMethods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues, which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers [Jones et al., supra; Riechmann et al., supra; and Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)], by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Additional examples of humanized murine monoclonal antibodies are also known in the art, e.g., antibodies binding human protein C [O'Connor et al., Protein Eng. 11:321-8 (1998)], \ninterleukin\n 2 receptor [Queen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 86:10029-33 (1989]), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [Carter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89:4285-9 (1992)]. Accordingly, such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are based on human sequences, and are thus human sequences are used as the “base” sequences, against which other sequences, such as rat, mouse and monkey sequences. In order to establish homology to primary sequence or structure, the amino acid sequence of a precursor or parent Fc is directly compared to the human Fc sequence outlined herein. After aligning the sequences, using one or more of the homology alignment programs described herein (for example using conserved residues as between species), allowing for necessary insertions and deletions in order to maintain alignment (i.e., avoiding the elimination of conserved residues through arbitrary deletion and insertion), the residues equivalent to particular amino acids in the primary sequence of human Fc are defined. Alignment of conserved residues preferably should conserve 100% of such residues. However, alignment of greater than 75% or as little as 50% of conserved residues is also adequate to define equivalent residues (sometimes referred to herein as “corresponding residues”).\n\n\nEquivalent residues may also be defined by determining homology at the level of tertiary structure for an Fc fragment whose tertiary structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography. Equivalent residues are defined as those for which the atomic coordinates of two or more of the main chain atoms of a particular amino acid residue of the parent or precursor (N on N, CA on CA, C on C and O on O) are within 0.13 nm and preferably 0.1 nm after alignment. Alignment is achieved after the best model has been oriented and positioned to give the maximum overlap of atomic coordinates of non-hydrogen protein atoms of the Fc variant fragment.\n\n\nSpecifically included within the definition of “antibody” are aglycosylated antibodies. By “aglycosylated antibody” as used herein is meant an antibody that lacks carbohydrate attached at position 297 of the Fc region, wherein numbering is according to the EU system as in Kabat. The aglycosylated antibody may be a deglycosylated antibody, that is an antibody for which the Fc carbohydrate has been removed, for example chemically or enzymatically. Alternatively, the aglycosylated antibody may be a nonglycosylated or unglycosylated antibody, that is an antibody that was expressed without Fc carbohydrate, for example by mutation of one or residues that encode the glycosylation pattern or by expression in an organism that does not attach carbohydrates to proteins, for example bacteria.\n\n\nSpecifically included within the definition of “antibody” are full-length antibodies that contain an Fc variant portion. By “full length antibody” herein is meant the structure that constitutes the natural biological form of an antibody, including variable and constant regions. For example, in most mammals, including humans and mice, the full length antibody of the IgG class is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of two immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain, each light chain comprising immunoglobulin domains V\nL \nand C\nL\n, and each heavy chain comprising immunoglobulin domains V\nH\n, Cγ1, Cγ2, and Cγ3. In some mammals, for example in camels and llamas, IgG antibodies may consist of only two heavy chains, each heavy chain comprising a variable domain attached to the Fc region. By “IgG” as used herein is meant a polypeptide belonging to the class of antibodies that are substantially encoded by a recognized immunoglobulin gamma gene. In humans this class comprises IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. In mice this class comprises IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3.\n\n\nBy “amino acid” and “amino acid identity” as used herein is meant one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids or any non-natural analogues that may be present at a specific, defined position. By “protein” herein is meant at least two covalently attached amino acids, which includes proteins, polypeptides, oligopeptides and peptides. The protein may be made up of naturally occurring amino acids and peptide bonds, or synthetic peptidomimetic structures, i.e. “analogs”, such as peptoids (see Simon et al., PNAS USA 89(20):9367 (1992)) particularly when LC peptides are to be administered to a patient. Thus “amino acid”, or “peptide residue”, as used herein means both naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids. For example, homophenylalanine, citrulline and norleucine are considered amino acids for the purposes of the invention. “Amino acid” also includes imino acid residues such as proline and hydroxyproline. The side chain may be in either the (R) or the (S) configuration. In the preferred embodiment, the amino acids are in the (S) or L-configuration. If non-naturally occurring side chains are used, non-amino acid substituents may be used, for example to prevent or retard in vivo degradation.\n\n\nBy “computational screening method” herein is meant any method for designing one or more mutations in a protein, wherein said method utilizes a computer to evaluate the energies of the interactions of potential amino acid side chain substitutions with each other and/or with the rest of the protein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, evaluation of energies, referred to as energy calculation, refers to some method of scoring one or more amino acid modifications. Said method may involve a physical or chemical energy term, or may involve knowledge-, statistical-, sequence-based energy terms, and the like. The calculations that compose a computational screening method are herein referred to as “computational screening calculations”.\n\n\nBy “effector function” as used herein is meant a biochemical event that results from the interaction of an antibody Fc region with an Fc receptor or ligand. Effector functions include but are not limited to ADCC, ADCP, and CDC. By “effector cell” as used herein is meant a cell of the immune system that expresses one or more Fc receptors and mediates one or more effector functions. Effector cells include but are not limited to monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, B cells, large granular lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and γγ T cells, and may be from any organism including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. By “library” herein is meant a set of Fc variants in any form, including but not limited to a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, a list of nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions at variable positions, a physical library comprising nucleic acids that encode the library sequences, or a physical library comprising the Fc variant proteins, either in purified or unpurified form.\n\n\nBy “Fc”, “Fc region”, FC polypeptide”, etc. as used herein is meant an antibody as defined herein that includes the polypeptides comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG, and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG, as illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n, Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cgamma2 and Cgamma3 (Cγ2 and Cγ3) and the hinge between Cgamma1 (Cγ1) and Cgamma2 (Cγ2). Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl-terminus, wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. Fc may refer to this region in isolation, or this region in the context of an antibody, antibody fragment, or Fc fusion. An Fc may be an antibody, Fc fusion, or an protein or protein domain that comprises Fc. Particularly preferred are Fc variants, which are non-naturally occurring variants of an Fc.\n\n\nBy “Fc fusion” as used herein is meant a protein wherein one or more polypeptides is operably linked to Fc. Fc fusion is herein meant to be synonymous with the terms “immunoadhesin”, “Ig fusion”, “Ig chimera”, and “receptor globulin” (sometimes with dashes) as used in the prior art (Chamow et al., 1996\n, Trends Biotechnol \n14:52-60; Ashkenazi et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Immunol \n9:195-200). An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an immunoglobulin with a fusion partner, which in general can be any protein, including, but not limited to, the target-binding region of a receptor, an adhesion molecule, a ligand, an enzyme, or some other protein or protein domain. The role of the non-Fc part of an Fc fusion is to mediate target binding, and thus it is functionally analogous to the variable regions of an antibody.\n\n\nBy “Fc gamma receptor” or “FcγR” as used herein is meant any member of the family of proteins that bind the IgG antibody Fc region and are substantially encoded by the FcγR genes. In humans this family includes but is not limited to FcγRI (CD64), including isoforms FcγRIa, FcγRIb, and FcγRIc; FcγRII (CD32), including isoforms FcγRIIa (including allotypes H131 and R131), FcγRIIb (including FcγRIIb-1 and FcγRIIb-2), and FcγRIIc; and FcγRIII (CD16), including isoforms FcγRIIIa (including allotypes V158 and F158) and FcγRIIIb (including allotypes FcγRIIIb-NA1 and FcγRIIIb-NA2) (Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65), as well as any undiscovered human FcγRs or FcγR isoforms or allotypes. An FcγR may be from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Mouse FcγRs include but are not limited to FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32), FcγRIII (CD16), and FcγRIII-2 (CD16-2), as well as any undiscovered mouse FcγRs or FcγR isoforms or allotypes.\n\n\nBy “Fc ligand” as used herein is meant a molecule, preferably a polypeptide, from any organism that binds to the Fc region of an antibody to form an Fc-ligand complex. Fc ligands include but are not limited to FcγRs, FcγRs, FcγRs, FcRn, C1q, C3, mannan binding lectin, mannose receptor, staphylococcal protein A, streptococcal protein G, and viral FcγR. Fc ligands may include undiscovered molecules that bind Fc\n\n\nBy “IgG” as used herein is meant a polypeptide belonging to the class of antibodies that are substantially encoded by a recognized immunoglobulin gamma gene. In humans this class comprises IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. In mice this class comprises IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3. By “immunoglobulin (Ig)” herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes. Immunoglobulins include but are not limited to antibodies. Immunoglobulins may have a number of structural forms, including but not limited to full length antibodies, antibody fragments, and individual immunoglobulin domains. By “immunoglobulin (Ig) domain” herein is meant a region of an immunoglobulin that exists as a distinct structural entity as ascertained by one skilled in the art of protein structure. Ig domains typically have a characteristic □-sandwich folding topology. The known Ig domains in the IgG class of antibodies are V\nH\n, Cγ1, Cγ2, Cγ3, V\nL\n, and C\nL\n.\n\n\nBy “parent polypeptide” or “precursor polypeptide” (including Fc parent or precursors) as used herein is meant a polypeptide that is subsequently modified to generate a variant. Said parent polypeptide may be a naturally occurring polypeptide, or a variant or engineered version of a naturally occurring polypeptide. Parent polypeptide may refer to the polypeptide itself, compositions that comprise the parent polypeptide, or the amino acid sequence that encodes it. Accordingly, by “parent Fc polypeptide” as used herein is meant an unmodified Fc polypeptide that is modified to generate a variant, and by “parent antibody” as used herein is meant an unmodified antibody that is modified to generate a variant antibody.\n\n\nAs outlined above, certain positions of the Fc molecule can be altered. By “position” as used herein is meant a location in the sequence of a protein. Positions may be numbered sequentially, or according to an established format, for example the EU index as in Kabat. For example, position 297 is a position in the human antibody IgG1. Corresponding positions are determined as outlined above, generally through alignment with other parent sequences.\n\n\nBy “residue” as used herein is meant a position in a protein and its associated amino acid identity. For example, Daragine 297 (also referred to as N297, also referred to as N297) is a residue in the human antibody IgG1.\n\n\nBy “target antigen” as used herein is meant the molecule that is bound specifically by the variable region of a given antibody. A target antigen may be a protein, carbohydrate, lipid, or other chemical compound.\n\n\nBy “target cell” as used herein is meant a cell that expresses a target antigen.\n\n\nBy “variable region” as used herein is meant the region of an immunoglobulin that comprises one or more Ig domains substantially encoded by any of the V□, V□, and/or V\nH \ngenes that make up the kappa, lambda, and heavy chain immunoglobulin genetic loci respectively.\n\n\nBy “variant polypeptide” as used herein is meant a polypeptide sequence that differs from that of a parent polypeptide sequence by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Variant polypeptide may refer to the polypeptide itself, a composition comprising the polypeptide, or the amino sequence that encodes it. Preferably, the variant polypeptide has at least one amino acid modification compared to the parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid modifications, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid modifications compared to the parent. The variant polypeptide sequence herein will preferably possess at least about 80% homology with a parent polypeptide sequence, and most preferably at least about 90% homology, more preferably at least about 95% homology. Accordingly, by “Fc variant” as used herein is meant an Fc sequence that differs from that of a parent Fc sequence by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. An Fc variant may only encompass an Fc region, or may exist in the context of an antibody, Fc fusion, or other polypeptide that is substantially encoded by Fc. Fc variant may refer to the Fc polypeptide itself, compositions comprising the Fc variant polypeptide, or the amino acid sequence that encodes it.\n\n\nFor all positions discussed in the present invention, numbering of an immunoglobulin heavy chain is according to the EU index (Kabat et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., United States Public Health Svice, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). The “EU index as in Kabat” refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be optimized for a variety of properties. Properties that may be optimized include but are not limited to enhanced or reduced affinity for an FcγR. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to possess enhanced affinity for a human activating FcγR, preferably FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIc, FcγRIIIa, and FcγRIIIb, most preferably FcγRIIa. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are optimized to possess reduced affinity for the human inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. These preferred embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans, for example enhanced effector function and greater anti-cancer potency. In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to have reduced or ablated affinity for a human FcγR, including but not limited to FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIc, FcγRIIa, and FcγRIIIb. These embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans, for example reduced effector function and reduced toxicity. Preferred embodiments comprise optimization of Fc binding to a human FcγR, however in alternate embodiments the Fc variants of the present invention possess enhanced or reduced affinity for FcγRs from nonhuman organisms, including but not limited to mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Fc variants that are optimized for binding to a nonhuman FcγR may find use in experimentation. For example, mouse models are available for a variety of diseases that enable testing of properties such as efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics for a given drug candidate. As is known in the art, cancer cells can be grafted or injected into mice to mimic a human cancer, a process referred to as xenografting. Testing of antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that are optimized for one or more mouse FcγRs, may provide valuable information with regard to the efficacy of the antibody or Fc fusion, its mechanism of action, and the like. The Fc variants of the present invention may also be optimized for enhanced functionality and/or solution properties in aglycosylated form. In a preferred embodiment, the aglycosylated Fc variants of the present invention bind an Fc ligand with greater affinity than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc polypeptide. Said Fc ligands include but are not limited to FcγRs, C1q, FcRn, and proteins A and G, and may be from any source including but not limited to human, mouse, rat, rabbit, or monkey, preferably human. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are optimized to be more stable and/or more soluble than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc polypeptide. An Fc variant that is engineered or predicted to display any of the aforementioned optimized properties is herein referred to as an “optimized Fc variant”.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be derived from parent Fc polypeptides that are themselves from a wide range of sources. The parent Fc polypeptide may be substantially encoded by one or more Fc genes from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, camels, llamas, dromedaries, monkeys, preferably mammals and most preferably humans and mice. In a preferred embodiment, the parent Fc polypeptide composes an antibody, referred to as the parent antibody. The parent antibody may be fully human, obtained for example using transgenic mice (Bruggemann et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n8:455-458) or human antibody libraries coupled with selection methods (Griffiths et al., 1998\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n9:102-108). The parent antibody need not be naturally occurring. For example, the parent antibody may be an engineered antibody, including but not limited to chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies (Clark, 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:397-402). The parent antibody may be an engineered variant of an antibody that is substantially encoded by one or more natural antibody genes. In one embodiment, the parent antibody has been affinity matured, as is known in the art. Alternatively, the antibody has been modified in some other way, for example as described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/339,788, filed on Mar. 3, 2003.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes belonging to any of the antibody classes. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention find use in antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise sequences belonging to the IgG class of antibodies, including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4. In an alternate embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention find use in antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise sequences belonging to the IgA (including subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgM classes of antibodies. The Fc variants of the present invention may comprise more than one protein chain. That is, the present invention may find use in an antibody or Fc fusion that is a monomer or an oligomer, including a homo- or hetero-oligomer.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other Fc modifications, including but not limited to modifications that alter effector function. Such combination may provide additive, synergistic, or novel properties in antibodies or Fc fusions. In one embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other known Fc variants (Duncan et al., 1988\n, Nature \n332:563-564; Lund et al., 1991\n, J Immunol \n147:2657-2662; Lund et al., 1992\n, Mol Immunol \n29:53-59; Alegre et al., 1994\n, Transplantation \n57:1537-1543; Hutchins et al., 1995\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n92:11980-11984; Jefferis et al., 1995\n, Immunol Lett \n44:111-117; Lund et al., 1995\n, Faseb J \n9:115-119; Jefferis et al., 1996\n, Immunol Lett \n54:101-104; Lund et al., 1996\n, J Immunol \n157:4963-4969; Armour et al., 1999\n, Eur J Immunol \n29:2613-2624; Idusogie et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n164:4178-4184; Reddy et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n164:1925-1933; Xu et al., 2000\n, Cell Immunol \n200:16-26; Idusogie et al., 2001\n, J Immunol \n166:2571-2575; Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65; Presta et al., 2002\n, Biochem Soc Trans \n30:487-490) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821; 5,885,573; 6,194,551; PCT WO 00/42072; PCT WO 99/58572). In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are incorporated into an antibody or Fc fusion that comprises one or more engineered glycoforms. By “engineered glycoform” as used herein is meant a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to an Fc polypeptide, wherein said carbohydrate composition differs chemically from that of a parent Fc polypeptide. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to enhancing or reducing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by any method, for example by using engineered or variant expression strains, by co-expression with one or more enzymes, for example □1-4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), by expressing an Fc polypeptide in various organisms or cell lines from various organisms, or by modifying carbohydrate(s) after the Fc polypeptide has been expressed. Methods for generating engineered glycoforms are known in the art, and include but are not limited to (Umaña et al., 1999\n, Nat Biotechnol \n17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001\n, Biotechnol Bioeng \n74:288-294; Shields et al., 2002\n, J Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al., 2003\n, Biol Chem \n278:3466-3473) U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684; U.S. Ser. Nos. 10/277,370; 10/113,929; PCT WO 00/61739A1; PCT WO 01/29246A1; PCT WO 02/31140A1; PCT WO 02/30954A1; Potelligent™ technology (Biowa, Inc., Princeton, N.J.); GlycoMAb™ glycosylation engineering technology (GLYCART biotechnology AG, Zürich, Switzerland)). Engineered glycoform typically refers to the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide; thus an Fc polypeptide, for example an antibody or Fc fusion, may comprise an engineered glycoform. Alternatively, engineered glycoform may refer to the Fc polypeptide that comprises the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide. Thus combinations of the Fc variants of the present invention with other Fc modifications, as well as undiscovered Fc modifications, are contemplated with the goal of generating novel antibodies or Fc fusions with optimized properties.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody. By “antibody of the present invention” as used herein is meant an antibody that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. The present invention may, in fact, find use in any protein that comprises Fc, and thus application of the Fc variants of the present invention is not limited to antibodies. The Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an Fc fusion. By “Fc fusion of the present invention” as used herein refers to an Fc fusion that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. Fc fusions may comprise an Fc variant of the present invention operably linked to a cytokine, soluble receptor domain, adhesion molecule, ligand, enzyme, peptide, or other protein or protein domain, and include but are not limited to Fc fusions described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,843,725; 6,018,026; 6,291,212; 6,291,646; 6,300,099; 6,323,323; PCT WO 00/24782; and in (Chamow et al., 1996\n, Trends Biotechnol \n14:52-60; Ashkenazi et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Immunol \n9:195-200).\n\n\nVirtually any antigen may be targeted by the antibodies and fusions of the present invention, including but are not limited to the following list of proteins, subunits, domains, motifs, and epitopes belonging to the following list of proteins: CD2; CD3, CD3E, CD4, CD11, CD11a, CD14, CD16, CD18, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD28, CD29, CD30, CD32, CD33 (p67 protein), CD38, CD40, CD40L, CD52, CD54, CD56, CD80, CD147, GD3, IL-1, IL-1R, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-6R, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-23, interferon alpha, interferon beta, interferon gamma; TNF-alpha, TNFbeta2, TNFc, TNFalphabeta, TNF-RI, TNF-RII, FasL, CD27L, CD30L, 4-1BBL, TRAIL, RANKL, TWEAK, APRIL, BAFF, LIGHT, VEGI, OX40L, TRAIL Receptor-1, A1 Adenosine Receptor, Lymphotoxin Beta Receptor, TACI, BAFF-R, EPO; LFA-3, ICAM-1, ICAM-3, EpCAM, integrin beta1, integrin beta2, integrin alpha4/beta7, integrin alpha2, integrin alpha3, integrin alpha4, integrin alpha5, integrin alpha6, integrin alphav, alphaVbeta3 integrin, FGFR-3, Keratinocyte Growth Factor, VLA-1, VLA-4, L-selectin, anti-Id, E-selectin, HLA, HLA-DR, CTLA-4, T cell receptor, B7-1, B7-2, VNRintegrin, TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2, eotaxin1, BLyS (B-lymphocyte Stimulator), complement C5, IgE, factor VII, CD64, CBL, NCA 90, EGFR (ErbB-1), Her2/neu (ErbB-2), Her3 (ErbB-3), Her4 (ErbB-4), Tissue Factor, VEGF, VEGFR, endothelin receptor, VLA-4, Hapten NP-cap or NIP-cap, T cell receptor alpha/beta, E-selectin, digoxin, placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and testicular PLAP-like alkaline phosphatase, transferrin receptor, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CEACAM5, HMFG PEM, mucin MUC1, MUC18, Heparanase I, human cardiac myosin, tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72), tumor-associated antigen CA 125, Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), High molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA), carcinoma-associated antigen, Gcoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa), tumor-associated antigen expressing Lewis Y related carbohydrate, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gH envelope glycoprotein, HIV gp120, HCMV, respiratory syncital virus RSV F, RSVF Fgp, VNRintegrin, IL-8, cytokeratin tumor-associated antigen, Hep B gp120, CMV, gpIIbIIIa, HIV IIIB gp120 V3 loop, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Fgp, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) gD glycoprotein, HSV gB glycoprotein, HCMV gB envelope glycoprotein, and \nClostridium perfringens \ntoxin.\n\n\nOne skilled in the art will appreciate that the aforementioned list of targets refers not only to specific proteins and biomolecules, but the biochemical pathway or pathways that comprise them. For example, reference to CTLA-4 as a target antigen implies that the ligands and receptors that make up the T cell co-stimulatory pathway, including CTLA-4, B7-1, B7-2, CD28, and any other undiscovered ligands or receptors that bind these proteins, are also targets. Thus target as used herein refers not only to a specific biomolecule, but the set of proteins that interact with said target and the members of the biochemical pathway to which said target belongs. One skilled in the art will further appreciate that any of the aforementioned target antigens, the ligands or receptors that bind them, or other members of their corresponding biochemical pathway, may be operably linked to the Fc variants of the present invention in order to generate an Fc fusion. Thus for example, an Fc fusion that targets EGFR could be constructed by operably linking an Fc variant to EGF, TGF□, or any other ligand, discovered or undiscovered, that binds EGFR. Accordingly, an Fc variant of the present invention could be operably linked to EGFR in order to generate an Fc fusion that binds EGF, TGF□, or any other ligand, discovered or undiscovered, that binds EGFR. Thus virtually any polypeptide, whether a ligand, receptor, or some other protein or protein domain, including but not limited to the aforementioned targets and the proteins that compose their corresponding biochemical pathways, may be operably linked to the Fc variants of the present invention to develop an Fc fusion.\n\n\nA number of antibodies and Fc fusions that are approved for use, in clinical trials, or in development may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. Said antibodies and Fc fusions are herein referred to as “clinical products and candidates”. Thus in a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in a range of clinical products and candidates. For example, a number of antibodies that target CD20 may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. For example the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody that is substantially similar to rituximab (Rituxan®, IDEC/Genentech/Roche) (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,137), a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody approved to treat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; HuMax-CD20, an anti-CD20 currently being developed by Genmab, an anti-CD20 antibody described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362, AME-133 (Applied Molecular Evolution), hA20 (Immunomedics, Inc.), and HumaLYM (Intracel). A number of antibodies that target members of the family of epidermal growth factor receptors, including EGFR (ErbB-1), Her2/neu (ErbB-2), Her3 (ErbB-3), Her4 (ErbB-4), may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. For example the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody that is substantially similar to trastuzumab (Herceptin®, Genentech) (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,171), a humanized anti-Her2/neu antibody approved to treat breast cancer; pertuzumab (rhuMab-2C4, Omnitarg™), currently being developed by Genentech; an anti-Her2 antibody described in U.S. Pat.

to their precise composition. The Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into the aforementioned clinical candidates and products, or into antibodies and Fc fusions that are substantially similar to them. The Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into versions of the aforementioned clinical candidates and products that are humanized, affinity matured, engineered, or modified in some other way. Furthermore, the entire polypeptide of the aforementioned clinical products and candidates need not be used to construct a new antibody or Fc fusion that incorporates the Fc variants of the present invention; for example only the variable region of a clinical product or candidate antibody, a substantially similar variable region, or a humanized, affinity matured, engineered, or modified version of the variable region may be used. In another embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody or Fc fusion that binds to the same epitope, antigen, ligand, or receptor as one of the aforementioned clinical products and candidates.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may find use in a wide range of antibody and Fc fusion products. In one embodiment the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is a therapeutic, a diagnostic, or a research reagent, preferably a therapeutic. Alternatively, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be used for agricultural or industrial uses. In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention compose a library that may be screened experimentally. This library may be a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, or may be a physical composition of nucleic acids or polypeptides that encode the library sequences. The Fc variant may find use in an antibody composition that is monoclonal or polyclonal. In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are used to kill target cells that bear the target antigen, for example cancer cells. In an alternate embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are used to block, antagonize, or agonize the target antigen, for example for antagonizing a cytokine or cytokine receptor. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are used to block, antagonize, or agonize the target antigen and kill the target cells that bear the target antigen.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be used for various therapeutic purposes. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variant proteins are administered to a patient to treat an antibody-related disorder. A “patient” for the purposes of the present invention includes both humans and other animals, preferably mammals and most preferably humans. Thus the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention have both human therapy and veterinary applications. In the preferred embodiment the patient is a mammal, and in the most preferred embodiment the patient is human. The term “treatment” in the present invention is meant to include therapeutic treatment, as well as prophylactic, or suppressive measures for a disease or disorder. Thus, for example, successful administration of an antibody or Fc fusion prior to onset of the disease results in treatment of the disease. As another example, successful administration of an optimized antibody or Fc fusion after clinical manifestation of the disease to combat the symptoms of the disease comprises treatment of the disease. “Treatment” also encompasses administration of an optimized antibody or Fc fusion protein after the appearance of the disease in order to eradicate the disease. Successful administration of an agent after onset and after clinical symptoms have developed, with possible abatement of clinical symptoms and perhaps amelioration of the disease, comprises treatment of the disease. Those “in need of treatment” include mammals already having the disease or disorder, as well as those prone to having the disease or disorder, including those in which the disease or disorder is to be prevented. By “antibody related disorder” or “antibody responsive disorder” or “condition” or “disease” herein are meant a disorder that may be ameliorated by the administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention. Antibody related disorders include but are not limited to autoimmune diseases, immunological diseases, infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, neurological diseases, and oncological and neoplastic diseases including cancer. By “cancer” and “cancerous” herein refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma (including liposarcoma), neuroendocrine tumors, mesothelioma, schwanoma, meningioma, adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, testicular cancer, esophageal cancer, tumors of the biliary tract, as well as head and neck cancer.

Within the scope of the present invention this is meant to include diseases and disorders characterized by aberrant proteins, due for example to alterations in the amount of a protein present, the presence of a mutant protein, or both. An overabundance may be due to any cause, including but not limited to overexpression at the molecular level, prolonged or accumulated appearance at the site of action, or increased activity of a protein relative to normal. Included within this definition are diseases and disorders characterized by a reduction of a protein. This reduction may be due to any cause, including but not limited to reduced expression at the molecular level, shortened or reduced appearance at the site of action, mutant forms of a protein, or decreased activity of a protein relative to normal. Such an overabundance or reduction of a protein can be measured relative to normal expression, appearance, or activity of a protein, and said measurement may play an important role in the development and/or clinical testing of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is the only therapeutically active agent administered to a patient. Alternatively, the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is administered in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents, including but not limited to cytotoxic agents, chemotherapeutic agents, cytokines, growth inhibitory agents, anti-hormonal agents, kinase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, cardioprotectants, or other therapeutic agents. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be administered concomitantly with one or more other therapeutic regimens. For example, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be administered to the patient along with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In one embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be administered in conjunction with one or more antibodies or Fc fusions, which may or may not comprise an Fc variant of the present invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are administered with a chemotherapeutic agent.

By “prodrug” as used herein is meant a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See, for example Wilman, 1986, Biochemical Society Transactions, 615th Meeting Belfast, 14:375-382; and Stella et al., “Prodrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,” Directed Drug Delivery, Borchardt et al., (ed.): 247-267, Humana Press, 1985. The prodrugs that may find use with the present invention include but are not limited to phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate-containing prodrugs, peptide-containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glycosylated prodrugs, beta-lactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs which can be converted into the more active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use with the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention include but are not limited to any of the aforementioned chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n\nThe antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be combined with other therapeutic regimens. For example, in one embodiment, the patient to be treated with the antibody or Fc fusion may also receive radiation therapy. Radiation therapy can be administered according to protocols commonly employed in the art and known to the skilled artisan. Such therapy includes but is not limited to cesium, iridium, iodine, or cobalt radiation. The radiation therapy may be whole body irradiation, or may be directed locally to a specific site or tissue in or on the body, such as the lung, bladder, or prostate. Typically, radiation therapy is administered in pulses over a period of time from about 1 to 2 weeks. The radiation therapy may, however, be administered over longer periods of time. For instance, radiation therapy may be administered to patients having head and neck cancer for about 6 to about 7 weeks. Optionally, the radiation therapy may be administered as a single dose or as multiple, sequential doses. The skilled medical practitioner can determine empirically the appropriate dose or doses of radiation therapy useful herein. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention and one or more other anti-cancer therapies are employed to treat cancer cells ex vivo. It is contemplated that such ex vivo treatment may be useful in bone marrow transplantation and particularly, autologous bone marrow transplantation. For instance, treatment of cells or tissue(s) containing cancer cells with antibody or Fc fusion and one or more other anti-cancer therapies, such as described above, can be employed to deplete or substantially deplete the cancer cells prior to transplantation in a recipient patient. It is of course contemplated that the antibodies and Fc fusions of the invention can be employed in combination with still other therapeutic techniques such as surgery.\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are administered with a cytokine.

In one embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is administered with an anti-angiogenic agent. By “anti-angiogenic agent” as used herein is meant a compound that blocks, or interferes to some degree, the development of blood vessels. The anti-angiogenic factor may, for instance, be a small molecule or a protein, for example an antibody, Fc fusion, or cytokine, that binds to a growth factor or growth factor receptor involved in promoting angiogenesis. The preferred anti-angiogenic factor herein is an antibody that binds to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is administered with a therapeutic agent that induces or enhances adaptive immune response, for example an antibody that targets CTLA-4. In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is administered with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

No. 5,804,396; PCT WO 99/09016 (American Cyanimid); PCT WO 98/43960 (American Cyanamid); PCT WO 97/38983 (Warner-Lambert); PCT WO 99/06378 (Warner-Lambert); PCT WO 99/06396 (Warner-Lambert); PCT WO 96/30347 (Pfizer, Inc); PCT WO 96/33978 (AstraZeneca); PCT WO96/3397 (AstraZeneca); PCT WO 96/33980 (AstraZeneca), gefitinib (IRESSA™, ZD1839, AstraZeneca), and OSI-774 (Tarceva™, OSI Pharmaceuticals/Genentech).\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is conjugated or operably linked to another therapeutic compound. The therapeutic compound may be a cytotoxic agent, a chemotherapeutic agent, a toxin, a radioisotope, a cytokine, or other therapeutically active agent. Conjugates of the antibody or Fc fusion and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl)hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntolyene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., 1971, Science 238:1098. Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See PCT WO 94/11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (Chari et al., 1992, Cancer Research 52: 127-131) may be used. Alternatively, the antibody or Fc fusion is operably linked to the therapeutic agent, e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis.\n\n\nChemotherapeutic agents that may be useful for conjugation to the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention have been described above. In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated or operably linked to a toxin, including but not limited to small molecule toxins and enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or variants thereof. Small molecule toxins include but are not limited to calicheamicin, maytansine (U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020), trichothene, and CC1065. In one embodiment of the invention, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated to one or more maytansine molecules (e.g. about 1 to about 10 maytansine molecules per antibody molecule). Maytansine may, for example, be converted to May-SS-Me which may be reduced to May-SH3 and reacted with modified antibody or Fc fusion (Chari et al., 1992\n, Cancer Research \n52: 127-131) to generate a maytansinoid-antibody or maytansinoid-Fc fusion conjugate. Another conjugate of interest comprises an antibody or Fc fusion conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. Structural analogues of calicheamicin that may be used include but are not limited to γ\n1\n \n1\n, □\n2\n \n1\n, □\n3\n, N-acetyl-γ\n1\n \n1\n, PSAG, and θ\n1\n \n1\n, (Hinman et al., 1993\n, Cancer Research \n53:3336-3342; Lode et al., 1998\n, Cancer Research \n58:2925-2928) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,714,586; 5,712,374; 5,264,586; 5,773,001). \nDolastatin\n 10 analogs such as auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) may find use as conjugates for the Fc variants of the present invention (Doronina et al., 2003\n, Nat Biotechnol \n21(7):778-84; Francisco et al., 2003 \nBlood \n102(4):1458-65). Useful enzymatically active toxins include but are not limited to diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, \nAleurites fordii \nproteins, dianthin proteins, \nPhytolaca americana \nproteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), \nmomordica charantia \ninhibitor, curcin, crotin, \nsapaonaria officinalis \ninhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes. See, for example, PCT WO 93/21232. The present invention further contemplates a conjugate or fusion formed between an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention and a compound with nucleolytic activity, for example a ribonuclease or DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease (DNase).\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be conjugated or operably linked to a radioisotope to form a radioconjugate. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugate antibodies and Fc fusions. Examples include, but are not limited to, At\n211\n, I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n, Sm\n153\n, Bi\n212\n, P\n32\n, and radioactive isotopes of Lu.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be conjugated to a “receptor” (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pretargeting wherein the antibody-receptor or Fc fusion-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a “ligand” (e.g. avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g. a radionucleotide). In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated or operably linked to an enzyme in order to employ Antibody Dependent Enzyme Mediated Prodrug Therapy (ADEPT). ADEPT may be used by conjugating or operably linking the antibody or Fc fusion to a prodrug-activating enzyme that converts a prodrug (e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent, see PCT WO 81/01145) to an active anti-cancer drug. See, for example, PCT WO 88/07378 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278. The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active, cytotoxic form. Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; cytosine deaminase useful for converting non-toxic 5-fluorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug, 5-fluorouracil; proteases, such as \nserratia \nprotease, thermolysin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidases and cathepsins (such as cathepsins B and L), that are useful for converting peptide-containing prodrugs into free drugs; D-alanylcarboxypeptidases, useful for converting prodrugs that contain D-amino acid substituents; carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes such as .beta.-galactosidase and neuramimidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs; beta-lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with .alpha.-lactams into free drugs; and penicillin amidases, such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase, useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups, respectively, into free drugs. Alternatively, antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known in the art as “abzymes”, can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs (see, for example, Massey, 1987\n, Nature \n328: 457-458). Antibody-abzyme and Fc fusion-abzyme conjugates can be prepared for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population. Other modifications of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are contemplated herein. For example, the antibody or Fc fusion may be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyoxyalkylenes, or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions are contemplated wherein an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention and one or more therapeutically active agents are formulated. Formulations of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing said antibody or Fc fusion having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed., 1980), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, acetate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl orbenzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; sweeteners and other flavoring agents; fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, corn and other starches; binding agents; additives; coloring agents; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG). In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition that comprises the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is in a water-soluble form, such as being present as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which is meant to include both acid and base addition salts. “Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt” refers to those salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free bases and that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. “Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts” include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum salts and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and ethanolamine. The formulations to be used for in vivo administration are preferrably sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes or other methods.\n\n\nThe antibodies and Fc fusions disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle comprising various types of lipids, phospholipids and/or surfactant that is useful for delivery of a therapeutic agent to a mammal. Liposomes containing the antibody or Fc fusion are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein et al., 1985\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, \n82:3688; Hwang et al., 1980\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, \n77:4030; U.S. Pat. No. 4,485,045; U.S. Pat. No. 4,544,545; and PCT WO 97/38731. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. A chemotherapeutic agent or other therapeutically active agent is optionally contained within the liposome (Gabizon et al., 1989\n, J National Cancer Inst \n81:1484).\n\n\nThe antibodies, Fc fusions, and other therapeutically active agents may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared by methods including but not limited to coacervation techniques, interfacial polymerization (for example using hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules, or poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules), colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), and macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed., 1980. Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymer, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (which are injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid, and ProLease® (commercially available from Alkermes), which is a microsphere-based delivery system composed of the desired bioactive molecule incorporated into a matrix of poly-DL-lactide-co-glycolide (PLG).\n\n\nThe concentration of the therapeutically active antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention in the formulation may vary from about 0.1 to 100 weight %. In a preferred embodiment, the concentration of the antibody or Fc fusion is in the range of 0.003 to 1.0 molar. In order to treat a patient, a therapeutically effective dose of the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be administered. By “therapeutically effective dose” herein is meant a dose that produces the effects for which it is administered. The exact dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques. Dosages may range from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of body weight or greater, for example 0.1, 1, 10, or 50 mg/kg of body weight, with 1 to 10 mg/kg being preferred. As is known in the art, adjustments for antibody or Fc fusion degradation, systemic versus localized delivery, and rate of new protease synthesis, as well as the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, drug interaction and the severity of the condition may be necessary, and will be ascertainable with routine experimentation by those skilled in the art.\n\n\nAdministration of the pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention, preferably in the form of a sterile aqueous solution, may be done in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intranasally, intraotically, transdermally, topically (e.g., gels, salves, lotions, creams, etc.), intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonary (e.g., AERx® inhalable technology commercially available from Aradigm, or Inhance™ pulmonary delivery system commercially available from Inhale Therapeutics), vaginally, parenterally, rectally, or intraocularly. In some instances, for example for the treatment of wounds, inflammation, etc., the antibody or Fc fusion may be directly applied as a solution or spray. As is known in the art, the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated accordingly depending upon the manner of introduction.\n\n\nEngineering Methods\n\n\nThe present invention provides engineering methods that may be used to generate Fc variants. A principal obstacle that has hindered previous attempts at Fc engineering is that only random attempts at modification have been possible, due in part to the inefficiency of engineering strategies and methods, and to the low-throughput nature of antibody production and screening. The present invention describes engineering methods that overcome these shortcomings. A variety of design strategies, computational screening methods, library generation methods, and experimental production and screening methods are contemplated. These strategies, approaches, techniques, and methods may be applied individually or in various combinations to engineer optimized Fc variants.\n\n\nDesign Strategies\n\n\nThe most efficient approach to generating Fc variants that are optimized for a desired property is to direct the engineering efforts toward that goal. Accordingly, the present invention teaches design strategies that may be used to engineer optimized Fc variants. The use of a design strategy is meant to guide Fc engineering, but is not meant to constrain an Fc variant to a particular optimized property based on the design strategy that was used to engineer it. At first thought this may seem counterintuitive; however its validity is derived from the enormous complexity of subtle interactions that determine the structure, stability, solubility, and function of proteins and protein-protein complexes. Although efforts can be made to predict which protein positions, residues, interactions, etc. are important for a design goal, often times critical ones are not predictable. Effects on protein structure, stability, solubility, and function, whether favorable or unfavorable, are often unforeseen. Yet there are innumerable amino acid modifications that are detrimental or deleterious to proteins. Thus often times the best approach to engineering comes from generation of protein variants that are focused generally towards a design goal but do not cause detrimental effects. In this way, a principal objective of a design strategy may be the generation of quality diversity. At a simplistic level this can be thought of as stacking the odds in one's favor. As an example, perturbation of the Fc carbohydrate or a particular domain-domain angle, as described below, are valid design strategies for generating optimized Fc variants, despite the fact that how carbohydrate and domain-domain angles determine the properties of Fc is not well understood. By reducing the number of detrimental amino acid modifications that are screened, i.e. by screening quality diversity, these design strategies become practical. Thus the true value of the design strategies taught in the present invention is their ability to direct engineering efforts towards the generation of valuable Fc variants. The specific value of any one resulting variant is determined after experimentation.\n\n\nOne design strategy for engineering Fc variants is provided in which interaction of Fc with some Fc ligand is altered by engineering amino acid modifications at the interface between Fc and said Fc ligand. Fc ligands herein may include but are not limited to FcγRs, C1q, FcRn, protein A or G, and the like. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at Fc positions that impact the binding interface, variants can be engineered that sample new interface conformations, some of which may improve binding to the Fc ligand, some of which may reduce Fc ligand binding, and some of which may have other favorable properties. Such new interface conformations could be the result of, for example, direct interaction with Fc ligand residues that form the interface, or indirect effects caused by the amino acid modifications such as perturbation of side chain or backbone conformations. Variable positions may be chosen as any positions that are believed to play an important role in determining the conformation of the interface. For example, variable positions may be chosen as the set of residues that are within a certain distance, for example 5 Angstroms (Å), preferrably between 1 and 10 Å, of any residue that makes direct contact with the Fc ligand.\n\n\nAn additional design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which the conformation of the Fc carbohydrate at N297 is optimized. Optimization as used in this context is meant to includes conformational and compositional changes in the N297 carbohydrate that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. Such a strategy is supported by the observation that the carbohydrate structure and conformation dramatically affect Fc/FcγR and Fc/C1q binding (Umaña et al., 1999\n, Nat Biotechnol \n17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001\n, Biotechnol Bioeng \n74:288-294; Mimura et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:45539-45547; Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16478-16483; Shields et al., 2002\n, J Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al., 2003\n, J Biol Chem \n278:3466-3473). However the carbohydrate makes no specific contacts with FcγRs. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at positions that interact with carbohydrate, a quality diversity of variants can be engineered that sample new carbohydrate conformations, some of which may improve and some of which may reduce binding to one or more Fc ligands. While the majority of mutations near the Fc/carbohydrate interface appear to alter carbohydrate conformation, some mutations have been shown to alter the glycosylation composition (Lund et al., 1996\n, J Immunol \n157:4963-4969; Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65).\n\n\nAnother design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which the angle between the Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains is optimized Optimization as used in this context is meant to describe conformational changes in the Cγ2-Cγ3 domain angle that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. This angle is an important determinant of Fc/FcγR affinity (Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16478-16483), and a number of mutations distal to the Fc/FcγR interface affect binding potentially by modulating it (Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604). By exploring energetically favorable substitutions positions that appear to play a key role in determining the Cγ2-Cγ3 angle and the flexibility of the domains relative to one another, a quality diversity of variants can be designed that sample new angles and levels of flexibility, some of which may be optimized for a desired Fc property.\n\n\nAnother design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which Fc is reengineered to eliminate the structural and functional dependence on glycosylation. This design strategy involves the optimization of Fc structure, stability, solubility, and/or Fc function (for example affinity of Fc for one or more Fc ligands) in the absence of the N297 carbohydrate. In one approach, positions that are exposed to solvent in the absence of glycosylation are engineered such that they are stable, structurally consistent with Fc structure, and have no tendency to aggregate. The Cγ2 is the only unpaired Ig domain in the antibody (see \nFIG. 1\n). Thus the N297 carbohydrate covers up the exposed hydrophobic patch that would normally be the interface for a protein-protein interaction with another Ig domain, maintaining the stability and structural integrity of Fc and keeping the Cγ2 domains from aggregating across the central axis. Approaches for optimizing aglycosylated Fc may involve but are not limited to designing amino acid modifications that enhance aglycoslated Fc stability and/or solubility by incorporating polar and/or charged residues that face inward towards the Cγ2-Cγ2 dimer axis, and by designing amino acid modifications that directly enhance the aglycosylated Fc/FcγR interface or the interface of aglycosylated Fc with some other Fc ligand.\n\n\nAn additional design strategy for engineering Fc variants is provided in which the conformation of the Cγ2 domain is optimized Optimization as used in this context is meant to describe conformational changes in the Cγ2 domain angle that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at Cγ2 positions that impact the Cγ2 conformation, a quality diversity of variants can be engineered that sample new Cγ2 conformations, some of which may achieve the design goal. Such new Cγ2 conformations could be the result of, for example, alternate backbone conformations that are sampled by the variant. Variable positions may be chosen as any positions that are believed to play an important role in determining C□2 structure, stability, solubility, flexibility, function, and the like. For example, Cγ2 hydrophobic core residues, that is Cγ2 residues that are partially or fully sequestered from solvent, may be reengineered. Alternatively, noncore residues may be considered, or residues that are deemed important for determining backbone structure, stability, or flexibility.\n\n\nAn additional design strategy for Fc optimization is provided in which binding to an FcγR, complement, or some other Fc ligand is altered by modifications that modulate the electrostatic interaction between Fc and said Fc ligand. Such modifications may be thought of as optimization of the global electrostatic character of Fc, and include replacement of neutral amino acids with a charged amino acid, replacement of a charged amino acid with a neutral amino acid, or replacement of a charged amino acid with an amino acid of opposite charge (i.e. charge reversal). Such modifications may be used to effect changes in binding affinity between an Fc and one or more Fc ligands, for example FcγRs. In a preferred embodiment, positions at which electrostatic substitutions might affect binding are selected using one of a variety of well known methods for calculation of electrostatic potentials. In the simplest embodiment, Coulomb's law is used to generate electrostatic potentials as a function of the position in the protein. Additional embodiments include the use of Debye-Huckel scaling to account for ionic strength effects, and more sophisticated embodiments such as Poisson-Boltzmann calculations. Such electrostatic calculations may highlight positions and suggest specific amino acid modifications to achieve the design goal. In some cases, these substitutions may be anticipated to variably affect binding to different Fc ligands, for example to enhance binding to activating FcγRs while decreasing binding affinity to inhibitory FcγRs.\n\n\nComputational Screening\n\n\nA principal obstacle to obtaining valuable Fc variants is the difficulty in predicting what amino acid modifications, out of the enormous number of possibilities, will achieve the desired goals. Indeed one of the principle reasons that previous attempts at Fc engineering have failed to produce Fc variants of significant clinical value is that approaches to Fc engineering have thus far involved hit-or-miss approaches. The present invention provides computational screening methods that enable quantitative and systematic engineering of Fc variants. These methods typically use atomic level scoring functions, side chain rotamer sampling, and advanced optimization methods to accurately capture the relationships between protein sequence, structure, and function. Computational screening enables exploration of the entire sequence space of possibilities at target positions by filtering the enormous diversity which results. Variant libraries that are screened computationally are effectively enriched for stable, properly folded, and functional sequences, allowing active optimization of Fc for a desired goal. Because of the overlapping sequence constraints on protein structure, stability, solubility, and function, a large number of the candidates in a library occupy “wasted” sequence space. For example, a large fraction of sequence space encodes unfolded, misfolded, incompletely folded, partially folded, or aggregated proteins. This is particularly relevant for Fc engineering because Ig domains are small beta sheet structures, the engineering of which has proven extremely demanding (Quinn et al., 1994\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n91:8747-8751; Richardson et al., 2002\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n99:2754-2759). Even seemingly harmless substitutions on the surface of a beta sheet can cause severe packing conflicts, dramatically disrupting folding equilibrium (Smith et al., 1995\n, Science \n270:980-982); incidentally, alanine is one of the worst beta sheet formers (Minor et al., 1994\n, Nature \n371:264-267). The determinants of beta sheet stability and specificity are a delicate balance between an extremely large number of subtle interactions. Computational screening enables the generation of libraries that are composed primarily of productive sequence space, and as a result increases the chances of identifying proteins that are optimized for the design goal. In effect, computational screening yields an increased hit-rate, thereby decreasing the number of variants that must be screened experimentally. An additional obstacle to Fc engineering is the need for active design of correlated or coupled mutations. For example, the greatest Fc/FcγR affinity enhancement observed thus far is S298A/E333A/K334A, obtained by combining three better binders obtained separately in an alanine scan (Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604). Computational screening is capable of generating such a three-fold variant in one experiment instead of three separate ones, and furthermore is able to test the functionality of all 20 amino acids at those positions instead of just alanine. Computational screening deals with such complexity by reducing the combinatorial problem to an experimentally tractable size.\n\n\nComputational screening, viewed broadly, has four steps: 1) selection and preparation of the protein template structure or structures, 2) selection of variable positions, amino acids to be considered at those positions, and/or selection of rotamers to model considered amino acids, 3) energy calculation, and 4) combinatorial optimization. In more detail, the process of computational screening can be described as follows. A three-dimensional structure of a protein is used as the starting point. The positions to be optimized are identified, which may be the entire protein sequence or subset(s) thereof. Amino acids that will be considered at each position are selected. In a preferred embodiment, each considered amino acid may be represented by a discrete set of allowed conformations, called rotamers. Interaction energies are calculated between each considered amino acid and each other considered amino acid, and the rest of the protein, including the protein backbone and invariable residues. In a preferred embodiment, interaction energies are calculated between each considered amino acid side chain rotamer and each other considered amino acid side chain rotamer and the rest of the protein, including the protein backbone and invariable residues. One or more combinatorial search algorithms are then used to identify the lowest energy sequence and/or low energy sequences.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the computational screening method used is substantially similar to Protein Design Automation® (PDA®) technology, as is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,188,965; 6,269,312; 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. In another preferred embodiment, a computational screening method substantially similar to Sequence Prediction Algorithm™ (SPA™) technology is used, as is described in (Raha et al., 2000\n, Protein Sci \n9:1106-1119), U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/877,695, and 10/071,859. In another preferred embodiment, the computational screening methods described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/339,788, filed on Mar. 3, 2003, entitled “ANTIBODY OPTIMIZATION”, are used. In some embodiments, combinations of different computational screening methods are used, including combinations of PDA® technology and SPA™ technology, as well as combinations of these computational methods in combination with other design tools. Similarly, these computational methods can be used simultaneously or sequentially, in any order.\n\n\nA template structure is used as input into the computational screening calculations. By “template structure” herein is meant the structural coordinates of part or all of a protein to be optimized. The template structure may be any protein for which a three dimensional structure (that is, three dimensional coordinates for a set of the protein's atoms) is known or may be calculated, estimated, modeled, generated, or determined. The three dimensional structures of proteins may be determined using methods including but not limited to X-ray crystallographic techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, de novo modeling, and homology modeling. If optimization is desired for a protein for which the structure has not been solved experimentally, a suitable structural model may be generated that may serve as the template for computational screening calculations. Methods for generating homology models of proteins are known in the art, and these methods find use in the present invention. See for example, Luo, et al. 2002\n, Protein Sci \n11: 1218-1226, Lehmann & Wyss, 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n12(4):371-5; Lehmann et al., 2000, Biochim Biophys Acta 1543(2):408-415; Rath & Davidson, 2000\n, Protein Sci, \n9(12):2457-69; Lehmann et al., 2000\n, Protein Eng \n13(1):49-57; Desjarlais & Berg, 1993\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n90(6):2256-60; Desjarlais & Berg, 1992\n, Proteins \n12(2):101-4; Henikoff & Henikoff, 2000\n, Adv Protein Chem \n54:73-97; Henikoff & Henikoff, 1994\n, J Mol Biol \n243(4):574-8; Morea et al., 2000\n, Methods \n20:267-269. Protein/protein complexes may also be obtained using docking methods. Suitable protein structures that may serve as template structures include, but are not limited to, all of those found in the Protein Data Base compiled and serviced by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB, formerly the Brookhaven National Lab).\n\n\nThe template structure may be of a protein that occurs naturally or is engineered. The template structure may be of a protein that is substantially encoded by a protein from any organism, with human, mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey preferred. The template structure may comprise any of a number of protein structural forms. In a preferred embodiment the template structure comprises an Fc region or a domain or fragment of Fc. In an alternately preferred embodiment the template structure comprises Fc or a domain or fragment of Fc bound to one or more Fc ligands, with an Fc/FcγR complex being preferred. The Fc in the template structure may be glycosylated or unglycosylated. The template structure may comprise more than one protein chain. The template structure may additionally contain nonprotein components, including but not limited to small molecules, substrates, cofactors, metals, water molecules, prosthetic groups, polymers and carbohydrates. In a preferred embodiment, the template structure is a plurality or set of template proteins, for example an ensemble of structures such as those obtained from NMR. Alternatively, the set of template structures is generated from a set of related proteins or structures, or artificially created ensembles. The composition and source of the template structure depends on the engineering goal. For example, for enhancement of human Fc/FcγR affinity, a human Fc/FcγR complex structure or derivative thereof may be used as the template structure. Alternatively, the uncomplexed Fc structure may be used as the template structure. If the goal is to enhance affinity of a human Fc for a mouse FcγR, the template structure may be a structure or model of a human Fc bound to a mouse FcγR.\n\n\nThe template structure may be modified or altered prior to design calculations. A variety of methods for template structure preparation are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,188,965;6,269,312; 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 09/877,695; 10/071,859, 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. For example, in a preferred embodiment, explicit hydrogens may be added if not included within the structure. In an alternate embodiment, energy minimization of the structure is run to relax strain, including strain due to van der Waals clashes, unfavorable bond angles, and unfavorable bond lengths. Alternatively, the template structure is altered using other methods, such as manually, including directed or random perturbations. It is also possible to modify the template structure during later steps of computational screening, including during the energy calculation and combinatorial optimization steps. In an alternate embodiment, the template structure is not modified before or during computational screening calculations.\n\n\nOnce a template structure has been obtained, variable positions are chosen. By “variable position” herein is meant a position at which the amino acid identity is allowed to be altered in a computational screening calculation. As is known in the art, allowing amino acid modifications to be considered only at certain variable positions reduces the complexity of a calculation and enables computational screening to be more directly tailored for the design goal. One or more residues may be variable positions in computational screening calculations. Positions that are chosen as variable positions may be those that contribute to or are hypothesized to contribute to the protein property to be optimized, for example Fc affinity for an FcγR, Fc stability, Fc solubility, and so forth. Residues at variable positions may contribute favorably or unfavorably to a specific protein property. For example, a residue at an Fc/FcγR interface may be involved in mediating binding, and thus this position may be varied in design calculations aimed at improving Fc/FcγR affinity. As another example, a residue that has an exposed hydrophobic side chain may be responsible for causing unfavorable aggregation, and thus this position may be varied in design calculations aimed at improving solubility. Variable positions may be those positions that are directly involved in interactions that are determinants of a particular protein property. For example, the Fc□R binding site of Fc may be defined to include all residues that contact that particular FγcR. By “contact” herein is meant some chemical interaction between at least one atom of an Fc residue with at least one atom of the bound FcγR, with chemical interaction including, but not limited to van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bond interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. In an alternative embodiment, variable positions may include those positions that are indirectly involved in a protein property, i.e. such positions may be proximal to residues that are known to or hypothesized to contribute to an Fc property. For example, the FcγR binding site of an Fc may be defined to include all Fc residues within a certain distance, for example 4-10 Å, of any Fc residue that is in van der Waals contact with the FcγR. Thus variable positions in this case may be chosen not only as residues that directly contact the FcγR, but also those that contact residues that contact the FcγR and thus influence binding indirectly. The specific positions chosen are dependent on the design strategy being employed.\n\n\nOne or more positions in the template structure that are not variable may be floated. By “floated position” herein is meant a position at which the amino acid conformation but not the amino acid identity is allowed to vary in a computational screening calculation. In one embodiment, the floated position may have the parent amino acid identity. For example, floated positions may be positions that are within a small distance, for example 5 Å, of a variable position residue. In an alternate embodiment, a floated position may have a non-parent amino acid identity. Such an embodiment may find use in the present invention, for example, when the goal is to evaluate the energetic or structural outcome of a specific mutation.\n\n\nPositions that are not variable or floated are fixed. By “fixed position” herein is meant a position at which the amino acid identity and the conformation are held constant in a computational screening calculation. Positions that may be fixed include residues that are not known to be or hypothesized to be involved in the property to be optimized. In this case the assumption is that there is little or nothing to be gained by varying these positions. Positions that are fixed may also include positions whose residues are known or hypothesized to be important for maintaining proper folding, structure, stability, solubility, and/or biological function. For example, positions may be fixed for residues that interact with a particular Fc ligand or residues that encode a glycosylation site in order to ensure that binding to the Fc ligand and proper glycosylation respectively are not perturbed. Likewise, if stability is being optimized, it may be beneficial to fix positions that directly or indirectly interact with an Fc ligand, for example an Fc□R, so that binding is not perturbed. Fixed positions may also include structurally important residues such as cysteines participating in disulfide bridges, residues critical for determining backbone conformation such as proline or glycine, critical hydrogen bonding residues, and residues that form favorable packing interactions.\n\n\nThe next step in computational screening is to select a set of possible amino acid identities that will be considered at each particular variable position. This set of possible amino acids is herein referred to as “considered amino acids” at a variable position. “Amino acids” as used herein refers to the set of natural 20 amino acids and any nonnatural or synthetic analogues. In one embodiment, all 20 natural amino acids are considered. Alternatively, a subset of amino acids, or even only one amino acid is considered at a given variable position. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, there is a computational benefit to considering only certain amino acid identities at variable positions, as it decreases the combinatorial complexity of the search. Furthermore, considering only certain amino acids at variable positions may be used to tailor calculations toward specific design strategies. For example, for solubility optimization of aglycosylated Fc, it may be beneficial to allow only polar amino acids to be considered at nonpolar Fc residues that are exposed to solvent in the absence of carbohydrate. Nonnatural amino acids, including synthetic amino acids and analogues of natural amino acids, may also be considered amino acids. For example see Chin et al., 2003\n, Science, \n301(5635):964-7; and Chin et al., 2003\n, Chem. Biol. \n10(6):511-9.\n\n\nA wide variety of methods may be used, alone or in combination, to select which amino acids will be considered at each position. For example, the set of considered amino acids at a given variable position may be chosen based on the degree of exposure to solvent. Hydrophobic or nonpolar amino acids typically reside in the interior or core of a protein, which are inaccessible or nearly inaccessible to solvent. Thus at variable core positions it may be beneficial to consider only or mostly nonpolar amino acids such as alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine. Hydrophilic or polar amino acids typically reside on the exterior or surface of proteins, which have a significant degree of solvent accessibility. Thus at variable surface positions it may be beneficial to consider only or mostly polar amino acids such as alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine and histidine. Some positions are partly exposed and partly buried, and are not clearly protein core or surface positions, in a sense serving as boundary residues between core and surface residues. Thus at such variable boundary positions it may be beneficial to consider both nonpolar and polar amino acids such as alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine. Determination of the degree of solvent exposure at variable positions may be by subjective evaluation or visual inspection of the template structure by one skilled in the art of protein structural biology, or by using a variety of algorithms that are known in the art. Selection of amino acid types to be considered at variable positions may be aided or determined wholly by computational methods, such as calculation of solvent accessible surface area, or using algorithms that assess the orientation of the C□-C□ vectors relative to a solvent accessible surface, as outlined in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,188,965; 6,269,312; 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. In one embodiment, each variable position may be classified explicitly as a core, surface, or boundary position or a classification substantially similar to core, surface, or boundary.\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, selection of the set of amino acids allowed at variable positions may be hypothesis-driven. Hypotheses for which amino acid types should be considered at variable positions may be derived by a subjective evaluation or visual inspection of the template structure by one skilled in the art of protein structural biology. For example, if it is suspected that a hydrogen bonding interaction may be favorable at a variable position, polar residues that have the capacity to form hydrogen bonds may be considered, even if the position is in the core. Likewise, if it is suspected that a hydrophobic packing interaction may be favorable at a variable position, nonpolar residues that have the capacity to form favorable packing interactions may be considered, even if the position is on the surface. Other examples of hypothesis-driven approaches may involve issues of backbone flexibility or protein fold. As is known in the art, certain residues, for example proline, glycine, and cysteine, play important roles in protein structure and stability. Glycine enables greater backbone flexibility than all other amino acids, proline constrains the backbone more than all other amino acids, and cysteines may form disulfide bonds. It may therefore be beneficial to include one or more of these amino acid types to achieve a desired design goal. Alternatively, it may be beneficial to exclude one or more of these amino acid types from the list of considered amino acids.\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, subsets of amino acids may be chosen to maximize coverage. In this case, additional amino acids with properties similar to that in the template structure may be considered at variable positions. For example, if the residue at a variable position in the template structure is a large hydrophobic residue, additional large hydrophobic amino acids may be considered at that position. Alternatively, subsets of amino acids may be chosen to maximize diversity. In this case, amino acids with properties dissimilar to those in the template structure may be considered at variable positions. For example, if the residue at a variable position in the template is a large hydrophobic residue, amino acids that are small, polar, etc. may be considered.\n\n\nAs is known in the art, some computational screening methods require only the identity of considered amino acids to be determined during design calculations. That is, no information is required concerning the conformations or possible conformations of the amino acid side chains. Other preferred methods utilize a set of discrete side chain conformations, called rotamers, which are considered for each amino acid. Thus, a set of rotamers may be considered at each variable and floated position. Rotamers may be obtained from published rotamer libraries (see for example, Lovel et al., 2000\n, Proteins: Structure Function and Genetics \n40:389-408; Dunbrack & Cohen, 1997\n, Protein Science \n6:1661-1681; DeMaeyer et al., 1997\n, Folding and Design \n2:53-66; Tuffery et al., 1991\n, J Biomol Struct Dyn \n8:1267-1289, Ponder & Richards, 1987\n, J Mol Biol \n193:775-791). As is known in the art, rotamer libraries may be backbone-independent or backbone-dependent. Rotamers may also be obtained from molecular mechanics or ab initio calculations, and using other methods. In a preferred embodiment, a flexible rotamer model is used (see Mendes et al., 1999\n, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics \n37:530-543). Similarly, artificially generated rotamers may be used, or augment the set chosen for each amino acid and/or variable position. In one embodiment, at least one conformation that is not low in energy is included in the list of rotamers. In an alternate embodiment, the rotamer of the variable position residue in the template structure is included in the list of rotamers allowed for that variable position. In an alternate embodiment, only the identity of each amino acid considered at variable positions is provided, and no specific conformational states of each amino acid are used during design calculations. That is, use of rotamers is not essential for computational screening.\n\n\nExperimental information may be used to guide the choice of variable positions and/or the choice of considered amino acids at variable positions. As is known in the art, mutagenesis experiments are often carried out to determine the role of certain residues in protein structure and function, for example, which protein residues play a role in determining stability, or which residues make up the interface of a protein-protein interaction. Data obtained from such experiments are useful in the present invention. For example, variable positions for Fc/FcγR affinity enhancement could involve varying all positions at which mutation has been shown to affect binding. Similarly, the results from such an experiment may be used to guide the choice of allowed amino acid types at variable positions. For example, if certain types of amino acid substitutions are found to be favorable, similar types of those amino acids may be considered. In one embodiment, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that were found to be favorable experimentally may be considered at variable positions. For example, if experimental mutation of a variable position at an Fc/FcγR interface to a large hydrophobic residue was found to be favorable, the user may choose to include additional large hydrophobic amino acids at that position in the computational screen. As is known in the art, display and other selection technologies may be coupled with random mutagenesis to generate a list or lists of amino acid substitutions that are favorable for the selected property. Such a list or lists obtained from such experimental work find use in the present invention. For example, positions that are found to be invariable in such an experiment may be excluded as variable positions in computational screening calculations, whereas positions that are found to be more acceptable to mutation or respond favorably to mutation may be chosen as variable positions. Similarly, the results from such experiments may be used to guide the choice of allowed amino acid types at variable positions. For example, if certain types of amino acids arise more frequently in an experimental selection, similar types of those amino acids may be considered. In one embodiment, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that were found to be favorable experimentally may be considered at variable positions. For example, if selected mutations at a variable position that resides at an Fc/FcγR interface are found to be uncharged polar amino acids, the user may choose to include additional uncharged polar amino acids, or perhaps charged polar amino acids, at that position.\n\n\nSequence information may also be used to guide choice of variable positions and/or the choice of amino acids considered at variable positions. As is known in the art, some proteins share a common structural scaffold and are homologous in sequence. This information may be used to gain insight into particular positions in the protein family. As is known in the art, sequence alignments are often carried out to determine which protein residues are conserved and which are not conserved. That is to say, by comparing and contrasting alignments of protein sequences, the degree of variability at a position may be observed, and the types of amino acids that occur naturally at positions may be observed. Data obtained from such analyses are useful in the present invention. The benefit of using sequence information to choose variable positions and considered amino acids at variable positions are several fold. For choice of variable positions, the primary advantage of using sequence information is that insight may be gained into which positions are more tolerant and which are less tolerant to mutation. Thus sequence information may aid in ensuring that quality diversity, i.e. mutations that are not deleterious to protein structure, stability, etc., is sampled computationally. The same advantage applies to use of sequence information to select amino acid types considered at variable positions. That is, the set of amino acids that occur in a protein sequence alignment may be thought of as being pre-screened by evolution to have a higher chance than random for being compatible with a protein's structure, stability, solubility, function, etc. Thus higher quality diversity is sampled computationally. A second benefit of using sequence information to select amino acid types considered at variable positions is that certain alignments may represent sequences that may be less immunogenic than random sequences. For example, if the amino acids considered at a given variable position are the set of amino acids which occur at that position in an alignment of human protein sequences, those amino acids may be thought of as being pre-screened by nature for generating no or low immune response if the optimized protein is used as a human therapeutic.\n\n\nThe source of the sequences may vary widely, and include one or more of the known databases, including but not limited to the Kabat database (Johnson & Wu, 2001\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n29:205-206; Johnson & Wu, 2000\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n28:214-218), the IMGT database (IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information System®; Lefranc et al., 1999\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n27:209-212; Ruiz et al., 2000 \nNucleic Acids Re. \n28:219-221; Lefranc et al., 2001\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n29:207-209; Lefranc et al., 2003\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n31:307-310), and VBASE, SwissProt, GenBank and Entrez, and EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database. Protein sequence information can be obtained, compiled, and/or generated from sequence alignments of naturally occurring proteins from any organism, including but not limited to mammals. Protein sequence information can be obtained from a database that is compiled privately. There are numerous sequence-based alignment programs and methods known in the art, and all of these find use in the present invention for generation of sequence alignments of proteins that comprise Fc and Fc ligands.\n\n\nOnce alignments are made, sequence information can be used to guide choice of variable positions. Such sequence information can relate the variability, natural or otherwise, of a given position. Variability herein should be distinguished from variable position. Variability refers to the degree to which a given position in a sequence alignment shows variation in the types of amino acids that occur there. Variable position, to reiterate, is a position chosen by the user to vary in amino acid identity during a computational screening calculation. Variability may be determined qualitatively by one skilled in the art of bioinformatics. There are also methods known in the art to quantitatively determine variability that may find use in the present invention. The most preferred embodiment measures Information Entropy or Shannon Entropy. Variable positions can be chosen based on sequence information obtained from closely related protein sequences, or sequences that are less closely related.\n\n\nThe use of sequence information to choose variable positions finds broad use in the present invention. For example, if an Fc/FcγR interface position in the template structure is tryptophan, and tryptophan is observed at that position in greater than 90% of the sequences in an alignment, it may be beneficial to leave that position fixed. In contrast, if another interface position is found to have a greater level of variability, for example if five different amino acids are observed at that position with frequencies of approximately 20% each, that position may be chosen as a variable position. In another embodiment, visual inspection of aligned protein sequences may substitute for or aid visual inspection of a protein structure. Sequence information can also be used to guide the choice of amino acids considered at variable positions. Such sequence information can relate to how frequently an amino acid, amino acids, or amino acid types (for example polar or nonpolar, charged or uncharged) occur, naturally or otherwise, at a given position. In one embodiment, the set of amino acids considered at a variable position may comprise the set of amino acids that is observed at that position in the alignment. Thus, the position-specific alignment information is used directly to generate the list of considered amino acids at a variable position in a computational screening calculation. Such a strategy is well known in the art; see for example Lehmann & Wyss, 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n12(4):371-5; Lehmann et al., 2000\n, Biochim Biophys Acta \n1543(2):408-415; Rath & Davidson, 2000\n, Protein Sci, \n9(12):2457-69; Lehmann et al., 2000\n, Protein Eng \n13(1):49-57; Desjarlais & Berg, 1993\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n90(6):2256-60; Desjarlais & Berg, 1992\n, Proteins \n12(2):101-4; Henikoff & Henikoff, 2000\n, Adv Protein Chem \n54:73-97; Henikoff & Henikoff, 1994\n, J Mol Biol \n243(4):574-8. In an alternate embodiment, the set of amino acids considered at a variable position or positions may comprise a set of amino acids that is observed most frequently in the alignment. Thus, a certain criteria is applied to determine whether the frequency of an amino acid or amino acid type warrants its inclusion in the set of amino acids that are considered at a variable position. As is known in the art, sequence alignments may be analyzed using statistical methods to calculate the sequence diversity at any position in the alignment and the occurrence frequency or probability of each amino acid at a position. Such data may then be used to determine which amino acids types to consider. In the simplest embodiment, these occurrence frequencies are calculated by counting the number of times an amino acid is observed at an alignment position, then dividing by the total number of sequences in the alignment. In other embodiments, the contribution of each sequence, position or amino acid to the counting procedure is weighted by a variety of possible mechanisms. In a preferred embodiment, the contribution of each aligned sequence to the frequency statistics is weighted according to its diversity weighting relative to other sequences in the alignment. A common strategy for accomplishing this is the sequence weighting system recommended by Henikoff and Henikoff (Henikoff & Henikoff, 2000\n, Adv Protein Chem \n54:73-97; Henikoff & Henikoff, 1994\n, J Mol Biol \n243:574-8. In a preferred embodiment, the contribution of each sequence to the statistics is dependent on its extent of similarity to the target sequence, i.e. the template structure used, such that sequences with higher similarity to the target sequence are weighted more highly. Examples of similarity measures include, but are not limited to, sequence identity, BLOSUM similarity score, PAM matrix similarity score, and BLAST score. In an alternate embodiment, the contribution of each sequence to the statistics is dependent on its known physical or functional properties. These properties include, but are not limited to, thermal and chemical stability, contribution to activity, and solubility. For example, when optimizing aglycosylated Fc for solubility, those sequences in an alignment that are known to be most soluble (for example see Ewert et al., 2003\n, J Mol Biol \n325:531-553), will contribute more heavily to the calculated frequencies.\n\n\nRegardless of what criteria are applied for choosing the set of amino acids in a sequence alignment to be considered at variable positions, use of sequence information to choose considered amino acids finds broad use in the present invention. For example, to optimize Fc solubility by replacing exposed nonpolar surface residues, considered amino acids may be chosen as the set of amino acids, or a subset of those amino acids which meet some criteria, that are observed at that position in an alignment of protein sequences. As another example, one or more amino acids may be added or subtracted subjectively from a list of amino acids derived from a sequence alignment in order to maximize coverage. For example, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that are found in a sequence alignment may be considered at variable positions. For example, if an Fc position that is known to or hypothesized to bind an FcγR is observed to have uncharged polar amino acids in a sequence alignment, the user may choose to include additional uncharged polar amino acids in a computational screening calculation, or perhaps charged polar amino acids, at that position.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, sequence alignment information is combined with energy calculation, as discussed below. For example, pseudo energies can be derived from sequence information to generate a scoring function. The use of a sequence-based scoring function may assist in significantly reducing the complexity of a calculation. However, as is appreciated by those skilled in the art, the use of a sequence-based scoring function alone may be inadequate because sequence information can often indicate misleading correlations between mutations that may in reality be structurally conflicting. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, a structure-based method of energy calculation is used, either alone or in combination with a sequence-based scoring function. That is, preferred embodiments do not rely on sequence alignment information alone as the analysis step.\n\n\nEnergy calculation refers to the process by which amino acid modifications are scored. The energies of interaction are measured by one or more scoring functions. A variety of scoring functions find use in the present invention for calculating energies. Scoring functions may include any number of potentials, herein referred to as the energy terms of a scoring function, including but not limited to a van der Waals potential, a hydrogen bond potential, an atomic solvation potential or other solvation models, a secondary structure propensity potential, an electrostatic potential, a torsional potential, and an entropy potential. At least one energy term is used to score each variable or floated position, although the energy terms may differ depending on the position, considered amino acids, and other considerations. In one embodiment, a scoring function using one energy term is used. In the most preferred embodiment, energies are calculated using a scoring function that contains more than one energy term, for example describing van der Waals, salvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions, and combinations thereof. In additional embodiments, additional energy terms include but are not limited to entropic terms, torsional energies, and knowledge-based energies.\n\n\nA variety of scoring functions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,188,965; 6,269,312; 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 09/877,695; 10/071,859, 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, scoring functions need not be limited to physico-chemical energy terms. For example, knowledge-based potentials may find use in the computational screening methodology of the present invention. Such knowledge-based potentials may be derived from protein sequence and/or structure statistics including but not limited to threading potentials, reference energies, pseudo energies, homology-based energies, and sequence biases derived from sequence alignments. In a preferred embodiment, a scoring function is modified to include models for immunogenicity, such as functions derived from data on binding of peptides to MHC (Major Htocompatability Complex), that may be used to identify potentially immunogenic sequences (see for example U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/903,378; 10/039,170; 60/222,697; 10/339,788; PCT WO 01/21823; and PCT WO 02/00165). In one embodiment, sequence alignment information can be used to score amino acid substitutions. For example, comparison of protein sequences, regardless of whether the source of said proteins is human, monkey, mouse, or otherwise, may be used to suggest or score amino acid mutations in the computational screening methodology of the present invention. In one embodiment, as is known in the art, one or more scoring functions may be optimized or “trained” during the computational analysis, and then the analysis re-run using the optimized system. Such altered scoring functions may be obtained for example, by training a scoring function using experimental data. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a number of force fields, which are comprised of one or more energy terms, may serve as scoring functions. Force fields include but are not limited to ab initio or quantum mechanical force fields, semi-empirical force fields, and molecular mechanics force fields. Scoring functions that are knowledge-based or that use statistical methods may find use in the present invention. These methods may be used to assess the match between a sequence and a three-dimensional protein structure, and hence may be used to score amino acid substitutions for fidelity to the protein structure. In one embodiment, molecular dynamics calculations may be used to computationally screen sequences by individually calculating mutant sequence scores.\n\n\nThere are a variety of ways to represent amino acids in order to enable efficient energy calculation. In a preferred embodiment, considered amino acids are represented as rotamers, as described previously, and the energy (or score) of interaction of each possible rotamer at each variable and floated position with the other variable and floated rotamers, with fixed position residues, and with the backbone structure and any non-protein atoms, is calculated. In a preferred embodiment, two sets of interaction energies are calculated for each side chain rotamer at every variable and floated position: the interaction energy between the rotamer and the fixed atoms (the “singles” energy), and the interaction energy between the variable and floated positions rotamer and all other possible rotamers at every other variable and floated position (the “doubles” energy). In an alternate embodiment, singles and doubles energies are calculated for fixed positions as well as for variable and floated positions. In an alternate embodiment, considered amino acids are not represented as rotamers.\n\n\nAn important component of computational screening is the identification of one or more sequences that have a favorable score, i.e. are low in energy. Determining a set of low energy sequences from an extremely large number of possibilities is nontrivial, and to solve this problem a combinatorial optimization algorithm is employed. The need for a combinatorial optimization algorithm is illustrated by examining the number of possibilities that are considered in a typical computational screening calculation. The discrete nature of rotamer sets allows a simple calculation of the number of possible rotameric sequences for a given design problem. A backbone of length n with m possible rotamers per position will have m\nn \npossible rotamer sequences, a number that grows exponentially with sequence length. For very simple calculations, it is possible to examine each possible sequence in order to identify the optimal sequence and/or one or more favorable sequences. However, for a typical design problem, the number of possible sequences (up to 10\n80 \nor more) is sufficiently large that examination of each possible sequence is intractable. A variety of combinatorial optimization algorithms may then be used to identify the optimum sequence and/or one or more favorable sequences. Combinatorial optimization algorithms may be divided into two classes: (1) those that are guaranteed to return the global minimum energy configuration if they converge, and (2) those that are not guaranteed to return the global minimum energy configuration, but which will always return a solution. Examples of the first class of algorithms include but are not limited to Dead-End Elimination (DEE) and Branch & Bound (B&B) (including Branch and Terminate) (Gordon & Mayo, 1999\n, Structure Fold Des \n7:1089-98). Examples of the second class of algorithms include, but are not limited to, Monte Carlo (MC), self-consistent mean field (SCMF), Boltzmann sampling (Metropolis et al., 1953\n, J Chem Phys \n21:1087), simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983\n, Science, \n220:671-680), genetic algorithm (GA), and Fast and Accurate Side-Chain Topology and Energy Refinement (FASTER) (Desmet, et al., 2002, Proteins, 48:31-43). A combinatorial optimization algorithm may be used alone or in conjunction with another combinatorial optimization algorithm.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the strategy for applying a combinatorial optimization algorithm is to find the global minimum energy configuration. In an alternate embodiment, the strategy is to find one or more low energy or favorable sequences. In an alternate embodiment, the strategy is to find the global minimum energy configuration and then find one or more low energy or favorable sequences. For example, as outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,312, preferred embodiments utilize a Dead End Elimination (DEE) step and a Monte Carlo step. In other embodiments, tabu search algorithms are used or combined with DEE and/or Monte Carlo, among other search methods (see Modern Heuristic Search Methods, edited by V. J. Rayward-Smith et al., 1996, John Wiley & Sons Ltd.; U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102; and PCT WO 02/25588). In another preferred embodiment, a genetic algorithm may be used; see for example U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/877,695 and 10/071,859. As another example, as is more fully described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,188,965; 6,269,312; 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588, the global optimum may be reached, and then further computational processing may occur, which generates additional optimized sequences. In the simplest embodiment, design calculations are not combinatorial. That is, energy calculations are used to evaluate amino acid substitutions individually at single variable positions. For other calculations it is preferred to evaluate amino acid substitutions at more than one variable position. In a preferred embodiment, all possible interaction energies are calculated prior to combinatorial optimization. In an alternatively preferred embodiment, energies may be calculated as needed during combinatorial optimization.\n\n\nLibrary Generation\n\n\nThe present invention provides methods for generating libraries that may subsequently be screened experimentally to single out optimized Fc variants. By “library” as used herein is meant a set of one or more Fc variants. Library may refer to the set of variants in any form. In one embodiment, the library is a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, or a list of nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions at variable positions. For example, the examples used to illustrate the present invention below provide libraries as amino acid substitutions at variable positions. In one embodiment, a library is a list of at least one sequence that are Fc variants optimized for a desired property. For example see, Filikov et al., 2002\n, Protein Sci \n11: 1452-1461 and Luo et al., 2002\n, Protein Sci \n11:1218-1226. In an alternate embodiment, a library may be defined as a combinatorial list, meaning that a list of amino acid substitutions is generated for each variable position, with the implication that each substitution is to be combined with all other designed substitutions at all other variable positions. In this case, expansion of the combination of all possibilities at all variable positions results in a large explicitly defined library. A library may refer to a physical composition of polypeptides that comprise the Fc region or some domain or fragment of the Fc region. Thus a library may refer to a physical composition of antibodies or Fc fusions, either in purified or unpurified form. A library may refer to a physical composition of nucleic acids that encode the library sequences. Said nucleic acids may be the genes encoding the library members, the genes encoding the library members with any operably linked nucleic acids, or expression vectors encoding the library members together with any other operably linked regulatory sequences, selectable markers, fusion constructs, and/or other elements. For example, the library may be a set of mammalian expression vectors that encode Fc library members, the protein products of which may be subsequently expressed, purified, and screened experimentally. As another example, the library may be a display library. Such a library could, for example, comprise a set of expression vectors that encode library members operably linked to some fusion partner that enables phage display, ribosome display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and the like.\n\n\nThe library may be generated using the output sequence or sequences from computational screening. As discussed above, computationally generated libraries are significantly enriched in stable, properly folded, and functional sequences relative to randomly generated libraries. As a result, computational screening increases the chances of identifying proteins that are optimized for the design goal. The set of sequences in a library is generally, but not always, significantly different from the parent sequence, although in some cases the library preferably contains the parent sequence. As is known in the art, there are a variety of ways that a library may be derived from the output of computational screening calculations. For example, methods of library generation described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 10/218,102; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588 find use in the present invention. In one embodiment, sequences scoring within a certain range of the global optimum sequence may be included in the library. For example, all sequences within 10 kcal/mol of the lowest energy sequence could be used as the library. In an alternate embodiment, sequences scoring within a certain range of one or more local minima sequences may be used. In a preferred embodiment, the library sequences are obtained from a filtered set. Such a list or set may be generated by a variety of methods, as is known in the art, for example using an algorithm such as Monte Carlo, B&B, or SCMF. For example, the top 10\n3 \nor the top 10\n5 \nsequences in the filtered set may comprise the library. Alternatively, the total number of sequences defined by the combination of all mutations may be used as a cutoff criterion for the library. Preferred values for the total number of recombined sequences range from 10 to 10\n20\n, particularly preferred values range from 100 to 10\n9\n. Alternatively, a cutoff may be enforced when a predetermined number of mutations per position is reached. In some embodiments, sequences that do not make the cutoff are included in the library. This may be desirable in some situations, for instance to evaluate the approach to library generation, to provide controls or comparisons, or to sample additional sequence space. For example, the parent sequence may be included in the library, even if it does not make the cutoff.\n\n\nClustering algorithms may be useful for classifying sequences derived by computational screening methods into representative groups. For example, the methods of clustering and their application described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102 and PCT WO 02/25588, find use in the present invention. Representative groups may be defined, for example, by similarity. Measures of similarity include, but are not limited to sequence similarity and energetic similarity. Thus the output sequences from computational screening may be clustered around local minima, referred to herein as clustered sets of sequences. For example, sets of sequences that are close in sequence space may be distinguished from other sets. In one embodiment, coverage within one or a subset of clustered sets may be maximized by including in the library some, most, or all of the sequences that make up one or more clustered sets of sequences. For example, it may be advantageous to maximize coverage within the one, two, or three lowest energy clustered sets by including the majority of sequences within these sets in the library. In an alternate embodiment, diversity across clustered sets of sequences may be sampled by including within a library only a subset of sequences within each clustered set. For example, all or most of the clustered sets could be broadly sampled by including the lowest energy sequence from each clustered set in the library.\n\n\nSequence information may be used to guide or filter computationally screening results for generation of a library. As discussed, by comparing and contrasting alignments of protein sequences, the degree of variability at a position and the types of amino acids which occur naturally at that position may be observed. Data obtained from such analyses are useful in the present invention. The benefits of using sequence information have been discussed, and those benefits apply equally to use of sequence information to guide library generation. The set of amino acids that occur in a sequence alignment may be thought of as being pre-screened by evolution to have a higher chance than random at being compatible with a protein's structure, stability, solubility, function, and immunogenicity. The variety of sequence sources, as well as the methods for generating sequence alignments that have been discussed, find use in the application of sequence information to guiding library generation. Likewise, as discussed above, various criteria may be applied to determine the importance or weight of certain residues in an alignment. These methods also find use in the application of sequence information to guide library generation. Using sequence information to guide library generation from the results of computational screening finds broad use in the present invention. In one embodiment, sequence information is used to filter sequences from computational screening output. That is to say, some substitutions are subtracted from the computational output to generate the library. For example the resulting output of a computational screening calculation or calculations may be filtered so that the library includes only those amino acids, or a subset of those amino acids that meet some criteria, for example that are observed at that position in an alignment of sequences. In an alternate embodiment, sequence information is used to add sequences to the computational screening output. That is to say, sequence information is used to guide the choice of additional amino acids that are added to the computational output to generate the library. For example, the output set of amino acids for a given position from a computational screening calculation may be augmented to include one or more amino acids that are observed at that position in an alignment of protein sequences. In an alternate embodiment, based on sequence alignment information, one or more amino acids may be added to or subtracted from the computational screening sequence output in order to maximize coverage or diversity. For example, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that are found in a sequence alignment may be added to the library. For example, if a position is observed to have uncharged polar amino acids in a sequence alignment, additional uncharged polar amino acids may be included in the library at that position.\n\n\nLibraries may be processed further to generate subsequent libraries. In this way, the output from a computational screening calculation or calculations may be thought of as a primary library. This primary library may be combined with other primary libraries from other calculations or other libraries, processed using subsequent calculations, sequence information, or other analyses, or processed experimentally to generate a subsequent library, herein referred to as a secondary library. As will be appreciated from this description, the use of sequence information to guide or filter libraries, discussed above, is itself one method of generating secondary libraries from primary libraries. Generation of secondary libraries gives the user greater control of the parameters within a library. This enables more efficient experimental screening, and may allow feedback from experimental results to be interpreted more easily, providing a more efficient design/experimentation cycle.\n\n\nThere are a wide variety of methods to generate secondary libraries from primary libraries. For example, U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102 and PCT WO 02/25588, describes methods for secondary library generation that find use in the present invention. Typically some selection step occurs in which a primary library is processed in some way. For example, in one embodiment a selection step occurs wherein some set of primary sequences are chosen to form the secondary library. In an alternate embodiment, a selection step is a computational step, again generally including a selection step, wherein some subset of the primary library is chosen and then subjected to further computational analysis, including both further computational screening as well as techniques such as “in silico” shuffling or recombination (see, for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,830,721; 5,811,238; 5,605,793; and 5,837,458, error-prone PCR, for example using modified nucleotides; known mutagenesis techniques including the use of multi-cassettes; and DNA shuffling (Crameri et al., 1998\n, Nature \n391:288-291; Coco et al., 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19:354-9; Coco et al., 2002\n, Nat Biotechnol, \n20:1246-50), heterogeneous DNA samples (U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,250); ITCHY (Ostermeier et al., 1999\n, Nat Biotechnol \n17:1205-1209); StEP (Zhao et al., 1998\n, Nat Biotechnol \n16:258-261), GSSM (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,171,820 and 5,965,408); in vivo homologous recombination, ligase assisted gene assembly, end-complementary PCR, profusion (Roberts & Szostak, 1997\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n94:12297-12302); yeast/bacteria surface display (Lu et al., 1995\n, Biotechnology \n13:366-372); Seed & Aruffo, 1987\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n84(10):3365-3369; Boder & Wittrup, 1997\n, Nat Biotechnol \n15:553-557). In an alternate embodiment, a selection step occurs that is an experimental step, for example any of the library screening steps below, wherein some subset of the primary library is chosen and then recombined experimentally, for example using one of the directed evolution methods discussed below, to form a secondary library. In a preferred embodiment, the primary library is generated and processed as outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312.\n\n\nGeneration of secondary and subsequent libraries finds broad use in the present invention. In one embodiment, different primary libraries may be combined to generate a secondary or subsequent library. In another embodiment, secondary libraries may be generated by sampling sequence diversity at highly mutatable or highly conserved positions. The primary library may be analyzed to determine which amino acid positions in the template protein have high mutational frequency, and which positions have low mutational frequency. For example, positions in a protein that show a great deal of mutational diversity in computational screening may be fixed in a subsequent round of design calculations. A filtered set of the same size as the first would now show diversity at positions that were largely conserved in the first library. Alternatively, the secondary library may be generated by varying the amino acids at the positions that have high numbers of mutations, while keeping constant the positions that do not have mutations above a certain frequency.\n\n\nThis discussion is not meant to constrain generation of libraries subsequent to primary libraries to secondary libraries. As will be appreciated, primary and secondary libraries may be processed further to generate tertiary libraries, quaternary libraries, and so on. In this way, library generation is an iterative process. For example, tertiary libraries may be constructed using a variety of additional steps applied to one or more secondary libraries; for example, further computational processing may occur, secondary libraries may be recombined, or subsets of different secondary libraries may be combined. In a preferred embodiment, a tertiary library may be generated by combining secondary libraries. For example, primary and/or secondary libraries that analyzed different parts of a protein may be combined to generate a tertiary library that treats the combined parts of the protein. In an alternate embodiment, the variants from a primary library may be combined with the variants from another primary library to provide a combined tertiary library at lower computational cost than creating a very long filtered set. These combinations may be used, for example, to analyze large proteins, especially large multi-domain proteins, of which Fc is an example. Thus the above description of secondary library generation applies to generating any library subsequent to a primary library, the end result being a final library that may screened experimentally to obtain protein variants optimized for a design goal. These examples are not meant to constrain generation of secondary libraries to any particular application or theory of operation for the present invention. Rather, these examples are meant to illustrate that generation of secondary libraries, and subsequent libraries such as tertiary libraries and so on, is broadly useful in computational screening methodology for library generation.\n\n\nExperimental Production and Screening\n\n\nThe present invention provides methods for producing and screening libraries of Fc variants. The described methods are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation. Rather, the provided methods are meant to illustrate generally that one or more Fc variants or one or more libraries of Fc variants may be produced and screened experimentally to obtain optimized Fc variants. Fc variants may be produced and screened in any context, whether as an Fc region as precisely defined herein, a domain or fragment thereof, or a larger polypeptide that comprises Fc such as an antibody or Fc fusion. General methods for antibody molecular biology, expression, purification, and screening are described in Antibody Engineering, edited by Duebel & Kontermann, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, 2001; and Hayhurst & Georgiou, 2001\n, Curr Opin Chem Biol \n5:683-689; Maynard & Georgiou, 2000\n, Annu Rev Biomed Eng \n2:339-76.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the library sequences are used to create nucleic acids that encode the member sequences, and that may then be cloned into host cells, expressed and assayed, if desired. Thus, nucleic acids, and particularly DNA, may be made that encode each member protein sequence. These practices are carried out using well-known procedures. For example, a variety of methods that may find use in the present invention are described in Molecular Cloning—A Laboratory Manual, 3\nrd \nEd. (Maniatis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 2001), and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley & Sons). As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the generation of exact sequences for a library comprising a large number of sequences is potentially expensive and time consuming. Accordingly, there are a variety of techniques that may be used to efficiently generate libraries of the present invention. Such methods that may find use in the present invention are described or referenced in U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 10/218,102; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. Such methods include but are not limited to gene assembly methods, PCR-based method and methods which use variations of PCR, ligase chain reaction-based methods, pooled oligo methods such as those used in synthetic shuffling, error-prone amplification methods and methods which use oligos with random mutations, classical site-directed mutagenesis methods, cassette mutagenesis, and other amplification and gene synthesis methods. As is known in the art, there are a variety of commercially available kits and methods for gene assembly, mutagenesis, vector subcloning, and the like, and such commercial products find use in the present invention for generating nucleic acids that encode Fc variant members of a library.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be produced by culturing a host cell transformed with nucleic acid, preferably an expression vector, containing nucleic acid encoding the Fc variants, under the appropriate conditions to induce or cause expression of the protein. The conditions appropriate for expression will vary with the choice of the expression vector and the host cell, and will be easily ascertained by one skilled in the art through routine experimentation. A wide variety of appropriate host cells may be used, including but not limited to mammalian cells, bacteria, insect cells, and yeast. For example, a variety of cell lines that may find use in the present invention are described in the ATCC® cell line catalog, available from the American Type Culture Collection.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are expressed in mammalian expression systems, including systems in which the expression constructs are introduced into the mammalian cells using virus such as retrovirus or adenovirus. Any mammalian cells may be used, with human, mouse, rat, hamster, and primate cells being particularly preferred. Suitable cells also include known research cells, including but not limited to Jurkat T cells, NIH3T3, CHO, COS, and 293 cells. In an alternately preferred embodiment, library proteins are expressed in bacterial cells. Bacterial expression systems are well known in the art, and include \nEscherichia coli \n(\nE. coli\n), \nBacillus subtilis, Streptococcus cremoris\n, and \nStreptococcus lividans\n. In alternate embodiments, Fc variants are produced in insect cells or yeast cells. In an alternate embodiment, Fc variants are expressed in vitro using cell free translation systems. In vitro translation systems derived from both prokaryotic (e.g. \nE. coli\n) and eukaryotic (e.g. wheat germ, rabbit reticulocytes) cells are available and may be chosen based on the expression levels and functional properties of the protein of interest. For example, as appreciated by those skilled in the art, in vitro translation is required for some display technologies, for example ribosome display. In addition, the Fc variants may be produced by chemical synthesis methods.\n\n\nThe nucleic acids that encode the Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into an expression vector in order to express the protein. A variety of expression vectors may be utilized for protein expression. Expression vectors may comprise self-replicating extra-chromosomal vectors or vectors which integrate into a host genome. Expression vectors are constructed to be compatible with the host cell type. Thus expression vectors which find use in the present invention include but are not limited to those which enable protein expression in mammalian cells, bacteria, insect cells, yeast, and in in vitro systems. As is known in the art, a variety of expression vectors are available, commercially or otherwise, that may find use in the present invention for expressing Fc variant proteins.\n\n\nExpression vectors typically comprise a protein operably linked with control or regulatory sequences, selectable markers, any fusion partners, and/or additional elements. By “operably linked” herein is meant that the nucleic acid is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. Generally, these expression vectors include transcriptional and translational regulatory nucleic acid operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the Fc variant, and are typically appropriate to the host cell used to express the protein. In general, the transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences may include promoter sequences, ribosomal binding sites, transcriptional start and stop sequences, translational start and stop sequences, and enhancer or activator sequences. As is also known in the art, expression vectors typically contain a selection gene or marker to allow the selection of transformed host cells containing the expression vector. Selection genes are well known in the art and will vary with the host cell used.\n\n\nFc variants may be operably linked to a fusion partner to enable targeting of the expressed protein, purification, screening, display, and the like. Fusion partners may be linked to the Fc variant sequence via a linker sequences. The linker sequence will generally comprise a small number of amino acids, typically less than ten, although longer linkers may also be used. Typically, linker sequences are selected to be flexible and resistant to degradation. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, any of a wide variety of sequences may be used as linkers. For example, a common linker sequence comprises the amino acid sequence GGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 6). A fusion partner may be a targeting or signal sequence that directs Fc variant protein and any associated fusion partners to a desired cellular location or to the extracellular media. As is known in the art, certain signaling sequences may target a protein to be either secreted into the growth media, or into the periplasmic space, located between the inner and outer membrane of the cell. A fusion partner may also be a sequence that encodes a peptide or protein that enables purification and/or screening. Such fusion partners include but are not limited to polyhistidine tags (His-tags) (for example H\n6 \nand H\n10 \nor other tags for use with Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) systems (e.g. Ni\n+2 \naffinity columns)), GST fusions, MBP fusions, Strep-tag, the BSP biotinylation target sequence of the bacterial enzyme BirA, and epitope tags which are targeted by antibodies (for example c-myc tags, flag-tags, and the like). As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, such tags may be useful for purification, for screening, or both. For example, an Fc variant may be purified using a His-tag by immobilizing it to a Ni\n+2 \naffinity column, and then after purification the same His-tag may be used to immobilize the antibody to a Ni\n+2 \ncoated plate to perform an ELISA or other binding assay (as described below). A fusion partner may enable the use of a selection method to screen Fc variants (see below). Fusion partners that enable a variety of selection methods are well-known in the art, and all of these find use in the present invention. For example, by fusing the members of an Fc variant library to the gene III protein, phage display can be employed (Kay et al., Phage display of peptides and proteins: a laboratory manual, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1996; Lowman et al., 1991\n, Biochemistry \n30:10832-10838; Smith, 1985\n, Science \n228:1315-1317). Fusion partners may enable Fc variants to be labeled. Alternatively, a fusion partner may bind to a specific sequence on the expression vector, enabling the fusion partner and associated Fc variant to be linked covalently or noncovalently with the nucleic acid that encodes them. For example, U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/642,574; 10/080,376; 09/792,630; 10/023,208; 09/792,626; 10/082,671; 09/953,351; 10/097,100; U.S. Ser. No. 60/366,658; PCT WO 00/22906; PCT WO 01/49058; PCT WO 02/04852; PCT WO 02/04853; PCT WO 02/08023; PCT WO 01/28702; and PCT WO 02/07466 describe such a fusion partner and technique that may find use in the present invention.\n\n\nThe methods of introducing exogenous nucleic acid into host cells are well known in the art, and will vary with the host cell used. Techniques include but are not limited to dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, calcium chloride treatment, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, viral or phage infection, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei. In the case of mammalian cells, transfection may be either transient or stable.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, Fc variant proteins are purified or isolated after expression. Proteins may be isolated or purified in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art. Standard purification methods include chromatographic techniques, including ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, affinity, sizing or gel filtration, and reversed-phase, carried out at atmospheric pressure or at high pressure using systems such as FPLC and HPLC. Purification methods also include electrophoretic, immunological, precipitation, dialysis, and chromatofocusing techniques. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration techniques, in conjunction with protein concentration, are also useful. As is well known in the art, a variety of natural proteins bind Fc and antibodies, and these proteins can find use in the present invention for purification of Fc variants. For example, the bacterial proteins A and G bind to the Fc region. Likewise, the bacterial protein L binds to the Fab region of some antibodies, as of course does the antibody's target antigen. Purification can often be enabled by a particular fusion partner. For example, Fc variant proteins may be purified using glutathione resin if a GST fusion is employed, Ni\n+2 \naffinity chromatography if a His-tag is employed, or immobilized anti-flag antibody if a flag-tag is used. For general guidance in suitable purification techniques, see Protein Purification: Principles and Practice, 3\nrd \nEd., Scopes, Springer-Verlag, NY, 1994. The degree of purification necessary will vary depending on the screen or use of the Fc variants. In some instances no purification is necessary. For example in one embodiment, if the Fc variants are secreted, screening may take place directly from the media. As is well known in the art, some methods of selection do not involve purification of proteins. Thus, for example, if a library of Fc variants is made into a phage display library, protein purification may not be performed.\n\n\nFc variants may be screened using a variety of methods, including but not limited to those that use in vitro assays, in vivo and cell-based assays, and selection technologies. Automation and high-throughput screening technologies may be utilized in the screening procedures. Screening may employ the use of a fusion partner or label. The use of fusion partners has been discussed above. By “labeled” herein is meant that the Fc variants of the invention have one or more elements, isotopes, or chemical compounds attached to enable the detection in a screen. In general, labels fall into three classes: a) immune labels, which may be an epitope incorporated as a fusion partner that is recognized by an antibody, b) isotopic labels, which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes, and c) small molecule labels, which may include fluorescent and colorimetric dyes, or molecules such as biotin that enable other labeling methods. Labels may be incorporated into the compound at any position and may be incorporated in vitro or in vivo during protein expression.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the functional and/or biophysical properties of Fc variants are screened in an in vitro assay. In vitro assays may allow a broad dynamic range for screening properties of interest. Properties of Fc variants that may be screened include but are not limited to stability, solubility, and affinity for Fc ligands, for example Fc□Rs. Multiple properties may be screened simultaneously or individually. Proteins may be purified or unpurified, depending on the requirements of the assay. In one embodiment, the screen is a qualitative or quantitative binding assay for binding of Fc variants to a protein or nonprotein molecule that is known or thought to bind the Fc variant. In a preferred embodiment, the screen is a binding assay for measuring binding to the antibody's or Fc fusions' target antigen. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the screen is an assay for binding of Fc variants to an Fc ligand, including but are not limited to the family of Fc□Rs, the neonatal receptor FcRn, the complement protein C1q, and the bacterial proteins A and G. Said Fc ligands may be from any organism, with humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys preferred. Binding assays can be carried out using a variety of methods known in the art, including but not limited to FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) and BRET (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer)-based assays, AlphaScreen™ (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay), Scintillation Proximity Assay, ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance, also known as BIACORE®), isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, gel electrophoresis, and chromatography including gel filtration. These and other methods may take advantage of some fusion partner or label of the Fc variant. Assays may employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic, fluorescent, luminescent, or isotopic labels.\n\n\nThe biophysical properties of Fc variant proteins, for example stability and solubility, may be screened using a variety of methods known in the art. Protein stability may be determined by measuring the thermodynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states. For example, Fc variant proteins of the present invention may be unfolded using chemical denaturant, heat, or pH, and this transition may be monitored using methods including but not limited to circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, absorbance spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry, and proteolysis. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the kinetic parameters of the folding and unfolding transitions may also be monitored using these and other techniques. The solubility and overall structural integrity of an Fc variant protein may be quantitatively or qualitatively determined using a wide range of methods that are known in the art. Methods which may find use in the present invention for characterizing the biophysical properties of Fc variant proteins include gel electrophoresis, chromatography such as size exclusion chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, analytical ultra-centrifugation, dynamic light scattering, proteolysis, and cross-linking, turbidity measurement, filter retardation assays, immunological assays, fluorescent dye binding assays, protein-staining assays, microscopy, and detection of aggregates via ELISA or other binding assay. Structural analysis employing X-ray crystallographic techniques and NMR spectroscopy may also find use. In one embodiment, stability and/or solubility may be measured by determining the amount of protein solution after some defined period of time. In this assay, the protein may or may not be exposed to some extreme condition, for example elevated temperature, low pH, or the presence of denaturant. Because function typically requires a stable, soluble, and/or well-folded/structured protein, the aforementioned functional and binding assays also provide ways to perform such a measurement. For example, a solution comprising an Fc variant could be assayed for its ability to bind target antigen, then exposed to elevated temperature for one or more defined periods of time, then assayed for antigen binding again. Because unfolded and aggregated protein is not expected to be capable of binding antigen, the amount of activity remaining provides a measure of the Fc variant's stability and solubility.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the library is screened using one or more cell-based or in vivo assays. For such assays, Fc variant proteins, purified or unpurified, are typically added exogenously such that cells are exposed to individual variants or pools of variants belonging to a library. These assays are typically, but not always, based on the function of an antibody or Fc fusion that comprises the Fc variant; that is, the ability of the antibody or Fc fusion to bind a target antigen and mediate some biochemical event, for example effector function, ligand/receptor binding inhibition, apoptosis, and the like. Such assays often involve monitoring the response of cells to antibody or Fc fusion, for example cell survival, cell death, change in cellular morphology, or transcriptional activation such as cellular expression of a natural gene or reporter gene. For example, such assays may measure the ability of Fc variants to elicit ADCC, ADCP, or CDC. For some assays additional cells or components, that is in addition to the target cells, may need to be added, for example serum complement, or effector cells such as peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs), NK cells, macrophages, and the like. Such additional cells may be from any organism, preferably humans, mice, rat, rabbit, and monkey. Antibodies and Fc fusions may cause apoptosis of certain cell lines expressing the antibody's target antigen, or they may mediate attack on target cells by immune cells which have been added to the assay. Methods for monitoring cell death or viability are known in the art, and include the use of dyes, immunochemical, cytochemical, and radioactive reagents. For example, caspase staining assays may enable apoptosis to be measured, and uptake or release of radioactive substrates or fluorescent dyes such as alamar blue may enable cell growth or activation to be monitored. In a preferred embodiment, the DELFIA® EuTDA-based cytotoxicity assay (Perkin Elmer, MA) is used. Alternatively, dead or damaged target cells may be monitored by measuring the release of one or more natural intracellular proteins, for example lactate dehydrogenase. Transcriptional activation may also serve as a method for assaying function in cell-based assays. In this case, response may be monitored by assaying for natural genes or proteins which may be upregulated, for example the release of certain interleukins may be measured, or alternatively readout may be via a reporter construct. Cell-based assays may also involve the measure of morphological changes of cells as a response to the presence of an Fc variant. Cell types for such assays may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic, and a variety of cell lines that are known in the art may be employed.\n\n\nAlternatively, cell-based screens are performed using cells that have been transformed or transfected with nucleic acids encoding the Fc variants. That is, Fc variant proteins are not added exogenously to the cells. For example, in one embodiment, the cell-based screen utilizes cell surface display. A fusion partner can be employed that enables display of Fc variants on the surface of cells (Witrrup, 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol, \n12:395-399). Cell surface display methods that may find use in the present invention include but are not limited to display on bacteria (Georgiou et al., 1997\n, Nat Biotechnol \n15:29-34; Georgiou et al., 1993\n, Trends Biotechnol \n11:6-10; Lee et al., 2000\n, Nat Biotechnol \n18:645-648; Jun et al., 1998\n, Nat Biotechnol \n16:576-80), yeast (Boder & Wittrup, 2000\n, Methods Enzymol \n328:430-44; Boder & Wittrup, 1997\n, Nat Biotechnol \n15:553-557), and mammalian cells (Whitehorn et al., 1995\n, Bio/technology \n13:1215-1219). In an alternate embodiment, Fc variant proteins are not displayed on the surface of cells, but rather are screened intracellularly or in some other cellular compartment. For example, periplasmic expression and cytometric screening (Chen et al., 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19: 537-542), the protein fragment complementation assay (Johnsson & Varshavsky, 1994\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n91:10340-10344; Pelletier et al., 1998\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95:12141-12146), and the yeast two hybrid screen (Fields & Song, 1989, Nature 340:245-246) may find use in the present invention. Alternatively, if a polypeptide that comprises the Fc variants, for example an antibody or Fc fusion, imparts some selectable growth advantage to a cell, this property may be used to screen or select for Fc variants.\n\n\nAs is known in the art, a subset of screening methods are those that select for favorable members of a library. Said methods are herein referred to as “selection methods”, and these methods find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries. When libraries are screened using a selection method, only those members of a library that are favorable, that is which meet some selection criteria, are propagated, isolated, and/or observed. As will be appreciated, because only the most fit variants are observed, such methods enable the screening of libraries that are larger than those screenable by methods that assay the fitness of library members individually. Selection is enabled by any method, technique, or fusion partner that links, covalently or noncovalently, the phenotype of an Fc variant with its genotype, that is the function of an Fc variant with the nucleic acid that encodes it. For example the use of phage display as a selection method is enabled by the fusion of library members to the gene III protein. In this way, selection or isolation of variant proteins that meet some criteria, for example binding affinity for an FcγR, also selects for or isolates the nucleic acid that encodes it. Once isolated, the gene or genes encoding Fc variants may then be amplified. This process of isolation and amplification, referred to as panning, may be repeated, allowing favorable Fc variants in the library to be enriched. Nucleic acid sequencing of the attached nucleic acid ultimately allows for gene identification.\n\n\nA variety of selection methods are known in the art that may find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries. These include but are not limited to phage display (Phage display of peptides and proteins: a laboratory manual, Kay et al., 1996, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1996; Lowman et al., 1991\n, Biochemistry \n30:10832-10838; Smith, 1985\n, Science \n228:1315-1317) and its derivatives such as selective phage infection (Malmborg et al., 1997, J Mol Biol 273:544-551), selectively infective phage (Krebber et al., 1997\n, J Mol Biol \n268:619-630), and delayed infectivity panning (Benhar et al., 2000\n, J Mol Biol \n301:893-904), cell surface display (Witrrup, 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol, \n12:395-399) such as display on bacteria (Georgiou et al., 1997\n, Nat Biotechnol \n15:29-34; Georgiou et al., 1993\n, Trends Biotechnol \n11:6-10; Lee et al., 2000\n, Nat Biotechnol \n18:645-648; Jun et al., 1998\n, Nat Biotechnol \n16:576-80), yeast (Boder & Wittrup, 2000\n, Methods Enzymol \n328:430-44; Boder & Wittrup, 1997\n, Nat Biotechnol \n15:553-557), and mammalian cells (Whitehorn et al., 1995\n, Bio/technology \n13:1215-1219), as well as in vitro display technologies (Amstutz et al., 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n12:400-405) such as polysome display (Mattheakis et al., 1994\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n91:9022-9026), ribosome display (Hanes et al., 1997\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n94:4937-4942), mRNA display (Roberts & Szostak, 1997\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n94:12297-12302; Nemoto et al., 1997\n, FEBS Lett \n414:405-408), and ribosome-inactivation display system (Zhou et al., 2002\n, J Am Chem Soc \n124, 538-543)\n\n\nOther selection methods that may find use in the present invention include methods that do not rely on display, such as in vivo methods including but not limited to periplasmic expression and cytometric screening (Chen et al., 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19:537-542), the protein fragment complementation assay (Johnsson & Varshavsky, 1994\n, Proc Nat Acad Sci USA \n91:10340-10344; Pelletier et al., 1998\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95:12141-12146), and the yeast two hybrid screen (Fields & Song, 1989\n, Nature \n340:245-246) used in selection mode (Visintin et al., 1999\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n96:11723-11728). In an alternate embodiment, selection is enabled by a fusion partner that binds to a specific sequence on the expression vector, thus linking covalently or noncovalently the fusion partner and associated Fc variant library member with the nucleic acid that encodes them. For example, U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/642,574; 10/080,376; 09/792,630; 10/023,208; 09/792,626; 10/082,671; 09/953,351; 10/097,100; U.S. Ser. No. 60/366,658; PCT WO 00/22906; PCT WO 01/49058; PCT WO 02/04852; PCT WO 02/04853; PCT WO 02/08023; PCT WO 01/28702; and PCT WO 02/07466 describe such a fusion partner and technique that may find use in the present invention. In an alternative embodiment, in vivo selection can occur if expression of a polypeptide that comprises the Fc variant, such as an antibody or Fc fusion, imparts some growth, reproduction, or survival advantage to the cell.\n\n\nA subset of selection methods referred to as “directed evolution” methods are those that include the mating or breading of favorable sequences during selection, sometimes with the incorporation of new mutations. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, directed evolution methods can facilitate identification of the most favorable sequences in a library, and can increase the diversity of sequences that are screened. A variety of directed evolution methods are known in the art that may find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries, including but not limited to DNA shuffling (PCT WO 00/42561 A3; PCT WO 01/70947 A3), exon shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 6,365,377; Kolkman & Stemmer, 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19:423-428), family shuffling (Crameri et al., 1998\n, Nature \n391:288-291; U.S. Pat. No. 6,376,246), RACHITT™ (Coco et al., 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19:354-359; PCT WO 02/06469), STEP and random priming of in vitro recombination (Zhao et al., 1998\n, Nat Biotechnol \n16:258-261; Shao et al., 1998\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n26:681-683), exonuclease mediated gene assembly (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,352,842; 6,361,974), Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis™ (U.S. Pat. No. 6,358,709), Gene Reassembly™ (U.S. Pat. No. 6,358,709), SCRATCHY (Lutz et al., 2001\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n98:11248-11253), DNA fragmentation methods (Kikuchi et al., \nGene \n236:159-167), single-stranded DNA shuffling (Kikuchi et al., 2000\n, Gene \n243:133-137), and AMEsystem™ directed evolution protein engineering technology (Applied Molecular Evolution) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,824,514; 5,817,483; 5,814,476; 5,763,192; 5,723,323).\n\n\nThe biological properties of the antibodies and Fc fusions that comprise the Fc variants of the present invention may be characterized in cell, tissue, and whole organism experiments. As is know in the art, drugs are often tested in animals, including but not limited to mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, pigs, and monkeys, in order to measure a drug's efficacy for treatment against a disease or disease model, or to measure a drug's pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and other properties. Said animals may be referred to as disease models. Therapeutics are often tested in mice, including but not limited to nude mice, SCID mice, xenograft mice, and transgenic mice (including knockins and knockouts). For example, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention that is intended as an anti-cancer therapeutic may be tested in a mouse cancer model, for example a xenograft mouse. In this method, a tumor or tumor cell line is grafted onto or injected into a mouse, and subsequently the mouse is treated with the therapeutic to determine the ability of the antibody or Fc fusion to reduce or inhibit cancer growth. Such experimentation may provide meaningful data for determination of the potential of said antibody or Fc fusion to be used as a therapeutic. Any organism, preferably mammals, may be used for testing. For example because of their genetic similarity to humans, monkeys can be suitable therapeutic models, and thus may be used to test the efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, or other property of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention. Tests of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention in humans are ultimately required for approval as drugs, and thus of course these experiments are contemplated. Thus the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be tested in humans to determine their therapeutic efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and/or other clinical properties.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExamples are provided below to illustrate the present invention. These examples are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation.\n\n\nFor all positions discussed in the present invention, numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat (Kabat et al., 1991\n, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5th Ed., United States Public Health Svice, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Those skilled in the art of antibodies will appreciate that this convention consists of nonsequential numbering in specific regions of an immunoglobulin sequence, enabling a normalized reference to conserved positions in immunoglobulin families. Accordingly, the positions of any given immunoglobulin as defined by the EU index will not necessarily correspond to its sequential sequence. \nFIG. 3\n shows the sequential and EU index numbering schemes for the antibody alemtuzumab in order to illustrate this principal more clearly. It should also be noted that polymorphisms have been observed at a number of Fc positions, including but not limited to \nKabat\n 270, 272, 312, 315, 356, and 358, and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the scientific literature may exist.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nComputational Screening and Design of Fc Libraries\n\n\nComputational screening calculations were carried out to design optimized Fc variants. Fc variants were computationally screened, constructed, and experimentally investigated over several computation/experimentation cycles. For each successive cycle, experimental data provided feedback into the next set of computational screening calculations and library design. All computational screening calculations and library design are presented in Example 1. For each set of calculations, a table is provided that presents the results and provides relevant information and parameters.\n\n\nSeveral different structures of Fc bound to the extracellular domain of Fc□Rs served as template structures for the computational screening calculations. Publicly available Fc/FcγR complex structures included pdb accession code 1E4K (Sondermann et al., 2000\n, Nature \n406:267-273), and pdb accession codes 1IIS and 1IIX (Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16469-16477). The extracellular regions of Fc□RIIIb and FcγRIIIa are 96% identical, and therefore the use of the Fc/FcγRIIIb structure is essentially equivalent to use of FcγRIIa. Nonetheless, for some calculations, a more precise Fc/Fc□RIIIa template structure was constructed by modeling a D129G mutation in the 1IIS and 1E4K structures (referred to as D129G 1IIS and D129G 1E4K template structures). In addition, the structures for human Fc bound to the extracellular domains of human FcγRIIb, human F158 Fc□RIIIa, and mouse FcγRIII were modeled using standard methods, the available Fc□R sequence information, the aforementioned Fc/FcγR structures, as well as structural information for unbound complexes (pdb accession code 1H9V) (Sondermann et al., 2001\n, J Mol Biol \n309:737-749) (pdb accession code 1FCG) (Maxwell et al., 1999\n, Nat Struct Biol \n6:437-442), Fc□RIIb (pdb accession code 2FCB) (Sondermann et al., 1999\n, Embo J \n18:1095-1103), and Fc□RIIIb (pdb accession code 1E4J) (Sondermann et al., 2000\n, Nature \n406:267-273).\n\n\nVariable positions and amino acids to be considered at those positions were chosen by visual inspection of the aforementioned Fc/FcγR and FcγR structures, and using solvent accessibility information and sequence information. Sequence information of Fcs and FcγRs was particularly useful for determining variable positions at which substitutions may provide distinguishing affinities between activating and inhibitory receptors. Virtually all Cγ2 positions were screened computationally. The Fc structure is a homodimer of two heavy chains (labeled chains A and B in the 1IIS, 1IIX, and 1E4K structures) that each include the hinge and C□2-C□3 domains (shown in \nFIG. 2\n). Because the Fc□R (labeled chain C in the 1IIS, 1IIX, and 1E4K structures) binds asymmetrically to the Fc homodimer, each chain was often considered separately in design calculations. For some calculations, Fc and/or Fc□R residues proximal to variable position residues were floated, that is the amino acid conformation but not the amino acid identity was allowed to vary in a protein design calculation to allow for conformational adjustments. These are indicated below the table for each set of calculations when relevant. Considered amino acids typically belonged to either the Core, Core XM, Surface, Boundary, Boundary XM, or All 20 classifications, unless noted otherwise. These classifications are defined as follows: Core=alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine; Core XM=alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; Surface=alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine and histidine; Boundary=alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine; Boundary XM=Boundary=alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; All 20=all 20 naturally occurring amino acids.\n\n\nThe majority of calculations followed one of two general types of computational screening methods. In one method, the conformations of amino acids at variable positions were represented as a set of backbone-independent side chain rotamers derived from the rotamer library of Dunbrack & Cohen (Dunbrack et al., 1997\n, Protein Sci \n6:1661-1681). The energies of all possible combinations of the considered amino acids at the chosen variable positions were calculated using a force field containing terms describing van der Waals, solvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions, and the optimal (ground state) sequence was determined using a Dead End Elimination (DEE) algorithm. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the predicted lowest energy sequence is not necessarily the true lowest energy sequence because of errors primarily in the scoring function, coupled with the fact that subtle conformational differences in proteins can result in dramatic differences in stability. However, the predicted ground state sequence is likely to be close to the true ground state, and thus additional favorable diversity can be explored by evaluating the energy of sequences that are close in sequence space and energy around the predicted ground state. To accomplish this, as well as to generate a diversity of sequences for a library, a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm was used to evaluate the energies of 1000 similar sequences around the predicted ground state. The number of sequences out of the 1000 sequence set that contain that amino acid at that variable position is referred to as the occupancy for that substitution, and this value may reflect how favorable that substitution is. This computational screening method is substantially similar to Protein Design Automation® (PDA®) technology, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,188,965; 6,269,312; 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588, and for ease of description, is referred to as PDA® technology throughout the examples. Tables that present the results of these calculations provide for each variable position on the designated chain (column 1) the amino acids considered at each variable position (column 2), the WT Fc amino acid identity at each variable position (column 3), the amino acid identity at each variable position in the DEE ground state sequence (column 4), and the set of amino acids and corresponding occupancy that are observed in the Monte Carlo output (column 5).\n\n\nOther calculations utilized a genetic algorithm (GA) to screen for low energy sequences, with energies being calculated during each round of “evolution” for those sequences being sampled. The conformations of amino acids at variable and floated positions were represented as a set of side chain rotamers derived from a backbone-independent rotamer library using a flexible rotamer model (Mendes et al., 1999\n, Proteins \n37:530-543). Energies were calculated using a force field containing terms describing van der Waals, solvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions. This calculation generated a list of 300 sequences which are predicted to be low in energy. To facilitate analysis of the results and library generation, the 300 output sequences were clustered computationally into 10 groups of similar sequences using a nearest neighbor single linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm to assign sequences to related groups based on similarity scores (Diamond, 1995\n, Acta Cryst\nD51:127-135). That is, all sequences within a group are most similar to all other sequences within the same group and less similar to sequences in other groups. The lowest energy sequence from each of these ten clusters are used as a representative of each group, and are presented as results. This computational screening method is substantially similar to Sequence Prediction Algorithm™ (SPA™) technology, as described in (Raha et al., 2000\n, Protein Sci \n9:1106-1119); U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/877,695; and 10/071,859, and for ease of description, is referred to as SPA™ technology throughout the examples.\n\n\nComputational screening was applied to design energetically favorable interactions at the Fc/Fc□R interface at groups of variable positions that mediate or potentially mediate binding with Fc□R. Because the binding interface involves a large number of Fc residues on the two different chains, and because Fc□Rs bind asymmetrically to Fc, residues were grouped in different sets of interacting variable positions, and designed in separate sets of calculations. In many cases these sets were chosen as groups of residues that were deemed to be coupled, that is the energy of one or more residues is dependent on the identity of one or more other residues. Various template structures were used, and in many cases calculations explored substitutions on both chains. For many of the variable position sets, calculations were carried out using both the PDA® and SPA™ technology computational screening methods described. The results of these calculations and relevant parameters and information are presented in Tables 1-30 below.\n\n\nTables that present the results of these calculations provide for each variable position on the designated chain (column 1) the amino acids considered at each variable position (column 2), the WT Fc amino acid identity at each variable position (column 3), and the amino acid identity at the variable positions for the lowest energy sequence from each cluster group (columns 4-13). Tables 1-59 are broken down into two sets, as labeled below, PDA® and SPA™ technology. \nColumn\n 4 of the PDA® tables show the frequency of each residue that occurs in the top 1000 sequences during that PDA® run. Thus, in the first row of Table 1, at position 328, when run using boundary amino acids as the set of variable residues for that position, L occurred 330 times in the top 1000 sequence, M occurred 302 times, etc.\n\n\nIn addition, included within the compositions of the invention are antibodies that have any of the listed amino acid residues in the listed positions, either alone or in any combination (note preferred combinations are listed in the claims, the summary and the figures). One preferred combination is the listed amino acids residues in the listed positions in a ground state (sometimes referred to herein as the “global solution”, as distinguished from the wild-type). Similarly, residue positions and particular amino acids at those residue positions may be combined between tables.\n\n\nFor SPA™ technology tables, such as Table 4, \ncolumn\n 4 is a SPA™ run that results in a protein with the six listed amino acids at the six listed positions (\ne.g. column\n 4 is a single protein with a wild-type sequence except for 239E, 265G, 267S, 269Y, 270T and 299S. Thus, each of these individual proteins are included within the invention. In addition, combinations between SPA™ proteins, both within tables and between tables, are also included.\n\n\nIn addition, each table shows the presence or absence of carbohydrate, but specifically included are the reverse sequences; e.g. Table 1 is listed for an aglycosylated variant, but these same amino acid changes can be done on a glycosylated variant.\n\n\nFurthermore, each table lists the template structure used, as well as “floated” residues; for example, Table 2 used a PDA® run that floated C120, C132 and C134.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConsidered\n\n\n \n\n\nGround\n\n\nSequences Around\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\n\n\nAmino Acids\n\n\nWT\n\n\nState\n\n\nGround State\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n328 A\n\n\nBoundary\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nL: 330 M: 302 E: 111 K: 62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA: 45 Q: 39 D: 36 S: 30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT: 28 N: 10 R: 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n332 A\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nI\n\n\nR\n\n\nR: 247 K: 209 Q: 130 H: 95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE: 92 T: 59 D: 51 N: 51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nS: 42 A: 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n328 B\n\n\nBoundary\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nL: 321 M: 237 T: 166 K: 73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nR: 72 S: 55 Q: 20 D: 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE: 13 A: 12 V: 10 N: 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n332 B\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nI\n\n\nE\n\n\nE: 269 Q: 180 R: 145 K: 111\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nD: 97 T: 78 N: 65 S: 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA: 14 H: 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDA ® technology, 1IIS template structure;

By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at positions that interact with carbohydrate, variants can be engineered that sample new, potentially favorable carbohydrate conformations. Fc residues F241, F243, V262, and V264 mediate the Fc/carbohydrate interaction and thus are target positions.

Residues P244, P245, P247, and W313, which reside at the Cγ2/Cγ3 interface, appear to play a key role in determining the Cγ2-Cγ3 angle and the flexibility of the domains relative to one another. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at these positions, variants can be designed that sample new, potentially favorable angles and levels of flexibility.

Calculations with Coulomb's law and Debye-Huckel scaling highlighted a number of positions in the Fc for which amino acid substitutions would favorably affect binding to one or more FcγRs, including positions for which replacement of a neutral amino acid with a negatively charged amino acid may enhance binding to FcγRIIIa, and for which replacement of a positively charged amino acid with a neutral or negatively charged amino acid may enhance binding to FcγRIIa.

Design calculations were aimed at designing favorable substitutions in the context of the aglycosylated Fc template structure at residue 297, residues proximal to it, residues at the Fc/FcγR interface, and residues at the Fc/carbohydrate interface. Variable positions were grouped in different sets of interacting variable positions and designed in separate sets of calculations, and various template structures were used. For many of the variable position sets, calculations were carried out using both the PDA® and SPA™ computational screening methods.

The N297 carbohydrate covers up the exposed hydrophobic patch that would normally be the interface for a protein-protein interaction with another Ig domain, maintaining the stability and structural integrity of Fc and keeping the Cγ2 domains from aggregating across the central axis. Key residues for design are F241, F243, V262, and V264, which reside behind the carbohydrate on Cγ2, in addition to residues such as L328, I332, and I336, which are exposed nonpolar residues facing inward towards the opposed Cγ2 domain, that were considered in previously presented calculations. The importance of these Cγ2 residues is supported by noting that the corresponding residues in the Cγ3 domain by sequence alignment either mediate the nonpolar interaction between the two Cγ3 domains or are buried in the Cγ3 core. The results of these design calculations are presented in Table 53.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConsidered\n\n\n \n\n\nGround\n\n\nSequences Around\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\n\n\nAmino Acids\n\n\nWT\n\n\nState\n\n\nGround State\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n241 A\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nF\n\n\nE\n\n\nE: 190 R: 172 K: 138 H: 117\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT: 93 Q: 91 D: 85 S: 49 N: 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA: 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 A\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nF\n\n\nR\n\n\nR: 190 H: 164 Q: 152 E: 149\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK: 92 T: 71 D: 64 N: 58 S: 42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA: 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n262 A\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nV\n\n\nD\n\n\nD: 416 E: 164 N: 138 Q: 87 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT: 83 R: 44 S: 32 K: 24 A: 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nH: 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n264 A\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nV\n\n\nH\n\n\nR: 368 H: 196 K: 147 E: 108\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQ: 68 T: 34 N: 33 D: 25 S: 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA: 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDA ® technology; 1IIS template structure; −carbohydrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a final set of calculations, a SPA™ computational screening method was applied to evaluate the replacement of all chosen variable positions with all 20 amino acids. The lowest energy rotamer conformation for all 20 amino acids was determined, and this energy was defined as the energy of substitution for that amino acid at that variable position. These calculations thus provided an energy of substitution for each of the 20 amino acids at each variable position. These data were useful for a variety of design goals aimed at both glycosylated and aglycosylated Fc, including optimization of Fc/FcγR affinity, Fc stability, Fc solubility, carbohydrate conformation, and hinge conformation. Furthermore, because these calculations provide energies for both favorable and unfavorable substitutions, they guide substitutions that may enable differential binding to activating versus inhibitory FcγRs. Various template structures were used, and calculations explored substitutions on both chains. The results of these calculations and relevant parameters and information are presented in Tables 54-59 below. \nColumn\n 1 lists the variable positions on chain A and B of the 1IIS template structure. \nColumn\n 2 lists the wild-type amino acid identity at each variable position. The remaining 20 columns provide the energy for each of the natural 20 amino acids (shown in the top row). All substitutions were normalized with respect to the lowest energy substitution, which was set to 0 energy. For example in Table 54, for L235 on chain A, serine is the lowest energy substitution, and L235A is 0.9 kcal/mol less stable than L235S. Extremely high energies were set to 20 kcal/mol for energies between 20-50 kcal/mol, and 50 kcal/mold for energies greater than 50 kcal/mol. Favorable substitutions may be considered to be the lowest energy substitution for each position, and substitutions that have small energy differences from the lowest energy substitution, for example substitutions within 1-2, 1-3, 1-5, or 1-10 kcal/mol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

−carbohydrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the design calculations presented above in Tables 1-59 were used to construct a series of Fc variant libraries for experimental production and screening. Experimental libraries were designed in successive rounds of computational and experimental screening. Design of subsequent Fc libraries benefited from feedback from prior libraries, and thus typically comprised combinations of Fc variants that showed favorable properties in the previous screen. The entire set of Fc variants that were constructed and experimentally tested is shown in Table 60. In this table, \nrow\n 1 lists the variable positions, and the rows that follow indicate the amino acids at those variable positions for WT and the Fc variants. For example, \nvariant\n 18 has the following four mutations: F241E, F243Y, V262T, and V264R. The variable position residues that compose this set of Fc variants are illustrated structurally in \nFIG. 3\n, and are presented in the context of the human IgG1 Fc sequence in \nFIG.

experimentation on the Fc variants was carried out in the context of the anti-cancer antibody alemtuzumab (Campath®, a registered trademark of Ilex Pharmaceuticals LP). Alemtuzumab binds a short linear epitope within its target antigen CD52 (Hale et al., 1990\n, Tissue Antigens \n35:118-127; Hale, 1995\n, Immunotechnology \n1: 175-187). Alemtuzumab has been chosen as the primary engineering template because its efficacy is due in part to its ability to recruit effector cells (Dyer et al., 1989\n, Blood \n73:1431-1439; Friend et al., 1991\n, Transplant Proc \n23:2253-2254; Hale et al., 1998\n, Blood \n92:4581-4590; Glennie et al., 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:403-410), and because production and use of its antigen in binding assays are relatively straightforward. In order to evaluate the optimized Fc variants of the present invention in the context of other antibodies, select Fc variants were evaluated in the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan®, a registered trademark of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation), and the anti-Her2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin®, a registered trademark of Genentech). The use of alemtuzumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab for screening purposes is not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular antibody.\n\n\nThe IgG1 full length light (V\nL\n-C\nL\n) and heavy (V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3) chain antibody genes for alemtuzumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab were constructed with convenient end restriction sites to facilitate subcloning. The genes were ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1Zeo (Invitrogen). The V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3 clone in pcDNA3.1zeo was used as a template for mutagenesis of the Fc region. Mutations were introduced into this clone using PCR-based mutagenesis techniques. Fc variants were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the sequence. Plasmids containing heavy chain gene (V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3) (wild-type or variants) were co-transfected with plasmid containing light chain gene (V\nL\n-C\nL\n) into 293T cells. Media were harvested 5 days after transfection. Expression of immunoglobulin was monitored by screening the culture supernatant of transfectomas by western using peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog #109-035-088). \nFIG. 6\n shows expression of wild-type alemtuzumab and \nvariants\n 1 through 10 in 293T cells. Antibodies were purified from the supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography (Pierce, Catalog #20334. \nFIG. 7\n shows results of the protein purification for WT alemtuzumab. Antibody Fc variants showed similar expression and purification results to WT. Some Fc variants were deglycosylated in order to determine their solution and functional properties in the absence of carbohydrate. To obtain deglycosylated antibodies, purified alemtuzumab antibodies were incubated with peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase F) at 37° C. for 24 h. \nFIG. 8\n presents an SDS PAGE gel confirming deglycosylation for several Fc variants and WT alemtuzumab.\n\n\nIn order to confirm the functional fidelity of alemtuzumab produced under these conditions, the antigenic CD52 peptide, fused to GST, was expressed in \nE. coli \nBL21 (DE3) under IPTG induction. Both un-induced and induced samples were run on a SDS PAGE gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane. For western analysis, either alemtuzumab from Sotec (final concentration 2.5 ng/ul) or media of transfected 293T cells (final alemtuzumab concentration about 0.1-0.2 ng/ul) were used as primary antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG was used as secondary antibody. \nFIG. 9\n presents these results. The ability to bind target antigen confirms the structural and functional fidelity of the expressed alemtuzumab. Fc variants that have the same variable region as WT alemtuzumab are anticipated to maintain a comparable binding affinity for antigen.\n\n\nIn order to screen for Fc/FcγR binding, the extracellular regions of human V158 FcγRIIIa, human F158 FcγRIIIa, human FcγRIIb, human FcγRIIa, and mouse FcγRIII, were expressed and purified. \nFIG. 10\n presents an SDS PAGE gel that shows the results of expression and purification of human V158 FcγRIIIa. The extracellular region of this receptor was obtained by PCR from a clone obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC:22630). The receptor was fused with glutathione S-Transferase (GST) to enable screening. Tagged Fc□RIIIa was transfected in 293T cells, and media containing secreted Fc□RIIIa were harvested 3 days later and purified. For western analysis, membrane was probed with anti-GST antibody.\n\n\nBinding affinity to Fc□RIIIa and FcγRIIb was measured for all designed Fc variants using an AlphaScreen™ assay (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay (ALPHA), PerkinElmer, Wellesley, Mass.), a bead-based non-radioactive luminescent proximity assay. Laser excitation of a donor bead excites oxygen, which if sufficiently close to the acceptor bead generates a cascade of chemiluminescent events, ultimately leading to fluorescence emission at 520-620 nm. The AlphaScreen™ assay was applied as a competition assay for screening Fc variants. WT alemtuzumab antibody was biotinylated by standard methods for attachment to streptavidin donor beads, and GST-tagged FcγR was bound to glutathione chelate acceptor beads. In the absence of competing Fc variants, WT antibody and FcγR interact and produce a signal at 520-620 nm. Addition of untagged Fc variant competes with the WT Fc/FcγR interaction, reducing fluorescence quantitatively to enable determination of relative binding affinities. All Fc variants were screened for V158 FcγRIIIa binding using the AlphaScreen™ assay. Select Fc variants were subsequently screened for binding to FcγRIIb, as well as other FcγRs and Fc ligands.\n\n\n \nFIG. 11\n shows AlphaScreen™ data for binding to human V158 FcγRIIIa by select Fc variants. The binding data were normalized to the maximum and minimum luminescence signal provided by the baselines at low and high concentrations of competitor antibody respectively. The data were fit to a one site competition model using nonlinear regression, and these fits are represented by the curves in the figure. These fits provide the \ninhibitory concentration\n 50% (IC50) (i.e. the concentration required for 50% inhibition) for each antibody, illustrated by the dotted lines in \nFIG. 11\n, thus enabling the relative binding affinities of Fc variants to be quantitatively determined. Here, WT alemtuzumab has an IC50 of (4.63×10\n−9\n)×(2)=9.2 nM, whereas S239D has an IC50 of (3.98×10\n110\n)×(2)=0.8 nM. Thus S239D alemtuzumab binds 9.2 nM/0.8 nM=11.64-fold more tightly than WT alemtuzumab to human V158 FcγRIIIa. Similar calculations were performed for the binding of all Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa. Select Fc variants were also screened for binding to human Fc□RIIb, and examples of these AlphaScreen™ binding data are shown in \nFIG. 12\n. Table 61 presents the fold-enhancement or fold-reduction relative to the parent antibody for binding of Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa (column 3) and human FcγRIIb (column 4), as determined by the AlphaScreen™ assay. For these data, a fold above 1 indicates an enhancement in binding affinity, and a fold below 1 indicates a reduction in binding affinity relative to WT Fc. All data were obtained in the context of alemtuzumab, except for those indicated with an asterix (*), which were tested in the context of trastuzumab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE

optimized properties were obtained from the FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIb screen. Table 61 provides Fc variants that bind more tightly to FcγRIIIa, and thus are candidates for improving the effector function of antibodies and Fc fusions. These include a number of variants that comprise substitutions at 239, 264, 330, and 332. \nFIG. 13\n shows AlphaScreen™ binding data for some of these Fc variants. The majority of these Fc variants provide substantially greater FcγRIIIa binding enhancements over S298A/E333A/K334A.\n\n\nAlthough the majority of Fc variants were screened in the context of the antibody alemtuzumab, select Fc variants were also screened in the context of rituximab and trastuzumab. AlphaScreen™ data for binding of select Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa in the context of rituximab and trastuzumab are shown in \nFIGS. 14 and 15\n respectively. The results indicate that the Fc variants display consistent binding enhancements regardless of the antibody context, and thus the Fc variants of the present invention are broadly applicable to antibodies and Fc fusions.\n\n\nFc variants have been obtained that show differentially enhanced binding to FcγRIIIa over FcγRIIb. As discussed, optimal effector function may result from Fc variants wherein affinity for activating FcγRs is greater than affinity for the inhibitory FcγRIIb. AlphaScreen™ data directly comparing binding to FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIb for two Fc variants with this specificity profile are shown in \nFIGS. 16\n \na \nand \n16\n \nb\n. This concept can be defined quantitatively as the fold-enhancement or -reduction of the activating FγR (Table 61, column 3) divided by the fold-enhancement or -reduction of the inhibitory FcγR (Table 61, column 4), herein referred to as the FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratio. This value provided in \nColumn\n 5 in Table 61. Table 61 shows that Fc variants provide this specificity profile, with a FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratio as high as 86:1.\n\n\nSome of the most promising Fc variants of the present invention for enhancing effector function have both substantial increases in affinity for FcγRIIIa and favorable FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratios. These include, for example, S239D/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold=56, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold=3), S239D/A330Y/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold=130), S239D/A330L/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold=139, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold=18), and S239D/S298A/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold=295, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold=48). \nFIG. 17\n shows AlphaScreen™ binding data for these and other Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa.\n\n\nBecause there are a number of FcγRs that contribute to effector function, it may be worthwhile to additionally screen Fc variants against other receptors. \nFIG. 18\n shows AlphaScreen™ data for binding of select Fc variants to human R131 FcγRIIa. As can be seen, those aforementioned variants with favorable binding enhancements and specificity profiles also show enhanced binding to this activating receptor. The use of FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIb, and FcγRIIc for screening is not meant to constrain experimental testing to these particular FcγRs; other FcγRs are contemplated for screening, including but not limited to the myriad isoforms and allotypes of FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII from humans, mice, rats, monkeys, and the like, as previously described.\n\n\nTaken together, the FcγR binding data provided in \nFIGS. 11-18\n and Table 61 indicate that a number of substitutions at \n \npositions\n \n 234, 235, 239, 240, 243, 264, 266, 325, 328, 330, and 332 are promising candidates for improving the effector function of antibodies and Fc fusions. Because combinations of some of these substitutions have typically resulted in additive or synergistic binding improvements, it is anticipated that as yet unexplored combinations of the Fc variants provided in Table 61 will also provide favorable results. Thus all combinations of the Fc variants in Table 61 are contemplated. Likewise, combinations of any of the Fc variants in Table 61 with other discovered or undiscovered Fc variants may also provide favorable properties, and these combinations are also contemplated. Furthermore, it is anticipated from these results that other substitutions at \n \npositions\n \n 234, 235, 239, 240, 243, 264, 266, 325, 328, 330, and 332 may also provide favorable binding enhancements and specificities, and thus substitutions at these positions other than those presented in Table 61 are contemplated.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nReduced Binding to FcγRs\n\n\nAs discussed, although there is a need for greater effector function, for some antibody therapeutics, reduced or eliminated effector function may be desired. Several Fc variants in Table 61 substantially reduce or ablate FcγR binding, and thus may find use in antibodies and Fc fusions wherein effector function is undesirable. AlphaScreen™ binding data for some examples of such variants are shown in \nFIGS. 19\n \na \nand \n19\n \nb\n. These Fc variants, as well as their use in combination, may find use for eliminating effector function when desired, for example in antibodies and Fc fusions whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism but not killing of the cells bearing target antigen.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nAglycosylated Fc Variants\n\n\nAs discussed, one goal of the current experiments was to obtain optimized aglycosylated Fc variants. Several Fc variants provide significant progress towards this goal. Because it is the site of glycosylation, substitution at N297 results in an aglycosylated Fc. Whereas all other Fc variants that comprise a substitution at N297 completely ablate FcγR binding, N297D/I332E has significant binding affinity for FcγRIIa, shown in Table 61 and illustrated in \nFIG. 20\n. The exact reason for this result is uncertain in the absence of a high-resolution structure for this variant, although the computational screening predictions suggest that it is potentially due to a combination of new favorable Fc/FcγR interactions and favorable electrostatic properties. Indeed other electrostatic substitutions are envisioned for further optimization of aglycosylated Fc. Table 61 shows that other aglycosylated Fc variants such as S239D/N297D/I332E and N297D/A330Y/I332E provide binding enhancements that bring affinity for FcγRIIIa within 0.28- and 0.43-fold respectively of glycosylated WT alemtuzumab. Combinations of these variants with other Fc variants that enhance FcγR binding are contemplated, with the goal of obtaining aglycosylated Fc variants that bind one or more FcγRs with affinity that is approximately the same as or even better than glycosylated parent Fc. An additional set of promising Fc variants provide stability and solubility enhancements in the absence of carbohydrate. Fc variants that comprise substitutions at positions 241, 243, 262, and 264, positions that do not mediate FγR binding but do determine the interface between the carbohydrate and Fc, ablate FγR binding, presumably because they perturb the conformation of the carbohydrate. In deglycosylated form, however, Fc variants F241E/F243R/V262E/V264R, F241E/F243Q/V262T/V264E, F241R/F243Q/V262T/V264R, and F241E/F243Y/V262T/V264R show stronger binding to FcγRIIIa than in glycosylated form, as shown by the AlphaScreen™ data in \nFIG. 21\n. This result indicates that these are key positions for optimization of the structure, stability, solubility, and function of aglycosylated Fc. Together these results suggests that protein engineering can be used to restore the favorable functional and solution properties of antibodies and Fc fusions in the absence of carbohydrate, and pave the way for aglycosylated antibodies and Fc fusions with favorable solution properties and full functionality that comprise substitutions at these and other Fc positions.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nAffinity of Fc Variants for Polymorphic Forms of FcγRIIIa\n\n\nAs discussed above, an important parameter of Fc-mediated effector function is the affinity of Fc for both V158 and F158 polymorphic forms of FcγRIIIa. AlphaScreen™ data comparing binding of select variants to the two receptor allotypes are shown in \nFIG. 22\n \na \n(V158 FcγRIIIa) and \nFIG. 22\n \nb \n(F158 FcγRIIIa). As can be seen, all variants improve binding to both FcγRIIIa allotypes. These data indicate that those Fc variants of the present invention with enhanced effector function will be broadly applicable to the entire patient population, and that enhancement to clinical efficacy will potentially be greatest for the low responsive patient population who need it most.\n\n\nThe FcγR binding affinities of these Fc variants were further investigated using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). SPR is a sensitive and extremely quantitative method that allows for the measurement of binding affinities of protein-protein interactions, and has been used to effectively measure Fc/FcγR binding (Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16478-16483). SPR thus provides an excellent complementary binding assay to the AlphaScreen™ assay. His-tagged V158 FcγRIIIa was immobilized to an SPR chip, and WT and Fc variant alemtuzumab antibodies were flowed over the chip at a range of concentrations. Binding constants were obtained from fitting the data using standard curve-fitting methods. Table 62 presents dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of select Fc variants to V158 FcγRIIIa and F158 FcγRIIIa obtained using SPR, and compares these with IC50s obtained from the AlphaScreen™ assay. By dividing the Kd and IC50 for each variant by that of WT alemtuzumab, the fold-improvements over WT (Fold) are obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSPR\n\n\nSPR\n\n\nAlphaScreen ™\n\n\nAlphaScreen ™\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV158 FcγRIIIa\n\n\nF158 FcγRIIIa\n\n\nV158 FcγRIIIa\n\n\nF158 FcγRIIIa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKd (nM)\n\n\nFold\n\n\nKd (nM)\n\n\nFold\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nFold\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nFold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT\n\n\n68\n\n\n \n\n\n730\n\n\n \n\n\n6.4\n\n\n \n\n\n17.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV264I\n\n\n64\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n550\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n11.5\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI332E\n\n\n31\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n72\n\n\n10.1\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n6.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV264I/\nI332E\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n52\n\n\n14.0\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n12.8\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n15.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS298A\n\n\n52\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n285\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n12.0\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS298A/E333A/\n\n\n39\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n156\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK334A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SPR data corroborate the improvements to FcγRIIIa affinity observed by AlphaScreen™ assay. Table 62 further indicates the superiority of V264I/I332E and I332E over S298A and S298A/E333A/K334A; whereas S298A/E333A/K334A improves Fc binding to V158 and F158 FcγRIIIa by 1.7-fold and 4.7-fold respectively, I332E shows binding enhancements of 2.2-fold and 10.1-fold respectively, and V264I/I332E shows binding enhancements of 4.0-fold and 14-fold respectively. Also worth noting is that the affinity of V264I/I332E for F158 FcγRIIIa (52 nM) is better than that of WT for the V158 allotype (68 nM), suggesting that this Fc variant, as well as those with even greater improvements in binding, may enable the clinical efficacy of antibodies for the low responsive patient population to achieve that currently possible for high responders.

The good fits of these data to straight lines (r\n2\n=0.9, r\n2\n=0.84, r\n2\n=0.98, and r\n2\n=0.90) support the accuracy the AlphaScreen™ measurements, and validate its use for determining the relative Fc□R binding affinities of Fc variants.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nADCC of Fc Variants\n\n\nIn order to determine the effect on effector function, cell-based ADCC assays were performed on select Fc variants. ADCC was measured using the DELFIA® EuTDA-based cytotoxicity assay (Perkin Elmer, MA) with purified human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) as effector cells. Target cells were loaded with BATDA at 1×10\n6 \ncells/ml, washed 4 times and seeded into 96-well plate at 10,000 cells/well. The target cells were then opsonized using Fc variant or WT antibodies at the indicated final concentration. Human PBMCs were added at the indicated fold-excess of target cells and the plate was incubated at 37° C. for 4 hrs. The co-cultured cells were centrifuged at 500×g, supernatants were transferred to a separate plate and incubated with Eu solution, and relative fluorescence units were measured using a Packard Fusion™ reader (Packard Biosciences, IL). Samples were run in triplicate to provide error estimates (n=3, +/−S.D.). PBMCs were allotyped for the V158 or F158 FcγRIIIa allotype using PCR.\n\n\nADCC assays were run on Fc variant and WT alemtuzumab using DoHH-2 lymphoma target cells. \nFIG. 24\n \na \nis a bar graph showing the ADCC of these proteins at 10 ng/ml antibody. Results show that alemtuzumab Fc variants I332E, V264I, and I332E/V264I have substantially enhanced ADCC compared to WT alemtuzumab, with the relative ADCC enhancements proportional to their binding improvements to FcγRIIIa as indicated by AlphaScreen™ assay and SPR. The dose dependence of ADCC on antibody concentration is shown in \nFIG. 24\n \nb\n. These data were normalized to the minimum and maximum fluorescence signal provided by the baselines at low and high concentrations of antibody respectively. The data were fit to a sigmoidal dose-response model using nonlinear regression, represented by the curve in the figure. The fits enable determination of the \neffective concentration\n 50% (EC50) (i.e. the concentration required for 50% effectiveness), which provides the relative enhancements to ADCC for each Fc variant. The EC50s for these binding data are analogous to the IC50s obtained from the AlphaScreen™ competition data, and derivation of these values is thus analogous to that described in Example 2 and \nFIG. 11\n. In \nFIG. 24\n \nb\n, the log(EC50)s, obtained from the fits to the data, for WT, V264I/I332E, and S239D/I332E alemtuzumab are 0.99, 0.60, and 0.49 respectively, and therefore their respective EC50s are 9.9, 4.0, and 3.0. Thus V264I/I332E and S239E/I332E provide a 2.5-fold and 3.3-fold enhancement respectively in ADCC over WT alemtuzumab using PBMCs expressing heterozygous V158/F158 FcγRIIIa.

The greater improvements observed for rituximab versus alemtuzumab are likely due to the use of homozygous F158/F158 FcγRIIIa rather than heterozygous V158/F158 FcγRIIIa PBMCs, as well as potentially the use of different antibodies and target cell lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFold Improvement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlog(EC50)\n\n\nEC50 (ng/ml)\n\n\nOver WT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nS298A/E333A/K334A\n\n\n−0.44\n\n\n0.37\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV264I/I332E\n\n\n−0.83\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n11.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADCC assays were run on Fc variant and WT trastuzumab using two breast carcinoma target cell lines BT474 and Sk-Br-3. \nFIG. 26\n \na \nshows a bar graph illustrating ADCC at 1 ng/ml antibody.

The AlphaScreen™ assay was used to measure binding of select Fc variants to the complement protein C1q. The assay was carried out with biotinylated WT alemtuzumab antibody attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and using C1q coupled directly to acceptor beads. Binding data of select Fc variants shown in \nFIG. 27\n \na \nindicate that C1q binding is uncompromised. Cell-based CDC assays were also performed on select Fc variants to investigate whether Fc variants maintain the capacity to activate complement. Amar Blue was used to monitor lysis of Fc variant and WT rituximab-opsonized WIL2-S lymphoma cells by human serum complement (Quidel, San Diego, Calif.). The results shown in \nFIG. 27\n \nb \nfor select Fc variants indicate that CDC is uncompromised.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nProtein A Binding by Fc Variants\n\n\nAs discussed, bacterial protein A binds to the Fc region between the C□2 and C□3 domains, and is frequently employed for antibody purification. The AlphaScreen™ assay was used to measure binding of select Fc variants to the protein A using biotinylated WT alemtuzumab antibody attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and using protein A coupled directly to acceptor beads. The binding data shown in \nFIG. 28\n for select Fc variants indicate that the capacity of the Fc variants to bind protein A is uncompromised. These results suggest that affinity of the Fc variants for other Fc ligands that bind the same site on Fc as protein A, such as the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn and protein G, are also unaffected.\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nCapacity of Fc Variants to Bind Mouse Fc□Rs\n\n\nOptimization of Fc to nonhuman Fc□Rs may be useful for experimentally testing Fc variants in animal models. For example, when tested in mice (for example nude mice, SCID mice, xenograft mice, and/or transgenic mice), antibodies and Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that are optimized for one or more mouse Fc□Rs may provide valuable information with regard to efficacy, mechanism of action, and the like. In order to evaluate whether the Fc variants of the present invention may be useful in such experiments, affinity of select Fc variants for mouse FcγRIII was measured using the AlphaScreen™ assay. The AlphaScreen™ assay was carried out using biotinylated WT alemtuzumab attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and GST-tagged mouse FcγRIII bound to glutathione chelate acceptor beads, expressed and purified as described in Example 2. These binding data are shown in \nFIG. 29\n. Results show that some Fc variants that enhance binding to human FcγRIIIa also enhance binding to mouse FcγRIII. This result indicates that the Fc variants of the present invention, or other Fc variants that are optimized for nonhuman FcγRs, may find use in experiments that use animal models.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\nValidation of Fc Variants Expressed in CHO Cells\n\n\nWhereas the Fc variants of the present invention were expressed in 293T cells for screening purposes, large scale production of antibodies is typically carried out by expression in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. In order to evaluate the properties of CHO-expressed Fc variants, select Fc variants and WT alemtuzumab were expressed in CHO cells and purified as described in Example 2. \nFIG. 30\n shows AlphaScreen™ data comparing binding of CHO- and 293T-expressed Fc variant and WT alemtuzumab to human V158 FcγRIIIa. The results indicate that the Fc variants of the present invention show comparable FcγR binding enhancements whether expressed in 293T or CHO.\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nTherapeutic Application of Fc Variants\n\n\nA number of Fc variants described in the present invention have significant potential for improving the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer antibodies. For illustration purposes, a number of Fc variants of the present invention have been incorporated into the sequence of the antibody rituximab. The WT rituximab light chain and heavy chain, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,137, are provided in \nFIGS. 31\n \na \nand \n32\n \nb\n. The improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences are provided in \nFIG. 31\n \nc\n. The improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences comprise at least non-WT amino acid selected from the group consisting of X\n1\n, X\n2\n, X\n3\n, X\n4\n, X\n5\n, and X\n6\n. These improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences may also comprise a substitution Z\n1\n. The use of rituximab here is solely an example, and is not meant to constrain application of the Fc variants to this antibody or any other particular antibody or Fc fusion.\n\n\nAll references are herein expressly incorporated by reference.\n\n\nWhereas particular embodiments of the invention have been described above for purposes of illustration, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that numerous variations of the details may be made without departing from the invention as described in the appended claims."

More particularly, the invention pertains to compositions and methods for modulating vacscular formation and maintenance mediated by neuropilin-1 (NRP1) receptor. This invention further relates to methods for the screening of substances therapeutically useful for preventing or treating conditions and diseases associated with angiogenesis.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nDevelopment of a vascular system is a fundamental requirement for many physiological and pathological processes. Actively growing tissues such as embryos and tumors require adequate blood supply. They satisfy this need by producing pro-angiogenic factors, which promote new blood vessel formation and maintenance via a process generally referred to as angiogenesis. Vascular formation is a complex but orderly biological event involving all or many of the following steps: a) Endothelial cells (ECs) proliferate from existing ECs or differentiate from progenitor cells; b) ECs migrate and coalesce to form cord-like structures; c) vascular cords then undergo tubulogenesis to form vessels with a central lumen d) existing cords or vessels send out sprouts to form secondary vessels; e) primitive vascular plexus undergo further remodeling and reshaping; and f) peri-endothelial cells are recruited to encase the endothelial tubes, providing maintenance and modulatory functions to the vessels; such cells including pericytes for small capillaries, smooth muscle cells for larger vessels, and myocardial cells in the heart. Hanahan, D. \nScience \n277:48-50 (1997); Hogan, B. L. & Kolodziej, P. A. \nNature Reviews Genetics. \n3:513-23 (2002); Lubarsky, B. & Krasnow, M. A. \nCell. \n112:19-28 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is now well established that angiogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders. These include solid tumors and metastasis, atherosclerosis, retrolental fibroplasia, hemangiomas, chronic inflammation, intraocular neovascular diseases such as proliferative retinopathies, e.g., diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), neovascular glaucoma, immune rejection of transplanted corneal tissue and other tissues, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. Folkman et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267:10931-10934 (1992); Klagsbrun et al., Annu. Rev. Physiol. 53:217-239 (1991); and Garner A., “Vascular diseases”, In: Pathobiology of Ocular Disease. A Dynamic Approach, Garner A., Klintworth G K, eds., 2nd Edition (Marcel Dekker, NY, 1994), pp 1625-1710.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of tumor growth, angiogenesis appears to be crucial for the transition from hyperplasia to neoplasia, and for providing nourishment for the growth and metastasis of the tumor. Folkman et al., \nNature \n339:58 (1989). The neovascularization allows the tumor cells to acquire a growth advantage and proliferative autonomy compared to the normal cells. A tumor usually begins as a single aberrant cell which can proliferate only to a size of a few cubic millimeters due to the distance from available capillary beds, and it can stay ‘dormant’ without further growth and dissemination for a long period of time. Some tumor cells then switch to the angiogenic phenotype to activate endothelial cells, which proliferate and mature into new capillary blood vessels. These newly formed blood vessels not only allow for continued growth of the primary tumor, but also for the dissemination and recolonization of metastatic tumor cells. Accordingly, a correlation has been observed between density of microvessels in tumor sections and patient survival in breast cancer as well as in several other tumors. Weidner et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med \n324:1-6 (1991); Horak et al., \nLancet \n340:1120-1124 (1992); Macchiarini et al., \nLancet \n340:145-146 (1992). The precise mechanisms that control the angiogenic switch is not well understood, but it is believed that neovascularization of tumor mass results from the net balance of a multitude of angiogenesis stimulators and inhibitors (Folkman, 1995, \nNat Med \n1(1):27-31).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe process of vascular development is tightly regulated. To date, a significant number of molecules, mostly secreted factors produced by surrounding cells, have been shown to regulate EC differentiation, proliferation, migration and coalescence into cord-like structures. For example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as the key factor involved in stimulating angiogenesis and in inducing vascular permeability. Ferrara et al., \nEndocr. Rev. \n18:4-25 (1997). The finding that the loss of even a single VEGF allele results in embryonic lethality points to an irreplaceable role played by this factor in the development and differentiation of the vascular system. Furthermore, VEGF has been shown to be a key mediator of neovascularization associated with tumors and intraocular disorders. Ferrara et al., \nEndocr. Rev. \nsupra. The VEGF mRNA is overexpressed by the majority of human tumors examined. Berkman et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n91:153-159 (1993); Brown et al., \nHuman Pathol. \n26:86-91 (1995); Brown et al., \nCancer Res. \n53:4727-4735 (1993); Mattern et al., \nBrit. J. Cancer \n73:931-934 (1996); Dvorak et al., \nAm. J. Pathol. \n146:1029-1039 (1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the concentration levels of VEGF in eye fluids are highly correlated to the presence of active proliferation of blood vessels in patients with diabetic and other ischemia-related retinopathies. Aiello et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n331:1480-1487 (1994). Furthermore, studies have demonstrated the localization of VEGF in choroidal neovascular membranes in patients affected by AMD. Lopez et al., \nInvest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. \n37:855-868 (1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies suppress the growth of a variety of human tumor cell lines in nude mice (Kim et al., \nNature \n362:841-844 (1993); Warren et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n95:1789-1797 (1995); Borgstrom et al., \nCancer Res. \n56:4032-4039 (1996); Melnyk et al., \nCancer Res. \n56:921-924 (1996)) and also inhibit intraocular angiogenesis in models of ischemic retinal disorders. Adamis et al., \nArch. Ophthalmol. \n114:66-71 (1996). Therefore, anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies or other inhibitors of VEGF action are promising candidates for the treatment of tumors and various intraocular neovascular disorders. Such antibodies are described, for example, in EP 817,648 published Jan. 14, 1998; and in WO98/45331 and WO98/45332, both published Oct. 15, 1998. One of the anti-VEGF antibodies, bevacizumab, has been approved by the FDA for use in combination with a chemotherapy regimen to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-samll cell lung cancer (NSCLC). And bevacizumab is being investigated in many ongoing clinical trials for treating various cancer indications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring development of the nervous system, neurons send out cable-like axons that migrate over long distances in order to reach their targets. See review by Carmeliet and Tessier-Lavigne (2005) \nNature \n436:193-200. At the leading tip of a growing axon is a highly motile, sensory structure called growth cone. Through dynamic cycles of extension and retraction of filopodial extensions, the growth cone continually senses and asseses from a myriad of guidance cues in its spatial environment, and accurately selects a correct track for extension towards its final target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOver the past decade, considerable progress has been made in understanding axon guidance mechanisms. See review by Dickson (2002) \nScience \n298:1959-64. Guidance cues come in four varieties: attractants and repellents; which may act either at short range (i.e., cell- or matrix-associated) or at longer range (i.e., diffusible). So far, four major families of axon guidance molecules have been identified: the netrins, semaphorins, ephrins and slits. See review by Huber et al (2003) \nAnnu Rev Neurosci \n26:509-63.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe semaphorins (Sema), also called collapsins, belong to a large family of phylogenetically conserved secreted and membrane-associated proteins. Members of the semaphorin family are capable of mediating both repulsive and attractive axon guidance events during neural development. Raper (2000) \nCurr Opin Neurobiol \n10:88-94. The more than thirty semaphorins identified to date all share a conserved N-terminal Sema domain of about 500 amino acids. Semaphorin members are classified into eight subfamilies depending on their structural similarities and species of origin. For more details on unified nomenclature for semaphorins, see Semaphorin Nomenclature Committee (1999) \nCell \n97:551-552.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe neuropilin (NRP) family is comprised of two homologous proteins, neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and neuropilin-2 (NRP2). NRP1 was first identified as a type I 130-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in growth cones of growing axons. NRP2 was subsequently identified by expression cloning. Fujisawa and Kitsukawa (1998) \nCurr Opin Neurobiol \n8:587-592. NRPs are found to be receptors for a subset of semaphorins, the \nclass\n 3 semaphorins. It was suggested that NRPs function as non-signaling co-receptors along with another semaphorin receptor family, plexins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough initially described as a mediator of axon guidance, NRPs have also been found to play critical roles in vascular development. Carmeliet and Tessier-Lavigne (2005). It is identified as an isoform-specific VEGF receptor expressed on tumor and endothelial cells, prompting considerable efforts to understand the role of NRPs in vascular and tumor biology. Soker et al (1998) \nCell \n92:735-745; Klagsbrun et al (2002) \nAdv Exp Med Biol \n515:33-48. Genetic studies have provided strong evidence that Nrp1 is required for vascular morphogenesis. Loss of Nrp1 function results in vascular remodeling and branching defects, a phenotype that can be further enhanced by the loss of Nrp2 function. Kawasaki et al. (1999) \nDevelopment \n126:4895-4902; Takashima et al. (2002) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n99:3657-3662. These results suggest that early in development Nrp1 and Nrp2 may have overlapping functions. However, the expression of each Nrp is partitioned later in development, with Nrp1 being expressed primarily in arteries, and Nrp2 in veins and lymphatic vessels. Yuan et al (2002) \nDevelopment \n129:4797-4806; Herzog et al. (2001) \nMech Dev \n109:115-119. Notably, loss of Nrp2 function alone specifically impairs lymphatic development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs Nrp1 is expressed in many other cell types during development, the role of vascular Nrp1 was addressed through the generation of an EC-specific knock-out, which resulted in similar vascular defects to those seen in the null allele. Gu et al. (2003) \nDev Cell \n5:45-57. Interestingly, this study also showed that Sema3A binding to NRP1 is not required for vascular development. In another study, defects were observed in the guidance of endothelial tip cells in the developing hindbrain in Nrp1 KO embryos. Gerhardt et al. (2004) \nDev Dyn \n231:503-509.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite the extensive studies in NRP1′s role in vascular development, it remains unclear as to whether NRP1 exerts its vascular function exclusively via the VEGF-VEGF Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) pathway, as an enhancer for VEGF binding to VEGFR2 and thereby for VEGFR2 signaling, or via a signaling pathway independent of VEGFR2, or a combination of both.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies can be manufactured using recombinant DNA technology. Widespread use has been made of monoclonal antibodies, particularly those derived from rodents, however nonhuman antibodies are frequently antigenic in humans. The art has attempted to overcome this problem by constructing “chimeric” antibodies in which a nonhuman antigen-binding domain is coupled to a human constant domain (Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The isotype of the human constant domain may be selected to tailor the chimeric antibody for participation in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. In a further effort to resolve the antigen binding functions of antibodies and to minimize the use of heterologous sequences in human antibodies, humanized antibodies have been generated for various antigens in which substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted at regions by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. For example, rodent residues have been substituted for the corresponding segments of a human antibody. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some complementarity determining region (CDR) residues and possibly some framework region (FR) residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. Jones et al. (1986) \nNature \n321:522-525; Riechmann et al. (1988) \nNature \n332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al. (1988) \nScience \n239:1534-1536.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to administering a therapeutic antibody to human, preclinical studies in nonhuman mammals are generally desired to evaluate the efficacy and/or toxicity of the antibody. Ideally, the antibodies subject to these studies are capable of recognizing and reacting with high potency to a target antigen endogenous to the host animal such as mouse or nonhuman primate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display technology has provided a powerful tool for generating and selecting novel proteins that bind to a ligand, such as an antigen. Using the technique of phage display, large libraries of protein variants can be generated and rapidly sorted for those sequences that bind to a target antigen with high affinity. Nucleic acids encoding variant polypeptides are fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a viral coat protein, such as the gene III protein or the gene VIII protein. Monovalent phage display systems where the nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein or polypeptide is fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a portion of the gene III protein have been developed. (Bass, S. (1990) \nProteins \n8:309; Lowman and Wells (1991) \nMethods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology \n3:205). In a monovalent phage display system, the gene fusion is expressed at low levels and wild type gene III proteins are also expressed so that infectivity of the particles is retained. Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening those libraries have been disclosed in many patents (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,286, U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,018, U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,717, U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,908 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,530).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe demonstration of expression of peptides on the surface of filamentous phage and the expression of functional antibody fragments in the periplasm of \nE. coli \nwas important in the development of antibody phage display libraries. (Smith et al. (1985) \nScience \n228:1315; Skerra and Pluckthun (1988) \nScience \n240:1038). Libraries of antibodies or antigen binding polypeptides have been prepared in a number of ways including by altering a single gene by inserting random DNA sequences or by cloning a family of related genes. Methods for displaying antibodies or antigen binding fragments using phage display have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,750,373, 5,733,743, 5,837,242, 5,969,108, 6,172,197, 5,580,717, and 5,658,727. The library is then screened for expression of antibodies or antigen binding proteins with desired characteristics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display technology has several advantages over conventional hybridoma and recombinant methods for preparing antibodies with the desired characteristics. This technology allows the development of large libraries of antibodies with diverse sequences in less time and without the use of animals. Preparation of hybridomas or preparation of humanized antibodies can easily require several months of preparation. In addition, since no immunization is required, phage antibody libraries can be generated for antigens which are toxic or have low antigenicity (Hogenboom (1988) \nImmunotechniques \n4:1-20). Phage antibody libraries can also be used to generate and identify novel therapeutic antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display libraries have been used to generate human antibodies from immunized, non-immunized humans, germ line sequences, or naïve B cell Ig repertories (Barbas & Burton(1996) \nTrends Biotech \n14:230; Griffiths et al. (1994) \nEMBO J. \n13:3245; Vaughan et al. (1996) \nNat. Biotech. \n14:309; Winter EP 0368 684 B1). Naïve, or nonimmune, antigen binding libraries have been generated using a variety of lymphoidal tissues. Some of these libraries are commercially available, such as those developed by Cambridge Antibody Technology and Morphosys (Vaughan et al.(1996) \nNature Biotech \n14:309; Knappik et al. (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n296:57). However, many of these libraries have limited diversity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability to identify and isolate high affinity antibodies from a phage display library is important in isolating novel antibodies for therapeutic use. Isolation of high affinity antibodies from a library is dependent on the size of the library, the efficiency of production in bacterial cells and the diversity of the library. See, for e.g., Knappik et al. (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n296:57. The size of the library is decreased by inefficiency of production due to improper folding of the antibody or antigen binding protein and the presence of stop codons. Expression in bacterial cells can be inhibited if the antibody or antigen binding domain is not properly folded. Expression can be improved by mutating residues in turns at the surface of the variable/constant interface, or at selected CDR residues. (Deng et al. (1994) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n269:9533, Ulrich et al. (1995) \nPNAS, \n92:11907-11911; Forsberg et al. (1997) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n272:12430). The sequence of the framework region is a factor in providing for proper folding when antibody phage libraries are produced in bacterial cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerating a diverse library of antibodies or antigen binding proteins is also important to isolation of high affinity antibodies. Libraries with diversification in limited CDRs have been generated using a variety of approaches. See, e.g., Tomlinson (2000) \nNature Biotech. \n18:989-994. CDR3 regions are of interest in part because they often are found to participate in antigen binding CDR3 regions on the heavy chain vary greatly in size, sequence and structural conformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOthers have also generated diversity by randomizing CDR regions of the variable heavy and light chains using all 20 amino acids at each position. It was thought that using all 20 amino acids would result in a large diversity of sequences of variant antibodies and increase the chance of identifying novel antibodies. (Barbas (1994) \nPNAS \n91:3809; Yelton, D E (1995) \nJ. Immunology \n155:1994; Jackson, J. R. (1995) \nJ. Immunology \n154:3310 and Hawkins, R E (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biology \n226:889).\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel anti-NRP1 antibodies capable of modulating at least one neuropilin mediated biological activity. Preferably, the anti-NRP1 antibodies are antagonist antibodies capable of inhibiting at least one neuropilin mediated biological activity. More specifically, the present invention provides methods of generating anti-NRP1 antibodies from a designed human synthetic antibody phage library, and novel function blocking anti-NRP1 antibodies generated thereof The anti-NRP1 antibodies of the invention fall into two classes, depending on where they bind to on NRP1: anti-NRP1\nA \nantibodies (including YW64.3 and variants thereof) are those that bind to the CUB domains (a1a2) of NRP1; and anti-NRP1\nB \nantibodies (including YW107.4 and variants thereof) are those that bind to the coagulation factor V/VIII domains (b1b2) of NRP1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the anti-NRP1\nA \nantibodies of the invention can be selected from the “YW64” antibody clones as shown in Table III, having the identified partial CDR sequences and binding affinities to murine and human NRP1s. The anti-NRP1\nA \nantibody of the invention preferably comprises a light chain variable domain comprising the following CDR amino acid sequences: CDRL1 (RASQSISSYLA; SEQ ID NO:123), CDRL2 (GASSRAS; SEQ ID NO:124) and CDRL3 (QQYMSVPIT; SEQ ID NO:125). For example, the anti-NRP1\nA \nantibody comprises a light chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:3. The anti-NRP1\nA \nantibody of the invention preferably comprises a heavy chain variable domain comprising the following CDR amino acid sequences: CDRH1 (GFSFSSEPIS; SEQ ID NO:126), CDRH2 (SSITGKNGYTYYADSVKG; SEQ ID NO:127) and CDRH3 (WGKKVYGMDV; SEQ ID NO:128). For example, the anti-NRP1\nA \nantibody comprises a heavy chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:4. More preferably, the anti-NRP1\nA \nantibody of the invention is the YW64.3 antibody comprising a light chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:3 and a heavy chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the anti-NRP1\nB \nantibodies of the invention can be selected from the “YW107.4” antibody clones as shown in Table IV, having the identified partial CDR sequences and binding affinities to murine and human NRP1s. The anti-NRP1\nB \nantibody of the invention preferably comprises a light chain variable domain comprising the following CDR amino acid sequences: CDRL1 (RASQYFSSYLA; SEQ ID NO:129), CDRL2 (GASSRAS; SEQ ID NO:130) and CDRL3 (QQYLGSPPT; SEQ ID NO:131). For example, the anti-NRP1\nB \nantibody comprises a light chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:5. The anti-NRP1\nB \nantibody of the invention preferably comprises a heavy chain variable domain comprising the following CDR amino acid sequences: CDRH1 (GFTFSSYAMS; SEQ ID NO:132), CDRH2 (SQISPAGGYTNYADSVKG; SEQ ID NO:133) and CDRH3 (ELPYYRMSKVMDV; SEQ ID NO:134). For example, the anti-NRP1\nB \nantibody comprises a heavy chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:6. More preferably, the anti-NRP1\nB \nantibody of the invention is the YW107.4.87 antibody comprising a light chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 and a heavy chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided by the present invention are uses of the anti-NRP1 antibodies for treating angiogenesis associated disorders such as cancer. In one preferred embodiment, the anti-NRP1 antibodies of invention are used in combination with an anti-VEGF antibody. Preferably, the anti-VEGF antibody is capable of binding to the same VEGF epitope as the antibody A4.6.1. More preferably, the anti-VEGF antibody is bevacizumab or ranibizumab.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n illustrates binding specificities of anti-NRP1 antibodies.

(2000) \nGenomics \n70:211-222. Neuropilins are 120 to 130 kDa non-tyrosine kinase receptors. There are multiple NRP-1 and NRP-2 splice variants and soluble isoforms. The basic structure of neuropilins comprises five domains: three extracellular domains (a1a2, b1b2 and c), a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The a1a2 domain is homologous to complement components C1r and C1s (CUB), which generally contains four cysteine residues that form two disculfid bridges. The b1b2 domain is homologous to coagulation factors V and VIII. The central portion of the c domain is designated as MAM due to its homology to meprin, A5 and receptor tyrosine phosphotase μ proteins. The a1a2 and b1b2 domains are responsible for ligand binding, whereas the c domain is critical for homodimerization or heterodimerization. Gu et al. (2002) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n277:18069-76; He and Tessier-Lavigne (1997) \nCell \n90:739-51.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Neuropilin mediated biological activity” refers in general to physiological or pathological events in which neuropilin-1 and/or neuropilin-2 plays a substantial role. Non-limiting examples of such activities are axon guidance during embryonic nervous system development or neuron-regeneration, angiogenesis (including vascular modeling), tumorgenesis and tumor metastasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody” is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. (1975) \nNature \n256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The “monoclonal antibodies” may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. (1991) \nNature \n352:624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222:581-597, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al. (1984) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81:6851-6855).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al. (1986) \nNature \n321:522-525; Riechmann et al. (1988) \nNature \n332:323-329; and Presta (1992) \nCurr. Op. Struct. Biol. \n2:593-596.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “species-dependent antibody” is one which has a stronger binding affinity for an antigen from a first mammalian species than it has for a homologue of that antigen from a second mammalian species. Normally, the species-dependent antibody “binds specifically” to a human antigen (i.e. has a binding affinity (K\nd\n) value of no more than about 1×10\n−7 \nM, preferably no more than about 1×10\n−8 \nM and most preferably no more than about 1×10\n−9 \nM) but has a binding affinity for a homologue of the antigen from a second nonhuman mammalian species which is at least about 50 fold, or at least about 500 fold, or at least about 1000 fold, weaker than its binding affinity for the human antigen. The species-dependent antibody can be any of the various types of antibodies as defined above, but preferably is a humanized or human antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “antibody mutant” or “antibody variant” refers to an amino acid sequence variant of the species-dependent antibody wherein one or more of the amino acid residues of the species-dependent antibody have been modified. Such mutants necessarily have less than 100% sequence identity or similarity with the species-dependent antibody. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody mutant will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of the species-dependent antibody, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or similarity with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical (i.e same residue) or similar (i e amino acid residue from the same group based on common side-chain properties, see below) with the species-dependent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence outside of the variable domain shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or similarity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “isolated” antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “antibody variable domain” refers to the portions of the light and heavy chains of antibody molecules that include amino acid sequences of Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs; ie., CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3), and Framework Regions (FRs). V\nH \nrefers to the variable domain of the heavy chain. V\nL \nrefers to the variable domain of the light chain. According to the methods used in this invention, the amino acid positions assigned to CDRs and FRs may be defined according to Kabat (Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1987 and 1991)) Amino acid numbering of antibodies or antigen binding fragments is also according to that of Kabat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs; ie., CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3) refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody variable domain the presence of which are necessary for antigen binding. Each variable domain typically has three CDR regions identified as CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3. Each complementarity determining region may comprise amino acid residues from a “complementarity determining region” as defined by Kabat (i.e. about residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and/or those residues from a “hypervariable loop” (i.e. about residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901-917). In some instances, a complementarity determining region can include amino acids from both a CDR region defined according to Kabat and a hypervariable loop. For example, the CDRH1 of the heavy chain of antibody 4D5 includes \namino acids\n 26 to 35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Framework regions” (hereinafter FR) are those variable domain residues other than the CDR residues. Each variable domain typically has four FRs identified as FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4. If the CDRs are defined according to Kabat, the light chain FR residues are positioned at about residues 1-23 (LCFR1), 35-49 (LCFR2), 57-88 (LCFR3), and 98-107 (LCFR4) and the heavy chain FR residues are positioned about at residues 1-30 (HCFR1), 36-49 (HCFR2), 66-94 (HCFR3), and 103-113 (HCFR4) in the heavy chain residues. If the CDRs comprise amino acid residues from hypervariable loops, the light chain FR residues are positioned about at residues 1-25 (LCFR1), 33-49 (LCFR2), 53-90 (LCFR3), and 97-107 (LCFR4) in the light chain and the heavy chain FR residues are positioned about at residues 1-25 (HCFR1), 33-52 (HCFR2), 56-95 (HCFR3), and 102-113 (HCFR4) in the heavy chain residues. In some instances, when the CDR comprises amino acids from both a CDR as defined by Kabat and those of a hypervariable loop, the FR residues will be adjusted accordingly. For example, when CDRH1 includes amino acids H26-H35, the heavy chain FR1 residues are at positions 1-25 and the FR2 residues are at positions 36-49.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “codon set” refers to a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. A set of oligonucleotides can be synthesized, for example, by solid phase synthesis, including sequences that represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will encode the desired group of amino acids. A standard form of codon designation is that of the IUB code, which is known in the art and described herein. A codon set typically is represented by 3 capital letters in italics, eg. NNK, NNS, XYZ, DVK and the like. A “non-random codon set”, as used herein, thus refers to a codon set that encodes select amino acids that fulfill partially, preferably completely, the criteria for amino acid selection as described herein. Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide “degeneracy” at certain positions is well known in that art, for example the TRIM approach (Knappek et al. (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n296:57-86); Garrard & Henner (1993) \nGene \n128:103). Such sets of oligonucleotides having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucleic acid synthesizers (available from, for example, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.), or can be obtained commercially (for example, from Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.). Therefore, a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences, the differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence. Oligonucleotides, as used according to the invention, have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable domain nucleic acid template and also can, but does not necessarily, include restriction enzyme sites useful for, for example, cloning purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “Fv” fragment is an antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight association, which can be covalent in nature, for example in scFv. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the V\nH\n-V\nL \ndimer Collectively, the six CDRs or a subset thereof confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although usually at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “Fab” fragment contains a variable and constant domain of the light chain and a variable domain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. F(ab′)\n2 \nantibody fragments comprise a pair of Fab fragments which are generally covalently linked near their carboxy termini by hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Single-chain Fv” or “scFv” antibody fragments comprise the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains, which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see Pluckthun in \nThe Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, \n \nVol\n 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH \nand V\nL\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al. (1993) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n90:6444-6448.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression “linear antibodies” refers to the antibodies described in Zapata et al. (1995 \nProtein Eng, \n8(10):1057-1062). Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (V\nH\n-C\nH\n1-V\nH\n-C\nH\n1) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “library” refers to a plurality of antibody or antibody fragment sequences (for example, polypeptides of the invention), or the nucleic acids that encode these sequences, the sequences being different in the combination of variant amino acids that are introduced into these sequences according to the methods of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Phage display” is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to at least a portion of coat protein on the surface of phage, e.g., filamentous phage, particles. A utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of randomized protein variants can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target antigen with high affinity. Display of peptide and protein libraries on phage has been used for screening millions of polypeptides for ones with specific binding properties. Polyvalent phage display methods have been used for displaying small random peptides and small proteins through fusions to either gene III or gene VIII of filamentous phage. Wells and Lowman (1992) \nCurr. Opin. Struct. Biol. \n3:355-362, and references cited therein. In a monovalent phage display, a protein or peptide library is fused to a gene III or a portion thereof, and expressed at low levels in the presence of wild type gene III protein so that phage particles display one copy or none of the fusion proteins. Avidity effects are reduced relative to polyvalent phage so that sorting is on the basis of intrinsic ligand affinity, and phagemid vectors are used, which simplify DNA manipulations. Lowman and Wells (1991) \nMethods: A companion to Methods in Enzymology \n3:205-0216.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “phagemid” is a plasmid vector having a bacterial origin of replication, e.g., ColE1, and a copy of an intergenic region of a bacteriophage. The phagemid may be used on any known bacteriophage, including filamentous bacteriophage and lambdoid bacteriophage. The plasmid will also generally contain a selectable marker for antibiotic resistance. Segments of DNA cloned into these vectors can be propagated as plasmids. When cells harboring these vectors are provided with all genes necessary for the production of phage particles, the mode of replication of the plasmid changes to rolling circle replication to generate copies of one strand of the plasmid DNA and package phage particles. The phagemid may form infectious or non-infectious phage particles. This term includes phagemids which contain a phage coat protein gene or fragment thereof linked to a heterologous polypeptide gene as a gene fusion such that the heterologous polypeptide is displayed on the surface of the phage particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “phage vector” means a double stranded replicative form of a bacteriophage containing a heterologous gene and capable of replication. The phage vector has a phage origin of replication allowing phage replication and phage particle formation. The phage is preferably a filamentous bacteriophage, such as an M13, fl, fd, Pf3 phage or a derivative thereof, or a lambdoid phage, such as lambda, 21, phi80, phi81, 82, 424, 434, etc., or a derivative thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “solvent accessible position” refers to a position of an amino acid residue in the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of a source antibody or antigen binding fragment that is determined, based on structure, ensemble of structures and/or modeled structure of the antibody or antigen binding fragment, as potentially available for solvent access and/or contact with a molecule, such as an antibody-specific antigen. These positions are typically found in the CDRs and on the exterior of the protein. The solvent accessible positions of an antibody or antigen binding fragment, as defined herein, can be determined using any of a number of algorithms known in the art. Preferably, solvent accessible positions are determined using coordinates from a 3-dimensional model of an antibody, preferably using a computer program such as the Insightll program (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.). Solvent accessible positions can also be determined using algorithms known in the art (e.g., Lee and Richards (1971) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n55, 379 and Connolly (1983) \nJ. Appl. Cryst. \n16, 548). Determination of solvent accessible positions can be performed using software suitable for protein modeling and 3-dimensional structural information obtained from an antibody. Software that can be utilized for these purposes includes SYBYL Biopolymer Module software (Tripos Associates). Generally and preferably, where an algorithm (program) requires a user input size parameter, the “size” of a probe which is used in the calculation is set at about 1.4 Angstrom or smaller in radius. In addition, determination of solvent accessible regions and area methods using software for personal computers has been described by Pacios (1994) \nComput. Chem. \n18(4): 377-386.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “angiogenic factor or agent” is a growth factor which stimulates the development of blood vessels, e.g., promote angiogenesis, endothelial cell growth, stabiliy of blood vessels, and/or vasculogenesis, etc. For example, angiogenic factors, include, but are not limited to, e.g., VEGF and members of the VEGF family, P1GF, PDGF family, fibroblast growth factor family (FGFs), TIE ligands (Angiopoietins), ephrins, Del-1, fibroblast growth factors: acidic (aFGF) and basic (bFGF), Follistatin, Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) /scatter factor (SF), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Leptin, Midkine,neuropilins, Placental growth factor, Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), Platelet-derived growth factor, especially PDGF-BB or PDGFR-beta, Pleiotrophin (PTN), Progranulin, Proliferin, Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), etc. It would also include factors that accelerate wound healing, such as growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), VIGF, epidermal growth factor (EGF), CTGF and members of its family, and TGF-alpha and TGF-beta. See, e.g., Klagsbrun and D'Amore (1991) \nAnnu. Rev. Physiol. \n53:217-39; Streit and Detmar (2003) \nOncogene \n22:3172-3179; Ferrara & Alitalo (1999) \nNature Medicine \n5(12):1359-1364; Tonini et al. (2003) \nOncogene \n22:6549-6556 (e.g., Table 1 listing known angiogenic factors); and, Sato (2003) \nInt. J. Clin. Oncol. \n8:200-206.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “anti-angiogenesis agent” or “angiogenesis inhibitor” refers to a small molecular weight substance, an polynucleotide, an polypeptide, an isolated protein, a recombinant protein, an antibody, or conjugates or fusion proteins thereof, that inhibits angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, or undesirable vascular permeability, either directly or indirectly. It should be understood that theanti-angiogenesis agent includes those agents that bind and block the angiogenic activity of the angiogenic factor or its receptor. For example, an anti-angiogenesis agent is an antibody or other antagonist to an angiogenic agent as defined above, e.g., antibodies to VEGF-A or to the VEGF-A receptor (e.g., KDR receptor or Flt-1 receptor), anti-PDGFR inhibitors such as Gleevec™ (Imatinib Mesylate). Anti-angiogensis agents also include native angiogenesis inhibitors, e.g., angiostatin, endostatin, etc. See, e.g., Klagsbrun and D'Amore (1991) \nAnnu. Rev. Physiol. \n53:217-39; Streit and Detmar (2003) \nOncogene \n22:3172-3179 (e.g., Table 3 listing anti-angiogenic therapy in malignant melanoma); Ferrara & Alitalo (1999) \nNature Medicine \n5(12):1359-1364; Tonini et al. (2003) \nOncogene \n22:6549-6556 (e.g., Table 2 listing known antiangiogenic factors); and, Sato (2003) \nInt. J. Clin. Oncol. \n8:200-206 (e.g., Table 1 listing anti-angiogenic agents used in clinical trials).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “VEGF” or “VEGF-A” as used herein refers to the 165-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factor and related 121-, 189-, and 206-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factors, as described by Leung et al. (1989) Science 246:1306, and Houck et al. (1991) \nMol. Endocrin, \n5:1806, together with the naturally occurring allelic and processed forms thereof The term “VEGF” also refers to VEGFs from non-human species such as mouse, rat or primate. Sometimes the VEGF from a specific species are indicated by terms such as hVEGF for human VEGF, mVEGF for murine VEGF, and etc. The term “VEGF” is also used to refer to truncated forms of the polypeptide comprising \namino acids\n 8 to 109 or 1 to 109 of the 165-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factor. Reference to any such forms of VEGF may be identified in the present application, e.g., by “VEGF (8-109),” “VEGF (1-109)” or “VEGF\n165\n.” The amino acid positions for a “truncated” native VEGF are numbered as indicated in the native VEGF sequence. For example, amino acid position 17 (methionine) in truncated native VEGF is also position 17 (methionine) in native VEGF. The truncated native VEGF has binding affinity for the KDR and Flt-1 receptors comparable to native VEGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “anti-VEGF antibody” is an antibody that binds to VEGF with sufficient affinity and specificity. Preferably, the anti-VEGF antibody of the invention can be used as a therapeutic agent in targeting and interfering with diseases or conditions wherein the VEGF activity is involved. An anti-VEGF antibody will usually not bind to other VEGF homologues such as VEGF-B or VEGF-C, nor other growth factors such as P1GF, PDGF or bFGF. A preferred anti-VEGF antibody is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the same epitope as the monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody A4.6.1 produced by hybridoma ATCC HB 10709. More preferably the anti-VEGF antibody is a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody generated according to Presta et al. (1997) \nCancer Res. \n57:4593-4599, including but not limited to the antibody known as bevacizumab (BV; Avastin™)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-VEGF antibody “Bevacizumab (BV)”, also known as “rhuMAb VEGF” or Avastin®, is a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody generated according to Presta et al. (1997) \nCancer Res. \n57:4593-4599. It comprises mutated human IgG1 framework regions and antigen-binding complementarity-determining regions from the murine anti-hVEGF monoclonal antibody A.4.6.1 that blocks binding of human VEGF to its receptors. Approximately 93% of the amino acid sequence of Bevacizumab, including most of the framework regions, is derived from human IgG1, and about 7% of the sequence is derived from the murine antibody A4.6.1. Bevacizumab has a molecular mass of about 149,000 daltons and is glycosylated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “VEGF antagonist” refers to a molecule capable of neutralizing, blocking, inhibiting, abrogating, reducing or interfering with VEGF activities including its binding to one or more VEGF receptors. VEGF antagonists include anti-VEGF antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, receptor molecules and derivatives which bind specifically to VEGF thereby sequestering its binding to one or more receptors, anti-VEGF receptor antibodies and VEGF receptor antagonists such as small molecule inhibitors of the VEGFR tyrosine kinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Treatment” refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those in which the disorder is to be prevented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “disorder” is any condition that would benefit from treatment with the antibody. For example, mammals who suffer from or need prophylaxis against abnormal angiogenesis (excessive, inappropriate or uncontrolled angiogenesis) or vascular permeability. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include malignant and benign tumors; non-leukemias and lymphoid malignancies; neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic and other glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal and blastocoelic disorders; and inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbnormal angiogenesis occurs when new blood vessels either grow excessively, insufficiently or inappropriately (e.g., the location, timing or onset of the angiogenesis being undesired from a medical standpoint) in a diseased state or such that it causes a diseased state. Excessive, inappropriate or uncontrolled angiogenesis occurs when there is new blood vessel growth that contributes to the worsening of the diseased state or causes a diseased state, such as in cancer, especially vascularized solid tumors and metastatic tumors (including colon, lung cancer (especially small-cell lung cancer), or prostate cancer), diseases caused by ocular neovascularisation, especially diabetic blindness, retinopathies, primarily diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, haemangioblastoma such as haemangioma; inflammatory renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, especially mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive nephrosclerosis; various imflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psorsasis, sarcoidosis, arterial arteriosclerosis and diseases occurring after transplants, endometriosis or chronic asthma and more than 70 other conditions. The new blood vessels can feed the diseased tissues, destroy normal tissues, and in the case of cancer, the new vessels can allow tumor cells to escape into the circulation and lodge in other organs (tumor metastases). Insufficient angiogenesis occurs when there is inadequate blood vessels growth that contributes to the worsening of a diseased state, e.g., in diseases such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and delayed wound healing. Further, ulcers, strokes, and heart attacks can result from the absence of angiogenesis that normally required for natural healing. The present invention contemplates treating those patients that are at risk of developing the above-mentioned illnesses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther patients that are candidates for receiving the antibodies or polypeptides of this invention have, or are at risk for developing, abnormal proliferation of fibrovascular tissue, acne rosacea, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, artery occlusion, atopic keratitis, bacterial ulcers, Bechets disease, blood borne tumors, carotid obstructive disease, choroidal neovascularization, chronic inflammation, chronic retinal detachment, chronic uveitis, chronic vitritis, contact lens overwear, corneal graft rejection, corneal neovascularization, corneal graft neovascularization, Crohn's disease, Eales disease, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, fungal ulcers, Herpes simplex infections, Herpes zoster infections, hyperviscosity syndromes, Kaposi's sarcoma, leukemia, lipid degeneration, Lyme's disease, marginal keratolysis, Mooren ulcer, Mycobacteria infections other than leprosy, myopia, ocular neovascular disease, optic pits, Osler-Weber syndrome (Osler-Weber-Rendu, osteoarthritis, Pagets disease, pars planitis, pemphigoid, phylectenulosis, polyarteritis, post-laser complications, protozoan infections, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, pterygium keratitis sicca, radial keratotomy, retinal neovascularization, retinopathy of prematurity, retrolental fibroplasias, sarcoid, scleritis, sickle cell anemia, Sogrens syndrome, solid tumors, Stargarts disease, Steven's Johnson disease, superior limbic keratitis, syphilis, systemic lupus, Terrien's marginal degeneration, toxoplasmosis, trauma, tumors of Ewing sarcoma, tumors of neuroblastoma, tumors of osteosarcoma, tumors of retinoblastoma, tumors of rhabdomyosarcoma, ulcerative colitis, vein occlusion, Vitamin A deficiency and Wegeners sarcoidosis, undesired angiogenesis associated with diabetes, parasitic diseases, abnormal wound healing, hypertrophy following surgery, injury or trauma, inhibition of hair growth, inhibition of ovulation and corpus luteum formation, inhibition of implantation and inhibition of embryo development in the uterus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-angiogenesis therapies are useful in the general treatment of graft rejection, lung inflammation, nephrotic syndrome, preeclampsia, pericardial effusion, such as that associated with pericarditis, and pleural effusion, diseases and disorders characterized by undesirable vascular permeability, e.g., edema associated with brain tumors, ascites associated with malignancies, Meigs' syndrome, lung inflammation, nephrotic syndrome, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, permeability associated with cardiovascular diseases such as the condition following myocardial infarctions and strokes and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther angiogenesis-dependent diseases according to this invention include angiofibroma (abnormal blood of vessels which are prone to bleeding), neovascular glaucoma (growth of blood vessels in the eye), arteriovenous malformations (abnormal communication between arteries and veins), nonunion fractures (fractures that will not heal), atherosclerotic plaques (hardening of the arteries), pyogenic granuloma (common skin lesion composed of blood vessels), scleroderma (a form of connective tissue disease), hemangioma (tumor composed of blood vessels), trachoma (leading cause of blindness in the third world), hemophilic joints, vascular adhesions and hypertrophic scars (abnormal scar formation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “cancer” and “cancerous” refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, lung cancer (including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, and squamous carcinoma of the lung), cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer (including gastrointestinal cancer), pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma and various types of head and neck cancer, as well as B-cell lymphoma (including low grade/follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); small lymphocytic (SL) NHL; intermediate grade/follicular NHL; intermediate grade diffuse NHL; high grade immunoblastic NHL; high grade lymphoblastic NHL; high grade small non-cleaved cell NHL; bulky disease NHL; mantle cell lymphoma; AIDS-related lymphoma; and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia); chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); Hairy cell leukemia; chronic myeloblastic leukemia; and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), as well as abnormal vascular proliferation associated with phakomatoses, edema (such as that associated with brain tumors), and Meigs' syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “anti-neoplastic composition” refers to a composition useful in treating cancer comprising at least one active therapeutic agent, e.g., “anti-cancer agent.” Examples of therapeutic agents (anti-cancer agents) include, but are limited to, e.g., chemotherapeutic agents, growth inhibitory agents, cytotoxic agents, agents used in radiation therapy, anti-angiogenesis agents, apoptotic agents, anti-tubulin agents, and other-agents to treat cancer, such as anti-HER-2 antibodies, anti-CD20 antibodies, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist (e.g., a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), HER1/EGFR inhibitor (e.g., erlotinib (Tarceva™), platelet derived growth factor inhibitors (e.g., Gleevec™ (Imatinib Mesylate)), a COX-2 inhibitor (e.g., celecoxib), interferons, cytokines, antagonists (e.g., neutralizing antibodies) that bind to one or more of the following targets ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, PDGFR-beta, BlyS, APRIL, BCMA or VEGF receptor(s), TRAIL/Apo2, and other bioactive and organic chemical agents, etc. Combinations thereof are also included in the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cytotoxic agent” as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g., I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90 \nand Re\n186\n), chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, or fragments thereof\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “chemotherapeutic agent” is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer.

No. 4,675,187), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, acids or derivatives of any of the above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “prodrug” as used in this application refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See, e.g., Wilman (1986) “Prodrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy” \nBiochemical Society Transactions, \n14, pp. 375-382, 615th Meeting Belfast and Stella et al. (1985). “Prodrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,” \nDirected Drug Delivery, Borchardt et al, (ed.), pp. \n247-267, Humana Press. The prodrugs of this invention include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate-containing prodrugs, peptide-containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glycosylated prodrugs, β-lactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs which can be converted into the more active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, those chemotherapeutic agents described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “isolated” nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the antibody nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the antibody where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression “control sequences” refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid is “operably linked” when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, “operably linked” means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the expressions “cell,” “cell line,” and “cell culture” are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words “transformants” and “transformed cells” include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it will be clear from the context.\n\n\n \nModes for Carrying out the Invention\n\n\nProduction of Anti-NRP1 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention herein provides novel anti-NRP1 antibodies. Exemplary methods for generating antibodies are described in more detail in the following sections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe novel anti-NRP1 antibodies are selected using the NRP1 antigen derived from a mammalian species. Preferably the antigen is human NRP1 (hNRP1). However, NRPs from other species such as murine NRP1 (mNRP1) can also be used as the target antigen. The NRP antigens from various mammalian species may be isolated from natural sources. In other embodiments, the antigen is produced recombinantly or made using other synthetic methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody selected will normally have a sufficiently strong binding affinity for the NRP1 antigen. For example, the antibody may bind hNRP1 with a K\nd \nvalue of no more than about 5 nM, preferably no more than about 2 nM, and more preferably no more than about 500 μM. Antibody affinities may be determined by a surface plasmon resonance based assay (such as the BlAcore assay as described in Examples); enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA); and competition assays (e.g. RIA's), for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the antibody may be subject to other biological activity assays, e.g., in order to evaluate its effectiveness as a therapeutic. Such assays are known in the art and depend on the target antigen and intended use for the antibody. Examples include the HUVEC inhibition assay (as described in the Examples below); tumor cell growth inhibition assays (as described in WO 89/06692, for example); antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) assays (U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362); and agonistic activity or hematopoiesis assays (see WO 95/27062).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo screen for antibodies which bind to a particular epitope on the antigen of interest, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in \nAntibodies, A Laboratory Manual, \nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping, e.g. as described in Champe et al. (1995) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270:1388-1394, can be performed to determine whether the antibody binds an epitope of interest.\n\n\n \n \nGeneration of Novel Anti-NRP1 Antibodies from Synthetic Antibody Phage Libraries\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method for generating and selecting novel anti-NRP1 antibodies using a unique phage display approach. The approach involves generation of synthetic antibody phage libraries based on single framework template, design of sufficient diversities within variable domains, display of polypeptides having the diversified variable domains, selection of candidate antibodies with high affinity to target NRP1 antigen, and isolation of the selected antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetails of the phage display methods can be found, for example, in WO03/102157 published Dec. 11, 2003.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the antibody libraries used in the invention can be generated by mutating the solvent accessible and/or highly diverse positions in at least one CDR of an antibody variable domain. Some or all of the CDRs can be mutated using the methods provided herein. In some embodiments, it may be preferable to generate diverse antibody libraries by mutating positions in CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 to form a single library or by mutating positions in CDRL3 and CDRH3 to form a single library or by mutating positions in CDRL3 and CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 to form a single library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA library of antibody variable domains can be generated, for example, having mutations in the solvent accessible and/or highly diverse positions of CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3. Another library can be generated having mutations in CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3. These libraries can also be used in conjunction with each other to generate binders of desired affinities. For example, after one or more rounds of selection of heavy chain libraries for binding to a target antigen, a light chain library can be replaced into the population of heavy chain binders for further rounds of selection to increase the affinity of the binders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, a library is created by substitution of original amino acids with variant amino acids in the CDRH3 region of the variable region of the heavy chain sequence. The resulting library can contain a plurality of antibody sequences, wherein the sequence diversity is primarily in the CDRH3 region of the heavy chain sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the library is created in the context of the humanized antibody 4D5 sequence, or the sequence of the framework amino acids of the humanized antibody 4D5 sequence. Preferably, the library is created by substitution of at least residues 95-100a of the heavy chain with amino acids encoded by the DVK codon set, wherein the DVK codon set is used to encode a set of variant amino acids for every one of these positions. An example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (DVK)\n7\n. In some embodiments, a library is created by substitution of residues 95-100a with amino acids encoded by both DVK and NNK codon sets. An example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (DVK)\n6\n(NNK). In another embodiment, a library is created by substitution of at least residues 95-100a with amino acids encoded by both DVK and NNK codon sets. An example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (DVK)\n5\n(NNK). Another example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (NNK)\n6\n. Other examples of suitable oligonucleotide sequences can be determined by one skilled in the art according to the criteria described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, different CDRH3 designs are utilized to isolate high affinity binders and to isolate binders for a variety of epitopes. The range of lengths of CDRH3 generated in this library is 11 to 13 amino acids, although lengths different from this can also be generated. H3 diversity can be expanded by using NNK, DVK and NVK codon sets, as well as more limited diversity at N and/or C-terminal\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiversity can also be generated in CDRH1 and CDRH2. The designs of CDR-H1 and H2 diversities follow the strategy of targeting to mimic natural antibodies repertoire as described with modification that focus the diversity more closely matched to the natural diversity than previous design.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor diversity in CDRH3, multiple libraries can be constructed separately with different lengths of H3 and then combined to select for binders to target antigens. The multiple libraries can be pooled and sorted using solid support selection and solution sorting methods as described previously and herein below. Multiple sorting satrategies may be employed. For example, one variation involves sorting on target bound to a solid, followed by sorting for a tag that may be present on the fusion polypeptide (eg. anti-gD tag) and followed by another sort on target bound to solid. Alternatively, the libraries can be sorted first on target bound to a solid surface, the eluted binders are then sorted using solution phase binding with decreasing concentrations of target antigen. Utilizing combinations of different sorting methods provides for minimization of selection of only highly expressed sequences and provides for selection of a number of different high affinity clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh affinity binders for the target NRP1 antigen can be isolated from the libraries. Limiting diversity in the H1/H2 region decreases degeneracy about 10\n4 \nto 10\n5 \nfold and allowing more H3 diversity provides for more high affinity binders. Utilizing libraries with different types of diversity in CDRH3 (eg. utilizing DVK or NVT) provides for isolation of binders that may bind to different epitopes of a target antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf the binders isolated from the pooled libraries as described above, it has been discovered that affinity may be further improved by providing limited diversity in the light chain. Light chain diversity is generated in this embodiment as follows in CDRL1: \namino acid position\n 28 is encoded by RDT; \namino acid position\n 29 is encoded by RKT; \namino acid position\n 30 is encoded by RVW; \namino acid position\n 31 is encoded by ANW; \namino acid position\n 32 is encoded by THT; optionally, \namino acid position\n 33 is encoded by CTG; in CDRL2: \namino acid position\n 50 is encoded by KBG; \namino acid position\n 53 is encoded by AVC; and optionally, \namino acid position\n 55 is encoded by GMA ; in CDRL3: \namino acid position\n 91 is encoded by TMT or SRT or both; \namino acid position\n 92 is encoded by DMC; \namino acid position\n 93 is encoded by RVT; \namino acid position\n 94 is encoded by NHT; and \namino acid position\n 96 is encoded by TWT or YKG or both.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a library or libraries with diversity in CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 regions is generated. In this embodiment, diversity in CDRH3 is generated using a variety of lengths of H3 regions and using primarily codon sets XYZ and NNK or NNS. Libraries can be formed using individual oligonucleotides and pooled or oligonucleotides can be pooled to form a subset of libraries. The libraries of this embodiment can be sorted against target bound to solid. Clones isolated from multiple sorts can be screened for specificity and affinity using ELISA assays. For specificity, the clones can be screened against the desired target antigens as well as other nontarget antigens. Those binders to the target NRP1 antigen can then be screened for affinity in solution binding competition ELISA assay or spot competition assay. High affinity binders can be isolated from the library utilizing XYZ codon sets prepared as described above. These binders can be readily produced as antibodies or antigen binding fragments in high yield in cell culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, it may be desirable to generate libraries with a greater diversity in lengths of CDRH3 region. For example, it may be desirable to generate libraries with CDRH3 regions ranging from about 7 to 19 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh affinity binders isolated from the libraries of these embodiments are readily produced in bacterial and eukaryotic cell culture in high yield. The vectors can be designed to readily remove sequences such as gD tags, viral coat protein component sequence, and/or to add in constant region sequences to provide for production of full length antibodies or antigen binding fragments in high yield.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA library with mutations in CDRH3 can be combined with a library containing variant versions of other CDRs, for example CDRL1, CDRL2, CDRL3, CDRH1 and/or CDRH2. Thus, for example, in one embodiment, a CDRH3 library is combined with a CDRL3 library created in the context of the humanized 4D5 antibody sequence with variant amino acids at \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 28, 29, 30,31, and/or 32 using predetermined codon sets. In another embodiment, a library with mutations to the CDRH3 can be combined with a library comprising variant CDRH1 and/or CDRH2 heavy chain variable domains. In one embodiment, the CDRH1 library is created with the humanized antibody 4D5 sequence with variant amino acids at \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n 28, 30, 31, 32 and 33. A CDRH2 library may be created with the sequence of humanized antibody 4D5 with variant amino acids at \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n 50, 52, 53, 54, 56 and 58 using the predetermined codon sets.\n\n\n \nAnti-NRP1 Antibody Mutants\n\n\n \n \n \nThe novel anti-NRP1 antibody generated from phage libraries can be further modified to generate antibody mutants with improved physical, chemical and or biological properties over the parent antibody. Where the assay used is a biological activity assay, the antibody mutant preferably has a biological activity in the assay of choice which is at least about 10 fold better, preferably at least about 20 fold better, more preferably at least about 50 fold better, and sometimes at least about 100 fold or 200 fold better, than the biological activity of the parent antibody in that assay. For example, an anti-NRP1 antibody mutant preferably has a binding affinity for NRP1 which is at least about 10 fold stronger, preferably at least about 20 fold stronger, more preferably at least about 50 fold stronger, and sometimes at least about 100 fold or 200 fold stronger, than the binding affinity of the parent anti-NRP1 antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo generate the antibody mutant, one or more amino acid alterations (e.g. substitutions) are introduced in one or more of the hypervariable regions of the parent antibody. Alternatively, or in addition, one or more alterations (e.g. substitutions) of framework region residues may be introduced in the parent antibody where these result in an improvement in the binding affinity of the antibody mutant for the antigen from the second mammalian species. Examples of framework region residues to modify include those which non-covalently bind antigen directly (Amit et al. (1986) \nScience \n233:747-753); interact with/effect the conformation of a CDR (Chothia et al. (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901-917); and/or participate in the V\nL\n-V\nH \ninterface (EP 239 400B1). In certain embodiments, modification of one or more of such framework region residues results in an enhancement of the binding affinity of the antibody for the antigen from the second mammalian species. For example, from about one to about five framework residues may be altered in this embodiment of the invention. Sometimes, this may be sufficient to yield an antibody mutant suitable for use in preclinical trials, even where none of the hypervariable region residues have been altered. Normally, however, the antibody mutant will comprise additional hypervariable region alteration(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hypervariable region residues which are altered may be changed randomly, especially where the starting binding affinity of the parent antibody is such that such randomly produced antibody mutants can be readily screened.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne useful procedure for generating such antibody mutants is called “alanine scanning mutagenesis” (Cunningham and Wells (1989) \nScience \n244:1081-1085). Here, one or more of the hypervariable region residue(s) are replaced by alanine or polyalanine residue(s) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with the antigen from the second mammalian species. Those hypervariable region residue(s) demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other mutations at or for the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined The ala-mutants produced this way are screened for their biological activity as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNormally one would start with a conservative substitution such as those shown below under the heading of “preferred substitutions”. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity (e.g. binding affinity), then more substantial changes, denominated “exemplary substitutions” in the following table, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, are introduced and the products screened.\n\n\n \nPreferred Substitutions:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal\n\n\nExemplary\n\n\nPreferred\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidue\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nval; leu; ile\n\n\nval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nlys; aln; asn\n\n\nlys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\ngln; his; lys; arg\n\n\ngln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nglu\n\n\nglu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nser\n\n\nser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nasn\n\n\nasn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu (E)\n\n\nasp\n\n\nasp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\npro; ala\n\n\nala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nasn; gln; lys; arg\n\n\narg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nleu; val; met; ala; phe;\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nnorleucine\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu (L)\n\n\nnorleucine; ile; val; met; ala;\n\n\nile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nphe\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\narg; gln; asn\n\n\narg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nleu; phe; ile\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nleu; val; ile; ala; tyr\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nala\n\n\nala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nthr\n\n\nthr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nser\n\n\nser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\ntyr; phe\n\n\ntyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\ntrp; phe; thr; ser\n\n\nphe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nile; leu; met; phe; ala;\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nnorleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEven more substantial modifications in the antibodies biological properties are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr, asn, gln;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) acidic: asp, glu;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(4) basic: his, lys, arg;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the sites selected for modification are affinity matured using phage display (see above).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence mutants are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared mutant or a non-mutant version of the parent antibody. The preferred method for making mutants is site directed mutagenesis (see, e.g., Kunkel (1985) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n82:488).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the antibody mutant will only have a single hypervariable region residue substituted. In other embodiments, two or more of the hypervariable region residues of the parent antibody will have been substituted, e.g. from about two to about ten hypervariable region substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrdinarily, the antibody mutant with improved biological properties will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of the parent antibody, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or similarity with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical (i.e same residue) or similar (i e. amino acid residue from the same group based on common side-chain properties, see above) with the parent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence outside of the variable domain shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or similarity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing production of the antibody mutant, the biological activity of that molecule relative to the parent antibody is determined As noted above, this may involve determining the binding affinity and/or other biological activities of the antibody. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a panel of antibody mutants is prepared and screened for binding affinity for the antigen such as NRP1 or a fragment thereof One or more of the antibody mutants selected from this initial screen are optionally subjected to one or more further biological activity assays to confirm that the antibody mutant(s) with enhanced binding affinity are indeed useful, e.g. for preclinical studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody mutant(s) so selected may be subjected to further modifications, oftentimes depending on the intended use of the antibody. Such modifications may involve further alteration of the amino acid sequence, fusion to heterologous polypeptide(s) and/or covalent modifications such as those elaborated below. With respect to amino acid sequence alterations, exemplary modifications are elaborated above. For example, any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody mutant also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant cross linking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment). Another type of amino acid mutant has an altered glycosylation pattern. This may be achieved by deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody. Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used. Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\n \nVectors, Host Cells and Recombinant Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-NRP1 antibody of the invention can be produced recombinantly, using techniques and materials readily obtainable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor recombinant production of an anti-NRP1 antibody, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated or synthethized using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to DNAs encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n \n(i) Signal Sequence Component\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibody of this invention may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which is preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the native antibody signal sequence, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, lpp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, a factor leader (including \nSaccharomyces \nand \nKluyveromyces \nα-factor leaders), or acid phosphatase leader, the \nC. albicans \nglucoamylase leader, or the signal described in WO 90/13646. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available.\n\n\n \n \nThe DNA for such precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the antibody.\n\n\n \n(ii) Origin of Replication Component\n\n\n \n \n \nBoth expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2μ plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter).\n\n\n \n \n(iii) Selection Gene Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for \nBacilli. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid, such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II, preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding antibody, wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as \naminoglycoside\n 3′-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trpl gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 (Stinchcomb et al. (1979) \nNature \n282:39). The trpl gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1. Jones (1977) \nGenetics \n85:12. The presence of the trpl lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly, Leu2-deficient yeast strains (ATCC 20,622 or 38,626) are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2 gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, vectors derived from the 1.6 μm circular plasmid pKD1 can be used for transformation of \nKluyveromyces \nyeasts. Alternatively, an expression system for large-scale production of recombinant calf chymosin was reported for \nK. lactis. \nVan den Berg (1990) \nBio/Technology \n8:135. Stable multi-copy expression vectors for secretion of mature recombinant human serum albumin by industrial strains of \nKluyveromyces \nhave also been disclosed. Fleer et al. (1991) \nBio/Technology \n9:968-975.\n\n\n \n(iv) Promoter Component\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the antibody nucleic acid. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter, β-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan (tip) promoter system, and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. However, other known bacterial promoters are suitable. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3′ end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3′ end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for \nalcohol dehydrogenase\n 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73,657. Yeast enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,978. See also Reyes et al. (1982) \nNature \n297:598-601 on expression of human β-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.\n\n\n \n(v) Enhancer Element Component\n\n\n \n \n \nTranscription of a DNA encoding the antibody of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, α-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv (1982) \nNature \n297:17-18 on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a \nposition\n 5′ or 3′ to the antibody-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a \nsite\n 5′ from the promoter.\n\n\n \n(vi) Transcription Termination Component\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5′ and, occasionally 3′, untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding the antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94/11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.\n\n\n \n \n(vii) Selection and Transformation of Host Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are the prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells described above. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example, Enterobacteriaceae such as \nEscherichia, \ne.g., \nE. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, \ne.g., \nSalmonella typhimurium, Serratia, \ne.g., \nSerratia marcescans, \nand \nShigella, \nas well as \nBacilli \nsuch as \nB. subtilis and B. licheniformis \n(e.g., \nB. licheniformis \n41P disclosed in DD 266,710 published 12 Apr. 1989), Pseudomonas such as \nP. aeruginosa, \nand \nStreptomyces. \nOne preferred \nE. coli \ncloning host is \nE. coli \n294 (ATCC 31,446), although other strains such as \nE. coli \nB, \nE. coli \nX1776 (ATCC 31,537), and \nE. coli \nW3110 (ATCC 27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody-encoding vectors. \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, \nor common baker's yeast, is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms. However, a number of other genera, species, and strains are commonly available and useful herein, such as \nSchizosaccharomyces pombe; Kluyveromyces \nhosts such as, e.g., \nK. lactis, K. fragilis \n(ATCC 12,424), \nK. bulgaricus \n(ATCC 16,045), \nK. wickeramii \n(ATCC 24,178), \nK. waltii \n(ATCC 56,500), \nK. drosophilarum \n(ATCC 36,906), \nK. thermotolerans, \nand \nK. marxianus; yarrowia \n(EP 402,226); \nPichia pastoris \n(EP 183,070); \nCandida; Trichoderma reesia \n(EP 244,234); \nNeurospora crassa; Schwanniomyces \nsuch as \nSchwanniomyces occidentalis; \nand filamentous fungi such as, e.g., \nNeurospora, Penicillium, Tolypocladium, \nand \nAspergillus \nhosts such as \nA. nidulans \nand \nA. niger. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as \nSpodoptera frugiperda \n(caterpillar), \nAedes aegypti \n(mosquito), \nAedes albopictus \n(mosquito), \nDrosophila melanogaster \n(fruitfly), and \nBombyx mori \nhave been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available, e.g., the L-1 variant of \nAutographa californica \nNPV and the Bm-5 strain of \nBombyx mori \nNPV, and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention, particularly for transfection of \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells. Plant cell cultures of cotton, corn, potato, soybean, petunia, tomato, and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells, and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al. (1977) \nJ. Gen Virol. \n36:59) ; baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR (CHO, Urlaub et al. (1980) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77:4216) ; mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather (1980) \nBiol. Reprod. \n23:243-251); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (Mather et al. (1982) \nAnnals N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n383:44-68); \nMRC\n 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep G2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n(viii) Culturing the Host Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe host cells used to produce the antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in Ham et al. (1979) \nMeth. Enz. \n58:44, Barnes et al. (1980) \nAnal. Biochem. \n102:255, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; 4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; or U.S. Pat. Re. 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN™ drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n(ix) Antibody Purification\n\n\n \n \n \nWhen using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, is removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al. (1992) \nBio/Technology \n10:163-167 describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of \nE. coli. \nBriefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human γ1, γ2, or γ4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al. (1983) \nJ. Immunol. Meth. \n62:1-13). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human γ3 (Guss et al. (1986) \nEMBO J. \n5:15671575). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX™ resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE™ chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nTherapeutic formulations of the antibody are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example, it may be desirable to further provide an immunosuppressive agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and γ ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37° C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S—S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Uses\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is contemplated that the antibody of the present invention may be used to treat a mammal. In one embodiment, the antibody is administered to a nonhuman mammal for the purposes of obtaining preclinical data, for example. Exemplary nonhuman mammals to be treated include nonhuman primates, dogs, cats, rodents and other mammals in which preclinical studies are performed. Such mammals may be established animal models for a disease to be treated with the antibody or may be used to study toxicity of the antibody of interest. In each of these embodiments, dose escalation studies may be performed in the mammal. Where the antibody is an anti-NRP1 antibody, it may be administered to a host rodent in a solid tumor model, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, or in the alternative, the antibody is used to treat a human, e.g. a patient suffering from a disease or disorder who could benefit from administration of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses antiangiogenic cancer therapy, a novel cancer treatment strategy aimed at inhibiting the development of tumor blood vessels required for providing nutrients to support tumor growth. Because angiogenesis is involved in both primary tumor growth and metastasis, the antiangiogenic treatment provided by the invention is capable of inhibiting the neoplastic growth of tumor at the primary site as well as preventing metastasis of tumors at the secondary sites, therefore allowing attack of the tumors by other therapeutics. Examples of cancer to be treated herein include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, lung cancer (including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, and squamous carcinoma of the lung), cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer (including gastrointestinal cancer), pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma and various types of head and neck cancer, as well as B-cell lymphoma (including low grade/follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); small lymphocytic (SL) NHL; intermediate grade/follicular NHL; intermediate grade diffuse NHL; high grade immunoblastic NHL; high grade lymphoblastic NHL; high grade small non-cleaved cell NHL; bulky disease NHL; mantle cell lymphoma; AIDS-related lymphoma; and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia); chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); Hairy cell leukemia; chronic myeloblastic leukemia; and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), as well as abnormal vascular proliferation associated with phakomatoses, edema (such as that associated with brain tumors), and Meigs' syndrome. More particularly, cancers that are amenable to treatment by the antibodies of the invention include breast cancer, colorectal cancer, rectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), renal cell cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, soft-tissue sarcoma, kaposi's sarcoma, carcinoid carcinoma, head and neck cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma, and multiple myeloma. More preferably, the methods of the invention are used to treat colorectal cancer in a human patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is contemplated that when used to treat various diseases such as tumors, the antibodies of the invention can be combined with other therapeutic agents suitable for the same or similar diseases. When used for treating cancer, antibodies of the present invention may be used in combination with conventional cancer therapies, such as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain aspects, other therapeutic agents useful for combination cancer therapy with the antibody of the invention include other anti-angiogenic agents. Many anti-angiogenic agents have been identified and are known in the arts, including those listed by Carmeliet and Jain (2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the antibody of the invention is used in combination with a VEGF antagonist or a VEGF receptor antagonist such as anti-VEGF antibodies, VEGF variants, soluble VEGF receptor fragments, aptamers capable of blocking VEGF or VEGFR, neutralizing anti-VEGFR antibodies, inhibitors of VEGFR tyrosine kinases and any combinations thereof Alternatively, or in addition, two or more anti-NRP1 antibodies may be co-administered to the patient. In a more preferred embodiment, the anti-NRP1\nA \nor anti-NRP\nB \nantibody of the invention is used in combination with an anti-VEGF antibody to generate additive or synergistic effects. Preferred anti-VEGF antibodies include those that bind to the same epitope as the anti-hVEGF antibody A4.6.1. More preferably the anti-VEGF antibody is bevacizumab or ranibizumab.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some other aspects, other therapeutic agents useful for combination tumor therapy with the antibody of the invention include antagonist of other factors that are involved in tumor growth, such as EGFR, ErbB2 (also known as Her2) ErbB3, ErbB4, or TNF. Preferably, the anti-NRP1 antibody of the invention can be used in combination with small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) that target one or more tyrosine kinase receptors such as VEGF receptors, FGF receptors, EGF receptors and PDGF receptors. Many therapeutic small molecule RTKIs are known in the art, including, but are not limited to, vatalanib (PTK787), erlotinib (TARCEVA®), OSI-7904, ZD6474 (ZACTIMA®), ZD6126 (ANG453), ZD1839, sunitinib (SUTENT®), semaxanib (SU5416), AMG706, AG013736, Imatinib (GLEEVEC®), MLN-518, CEP-701, PKC- 412, Lapatinib (GSK572016), VELCADE®, AZD2171, sorafenib (NEXAVAR®), XL880, and CHIR-265.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-NRP1 antibody of the invention, either alone or in combination with a second therpateutic agent (such as an anti-VEGF antibody) can be further used in combination with one or more chemotherapeutic agents. A variety of chemotherapeutic agents may be used in the combined treatment methods of the invention. An exemplary and non-limiting list of chemotherapeutic agents contemplated is provided herein under “Definition”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the anti-NRP1 antibody is co-administered with a second therapeutic agent, the second therapeutic agent may be administered first, followed by the anti-NRP1 antibody. However, simultaneous administration or administration of the anti-NRP1 antibody first is also contemplated. Suitable dosages for the second therapeutic agent are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the agent and anti-NRP1 antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of antibody will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 μg/kg to 50 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg/kg) of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 μg/kg to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. In a preferred aspect, the antibody of the invention is administered every two to three weeks, at a dose ranged from about 5 mg/kg to about 15 mg/kg. More preferably, such dosing regimen is used in combination with a chemotherapy regimen as the first line therapy for treating metastatic colorectal cancer. In some aspects, the chemotherapy regimen involves the traditional high-dose intermittent administration. In some other aspects, the chemotherapeutic agents are administered using smaller and more frequent doses without scheduled breaks (“metronomic chemotherapy”). The progress of the therapy of the invention is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody composition will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The “therapeutically effective amount” of the antibody to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat a disease or disorder. The antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages. Generally, alleviation or treatment of a disease or disorder involves the lessening of one or more symptoms or medical problems associated with the disease or disorder. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug can accomplish one or a combination of the following: reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., to decrease to some extent and/or stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. In some embodiments, a composition of this invention can be used to prevent the onset or reoccurrence of the disease or disorder in a subject or mammal.\n\n\n \nNon-Therapeutic Uses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention may be used as affinity purification agents. In this process, the antibodies are immobilized on a solid phase such a Sephadex resin or filter paper, using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody is contacted with a sample containing the antigen to be purified, and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except the antigen to be purified, which is bound to the immobilized antibody. Finally, the support is washed with another suitable solvent, such as glycine buffer, pH 5.0, that will release the antigen from the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of this invention may also be useful in diagnostic assays, e.g., for detecting expression of an antigen of interest in specific cells, tissues, or serum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor diagnostic applications, the antibody typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available which can be generally grouped into the following categories:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) Radioisotopes, such as \n35\nS, \n14\nC, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, and \n131\nI. The antibody can be labeled with the radioisotope using the techniques described in \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology, \n \n \nVolumes\n \n 1 and 2, Coligen et al. (1991) Ed. Wiley-Interscience, New York, N.Y., Pubs. for example and radioactivity can be measured using scintillation counting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) Fluorescent labels such as rare earth chelates (europium chelates) or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, Lissamine, phycoerythrin and Texas Red are available. The fluorescent labels can be conjugated to the antibody using the techniques disclosed in \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology, \nsupra, for example. Fluorescence can be quantified using a fluorimeter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) Various enzyme-substrate labels are available and U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149 provides a review of some of these. The enzyme generally catalyzes a chemical alteration of the chromogenic substrate which can be measured using various techniques. For example, the enzyme may catalyze a color change in a substrate, which can be measured spectrophotometrically. Alternatively, the enzyme may alter the fluorescence or chemiluminescence of the substrate. Techniques for quantifying a change in fluorescence are described above. The chemiluminescent substrate becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light which can be measured (using a chemiluminometer, for example) or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor. Examples of enzymatic labels include luciferases (e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase; U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, malate dehydrogenase, urease, peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase (HRPO), alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases (e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), heterocyclic oxidases (such as uricase and xanthine oxidase), lactoperoxidase, microperoxidase, and the like. Techniques for conjugating enzymes to antibodies are described in O'Sullivan et al. (1981) Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme-Antibody Conjugates for use in Enzyme Immunoassay, in \nMethods in Enzym. \n(ed J. Langone & H. Van Vunakis), Academic press, New York 73:147-166.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of enzyme-substrate combinations include, for example:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) Horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) with hydrogen peroxidase as a substrate, wherein the hydrogen peroxidase oxidizes a dye precursor (e.g., orthophenylene diamine (OPD) or 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine hydrochloride (TMB));\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) alkaline phosphatase (AP) with para-Nitrophenyl phosphate as chromogenic substrate; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iii) β-D-galactosidase (β-D-Gal) with a chromogenic substrate (e.g., p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactosidase) or fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-galactosidase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous other enzyme-substrate combinations are available to those skilled in the art. For a general review of these, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,275,149 and 4,318,980.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSometimes, the label is indirectly conjugated with the antibody. The skilled artisan will be aware of various techniques for achieving this. For example, the antibody can be conjugated with biotin and any of the three broad categories of labels mentioned above can be conjugated with avidin, or vice versa. Biotin binds selectively to avidin and thus, the label can be conjugated with the antibody in this indirect manner. Alternatively, to achieve indirect conjugation of the label with the antibody, the antibody is conjugated with a small hapten (e.g., digoxin) and one of the different types of labels mentioned above is conjugated with an anti-hapten antibody (e.g., anti-digoxin antibody). Thus, indirect conjugation of the label with the antibody can be achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the invention, the antibody need not be labeled, and the presence thereof can be detected using a labeled antibody which binds to the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention may be employed in any known assay method, such as competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays. Zola, \nMonoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques, \npp. 147-158 (CRC Press, Inc. 1987).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive binding assays rely on the ability of a labeled standard to compete with the test sample analyze for binding with a limited amount of antibody. The amount of antigen in the test sample is inversely proportional to the amount of standard that becomes bound to the antibodies. To facilitate determining the amount of standard that becomes bound, the antibodies generally are insolubilized before or after the competition, so that the standard and analyze that are bound to the antibodies may conveniently be separated from the standard and analyze which remain unbound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSandwich assays involve the use of two antibodies, each capable of binding to a different immunogenic portion, or epitope, of the protein to be detected. In a sandwich assay, the test sample analyze is bound by a first antibody which is immobilized on a solid support, and thereafter a second antibody binds to the analyze, thus forming an insoluble three-part complex. See, e.g., U.S. Pat No. 4,376,110. The second antibody may itself be labeled with a detectable moiety (direct sandwich assays) or may be measured using an anti-immunoglobulin antibody that is labeled with a detectable moiety (indirect sandwich assay). For example, one type of sandwich assay is an ELISA assay, in which case the detectable moiety is an enzyme.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor immunohistochemistry, the tumor sample may be fresh or frozen or may be embedded in paraffin and fixed with a preservative such as formalin, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies may also be used for in vivo diagnostic assays. Generally, the antibody is labeled , with a radionuclide (such as \n111\nIn, \n99\nTc, \n14\nC, \n131\nI, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, \n32\nP or \n35\nS) or a dye so that the tumor can be localized using immunoscintiography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a method of detecting NRP1 in a biological sample (e.g., tissue, blood, sera, spinal fluid) or a prepared biological sample can comprise the step of contacting an antibody of this invention with the sample and observing the anti-NRP1 antibody bound to the NRP1 in the sample or determining the amount of the anti-NRP1 antibody bound to NRP1 in the sample. In another embodiment, a method of detecting NRP1 in a subject comprises the step of administering an antibody of this invention to the subject and observing the anti-NRP1 antibody bound to the NRP1 in the subject or determining the amount of the anti-NRP1 antibody bound to NRP1 in the subject (e.g., human, mouse, rabbit, rat, etc.).\n\n\n \nDiagnostic Kits\n\n\n \n \n \nAs a matter of convenience, the antibody of the present invention can be provided in a kit, i.e., a packaged combination of reagents in predetermined amounts with instructions for performing the diagnostic assay. Where the antibody is labeled with an enzyme, the kit will include substrates and cofactors required by the enzyme (e.g., a substrate precursor which provides the detectable chromophore or fluorophore). In addition, other additives may be included such as stabilizers, buffers (e.g., a block buffer or lysis buffer) and the like. The relative amounts of the various reagents may be varied widely to provide for concentrations in solution of the reagents which substantially optimize the sensitivity of the assay. Particularly, the reagents may be provided as dry powders, usually lyophilized, including excipients which on dissolution will provide a reagent solution having the appropriate concentration.\n\n\n \nArticles of Manufacture\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, and test tubes. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). The active agent in the composition is the antibody. The label on, or associated with, the container indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice. The article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts with instructions for use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are intended merely to illustrate the practice of the present invention and are not provided by way of limitation. The disclosures of all patent and scientific literatures cited herein are expressly incorporated in their entirety by reference.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nGeneration of Anti-NRP1 Antibodies\n\n\nA. Generation of Antibody Phage Libraries\n\n\n \n \n \nA variety of methods are known in the art for generating antibody libraries displayed on phage or displayed using other technologies. One of the advantages of these libraries, as compared to conventional hybridoma technologies, is that they are well suited for generating cross-species functional antibodies, because they allow in vitro selection and screening without the introduction of immune tolerance. Smith (1985) \nScience \n228:1315-1317; Bradbury and Marks (2004) \nJ Immunol Methods \n290:29-49.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, two types of combinatorial antibody libraries have been developed, distinguished by the source of repertoires. Most libraries to date are “natural” antibody libraries which use the natural repertoires as the source for its diversity, where the genes as message RNA of immune cells from naïve or immunized animals or human are amplified and cloned into vector for phage display or other display technology, such as ribosome or yeast display. The natural antibodies usually have multiple frameworks, which together with variable CDRs sequences and the recombination of light chain and heavy chain made up the diversity of the library. The size of the library determines the performance of the libraries since the repertoires are in general larger than the library size. The synthetic library, on the other hand, is a new branch of library where the diversity is designed and built into the library with synthetic DNA. Single or multiple frameworks have been used. For single framework library, the source of the diversity solely depends on the degeneracy of synthetic DNA designed to create the diverse CDR loops. Both the diversity design and the size of the libraries are critical for the library performance, which can be measured by the affinity of the antibodies found from the libraries. Knappik et al. (2000) \nJ Mol Biol \n296:57-86; Sheets et al. (1998) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95: 6157-6162; de Haard et al. (1999) \nJ Biol Chem \n274:18218-18230.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy introducing synthetic diversity at solvent-exposed positions within the variable heavy chain complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), Lee et al. developed a phage-displayed synthetic antibody library built on a single human framework (VL\nkappa I\n, VH\nsubgroup III \n). Sidhu et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n338:299-310; Lee et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n340:1073-1093; Carter et al. (1992) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n89:4285-4289. This “VH library” was displayed as a bivalent antigen-binding fragment (Fab′2) and used tailored codons to mimic the natural diversity observed in human immunoglobulin. Lee et al. (2004) \nJ Immunol Methods \n284:119-132. While the VH library has performed well as measured by the affinity and function of derived antibodies, further modifications in library design can be desirable in generating functional antibodies of certain antigen targets of interest. The recent availability of trinucleotides for oligonucleotide synthesis enabled the ability to increase amino acid diversity without increasing DNA diversity. A new “VH/VL library” was thus generated as described herein, wherein the highly variable positions in CDR-L3 were further diversified, since CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 form the inner sphere of the antigen-binding site. Mian et al. (1991) \nJ Mol Biol \n217:133-151.\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe VH/VL naïve library template with consensus CDR-L1, -L2, -L3, -H1 and -H2 was generated using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis on phagemid pV0350-4 with stop codons on CDR-H3 and displaying bivalently on the surfaces of M13 bacteriophage particles. Lee et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n340:1073-1093. Phage-displayed libraries were constructed using Kunkel mutagenesis method as described (Kunkel et al. (1991) \nMethods Enzymol \n204:125-139), with a mixture of mutagenic oligonucleotides designed to introduce mutations at the designed sites in CDR-L3, H1, H2 and H3 and repair CDR-H3 stop codons. The mutagenesis reactions (˜10 μg DNA) were electroporated into \nE. coli \nSS320 cells (˜10\n11 \ncells), as described (Sidhu et al. (2004)).\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe VH/VL library described here utilized the Herceptin® derived VL\nkappa I \nand VH\nsub group III \nframework as used for the VH library, which has been shown to display well on bacteriophage, express well in \nE. coli, \nand which can rapidly be converted to a full length IgG that expresses well in mammalian cells. Lee et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n340:1073-1093; Carter et al. (1992) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n89:4285-4289. The libraries were displayed on the phage surface as a bivalent Fab (Fab′2) by being fused to the phage coat protein P3. This bivalent display was intended to increase the apparent binding affinities to immobilized antigens and help to improve the recovery of rare or low-affinity phage antibody clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo avoid potential biases inherited from the Herceptin®-derived CDR sequences maintained in the light chain of the VH library, consensus kappa I CDR sequences were introduced into the template for the VH/VL library. Consensus CDR residues are determined by selecting the most prevalent amino acids existing in natural human antibodies. The stop codons, previously employed in the heavy chain of the VH library to ensure mutagenesis in all 3 CDRs, were similarly replaced with consensus subgroup III sequences for CDR-H1 and CDR-H2. The consensus CDR sequences represent the most prevalent amino acid in each position. CDR-H3 plays a dominant role in antigen recognition, thus several stop codons were placed in H3 to ensure functional antibody clones from the libraries were different from each other. Xu et al. (2000) \nImmunity \n13: 37-45. The presence of human consensus CDR sequences was expected to allow partially mutated variants (not all targeted CDRs are changed) to be displayed and to remain potentially functional in binding. In this way the VH/VL design has the advantage of increasing the ratio of functional phage antibody clones in the library. The CDR sequences used were SISSYL for CDR-L1 (positions 28-33), GASSRA for CDR-L2 (positions 50-55), YYSSPL for CDR-L3 (positions 91-96), FTFSSYAMS for CDR-H1 (positions 27-35), and RISPSGGSTY for CDR-H2 (positions 50-58), and WXXXRPXXMDY for CDR-H3 (positions 95-102, X is a stop codon) as shown in Table I. The prevalence of each position in human antibodies is also shown in Table I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiversity in the VH/VL library was introduced into a subset of CDR positions based on their high solvent exposure and/or especially high variability among natural antibody sequences. Positions chosen for mutagenesis and the diversity that was introduced are shown in Table II. For example, in CDR-H1, \n \n \n \n \n \n \nposition\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 were chosen to diversify. For the VH/VL library design, degenerate oligo codons or trinucletides were used to guide the diversity in each position so that the most prevalent amino acids would be represented. For example in CDR-H1 (position 30), serine represents about 50% of natural diversity, so a mixture of trinucletides (X1) that have ca. 52% serine and 2.5% of other amino acids except cysteine was used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDR-H3 and CDR-L3 form the center of the antigen-binding site and therefore show the highest frequency of antigen contacts in structurally known antibody-antigen complexes. Chothia et al. (1989) \nNature \n342:877-883. Five residues in CDR-L3 (Table II) with the highest variability were randomized Overall CDR-H3 is the most diverse in terms of length, sequence, and structure and is a key component of the diversity in natural antibodies. Xu and Davis (2000) \nImmunity \n13:37-45; Wu et al. (1993) \nProteins \n16:1-7. Thus 12 sub-libraries were constructed with different CDR-H3 lengths varying from 9 to 20 amino acids. Combined, these sub-libraries cover approximately 90% of CDR-H3 length variation in natural antibodies. Oligonucleotides encoding CDR-H3 were synthesized using trinucleotide codons. This enabled us to easily delete cysteine (rare in CDR-H3), and to boost levels of glycine, tyrosine and serine, the most abundant residues in CDR-H3. Mian et al. (1991) \nJ Mol Biol \n217:133-151. Codon X7, a trinucleotide mixture of about 15.6% each serine, tyrosine, and glycine, with 3.1% each of the remaining amino acids except cysteine, was used for each position in CDR-H3 (theoretical calculations for all trinucleotides mixture). Different combinations of trinucleotides were also used in selected positions of CDR-H1, H2, H3, and L3. As shown in Table II and Supplemental Table I, Codons X1 to X6 have a high percentage of serine, tyrosine, or glycine. X1 has 52.5% of serine, X2 has 52.5% tyrosine, X3 has 10% tyrosine, glycine or serine, X4 has 28.8% glycine, X5 has 19.2% tyrosine, glycine or serine, and X6 has 20% tyrosine or serine.

library template. Designed diversity is either a group of residues encoded by a tailored degenerate codon (italics) or 19 amino acids without cysteine encoded by mixtures of trinucleotides codon (bold text) so that the percentage of amino acid types encoded at each position was close to or higher than 50% of amino acid types found in the database. For particular positions, all 19 amino acids without cysteine are introduced using trinucleotides codon mixtures with different bias toward Tyr (Y), Gly (G) and Ser (S).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nB. Generation of Phage-Derived Monoclonal Anti-NRP1 Antibodies\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nLibrary sorting and screening to identify anti NRP1 antibodies—Human and murine NRP1 constructs (1-641aa) were cloned into mammalian expression vector, and expressed in CHO cells. Truncated form of NRP-1, a1a2 and b1b2 domains, were expressed in baculovirus. \nNUNC\n 96 well Maxisorp immunoplates were coated overnight at 4° with target antigen (10 ug/ml) and were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with phage blocking buffer PBST (PBS and 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20). The antibody phage libraries were added to antigen plates and incubated overnight at RT. The following day antigen-coated plates were washed 10 times with PBT (PBS with 0.05% T-20), and bound phage were eluted with 50 mM HCl and 500 mM NaCl for 30 minutes and neutralized with equal volume of 1M Tris base pH7.5. Recovered phage was amplified in \nE. coli \nXL-1 Blue cells. During the subsequent selection rounds, incubation of antibody phage with the antigen-coated plates was reduced to 2-3 hours, and the stringency of plate washing was gradually increased.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-NRP1 antibodies binding affinities, specificity and flow cytometry analysis—Phage antibody IC\n50 \nvalues were determined using competitive phage-binding ELISA as described. Lee et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n340:1073-1093. Competition curves were fit with a four-parameter non-linear regression curve-fitting program (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software) to determine the IC\n50 \nvalues which were calculated as the concentration of antigen in solution binding stage that inhibited 50% of the phage-displayed antibody from binding to immobilized antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClones of interest were then reformatted into IgGs by cloning V\nL \nand V\nH \nregion of individual clones into LPG3 and LPG4 vector respectively (Carter et al. (1992) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n89:4285-4289), transiently expressed in mammalian cells, and purified with protein A columns. For binding affinity determinations of anti-NRP1 IgGs, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) measurement with a BIAcore™-3000 instrument was used. Anti-NRP1 IgGs were coupled to activated CM5 biosensor chips to achieve approximately 500 response units (RU), followed by blocking un-reacted groups with 1M ethanolamine. For kinetic measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Neuropilin (0.7 to 500 nM) were injected in PBST buffer at 25° C. with a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor binding specificity tests, 10 μg/ml of IgGs in PBST buffer was incubated with 2 μg/ml antigen-coated 96-well Maxisorp plates for at least 1 hr, and the plates were washed with PBT buffer. Bound antibodies were detected with anti-human antibody HRP conjugates, developed with TMB substrate for approximately 5 minutes, quenched with 1M H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor flow cytometry analysis, HUVEC cells were detached from the tissue culture flasks with cell dissociation buffer. Dissociated cells were washed in PBS and re-suspended in PBS containing 2% Fetal Bovine Serum (FACS buffer). Cells were incubated with 10 ug/ml anti-NRP1 antibodies or control antibody (anti-IgE) in FACS buffer on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed twice in PBS, and stained in FACS buffer with PE-\nFab′\n2 goat anti-human IgG, Fc specific antibody on ice for 30 minutes. Following two PBS washes, the cells were re-suspended in 200 μl FACS buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS caliber, Benton Dickenson, Mountain View, Calif.) using Cell-Quest software.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe 12 VH/VL sub-libraries were individually panned against immobilized CHO cell expressed hNRP1 (a1a2b1b2)-Fc protein for the first round of selection. Eluted phages from each sub-library were amplified and then combined for second round of selection. Since hNRP1-Fc was used as the antigen, the pooled phage was pre-absorbed with excess irrelevant Fc fusion protein after the first round of panning to minimize the recovery of anti-Fc phage antibodies. After the fourth round of panning, 95 randomly picked phage clones were evaluated for the ability to specifically bind to NRP1. Ninety percent of clones were positive for hNRP1 binding and 40% of positive clones bound both human and murine NRP1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese phage clones were sequenced, and 10 unique clones were chosen for further characterization. All bound to both human and murine NRP1 with an IC\n50 \nbelow 70 nM in the phage ELISA. Clone YW64.3 bound human and murine NRP1 with an IC\n50 \nof 0.5 and 3.4 nM, respectively (Table III). Sequences from the 10 clones reflect the VH/VL library design with variable CDR-H3 lengths and varied changes distributed throughout CDR-H1, H2 and L3 yet some consensus CDR sequences from the library template are retained.

To select phage antibodies that bound to the b1b2 domain of NRP1 and potentially block the binding of VEGF, we initiated a new panning process using baculovirus expressed hNRP1 (b1b2)-His as an immobilized antigen. Following 4 rounds of selection, only one unique clone, YW107.4 was identified that bound both human and murine NRP1. YW107.4 bound to human and murine NRP1 with an IC\n50 \nof 6 and 38 nM in the Phage ELISA (Table III).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCharacterization of selected anti-NRP1 IgG—Selected anti-NRP1 clones from Table III were reformatted into full length human IgG1, expressed in CHO cells and purified for further characterization. The anti-NRP1 phage antibodies YW64.3 and YW107.4 bound specifically to human and murine NRP1 and did not bind to human or murine NRP-2, ErbB2-ECD or BSA. \nFIG. 1A\n. Each of the other eight-phage antibodies showed similar specificity. By surface plasmon resonance, immobilized YW64.3 and YW107.4 IgG did not interact with these antigens at concentrations up to 500 nM. However, both YW64.3 and YW107.4 bound human NRP1 with a Kd of 0.9 and 5 nM as well as murine NRP1 with a Kd of 7.8 and 11 nM, respectively. Although these antibodies were selected using plate-immobilized antigen, FACS analysis demonstrated all purified IgGs also bound to HUVEC cells which express hNRP1 endogenously (e.g. YW64.3 and YW107.4 shown in \nFIG. 1B\n).\n\n\n \n \nC. Affinity maturation of Anti-NRP1 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYW107.4 bound to the b1b2 domain of both human and murine NRP1 with a phage IC\n50 \nof 6 and 38 nM, respectively (Table III). To improve potency in vivo, this clone was affinity-matured using human NRP1-His.\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nTo generate the library template for affinity maturation of clone YW107.4, the GCN4 leucine zipper of the parental phagemid was first removed using Kunkel mutagenesis to provide a monovalent display Fab format. A stop codon was incorporated in CDR-L3. A soft randomization strategy was used for affinity maturation, which introduced the mutation rate of approximately 50% at the selected positions by the mutagenic DNA synthesizing with 70-10-10-10 mixtures of bases favoring the wild type nucleotides. Gallop et al. (1994) \nJ Med Chem \n37:1233-1251. Three different libraries with combinations of CDR loops, L1/L2/L3, L3/H1/H2 and L3/H3 randomization, were generated through soft randomizing selected residues at positions 28-32 of CDR-L1, 50 and 53-55 of CDR-L2, 91, 92, 93, 94 and 96 of CDR-L3, 28-35 of CDR-H1, 50-58 of CDR-H2, and 95-100 of CDR-H3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor selecting affinity-matured clones, phage libraries were subjected to plate sorting for the first round and followed by four rounds of solution phase sorting as described. Lee et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n340:1073-1093. At the first round of plate sorting, three libraries were added to hNRP1-coated plate separately for 1 hr at 37° C. After that, four rounds of solution phase sorting were performed to enhance the efficiency of affinity-based selection with increasing stringency as follow: round 2 (5 nM biotinylated hNRP1), round 3 (1 nM biotinylated hNRP1), round 4 (0.5 nM biotinylated hNRP1 and 250 nM non-biotinylated hNRP1 competitor at 37° C. for 1 hr) and round 5 (0.5 nM biotinylated hNRP1 and 500 nM non-biotinylated hNRP1 competitor at 37° C. for 3 hr). During the selection process, the reaction without biotinylated hNRP1 was included and served as background phage binding for calculating the enrichment of each round of panning.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter five rounds of panning, a high-throughput single-point competitive phage ELISA was used to rapidly screen for high-affinity clones as described. Sidhu et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n338:299-310. Clones with low ratio of the absorbance at 450 nm in the presence of 5 nM hNRP1 to that in the absence of hNRP1 were chosen for further characterization.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThree different CDR combinations, L1/L2/L3, L3/H1/H2 and L3/H3, were targeted for randomization using a ‘soft randomization’ strategy that maintains a wild-type sequence bias such that selected positions are mutated only 50 percent of the time. Gallop et al. (1994) \nJ Med Chem \n37:1233-1251. For affinity maturation, the monovalent Fab was displayed on phage rather than bi-valent Fab to reduce potential avidity during selection. Stop codons were introduced at CDR-L3 in each sub-library. Off-rate selection strategies (see Methods) were employed to improve the affinity of YW107.4, since it already possessed a relatively high association rate constant (2.2×10\n5\n), but the dissociation rate constant (1.1×10\n−3\n) was relatively fast (Table V).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the first round of selection, all 3 CDR soft-randomized libraries were panned against immobilized hNRP1 followed by subsequent rounds with a solution-phase sorting strategy to limit target concentration and enhance affinity-based selection. The concentration of biotinylated-hNRP1 was gradually reduced from 5 to 0.5 nM and a 500-fold excess of non-biotinylated hNRP1 was added to compete for fast off-rate binders. The mixture was also incubated at 37° C. for up to 2 hrs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe L1/L2/L3 library showed significant \nenrichment following round\n 5. Ninety-six clones were randomly picked, sequenced and then affinities ranked. Twenty-three unique phage clones were selected and purified for further characterization. Most clones had improved affinity for hNRP1 as determined by phage competition ELISA. Surprisingly, the affinity for mNRP1 was also improved despite being omitted from the selection process, suggesting that the clones bound to a conserved epitope. Selected clones had 4 to 7 changes in the 3 light chain CDRs; positions 28 and 30 in CDR-L1 tended to be substituted with Tyrosine and Histidine, respectively, whereas \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 92, 93, and 96 in CDR-L3 were more diverse (Table IV).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClones with the highest affinity for both human and murine NRP1 (YW107.4.18, YW107.4.38, YW107.4.52, YW107.4.63, YW107.4.76a and YW107.4.87) were reformatted and expressed as full-length antibodies. All 6 IgGs had improved affinity for hNRP1 and maintained complete blocking of VEGF-A binding. Affinities for human and murine NRP1 ranged from 0.4 to 1.8 nM (Table V). The dissociation rate constant of YW107.4.87 was improved leading to an overall improvement in affinity of about 10-fold for both human and murine NRP1; no binding was observed to human or murine NRP2 (\nFIG. 2A\n).

For the purpose of this application and in the following descriptions of anti-NRP1 antibody activities, “YW64.3” and “anti-NRP\nA\n” are used interchangeably; and “YW107.4.87” and “anti-NRP\nB\n” are used interchangeably.\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nCell Cultures\n\n\n \n \n \nHUVEC, HUAEC, and HMVECs were purchased from Cambrex and cultured in EGM-2 medium (Cambrex). Cells and tissue cultures are maintained at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2\n, 95% humidity incubator.\n\n\n \nDRG and Hippocampal Collapse Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nCollapse assays on axons from mouse E12.5 DRG were performed as described in He and Tessier-Lavigne (1997) \nCell \n90:739-751. Briefly, DRG explants were plated on laminin coated 8-chamber slides (Nunc) and cultured in N3-F12 medium with 50 ng/ml NGF overnight at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2\n, 95% humidity incubator. Human Semaphorin-3A (Met-1 to Val-771) was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRK5 with a C-terminal hexahistidine fusion tag. The protein was transiently expressed in CHO cells and purified by NiNTA affinity chromatography. N-terminal sequencing was used to confirm the protein visible as a 90 kDa band on a Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gel. Purified Sema3A was added at ˜8 ng/ml in the presence or absence of inhibitors, and explants were incubated at 37° C. for 30 min to induce collapse. For visualization, growth cones were fixed in 4% PFA and 15% sucrose, stained with rhodamin-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) at 1:40 in PBS for 30 min, and then washed and mounted with Fluoromount G (Fisher). To perform the hippocampal collapse assay, E17 mouse brains were dissected in chilled PBS and horizontally sectioned into 250 μm thick slices using a tissue chopper (Mcllwain). The dentate gyms was further subdissected from selected sections of hippocampus using fine tungsten needles. Explants were plated on laminin coated 8-chamber slides (Nunc) and cultured in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Gibco Life Technologies) overnight at 37° C. To induce collapse, explants were incubated with control or anti-NRP1 antibodies (10 μg/ml) in the presence of mock transfected or Sema3F transfected COS cell conditioned media for 30 minutes at 37° C.\n\n\n \nCell Migration Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nCell migration assays were performed using a modified Boyden chamber assay with the 8 μm pore size Falcon 24-multiwell insert system (BD Biosciences). The plates were pre-coated with 8 μg/ml Laminin (Invitrogen) for 16 hrs at 37° C. in both the upper and lower chambers. HUVECs (80-90% confluent) were harvested with trypsin, counted, centrifuged and resuspended in EBM-2 with 0.1% BSA at a concentration of 5×10\n5 \ncells/ml. 100 μl cells were added into the upper chamber of the transwell system. Inhibitors were added to the upper chamber with the cells immediately before addition of the stimuli to the lower chamber (10 ng/ml of VEGF in most cases), which contained 500 μl EBM-2 with 0.1% BSA. The plates were then placed at 37° C. overnight. To cease the assay, cells on the upper face of the membrane were removed using a sponge swab and cells on the lower face were fixed with methanol and stained with Cytox green (Molecular Probes). The number of migrated cells on the lower face of the membrane was counted using AxiPhot fluorescent microscope and the results were analyzed with the ImageJ program (NIH, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).\n\n\n \nBead Outgrowth Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nDextran-coated \nCytodex\n 3 microcarrier beads (Amersham Pharmacia) were incubated with subconfluent HUVECs at a concentration of 400 cells per bead in 1 ml of EGM-2 medium, for 4 hrs at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 incubator with gentle shake every 20 min. Beads were then transferred to a 25-cm\n2 \ntissue culture flask (BD Biosciences) and incubated in 5 ml of EGM-2 for 12-16 hrs at 37° C. HUVEC-coated beads were then washed three times with 1 ml EGM-2 and resuspended in 2.5 m/ml of fibrinogen (Sigma) in PBS at a density of 200 beads/ml. 0.5 ml of fibrinogen/bead solution was transferred into one well of a 24-well tissue culture plate containing 0.625 units thrombin (Sigma) to induce clotting. The fibrinogen/bead solution was incubated for 5 min at room temperature, then for 20 min at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 incubator. After the clotting was complete, lml of EGM-2 was added to each well and the clot was equilibrated for 30 min at 37° C. The medium was removed, and lml of skin fibroblast cells (Detroit 551) at a concentration of 2000/ml in EGM-2 medium were plated on the top of the clot. Different antibodies were then added to each well and the assay was monitored for 8 days with change in medium every 2-3 days. 10× resolution images of the beads were captured by an inverted microscope, and concentric circles spaced at 100, 200, and 300 μm were digitally drawn around the bead in each image. The number of vessels crossing each line was counted and the average was taken at each distance and condition.\n\n\n \nFACS Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nConfluent HUVECs were incubated with control or anti-NRP1 antibodies at 10 μg/ml for 5 min, 2 hrs or 20 hrs at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were harvested with enzyme free cell dissociation buffer (Gibco), neutralized with equal volume of FACS buffer (1×PBS, 2% FBS, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium azide) and transferred into Pro-bind U-bottom 96-well assay plates (Falcon) at 500,000 cells per well. Cell pellets were collected by centrifuged at 2 k rpm, and resuspended in 25 μl staining buffer (FACS buffer with 5% normal mouse serum, 2% normal rat serum and 10% 10 μg/ml human IgG) containing appropriate biotinylated antibody at 1:100, followed by a 2 hr incubation at 4° C. Antibodies were biotinylated using the FluoReporter mini-biotin-xx protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes). Cells were then washed twice with FACS buffer, and incubated in 25 μl FACS buffer containing 1:1000 streptavidin-PE (BD Biosciences) for 20 min at 4° C. Finally, cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer, and analyzed with the FacsCalibur system (BD Biosciences).\n\n\n \nCell Adhesion Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nSubconfluent HUVECs were pre-incubated in 100 μl Medium 199 with control or anti-NRP1 antibodies for 30 min at 37° C., then plated on NUNC maxisorp flat bottom 96-well plates (eBioscience) coated with 1 μg/ml Fibronectin (Roche) at 10,000 cells per well. Plates were centrifuged for 1 min at 140 g to synchronize contract of cells with substrate, and incubated at 37° C. for 30 min. Plates were then washed 3 times with PBS, frozen at −80° C. for two hours. Cell density was determined with the CyQuant kit (Molecular Probes).\n\n\n \nMouse Neonatal Retinal Vascular Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nNeonatal CD1 mice (same litters) were administered via i.p. with different antibodies at a concentration of 10 mg/kg. The injections were performed on \n \npostnatal day\n \n 1 and 3 for postnatal day 5 (P5) studies, and on \n \n \nday\n \n \n 1, 3 and 5 for P8 studies. Eyes were collected and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 16 hrs at 4° C., followed by PBS washes. The dissected retinas were block with 10% mouse serum in PBSt (PBS, 1% Triton X-100) for 3 hrs, then incubated overnight at 4° C. with biotinylated isolectin B4 (Bandeiraea simplicifolia; Sigma) 25 μg/ml in PBLEC (1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1 mM MnCl\n2\n, in PBS pH 6.8). Retinas were then washed 4 times in PBSt, and incubated with Alexa 488 streptavidin (1:200; Molecular Probes) overnight at 4° C. After staining was completed, retinas were washed 4 times in PBSt, post fixed with 4% PFA in PBS, followed by another 4 washes in PBS. Images of flat mounted retinas were captured by confocal fluorescence microscopy.\n\n\n \nMouse Skin Vessel Permeability Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n5-7 week C57BL6J female mice were injected with 150 μl 0.5% Evan's blue solution i.v. The areas of the back and flanks of the animals were shaved to remove hair below the neck and above the hip, and the shaved area was divided into 4 injection zones. One hour after the Evan's blue injection, 20 μl of PBS containing BSA (7.5 μg/ml) or hVEGF (7.5 μg/ml) with or without antibody (0.5 mg/ml) were injected i.d. randomly on any one of four zones, one injection for each zone. One hour after the i.d. injection, the animals were sacrificed and the skin containing the 4 zones was dissected out. A digital image of the skin was taken. A 8 mm skin biopsy punch was used to cut out skin samples of same area on the injection sites, and skin samples were incubated in formamide solution at 55° C. for 48 hrs to extract the Evan's blue dye from the tissues. The absorbance of the solution was then measured with a spectrometer at 605 nm\n\n\n \nCell Proliferation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nCell proliferation was analyzed with the Cell Proliferation ELISA kit (Roche). Briefly, 90% confluent HUVECs were harvested and resuspended in assay media (DMEM:F12 50:50, 1.5% FBS), and plated at 3,000 cells per well into black 96-well tissue culture plate (ViewPlate-96, Perkin Elmer) pre-coated with 1% gelatin. Cells were incubated at 37° C. for 16 hrs, changed into fresh assay media and incubated for another 8 hrs. VEGF (20 ng/ml) and different antibodies were added to the culture and the cells were incubated for 20 hrs. BrdU labeling solution was added to a final concentration of 10 mM and the cells were incubated for another 24 hrs at 37° C. BrdU incorporation was determined by chemiluminescence immunoassay.\n\n\n \nVEGFR2 Phosphorylation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal VEGFR2 and phospho-VEGFR2 were determined with DuoSet IC ELISA kits (R&D). Briefly, subconfluent HUVECs were rinsed with PBS and lysed in the provided lysis buffer. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14 kg for 5 min at 4° C., and supernatants were transferred to clean tubes. ELISA assays were then carried out as directed.\n\n\n \nImmunoblotting\n\n\n \n \n \nConfluent HUVECs were starved for 16 hrs in EBM-2 with 0.2% FBS and 0.1% BSA, and then changed into EMB-2 with 0.1% BSA, followed by a 90 min incubation at 37° C. Control and anti-NRP1 antibodies were added at 50 μg/ml, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37° C. Cells were stimulated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) for 10 min at 37° C., washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I and II (Sigma) and complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). Aliquots of lysate were subjected to electrophoresis in 4-20% Novex Tris-Glycine SDS gels (Invitrogen), followed by electrotransfer to Invitrolon PVDF membrane (Invitrogen). The primary antibodies used in this study were anti-Erk, anti-phospho-Erk, anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt, anti-p38, anti-phospho-p38, anti-Src and anti-phospho-Src (Tyr416), all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\nA.

It has been previously suggested that Sema3A and VEGF\n165 \nmay share overlapping binding domains in the N-terminal region of the b1 domain, and thus may compete for binding to NRP1. Gu et al. (2002) \nJ Biol Chem \n277:18069-18076; Miao et al. (1999) \nJ Cell Biol \n146:233-242. Therefore, it seemed possible that a single anti-NRP1 mAb would block both Sema3A and VEGF binding. Anti-NRP1 mAbs of this invention were tested for their abilities to block Sema3A-induced axon growth cone collapse. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were dissected from mouse E12.5 embryos and cultured to establish sensory neuron growth cones that were responsive to Sema3A/NRP1-dependent collapse. He and Tessier-Lavigne (1997) \nCell \n90:739-751. Adding Sema3A to these cultures caused growth cones to retract their actin rich structures. However, if anti-NRP1 \nA \nwas added to the wells at the same time as Sema3A, collapse was completely blocked. In contrast, anti-NRP1 \nB \nhad no effect on Sema3A-induced collapse (\nFIG. 5A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese two antibodies thus have functionally distinct actions: anti-NRP1 \nA \nblocks Sema3A function but does not interfere with VEGF binding to NRP1; whereas anti-NRP1 \nB \nblocks VEGF binding to NRP1 without effect on Sema3A function. Further studies showed that neither antibody blocks Sema3F/NRP2-dependent collapse of E17 hippocampal growth cones (\nFIG. 5B\n), consistent with the observation that neither antibody binds NRP2. The antibodies thus provide selective tools to dissect the role of NRP1 in vascular biology, and means for selectively blocking NRP1 activities.\n\n\n \nB. Both Anti-NRP1\nA \nand Anti-NRP1\nB \nReduce VEGF\n165\n-Dependent Endothelial Cell Migration and Bead Outgrowth\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-NRP1 mAbs of the invention were tested in VEGF-driven endothelial cell (EC) migration. Using a transwell system, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were introduced into the top chamber, while VEGF was added to the bottom chamber to promote EC migration. ECs that had migrated to the bottom chamber were then fixed, stained, and quantified (\nFIG. 6A\n). Anti-VEGF antibodies were used as a positive control to block VEGF-driven EC migration in this and subsequent experiments (a cross-species reactive anti-VEGF antibody, B20.4.1, was used in all experiments unless stated otherwise; Liang et al. (2006) \nJ Biol Chem \n281:951-961.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-NRP1 mAbs were added to cells in the top chamber just prior to the addition of VEGF. Interestingly, both anti-NRP1\nA \nand anti-NRP1\nB \nsignificantly reduced endothelial cell migration, with anti-NRP1\nB \nproviding a stronger block of migration (\nFIG. 6A\n). Similar results were obtained using two other types of EC lines, HUAECs and HAECs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further dissect the role of NRP1 and anti-NRP1 mAbs in more complex EC functions, an in vitro system of angiogenic sprouting was employed. Nakatsu et al. (2003) \nMicrovasc Res \n66:102-112. In this assay, ECs coated on beads sprout over a seven days period, resulting in multiple well-defined vessel structures protruding from each bead. Adding either anti-NRP1 mAbs to these cultures resulted in a reduction in vessel length, and in the case of anti-NRP1\nB \na decrease in the number of sprouts was also observed. This observation was confirmed by quantification (\nFIG. 6B\n). Anti-VEGF was used as a positive control and completely blocked sprouting in this assay. The results confirmed strong effects for each anti-NRP1 mAb in reducing EC migration and outgrowth of vessels in this in vitro assay.\n\n\n \nC. NRP1 is Necessary for Vascular Remodeling in the Mouse Retina\n\n\n \n \n \nPhenotypes observed in the Nrp1 knock-out mice are consistent with a defect in vascular remodeling. Gu et al. (2003) \nDev Cell \n5:45-57; Kawasaki et al. (1999) \nDevelopment \n126:895-4902; Takashima et al. (2002) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n99:3657-3662. Next, the role of NRP1 in vascular remodeling was tested by analyzing the effects of systemic treatment with the anti-NRP1 mAbs on the developing mouse retina, which is an ideal model to investigate the stereotyped events of vascular sprouting, remodeling, and maturation. Dorrell and Friedlander (2006) \nProg Retin Eye Res \n25:277-95. At birth, an astrocytic network is in place to guide ECs sprouting from central retinal artery located near the optic nerve head (ONH). After one day of postnatal life (P1) the retinal vasculature has developed a morphogenic furrow in the nerve fiber layer (NFL), lying superficial to the ganglion cell layer, that begins to extend toward the edge of the retina in a concentric pattern, reaching halfway by P5 (\nFIG. 7A\n). Over the next three days the furrow continues to extend to the edge of the retina, while the vascular plexus closest to the ONH undergoes stereotyped remodeling, consisting of thinning of the vascular plexus into a refined capillary network in the NFL (\nFIG. 7B\n), and sprouting of vessels into deeper layers of the retina (\nFIG. 7C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies were injected into neonatal mice beginning at P1, followed by injections every other day until retinas were collected at P5 and P8. To visualize the vasculature, retinas were stained with isolectin B4 and compared. While the refined capillary network of the IgG control group is well established between P5 and P8, this vascular remodeling is completely inhibited by both anti-NRP1 mAbs. This difference was quantified by comparing the vascular density from representative images taken of the NFL vascular network in regions adjacent to the ONH (\nFIG. 7D\n). Because treatment with either anti-NRP1 mAb results in a strong inhibition of vascular remodeling, vascular density is significantly higher in both anti-NRP1 \nA \nand anti-NRP1 \nB \ntreated retinas as compared to controls. Interestingly, the developmental furrow continues to extend in both anti-NRP1 mAb treated retinas, with only a slight inhibition of extension in the anti-NRP1 \nB \ntreated animals (\nFIG. 7E\n). This suggests that development of the retina is not generally inhibited, but that there is instead a specific block in vascular remodeling when treating with either anti-NRP1 mAb.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast to the anti-NRP1 mAbs, anti-VEGF treatment resulted in a reduction of retinal vascular density as compared to control (\nFIG. 7D\n). At a qualitative level, vessels in anti-VEGF treated retinas have a reduced complexity at P8, a trend that is present but less obvious at P5. These data suggest that anti-VEGF treatment results in either block of initial sprouting and/or vascular regression. Interestingly, systemic delivery of anti-VEGF does not significantly reduce the extension of the vascular furrow (\nFIG. 7E\n). This is likely a consequence of poor antibody diffusion to the extending tip cells due to the lack of vessel lumens in this outer region. Gerhardt et al. (2003) \nJ Cell Biol \n161:1163-1177.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEvaluating P8 retinas also allowed further investigation of the effects of antibody treatment on angiogenic sprouting. Between P5 and P8, vessels begin to sprout from the NFL vascular network into deeper vascular layers resulting in the formation of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) vascular network, which is superficial to the outer nuclear layer and is the deepest vascular bed in the retina (\nFIG. 7C\n). Later in development, sprouting from collaterals that gave rise to the OPL results in an intermediate vascular bead, termed the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Images taken from the OPL at P8 show a complete inhibition of sprouting by both anti-NRP1 mAbs, and by anti-VEGF treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe different phenotypes observed in retinas taken from animals systemically treated with either anti-NRP1 \nA \nor anti-NRP1 \nB\n, as compared to anti-VEGF, suggest that NRP1 may regulate EC function by mechanisms other than enhancing VEGFR2 signaling.\n\n\n \nD. Blocking NRP1 Function has Little Effect on VEGFR2 Signaling\n\n\n \n \n \nHaving observed that NRP1 is required for endothelial cell migration in response to VEGF, we investigated the requirement of NRP1 in EC proliferation and vascular permeability—two defining cellular activities induced by VEGF. Remarkably, treatment with either anti-NRP1 \nA \nor anti-NRP1\nB \nhad no effect on VEGF-induced permeability, whereas anti-VEGF provided a strong block (\nFIG. 8A\n). A similar trend was observed when testing for VEGF-induced EC proliferation, with anti-NRP1 \nA \nshowing no block of proliferation, and anti-NRP1\nB \nonly a slight dose-responsive reduction (\nFIG. 8B\n). These results support previously published data showing that siRNA knockdown of NRP1 in ECs does not effect proliferation induced by VEGF (Murga et al. (2005) \nBlood \n105:1992-1999), and suggests that NRP1's primary role in VEGF-driven EC behaviors is to mediate cell migration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of anti-NRP1 antibodies on VEGFR2 signaling was studied. VEGF binds to the second and third extracellular IgG domains of VEGFR2, and activates the receptor by triggering auto-phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain. In contrast to anti-VEGF, which completely blocked VEGFR2 phosphorylation induced by VEGF in HUVECs, anti-NRP1 \nA \ndid not significantly change VEGFR2 phosphorylation levels, whereas anti-NRP1\nB \nresulted in only a modest reduction (\nFIG. 8C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRather than regulating VEGFR2 phosphorylation level directly, NRP1 may act to modulate specific VEGFR2 pathways. To address this possibility, the effect of anti-NRP1 treatment on downstream signaling events mediated by VEGFR2 was examined. VEGFR2 has been shown to induce EC proliferation through activation of the mitogen activated protein kinases Erk1/2 (Rousseau et al. (1997) \nOncogene \n15:2169-2177; Takahashi et al. Shibuya (1999) \nOncogene \n18:2221-2230), and to regulate EC survival and vascular permeability through the PI3-Kinase/Akt pathway. Chen et al. (2005) \nNat Med \n11:1188-1196; Gerber et al. (1998) \nJ Biol Chem \n273:13313-13316; Six et al. (2002) \nFEBS Lett \n532:67-69. Consistent with the observation that anti-NRP1 mAb treatments did not significantly change VEGF-induced EC proliferation or vascular permeability, anti-NRP1 \nA \nand anti-NRP1\nB \nincubation did not affect VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 or Akt. On the other hand, inhibiting NRP1 function with anti-NRP1 antibodies strongly reduced EC migration. It is possible that NRP1 specifically regulates VEGFR2 pathways required for cell motility, such as the p38 MAP kinase pathway, which has been shown to be required for VEGF-driven actin reorganization and cell migration in ECs. Rousseau et al. (1997) \nOncogene \n15:2169-2177. Anti-NRP1 \nA \nand anti-NRP1\nB \ntreatments both led to a slight reduction in p38 phosphorylation level in HUVECs (\nFIG. 8D\n), lending support to this hypothesis. However, the mild decrease in p38 phosphorylation alone is unlikely to account for the strong reduction we observed in the migration and sprouting assays as described in previous sections (\nFIG. 6\n), or explain the qualitatively different phenotypes observed between the anti-NRP1 mAbs and anti-VEGF mAb treatments in the retinal vascular remodeling experiments (\nFIG. 7\n).\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nTumor Inhibitory Activities of Anti-NRP1 Antibodies\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe human cell lines, H1299 and SK-MES-1 non-small-cell lung carcinomas were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, Md.). For SK-MES-1, each HRLN female nude mouse received a 1 mm\n3 \ntumor fragment s.c. implant in the flank. For H1299, 1×10\n7 \ntumor cells were injected s.c. in the flank of HRLN female nude mice. Tumor growth was monitored twice weekly by caliper measurements. When tumors reach an average size of 80-120 mm\n3\n, mice were sorted to give nearly identical group mean tumor sizes, and treatment was started. This was considered \nday\n 1 of each study. All treatments were body-weight adjusted at 0.2 ml/20 g. Tumor volume (mm\n3\n)=width\n2\n×length/2. Percent tumor growth inhibition (% TGI)=(median tumor volume of the control arm−median tumor volume of the treatment arm/median tumor volume of the control arm)×100.% TGI is only measured as long as all animals remain on they study (for SK-MES-1=\nday\n 22; for H1299=day 15). Time to endpoint (TTE)=log\n10 \n(endpoint volume, mm\n3\n)−b/m; were b is the intercept and m is the slope of the line obtained by linear regression of the log-transformed tumor growth data. Percent tumor growth delay (% TGD)=(median TTE for a treatment arm−median TTE for the control arm/median TTE for the control arm)×100.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice were anesthetized with Avertin (1.3% tribromoethanol and 0.8% amyl alcohol; Sigma-Aldrich). FITC-labeled Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (150 μg in 150 μl of 0.9% NaCl; Vector Laboratories) was injected i.v. 3 minutes before systemic perfusion. The vasculature was perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 2 to 3 min. Tumors were removed and post-fixed by immersion in the same fixative for 16 hrs, followed by an incubation in 30% sucrose overnight for cryoprotection, then embedded in OCT and frozen. Sections (30 μm) were cut and mounted onto glass slides, rehydrated and blocked in PBSt (PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100) with 5% normal goat serum for 2 hrs at room temperature. The sections were incubated overnight with anti-NRP1 \nB \n(1:500) or rat anti-mouse PDGFRβ (1:1000; clone APBS, eBioscience) at 4° C. Sections were then washed 4 times in PBSt, and incubated with secondary antibodies, Alexa 488 goat anti-human IgG and Alexa 568 goat anti-rat IgG (1:200; Molecular Probes), for 4 hrs at room temperature. After staining was completed, sections were washed 4 times in PBSt, post fixed with 4% PFA in PBS, followed by another 4 washes in PBS. The final wash solution was removed, and 1-2 drops of Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) were added. Glass coverslips were placed over samples, and images were captured with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nBlocking the VEGF pathway has been proven to reduce neovascularization in mouse tumor models and in human cancers. Ferrara and Kerbel (2005) \nNature \n438:967-974. However, it is believed that some tumors are less dependent on VEGF for vessel formation, or may become insensitive to anti-VEGF therapies. Jain et al. (2006) \nNat Clin Pract Oncol \n3:24-40; Kerbel et al. (2001) \nCancer Metastasis Rev \n20:79-86. To determine if NRP1 blockade could enhance the tumor growth inhibition provided by blocking VEGF, we selected several xenograft models known to exhibit varying sensitivity to anti-VEGF therapy. Since mouse stromal VEGF, in addition to tumor derived VEGF, has been shown to impact tumor growth, we used anti-VEGF mAbs that recognize both murine and human VEGF. Liang et al. (2006) \nJ Biol Chem \n281:951-961.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese experiments were designed to test the effect of blocking NRP1 alone and in combination with anti-VEGF. Also included were single agent anti-VEGF and isotype control antibody. SK-MES-1 is a NSCLC xenograft model that expresses NRP1 primarily in vascular and stromal tissue, with an intermediate level of expression in tumor cells. In this model, anti-VEGF provided a 52% tumor growth inhibition (TGI), single agent anti-NRP1\nB \ncaused a 37% TGI, and anti-NRP1 \nA \nhad no significant effect on TGI (\nFIG. 9A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStrikingly, the additive effect was observed when either anti-NRP1 antibody was used in combination with anti-VEGF. As depicted in \nFIG. 10A\n, anti-NRP1 \nA \nused in combination with anti-VEGF increased the TGI from about 52% to about 70%; and anti-NRP1\nB \nused in combination with anti-VEGF increased the TGI to about 77% (\nFIG. 9A\n). Similar results were obtained in the H1299 NSCLC xenograft model, which also expresses NRP1 in vascular and stromal tissue at high levels, but in tumor cells to a lesser extent. Single agent anti-NRP1\nB \nshowed 39% TGI, anti-VEGF showed 28% TGI, and the combination showed 51% TGI (\nFIG. 9C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimals in the SK-MES-1 model were dosed to \nday\n 35 and followed to \nday\n 60 to examine the delay in tumor growth (animals were removed from the study when tumor sizes exceeded 1500 mm\n3\n; no animals were removed as a result of toxicity). The Kaplan-Meier plot shows a significant effect of both anti-NRP1 mAb combination arms in delaying tumor growth as compared to single agent arms (\nFIG. 9B\n). Measurements of tumor growth delay (TGD) show no single agent delay for anti-NRP1 \nA\n; 24% TGD for anti-NRP1 \nB\n; 60% TGD for anti-VEGF; 93% TGD for anti-NRP1 \nA\n+anti-VEGF combination arm; and 96% for anti-NRP1\nB\n+anti-VEGF combination arm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar results to those seen in the NSCLC models were also observed in a murine model of breast cancer, termed founder 5 (Fo5), in which tumors generated by MMTV-Her2 transgenic expression were dissected and implanted in nude mice. Finkle et al. (2004) \nClin Cancer Res \n10:2499-2511. In this model, NRP1 is primarily expressed on vessels and adjacent stroma, and anti-VEGF is again only partially effective at reducing tumor growth (\nFIG. 9C\n). Growth inhibition was similar to that seen in the NSCLC models, however to focus on the histological changes in the context of anti-NRP1 and anti-VEGF treatment, animals were harvested on the same day early in the experiment (dashed line; \nFIG. 9C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the Fo5 model for vascular histology studies, we observed that control tumors showed very large unorganized vessels that generally lack pericyte coverage as determined by PDGFR-β immunohistochemistry. Treatment with anti-VEGF alone resulted in a decrease in vessel diameter and a general reduction in vascular density. In addition, most, if not all vessels that remained in anti-VEGF treated tumors showed close association of pericytes. Similar results were observed with other pericyte markers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVessels from tumors treated with either anti-NRP1 mAb alone appear similar in morphology to anti-NRP1 treated vessels in neonatal mouse retinas, with vessels appearing flat and unorganized, maintaining a plexus-like appearance. On the other hand, similar to control treated tumor vessels, tumors treated with either anti-NRP1 mAb also lack significant pericyte coverage. Most interestingly, tumors that were treated with anti-VEGF and either anti-NRP1 \nA \nor anti-NRP1 \nB\n, showed a combined phenotype, with vessel reduction similar to anti-VEGF treated tumors, but with remaining vessels appearing less refined and lacking close pericyte association.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese morphological observations are correlated with the quantified changes in vascular desensity. As shown in \nFIG. 10\n, treatment with both anti-NRP1 antibodies and anti-VEGF decreased vascular density (10A). On the other hand, only anti-VEGF seems to increase perictye staining in tumor samples tested, as compared to control. Overall, pericyte/vascular ratio measuring relative pericyte coverage shows that anti-VEGF treated tumors had the highest ratio, which is decreased by anti-NRP1\nA \nand anti-NRP1 \nB \ntreatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe findings that anti-NRP1 (anti-NRP1 \nA \nand anti-NRP1\nB\n) and anti-VEGF may be acting by blocking different EC functions and/or signaling pathways raised the possibility that combining these antibodies in tumor models could have an additive or synergistic effect in reducing tumor growth. Indeed, a profound additive effect was observed when combining anti-NRP1 with anti-VEGF (\nFIG. 9\n). Especially in the case of \nanti-NRP\n 1 \nA\n, the results suggest a synergistic, rather than additive effect, since in multiple tumor models the mean tumor volume following single agent anti-NRP1\nA \ntreatment was not different from control, but the antibody significantly enhanced tumor response when combined with anti-VEGF, compared to anti-VEGF treatment alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of anti-NRP1\nB\n, single agent treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth. Interestingly, these effects are only slightly less potent than anti-VEGF alone. However, the reduction in tumor growth from the combination arms for anti-NRP1 \nB \nwas similar to the anti-NRP1 \nA \ncombination arms. The single agent effect of anti-NRP1\nB \nmay be due to its relatively stronger inhibitory activity in reducing sprouting and in vivo angiogenesis, compared to anti-NRP1\nA\n. On the other hand, both antibodies were equally potent in blocking vascular remodeling in the mouse retinal development assay and inhibiting pericyte association with vessels in the Fo5 tumor model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been proposed that vascular remodeling in the retina takes place in the absence of close pericyte associations, suggesting that pericytes serve to stabilize immature blood vessels ending the plasticity period of vessel remodeling. Benjamin et al. (1998) \nDevelopment \n125:1591-1598. Findings of this invention suggest that NRP1 is required for this intricate process of vessel remodeling, consisting of the morphogenesis of the vascular plexus into fine capillaries, followed by further maturation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe idea of pericytes stabilizing tumor vessels, thus giving rise to anti-VEGF therapy resistance as a consequence of vessels losing their VEGF-dependence, has been proposed and tested experimentally. Bergers et al. (2003) \nJ Clin Invest \n111:1287-1295; Erber et al. (2004) \nFaseb J \n18:338-340. In these studies, it was observed that blocking both the function of VEGF (EC ligand) and PDGF (pericyte ligand) results in further disruption of tumor vasculature. Subsequently, it has been shown in imaging studies that blocking VEGF function alone in tumors results in a significant amount of vascular regression, but the remaining vessels become “normalized” with close pericyte associations, possibly a consequence of immature vessels undergoing vascular remodeling and maturation. Inai et al. (2004) \nAm J Pathol \n165:35-52.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the observations obtained in the developing retina, it can be postulated that blocking NRP1 function in tumors would also reduce vascular remodeling of tumor vessels, subsequently inhibiting vessel maturation, therefore keeping vessels in a state of VEGF-dependence. This alone may not have a significant effect on reducing tumor growth, as most tumor vessels are already inherently disorganized. Baluk et al. (2005) \nCurr Opin Genet Dev \n15:102-111. This prediction is consistent with the observation that, although anti-NRP1 \nA \nstrongly inhibits vascular remodeling, we do not see a single agent effect with this antibody in reducing tumor growth. However, it was speculated that blocking vascular remodeling, and the subsequent maturation, in combination with anti-VEGF therapy may render the remaining tumor vessels more susceptible to regression. The experiments of the present invention showed that vessels remaining in tumors treated with either anti-NRP1 mAb in combination with anti-VEGF indeed lack pericyte association. These results suggest that the additive effect we observe in blocking both NRP1 and VEGF function may arise as a consequence of rendering remaining vessels in anti-VEGF treated tumors more vulnerable to regression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the results obtained in developing retina and xenograft tumor models, it is postulated that blocking NRP1 function in newly formed vessels inhibits vessels from undergoing remodeling and subsequent maturation, thus rendering these vessels more dependent on VEGF for survival (see the model in \nFIG. 11A\n). Consistent with this model, we observed a significant decrease in vascular density of the developing retina in neonate mice treated with both anti-NRP1 \nB \nand anti-VEGF at half the dose of single agent alone (single dose=10 mg/kg, combination dose=5 mg/kg of each antibody). See \nFIG. 11B\n, as compared to \nFIG. 7D\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, it is possible that NRP1 may also be required not only for endothelial but also pericyte function. It has recently been reported that bFGF induces upregulation of NRP1 on smooth muscle cells, resulting in the ability of VEGF to induce smooth muscle cell migration. Liu et al. (2005) \nCytokine \n32:206-212. In the present experiment, expression of NRP1 was seen on human smooth muscle cells, as well as on pericytes in various murine and human tumors (for example, expression of NRP1 extends to areas adjacent to lectin positive stain in the Fo5 model).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn conclusion, the experiments described herein demonstrate that blocking NRP1 and VEGF function in tumor models results in an additive effect in reducing tumor growth. Also presented are evidences that NRP1 may also be acting through mechanisms other than VEGFR2 signaling."
