Description\n\n\n\n\n U 2011/020836 \n\n\nAURORA KINASE COMPOUNDS AND METHODS OF THEIR USE RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n (0001 ] This application claims priority to U .S. provisional application no. \n\n\n 61/294,413 filed January 1 , 2010, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference. \n\n\nFIELD \n\n\n [0002] Provided herein are compounds that are modulators of Aurora kinases, compositions comprising the compounds and methods of use thereof. The \n\n\ncompounds provided are useful in the treatment, prevention, and/or amelioration of a disease or disorder related to Aurora kinase activity or one or more symptoms \n\n\nassociated with such diseases or disorders. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and methods of treating cancer are also provided. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n [0003] Members of the Aurora-kinase family are key mitiotic regulators \n\n\nrequired for genome stability. Furthermore, the Aurora kinases have been reported to be over-expressed in a wide range of human tumors. Elevated expression of Aurora- A and Aurora-B has been detected in cancers of breast, including invasive duct \n\n\nadenocarcinomas of the breast, lung, colon, prostate, pancreas, liver, skin, stomach, rectum, oesophagus, endrometrium, cervix, bladder, ovary and thyroid, see, Keen et ai, Nature, Cancer Reviews, vol. 4, 927-936 (2004). High levels of Aurora-A have also been reported in renal, neuroblastoma, melanoma and lymphoma rumor cell lines. Amplification/over-expression of Aurora-A is observed in human bladder cancers, and amplification of Aurora-A is associated with aneuploidy and aggressive clinical behavior. Moreover, amplification of the Aurora-A locus (20q l3) correlates with poor prognosis for patients with node-negative breast cancer. In addition, an allelic variant, isoleucine at amino acid position 31 , is reported to be a low-penetrance \n\n\ntumor-susceptibility gene. This variant displays greater transforming potential than the phenylalanine-31 variant and is associated with increased risk for advanced and metastatic disease. Aurora-B is also highly expressed in multiple human tumor cell lines, including leukemic cells. Levels of Aurora-B increase as a function of Duke's stage in primary colorectal cancers. Aurora-C, which is normally only found in germ cells, is also over-expressed in a high percentage of primary colorectal cancers and in a variety of tumor cell lines, including cervical adenocarinoma and breast carcinoma cells. \n\n [0004] Research todate supports the hypothesis that in vitro an inhibitor of\n\n\nAurora kinase activity would disrupt mitosis causing cell cycle defects and eventual cell death. Therefore, without being bound to any theory, in vivo, an Aurora kinase inhibitor slows tumor growth and induce regression. For example, Hauf et al. \n\n\ndescribe an Aurora B inhibitor, Hesperadin, that causes defects in chromosomal segregation and a block in cytokinesis, thereby resulting in polyploidy [Hauf, S et al. JCB 161(2), 281-294 (2003)]. Ditchfield et al. have described an equipotent inhibitor of Aurora A and B (ZM447439) that causes defects in chromosome alignment, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, Ditchfield, C. et al., JCB 161(2), 267-280 (2003). Furthermore, the authors show that proliferating cells, but not cell-cycle arrested cells, are sensitive to the inhibitor. Efficacy of a potent Aurora A and B inhibitor in mouse and rat xenograft models was recently reported, see, Harrington, E. A. et al., Nature Medicine 10(3), 262-267, (2004). These results demonstrate that inhibition of Aurora kinases can provide a therapeutic window for the treatment of proliferative disorders such as cancer (see Nature, Cancer Reviews, Vol. 4, p927-936, December 2004, for a review by N. Keen and S. Taylor, which outlines the therapeutic potential of Aurora kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer). Certain Aurora kinase inhibitor compounds are disclosed in US patent no. 7,442,700 and US publication no. 2006/0084650A1. \n\n\n [0005] There is a continuing need for compounds that inhibit the activity of\n\n\nAurora kinases; for compounds that are selective at Aurora kinases or compounds that modulate Aurora kinase activity. \n\n\nSUMMARY \n\n\n [0006] Provided herein are compounds of formula (I).

Atoms \n\n\ncontaining their natural isotopic composition may also be referred to herein as \"non- enriched\" atoms. Unless otherwise designated, the atoms of the compounds recited herein are meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. For example, unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as \"H\" or \"hydrogen\", the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural isotopic composition. \n\n\n|0051] As used herein, \"isotopically enriched\" refers to an atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. \n\n\n\"Isotopically enriched\" may also refer to a compound containing at least one atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. \n\n\n [0052] As used herein, \"isotopic enrichment\" refers to the percentage of \n\n\nincorporation of an amount of a specific isotope at a given atom in a molecule in the \n\n place of that atom's natural isotopic abundance. For example, deuterium enrichment of 1% at a given position means that 1% of the molecules in a given sample contain deuterium at the specified position. Because the naturally occurring distribution of deuterium is about 0.0156%, deuterium enrichment at any position in a compound synthesized using non-enriched starting materials is about 0.0156%.

In certain embodiment, compounds provided herein have IC50 of about 30- 100 nM in BrdU assay. \n\n\n[00384] Also provided herein are isotopically enriched analogs of the compounds provided herein. Isotopic enrichment (for example, deuteration) of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (\"P \"), pharmacodynamics (\"PD\"), and toxicity profiles, has been demonstrated previously with some classes of drugs. See, for example, Lijinsky et. al. , Food Cosmet. Toxicol. , 20: 393 ( 1982); Lijinsky et. al. , J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 69: 1 127 (1982); Mangold et. al, Mutation Res. 308: 33 (1994); Gordon et. al. , Drug Metab. Dispos., 15: 589 (1987); Zello et. al, \n\n\nMetabolism, 43 : 487 (1994); Gately et. al. , J. Nucl. Med, 27: 388 ( 1986); Wade D, Chem. Biol. Interact. 1 17: 191 ( 1999). \n\n\n [00385] Isotopic enrichment of a drug can be used, for example, to (1 ) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (2) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (3) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (4) decrease the amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect. (5) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed, and/or (6) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not. \n\n\n|00386] Replacement of an atom for one of its isotopes often will result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"KIE\"). For example, if a C-H bond is broken during a rate- determining step in a chemical reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"DKIE\"). (See, e.g, Foster et al , Adv. Drug Res., vol. 14, pp. 1 -36 ( 1985); Kushner et al , Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., vol. 77, pp. 79- 88 ( 1999)). \n\n [00387] Tritium (\"T\") is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used in research, fusion reactors, neutron generators and radiopharmaceuticals. Tritium is a hydrogen atom that has 2 neutrons in the nucleus and has an atomic weight close to 3. It occurs naturally in the environment in very low concentrations, most commonly found as\n\n\nT2O. Tritium decays slowly (half-life = 12.3 years) and emits a low energy beta particle that cannot penetrate the outer layer of human skin. Internal exposure is the main hazard associated with this isotope, yet it must be ingested in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. As compared with deuterium, a lesser amount of tritium must be consumed before it reaches a hazardous level. Substitution of tritium (\"T\") for hydrogen results in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects. Similarly, substitution of isotopes for other elements, including, but not limited to, \n13\nC or \nl4\nC for carbon, \n3\nS, \n34\nS, or \n6\nS for sulfur, \n15\nN for nitrogen, and \nl 7\n0 or \nl 8\n0 for oxygen, will provide a similar kinetic isotope effects. \n\n\n [00388] In another embodiment, provided herein are methods of using the disclosed compounds and compositions, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or hydrates thereof, for the local or systemic treatment or prophylaxis of human and veterinary diseases, disorders and conditions modulated or otherwise affected mediated via Aurora kinase activity. \n\n\n C. FORMULATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS \n\n\n [00389] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein contain \n\n\ntherapeutically effective amounts of one or more of compounds provided herein that are useful in the prevention, treatment, or amelioration of Aurora kinase, mediated diseases or one or more of the symptoms thereof. \n\n\n [00390] The compositions contain one or more compounds provided herein.\n\n\nThe compounds can be formulated into suitable pharmaceutical preparations such as solutions, suspensions, tablets, dispersible tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations or elixirs, for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration, as well as transdermal patch preparation and dry powder inhalers. Typically the compounds described above are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions using techniques and procedures well known in the art. \n\n [00391] In the compositions, effective concentrations of one or more compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate or prodrug is (are) mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier or vehicle. The concentrations of the compounds in the compositions are effective for delivery of an amount, upon administration, that treats, prevents, or ameliorates one or more of the symptoms of Aurora kinase mediated diseases. \n\n\n [00392] Typically, the compositions are formulated for single dosage administration. To formulate a composition, the weight fraction of compound is dissolved, suspended, dispersed or otherwise mixed in a selected vehicle at an effective concentration such that the treated condition is relieved or ameliorated. Pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles suitable for administration of the compounds provided herein include any such carriers known to those skilled in the art to be suitable for the particular mode of administration. \n\n\n[00393] in addition, the compounds may be formulated as the sole \n\n\npharmaceutically active ingredient in the composition or may be combined with other active ingredients. These may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n [00394] The active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on the patient treated. The therapeutically effective concentration may be determined empirically by testing the compounds in in vitro and in vivo systems described herein and then extrapolated therefrom for dosages for humans. \n\n\n [00395] The concentration of active compound in the pharmaceutical composition will depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the active compound, the physicochemical characteristics of the compound, the dosage schedule, and amount administered as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. For example, the amount that is delivered is sufficient to ameliorate one or more of the symptoms of Aurora kinase mediated diseases. \n\n\n[00396] Typically a therapeutically effective dosage should produce a serum concentration of active ingredient of from about 1 ng/ml to about 50- 100 μg/ml. The pharmaceutical compositions typically should provide a dosage of from about 10 mg to about 4000 mg of compound per kilogram of body weight per day. Pharmaceutical \n\n dosage unit forms are prepared to provide from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg and in certain embodiments, from about 10 mg to about 500 mg, from about 20 mg to about 250 mg or from about 25 mg to about 100 mg of the essential active ingredient or a combination of essential ingredients per dosage unit form. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical dosage unit forms are prepared to provide about 10 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg or 2000 mg of the essential active ingredient. The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the disease being treated and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed compositions. \n\n\n[00397] Thus, effective concentrations or amounts of one or more of the compounds described herein are mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier or vehicle for systemic, topical or local administration to form pharmaceutical compositions. Compounds arc included in an amount effective for ameliorating one or more symptoms of, or for treating or preventing Aurora kinase mediated diseases. The concentration of active compound in the composition will depend on absorption, inactivation, excretion rates of the active compound, the dosage schedule, amount administered, particular formulation as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. \n\n\n [00398] The compositions are intended to be administered by a suitable route, including, but not limited to, orally, parenterally, rectally, topically and locally. For oral administration, capsules and tablets can be formulated. \n\n\n[00399] Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, \n\n\nsubcutaneous, or topical application can include any of the following components: a sterile diluent, such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oil, polyethylene glycol, glycerine, propylene glycol, dimethyl acetamide or other synthetic solvent; \n\n antimicrobial agents, such as benzyl alcohol and methyl parabens; antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid and sodium bisulfite; chelating agents, such as \n\n\nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); buffers, such as acetates, citrates and phosphates; and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. Parenteral preparations can be enclosed in ampules, disposable syringes or single or multiple dose vials made of glass, plastic or other suitable material. \n\n\n[00400] In instances in which the compounds exhibit insufficient solubility, methods for solubilizing compounds may be used. Such methods are known to those of skill in this art, and include, but are not limited to, using cosolvents, such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), using surfactants, such as TWEEN®, or dissolution in aqueous sodium bicarbonate. \n\n\n [00401] Upon mixing or addition of the compound(s), the resulting mixture may be a solution, suspension, emulsion or the like. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. In one embodiment, the effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the symptoms of the disease, disorder or condition treated and may be empirically determined. \n\n\n[00402] The pharmaceutical compositions are provided for administration to humans and animals in unit dosage forms or multiple-dosage forms. Unit-dose forms as used herein refer to physically discrete units suitable for human and animal subjects and packaged individually as is known in the art. Each unit-dose contains a predetermined quantity of the therapeutically active compound sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier, vehicle or diluent. Examples of unit-dose forms include ampules and syringes and individually packaged tablets, capsules, pills, powders and granules, oral solutions or suspensions, and oil-water emulsions. Unit-dose forms may be administered in fractions or multiples thereof. A multiple-dose form is a plurality of identical unit-dosage forms packaged in a single container to be administered in segregated unit-dose form. Examples of multiple-dose forms include vials, bottles of tablets or capsules or bottles of pints or gallons. Hence, multiple dose form is a multiple of unit-doses which are not segregated in packaging. \n\n\n [00403] Dosage fonns or compositions containing active ingredient in the range of 0.005% to 100% with the balance made up from non-toxic carrier may be \n\n prepared. For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic composition is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talcum, cellulose derivatives, sodium crosscarmellose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate or sodium saccharin. Such compositions include solutions, suspensions, tablets, capsules, powders and sustained release formulations, such as, but not limited to, implants and microencapsulated delivery systems, and biodegradable, biocompatible polymers, such as collagen, ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, polyorthoesters, polylactic acid and others. \n\n\nMethods for preparation of these compositions are known to those skilled in the art. The contemplated compositions may contain about 0.001%- 100% active ingredient, in certain embodiments, about 0.1 -85%, typically about 75-95%. \n\n\n[00404] The active compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives may be prepared with carriers that protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as time release formulations or coatings. \n\n\n 1. Compositions for oral administration \n\n\n[00405] Oral pharmaceutical dosage forms are either solid, gel or liquid. The solid dosage forms are tablets, capsules, granules, and bulk powders. Types of oral tablets include compressed, chewable lozenges and tablets which may be \n\n\nenteric-coated, sugar-coated or film-coated.

For example, the composition can be formulated in an enteric coating that maintains its integrity in the stomach and releases the active compound in the intestine. The composition may also be formulated in combination with an antacid or other such ingredient. \n\n\n [00409] When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to material of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. In addition, dosage unit forms can contain various other materials which modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar and other enteric agents. The compounds can also be administered as a component of an elixir, suspension, syrup, wafer, sprinkle, chewing gum or the like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and colorings and flavors. \n\n\n [00410] The active materials can also be mixed with other active materials which do not impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired action, such as antacids, H2 blockers, and diuretics. The active ingredient is a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof as described herein. \n\n Higher concentrations, up to about 98% by weight of the active ingredient may be included, \n\n\n [004111 Liquid oral dosage forms include aqueous solutions, emulsions, suspensions, solutions and/or suspensions reconstituted from non-effervescent granules and effervescent preparations reconstituted from effervescent granules.

An emulsion is a two-phase system in which one liquid is dispersed in the form of small globules throughout another liquid. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in emulsions are non-aqueous liquids, emulsifying agents and preservatives. Suspensions use pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agents and preservatives. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances used in non-effervescent granules, to be reconstituted into a liquid oral dosage form, include diluents, sweeteners and wetting agents. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances used in effervescent granules, to be reconstituted into a liquid oral dosage form, include organic acids and a source of carbon dioxide.

Injectables, solutions and emulsions \n\n\n[00418] Parenteral administration, generally characterized by injection, either subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously is also contemplated herein. \n\n\nInjectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol \n\n or ethanol. In addition, if desired, the pharmaceutical compositions to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, stabilizers, solubility enhancers, and other such agents, such as for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleatc and cyclodextrins. In one embodiment, the composition is administered as an aqueous solution with hydroxypropyl-beta- cyclodextrin (HPBCD) as an excipient. In one embodiment, the aqueous solution contains about 1 % to about 50% HPBCD. In one embodiment, the aqueous solution contains about 1 %, 3%, 5%, 10% or about 20% HPBCD. \n\n\n [00419] Parenteral administration of the compositions includes intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations.

The exact dose depends on the age, weight and condition of the patient or animal as is known in the art. \n\n\n [00424] The unit-dose parenteral preparations are packaged in an ampule, a vial or a syringe with a needle. All preparations for parenteral administration must be sterile, as is known and practiced in the art. \n\n\n [00425] Illustratively, intravenous or intraarterial infusion of a sterile aqueous solution containing an active compound is an effective mode of administration. \n\n\nAnother embodiment is a sterile aqueous or oily solution or suspension containing an active material injected as necessary to produce the desired pharmacological effect. \n\n\n[00426] Injectables are designed for local and systemic administration. \n\n\n Typically a therapeutically effective dosage is formulated to contain a concentration of at least about 0.1% w/w up to about 90% w/w or more, such as more than 1% w/w of the active compound to the treated tissue(s). The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the tissue being treated and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary with the age of the individual treated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the formulations, and that the concentration ranges \n\n set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed formulations. \n\n\n [00427] The compound may be suspended in micronized or other suitable form or may be derivatized to produce a more soluble active product or to produce a prodrug. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the symptoms of the condition and may be empirically determined. \n\n\n 3. Lyophilized powders \n\n\n [00428] Of interest herein are also lyophilized powders, which can be reconstituted for administration as solutions, emulsions and other mixtures. They may also be reconstituted and formulated as solids or gels. \n\n\n [00429] The sterile, lyophilized powder is prepared by dissolving a compound provided herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, in a suitable solvent. The solvent may contain an excipient which improves the stability or other pharmacological component of the powder or reconstituted solution, prepared from the powder. Excipients that may be used include, but are not limited to, dextrose, sorbital, fructose, corn syrup, xylitol, glycerin, glucose, sucrose, hydroxypropyl-beta- cyclodextrin (HPBCD) or other suitable agent. The solvent may also contain a buffer, such as citrate, sodium or potassium phosphate or other such buffer known to those of skill in the art at, typically, about neutral pH. Subsequent sterile filtration of the solution followed by lyophilization under standard conditions known to those of skill in the art provides the desired formulation. Generally, the resulting solution will be apportioned into vials for lyophilization. Each vial will contain a single dosage (10- 1000 mg, 100-500 mg, 10-500 mg, 50-250 mg or 25-100 mg) or multiple dosages of the compound. The lyophilized powder can be stored under appropriate conditions, such as at about 4°C to rt. \n\n\n [00430] Reconstitution of this lyophilized powder with water for injection provides a formulation for use in parenteral administration. For reconstitution, about 1 -50 mg, about 5-35 mg, or about 9-30 mg of lyophilizcd powder, is added per mL of sterile water or other suitable carrier. The precise amount depends upon the selected compound. Such amount can be empirically determined. \n\n\n 4. Topical administration \n\n |004311 Topical mixtures are prepared as described for the local and systemic administration. The resulting mixture may be a solution, suspension, emulsions or the like and are formulated as creams, gels, ointments, emulsions, solutions, elixirs, lotions, suspensions, tinctures, pastes, foams, aerosols, irrigations, sprays, suppositories, bandages, dermal patches or any other formulations suitable for topical administration. \n\n\n [00432] The compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof may be formulated as aerosols for topical application, such as by inhalation. These formulations for administration to the respiratory tract can be in the form of an aerosol or solution for a nebulizer, or as a microfinc powder for insufflation, alone or in combination with an inert carrier such as lactose. In such a case, the particles of the formulation will typically have diameters of less than 50 microns or less than 10 microns. \n\n\n [00433] The compounds may be formulated for local or topical application, such as for topical application to the skin and mucous membranes, such as in the eye, in the form of gels, creams, and lotions and for application to the eye or for intracisternal or intraspinal application. Topical administration is contemplated for transdermal delivery and also for administration to the eyes or mucosa, or for inhalation therapies. Nasal solutions of the active compound alone or in combination with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients can also be administered. \n\n\n[00434] These solutions, particularly those intended for ophthalmic use, may be formulated as 0.01% - 10% isotonic solutions, pH about 5-7, with appropriate salts. \n\n\n 5. Compositions for other routes of administration \n\n\n[00435] Other routes of administration, such as topical application, transdermal patches, and rectal administration are also contemplated herein. \n\n\n(00436] For example, pharmaceutical dosage forms for rectal administration are rectal suppositories, capsules and tablets for systemic effect. Rectal suppositories are used herein mean solid bodies for insertion into the rectum which melt or soften at body temperature releasing one or more pharmacologically or therapeutically active ingredients. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances utilized in rectal suppositories are bases or vehicles and agents to raise the melting point. Examples of bases include cocoa butter (theobroma oil), glycerin-gelatin, carbowax (polyoxyethylene glycol) and appropriate mixtures of mono-, di- and triglycerides of fatty acids. Combinations \n\n of the various bases may be used. Agents to raise the melting point of suppositories include spermaceti and wax. Rectal suppositories may be prepared either by the compressed method or by molding. The typical weight of a rectal suppository is about 2 to 3 gm. \n\n\n 100437] Tablets and capsules for rectal administration are manufactured using the same pharmaceutically acceptable substance and by the same methods as for formulations for oral administration. \n\n\n D. EVALUATION OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPOUNDS |00438] Standard physiological, pharmacological and biochemical procedures are available for testing the compounds to identify those that possess biological activities that modulate the activity of Aurora kinases, including wild type and mutant Aurora kinases. \n\n\n |00439] Such assays include, for example, biochemical assays such as binding assays, radioactivity incorporation assays, as well as a variety of cell based assays. \n\n\n[00440] Exemplary cell based assay methodologies include, but are not limited to measurement of histone H3 phosphorylation in a cellular assay to determine the compounds' ability to inhibit the ability of the Aurora B kinase to phosphorylate serine 10 of the histone H3 enzyme (HH3) during mitosis in human cells and proliferation assay to determine anti-proliferative activity of the compounds based on the detection of BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine), a synthetic thymidine analog that is incorporated into the genomic DNA of proliferating cells which is then detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdU antibody (anti-BrdU-POD). \n\n\n [00441] Cells useful in the assays include cells with wildtype or mutated forms.\n\n\nSuitable cells include those derived through cell culture from patient samples as well as cells derived using routine molecular biology techniques, e.g., retroviral transduction, transfection, mutagenesis, etc. \n\n\n E.

PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS \n\n\n[00457] Starting materials in the synthesis examples provided herein are either available from commercial sources or via literature procedures (e.g., March Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, (1992) 4th Ed.; Wiley Interscience, New York). All commercially available compounds were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. DMSO-i (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), CD^OD (Alrdrich) and CDC1\n3\n (99.8% D, Cambridge Isotope \n\n\nLaboratories) were used in all experiments as indicated. Proton (Ή) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 300 MHz NMR spectrometer. Significant peaks are tabulated and typically include: number of protons, and multiplicity (s, singlet; d, double; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br s, broad singlet). Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (δ) relative to tetramethylsilane. Low resolution mass spectra (MS) were obtained as electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra, which were recorded on a Shimadzu HPLC/MS instrument using reverse-phase conditions (acetonitrile/water, 0.05% acetic acid). Preparative HPLC was performed using Varian HPLC systems and Phenomenex columns. Flash chromatography was performed using Merck Silica Gel 60 (230-400 mesh) following standard protocol (Still et al. (1978) J. Org. Chem. 43:2923). \n\n\n[00458] It is understood that in the following description, combinations of substituents and/or variables of the depicted formulae are permissible only if such contributions result in stable compounds under standard conditions. \n\n\n[00459] It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described below the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsilyl (e.g., r-butyldimethylsilyl, /-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for amino, amidino and guanidino include /-butoxycarbonyl, bcnzyloxycarbonyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto include -C(0)-R (where R is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl), />-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters. \n\n [00460] Protecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques, which are well-known to those skilled in the art and as described herein. The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Green, T.W. and P.G.M. Wutz, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (1991 ), 2nd Ed., Wiley- Interscience. \n\n\n[00461] One of ordinary skill in the art could easily ascertain which choices for each substituent are possible for the reaction conditions of each Scheme. Moreover, the substituents are selected from components as indicated in the specification heretofore, and may be attached to starting materials, intermediates, and/or final products according to schemes known to those of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n[00462] Also it will be apparent that the compounds provided herein could exist as one or more isomers, that is E/Z isomers, enantiomers and/or diastereomers. Compounds of formula (1) may be generally prepared as depicted in the following schemes, unless otherwise noted, the various substituents are as defined elsewhere herein. \n\n\n Standard abbreviations and acronyms as defined in J. Org. Chem. 2007 72(1): 23A- 24A are used herein. Additional abbreviations are provided below: \n\n\n \n\n 100463] In the following schemes, the variables are as described herein for compounds of Formulae I - XVI. \n\n\n [00464] In certain embodiments, compounds of formula (I) are prepared according to the synthetic routes outlined in Scheme 1. The commercially available 2- cyanopyrrole 1 and substituted 2-cyanopyrroles 1 are aminated by reacting with chloroamine under strong basic condition to give the corresponding 1 -amino-2- cyanopyrroles 2. The cyano group of 2 can be hydrolyzed to carboxamides 3 using an aqueous base, such as potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide. Compounds 3 can be cyclized by reacting with alkyl chloroformate and pyridine at elevated temperature to give the pyrrolo[ 1 ,2-f] [ 1 ,2,4]triazine-2,4( 1 H,3H)-diones (4). Chloro-dehydration of 4 using phosphoryl oxychloride catalyzed by Ν,Ν-dimethylacetamide with base, such as Ν,Ν-diisopropylethylamine, can lead to the formation of 2,4- dichloropyrrolo[l ,2-fJ[ l ,2,4]triazines (5). The 4-position chloride of 5 can be regioselectively displaced by an arylamine or a heteroarylamine in the presence of I and DIEA as base to give compounds 6. Under elevated temperature with base, such as potassium carbonate, the 2-position chloride of 6 can be displaced by 4-amino-aryl- mercaptan to give compounds 7. Compounds 7 can be acylated with chloroacetyl chloride to give compounds 8. The chloride of 8 can be displaced with a variety of amines, including pyrrolidines, to give compounds 9. \n\n\nScheme 1: General synthesis of Aurora compounds: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (00465] In another embodiment, compounds of formula (I) are prepared according to the synthetic routes outlined in Scheme 2 without going through 2,4- dichloropyiTolo[l,2-l][l ,2,4]triazines. The commercially available methyl 2-pyrrole carboxylate and readily available substituted methyl 2-pyrrole carboxylates 10 are aminated by reacting with chloroamine under strong basic condition to give the corresponding 1 -amino-2-pyrrole carboxylates 11. Reacting 11 with \n\n\nbenzoylisothiocyanate provided 1 -(3-benzoylthioureido)- 1 H-pyrrole-2-carboxylates 12. Cyclization can be realized under basic condition with bases such as sodium ethoxide to give 2-mercaptopyrrolo[l ,2-fJ[l,2,4]triazin-4-ols 13. A nucleophilic substitution of mercaptans 13 with fluorine-substituted nitroarenes under basic condition at elevated temperature can generate the diarylsulfides 14. Chloro- dehydration of 14 yield 4-chloropyrrolo[ l ,2-f][l,2,4]triazines 15. The 4-chloride of 15 can be displaced by an arylamine or a heteroarylamine using I as catalyst and DIEA as base to give compounds 16. Reduction of the nitro group of 16 using a \n\n number of reducing agents, such as tin(II) chloride, in solvents such as EtOH, would provide anilines 17. Compounds 17 can be acylated with chloroacetyl chloride to give compounds 18. The chloride of 18 can be displaced with a variety of amines, including pyrrolidines, to give compounds 19. Alternatively, 2-mercaptopyrrolo[ l ,2- f][l ,2,4]triazin-4-ols 13 may undergo aminolysis to yield the carboxamide 3 and proceed as described in Scheme I to produce compounds 9. \n\n\n Scheme 2: General synthesis of Aurora compounds without going through 2,4- dichloropyrrolotriazine: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00466] In an illustrative method, compounds of formula (1), such as 6- chloropyrrolo[ l ,2-l][ l ,2,4]triazine analogs may be routinely prepared according to the synthetic route outlined in Scheme 3. The commercially available 2,2,2-trichloro- l - ( 1 H-pyrrol-2-yl)ethanone 20 can be regioselectively chlorinated with chlorination agents, not limited to suliuryl chloride, to give 2,2,2-trichloro- l -(4-chloro-l H-pyrrol- 2-yl)ethanone 21. Methanolysis of 21 with sodium methoxide can yield methyl \n\n carboxylate 22, which can then be subsequently transformed to the desired compound 23 as described in Scheme 1 or 2. \n\n\nScheme 3: General synthesis of 6-chloro and 6-bromo substituted pyrroltriazine analogs: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23 \n\n\n [00467] A similar sequence can be adapted for making the 6-bromo pyrrolotriazine analogs. \n\n\n [00468] In an illustrative method, compounds of formula (I), such as 6- fluoropyrrolo[ l ,2-f][l,2,4]triazine analogs may be routinely prepared according to the synthetic routes outlined in Scheme 4. Treatment of methyl N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl- 4-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylate with DAST or Deoxo-Fluor can lead to \n\n\ndifluoropyrrolidine 25. Oxidation and dehydrofluorination of the pyrrolidine ring of 25 to pyrrole 26 can be realized with oxidizing agents, such as manganese dioxide. Compound 26 can then be transformed to the fluorinated compounds 27 as described in Scheme 1 or 2. \n\n\n Scheme 4: General synthesis of 6-fluoro substituted pyrroltriazine analogs: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 27 \n\n\n [00469] In an illustrative method, compounds of formula (I), such as 6-amino- substituted pyrrolo[ l ,2-f][l,2,4]triazine analogs may be routinely prepared according to the synthetic routes outlined in Scheme 5. The commercially available 2-methyl 4- \n\n nitro-lH-pyrrole-2-carboxylate 28 can be converted to compounds 29 by following the steps described in Scheme 2. The nitro group of 29 can then be reduced to an amino group using a variety of reducing agents, one of which can be Raney Ni under a hydrogen atmosphere to give 30. The amino group of 30 can then by acylated with bromoacetic anhydride or chloroacetyl chloride to give acetamides 31. Substitution with a variety of amines can then afford the desired compounds 32. \n\n\nScheme 5: General synthesis of 6-nitrogen substituted pyrrolotriazine derivatives: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 32 \n\n\n [00470] In an illustrative method, compounds of formula (I), such as 6- hydroxymethyl-substituted pyrrolo[l,2-i][l ,2,4]triazine analogs and 6-aminomethyl- substituted pyrrolo[l ,2-fJ[l,2,4]triazine analogs may be routinely prepared according to the synthetic routes outlined in Scheme 6. The commercially available dimethyl 1 H-pyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylate 33 can be converted to compounds 34 by following the steps described in Scheme 1. The compounds 34 can be further transformed to compounds 35 by following the steps described in Scheme 1. The carboxylate group \n\n of 35 can then be reduced to give the hydroxymethyl analogs 36. Oxidation of the hydroxyl group of 36 to aldehyde 37 can be realized with different oxidizing agents, such as manganese dioxide. Reductive amination using a variety of amines, under a variety of conditions, can afford the aminomethyl analogs 38. \n\n\nScheme 6: General synthesis of 6-carbon substituted pyrrolotriazine derivatives- 1: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 38 \n\n\n[00471] Similarly, in an illustrative method, compounds of formula (I), such as\n\n\n6-carboxamide-substituted pyrrolo[ l ,2-f][l,2,4]triazine analogs may be routinely prepared according to the synthetic routes outlined in Scheme 7. The carboxylate analogs 35 can be hydrolyzed to give the carboxylic acids 39. Amide bond formation \n\n using a variety of coupling reagents, such as TBTU, provides the carboxamide analogs 40. \n\n\nScheme 7: General synthesis of 6-carbon substituted pyrrolotriazine derivatives- 2: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00472] In an illustrative method, compounds of formula (I), such as 7-chloro- substituted or 7-fluoro-substituted-pyrrolo[l ,2-f][l ,2,4]triazine analogs may be routinely prepared according to the synthetic routes outlined in Scheme 8. The dichloropyrrolotriazine 41 can be chlorinated with NCS in solvents such as acetonitrile to give 7-chloropyrrolotriazine 42, which can then be transformed to the chlorinated compounds 43 as described in Scheme 1. Similarly, fiuorination of 41 can be realized with agents such as SelectFluor to give 7-fluoropyrrolotriazine 44, which can then be transformed to the fluorinated compounds 45 as described in Scheme 1 or 2. \n\n\nScheme 8: General synthesis of 7-substituted pyrrolotriazine derivatives \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n [00473] The subject matter has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of description rather than of limitation.

Description\n\n\n\n\n OLIGOMER-TRICYCLIC CONJUGATES \n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION \n\n\n [0001] This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C § 119(e) to U.S.\n\n\nProvisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/296,272, filed January 19, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. \n\n\n [0002] This invention comprises (among other things) chemically modified tricyclics that possess certain advantages over tricyclics lacking the chemical modification. The chemically modified tricyclics described herein relate to and/or have application(s) in (among others) the fields of drug discovery, pharmacotherapy, physiology, organic chemistry and polymer chemistry. \n\n\n [0003] Clinical depression (also called major-depressive disorder or unipolar depression) is a common psychiatric disorder, characterized by a persistent lowering of mood, loss of interest in usual activities and diminished ability to experience pleasure. \n\n\n [0004] While the term \"depression\" is commonly used to describe a temporary decreased mood, clinical depression is a serious illness that involves the body, mood, and thoughts and cannot simply be willed or wished away. It is often a disabling disease that affects a person's work, family and school life, sleeping and eating habits, general health and ability to enjoy life. The course of clinical depression varies widely: depression can be a once in a life-time event or have multiple recurrences, it can appear either gradually or suddenly, and either last for few months or be a life-long disorder. Having depression is a major risk factor for suicide; in addition, people with depression suffer from higher mortality from other causes. Clinical depression is usually treated by psychotherapy, antidepressants, or a combination of the two. \n\n\n[0005] Neuropathy is a disease of the peripheral nerve or nerves. The four major forms of nerve damage are polyneuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, mononeuropathy, and mononeuritis multiplex. A more common form is peripheral polyneuropathy, which mainly affects the feet and legs. There are other less common forms of neuropathy, for example enteric neuropathy. \n\n\n[0006] Aside from diabetes (i.e., diabetic neuropathy), the common causes of neuropathy are herpes zoster infection, HIV-AIDS, toxins, alcoholism, chronic trauma (such as repetitive motion disorders) or acute trauma (including surgery), neurotoxicity and autoimmune conditions such as celiac disease. Neuropathic pain is common in cancer as a direct result of the cancer on \n\n peripheral nerves (e.g., compression by a tumor), as a side effect of many chemotherapy drugs, and as a result of electrical injury. In many cases the neuropathy is \"idiopathic,\" meaning no cause is found. \n\n\n [0007] Neuropathic pain is usually perceived as a steady burning and/or \"pins and needles\" and/or \"electric shock\" sensations and/or tickling. The difference is due to the fact that \"ordinary\" pain stimulates only pain nerves, while a neuropathy often results in the firing of both pain and non-pain (touch, warm, cool) sensory nerves in the same area, producing signals that the spinal cord and brain do not normally expect to receive. \n\n\n [0008] Neuropathic pain may be difficult to treat. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials found that the best treatments are tricyclics, anticonvulsants, and capsaicin. Tricyclic antidepressants are used in numerous applications; mainly indicated for the treatment of clinical depression, neuropathic pain, nocturnal enuresis, and ADHD, but they have also been used successfully for headache (including migraine headache), anxiety, insomnia, smoking cessation, bulimia nervosa, irritable bowel syndrome, narcolepsy, pathological crying or laughing, persistent hiccups, interstitial cystitis, and ciguatera poisoning, and as an adjunct in schizophrenia. \n\n\n [0009] It is generally thought that tricyclic antidepressants work by inhibiting the reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine, or serotonin by nerve cells. \n\n\nTricyclics may also possess affinity for muscarinic and histamine HI through H4 receptors to varying degrees. Although norepinephrine and dopamine are generally considered stimulatory neurotransmitters, tricyclic antidepressants also increase the effects on HI histamine, and thus most have sedative effects and may also be useful as anti-histaminic compounds. \n\n\n[0010] Oxcarbazepine is an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizing drug, used primarily in the treatment of epilepsy. It is also used to treat anxiety and mood disorders, and benign motor tics. Oxcarbazepine is a structural derivative of carbamazepine, with a ketone in place of the carbon-carbon double bond on the dibenzazepine ring. This difference helps reduce the impact on the liver of metabolizing the drug, and also prevents the serious forms of anemia or agranulocytosis occasionally associated with carbamazepine. Aside from this reduction in side effects, it is thought to have the same mechanism as carbamazepine - sodium channel inhibition (presumed to be the main mechanism of action) - and is generally used to treat the same conditions. Oxcarbazepine has recently been found to be associated with a greater enhancement \n\n in mood and reduction in anxiety symptoms than other drugs employed to treat epilepsy. \n\n\nEslicarbazepine acetate is an antiepileptic drug. It is a prodrug which is activated to \n\n\neslicarbazepine (S-licarbazepine), an active metabolite of oxcarbazepine. \n\n\n[0011] The utility of antidepressants and anticonvulsants has been limited by potential adverse effects on the central nervous system such as bad dreams, drowsiness, blurred vision, decreased gastro-intestinal mobility and secretion, difficulty with urination, hyperthermia, and dry mouth. As a consequence, pharmacotherapy with tricyclics would be improved if these and/or other side effects associated with their use could be decreased. Thus, there is a large unmet need for developing novel tricyclic compounds. \n\n\n [0012] The present invention seeks to address these and other needs in the art. \n\n\n [0013] In one or more embodiments of the invention, a compound is provided, the compound comprising a tricyclic residue covalently attached via a stable or degradable linkage to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer. \n\n\n [0014] Exemplary compounds of the invention include those having the following structure: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Formula I-C \n\n\nwherein: \n\n\n D is C or N; \n\n\n Y is selected from the group consisting of-C¾-, -CH-, -CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-, -CH=CH-, \n\n\n -CH\n2\n-S-, CH\n2\n-0-, -C(0)-CH\n2\n- , -C(-OR\n10\n)-CH\n2\n-, CH\n2\n-NH-, -S-C¾-, -0-CH\n2)\n -NH-CH\n2\n,\n\n\n-HN-, -0-, -N=C-, -C=N-, and -S-, unsubstituted or optionally substituted; \n\n\n one or more of R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8\n, R\n9\n, each are independently selected from the group consisting of nil, hydrogen, halo, cyano, hydroxy, carboxy, keto, thioketo, amino, acylamino, acyl, amido, aryloxy, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, heteroalkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, dioxo, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, and heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted or optionally substituted; \n\n R is selected from hydrogen, alkyl, and acyl; \n\n\nX is a spacer moiety; and \n\n\n POLY is a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer. \n\n\n [0015] Exemplary compounds of the invention include those having the following structure: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein: \n\n\n Y is selected from-CH\n2\n-, -CH-, -CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-, -CH=CH-, -CH\n2\n-S-, CH\n2\n-0-,-C(0)-CH\n2\n- , -C(- OR\n10\n)-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-NH-, -S-CH\n2\n-, -0-CH\n2\n, -NH-CH\n2\n-, -NH-S(0)\n2\n-, -NH-C(O)-, -HN-, -0-, -N=C-\nS\n -C=N-, and -S-, each of which is independently optionally substituted; \n\n\n D is C or N; \n\n\n R\n1\n is selected from alkyl, amino, acylamino, acyl, amido, aryloxy, alkylamino, \n\n\ndialkylamino wherein each alkyl group independently has from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, \n\n\npiperidino, pyrrolidino, N-(lower alkyl)-2-piperidyl, morpholino, 1 -piperizinyl, 4-(lower alkyl)- 1 -piperizinyl, 4-(hydroxyl-lower alkyl)- 1 -piperizinyl, and 4-(methoxy-lower alkyl)- 1- piperizinyl, each of which is independently optionally substituted; \n\n\n each of R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8\n, and R\n9\n, are independently selected from hydrogen, halo, cyano, hydroxy, carboxy, keto, thioketo, amino, acylamino, acyl, amido, aryloxy, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, heteroalkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, dioxo, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, and \n\n\nheterocycloalkyl, each of which is independently optionally substituted; \n\n\n R\n10\n is selected from hydrogen, alkyl, and acyl; \n\n\n X is a spacer moiety; and \n\n\n POLY is a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer. \n\n\n[0016] The \"tricyclic residue\" is a compound having a structure of a tricyclic compound that is altered by the presence of one or more bonds, which bonds serve to attach (either directly \n\n or indirectly) one or more water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomers.

Typically, an unfiltered aqueous preparation of a \"water-soluble\" oligomer transmits at least 75%, in certain embodiments at least 95%, of the amount of light transmitted by the same solution after filtering. In certain embodiments the water-soluble oligomer is at least 95% (by weight) soluble in water or completely soluble in water. With respect to being \"non-peptidic,\" an oligomer is non- peptidic when it has less than 35% (by weight) of amino acid residues. \n\n\n[0033] The terms \"monomer,\" \"monomelic subunit\" and \"monomeric unit\" are used interchangeably herein and refer to one of the basic structural units of a polymer or oligomer. In the case of a homo-oligomer, a single repeating structural unit forms the oligomer. In the case of a co-oligomer, two or more structural units are repeated— either in a pattern or randomly - to form the oligomer. In certain embodiments, oligomers used in connection with present the invention are homo-oligomers. The water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer typically comprises one or more monomers serially attached to form a chain of monomers. The oligomer can be formed from a single monomer type (i.e., is homo-oligomeric) or two or three monomer types (i.e., is co-oligomeric). \n\n\n [0034] An \"oligomer\" is a molecule possessing from about 1 to about 30 monomers.\n\n\nSpecific oligomers for use in the invention include those having a variety of geometries such as linear, branched, or forked, to be described in greater detail below. \n\n\n[0035] \"PEG\" or \"polyethylene glycol,\" as used herein, is meant to encompass any water-soluble poly( ethylene oxide). Unless otherwise indicated, a \"PEG oligomer\" an oligoethylene glycol is one in which substantially all (in certain embodiments all) monomeric subunits are ethylene oxide subunits, though the oligomer may contain distinct end capping moieties or functional groups, e.g., for conjugation, PEG oligomers for use in the present invention will comprise one of the two following structures: \"-(CH\n2\nCH\n2\n0)\nn\n-\nM\n or \n\n\n\"-(CH2CH\n2\n0)\nn\n-iCH2CH\n2\n-,\" depending upon whether or not the terminal oxygen(s) has been displaced, e.g., during a synthetic transformation. As stated above, for the PEG oligomers, the variable \"n\" ranges from about 1 to 30, in certain embodiments from about 2 to about 30, and the terminal groups and architecture of the overall PEG can vary. When PEG further comprises a functional group, A, for linking to, e.g., a small molecule drug, the functional group v/hen \n\n covalently attached to a PEG oligomer does not result in formation of (i) an oxygen-oxygen bond (-0-0-, a peroxide linkage), or (ii) a nitrogen-oxygen bond (N-O, O-N). \n\n\n[0036] The terms \"end-capped\" and \"terminally capped\" are interchangeably used herein to refer to a terminal or endpoint of a polymer having an end-capping moiety. Typically, although not necessarily, the end-capping moiety comprises a hydroxy or Ci\n-20\n alkoxy group, in certain embodiments a C O alkoxy group, and in certain embodiments a C\n1-5\n alkoxy group. Thus, examples of end-capping moieties include alkoxy (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy and benzyloxy), as well as aryl, heteroaryl, cyclo, heterocyclo, and the like. The end-capping moiety may include one or more atoms of the terminal monomer in the polymer [e.g., the end-capping moiety \"methoxy\" in CH\n3\n0(CH\n2\nCH\n2\n0)\nn\n- and CH\n3\n(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nN\n-]. In addition, saturated, unsaturated, substituted and unsubstituted forms of each of the foregoing are envisioned. Moreover, the end-capping group can also be a silane. The end-capping group can also comprise a detectable label. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a detectable label, the amount or location of the polymer and/or the moiety (e.g., active agent) to which the polymer is coupled can be determined by using a suitable detector. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric (e.g., dyes), metal ions, radioactive moieties, gold particles, quantum dots, and the like. Suitable detectors include photometers, films, spectrometers, and the like. The end-capping group can also comprise a phospholipid. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a phospholipid, unique properties are imparted to the polymer and the resulting conjugate. Exemplary phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the class of phospholipids called \n\n\nphosphatidylcholines. Specific phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the group consisting of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine, \n\n\ndipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, disteroylphosphatidylcholine, behenoylphosphatidylcholine, arachidoylphosphatidylcholine, and lecithin, \n\n\n[0037] The term \"targeting moiety\" is used herein to refer to a molecular structure that helps the conjugates of the invention to localize to a targeting area, e.g. , help enter, permeate, or penetrate a cell, or bind a receptor. In certain embodiments, the targeting moiety comprises of vitamin, cofactor, antibody, antigen, receptor, DNA, R A, sialyl Lewis X antigen, hyaluronic acid, sugars, cell specific lectins, steroid or steroid derivative, RGD peptide, cell penetrating or cell targeting moiety, ligand for a cell surface receptor, serum component, or combinatorial \n\n molecule directed against various intra- or extracellular receptors. The targeting moiety may also comprise a lipid or a phospholipid. Exemplary phospholipids include, without limitation, phosphatidylcholines, phospatidylserine, phospatidylinositol, phospatidylglycerol, and phospatidylethanolamine. These lipids may be in the form of micelles or liposomes and the like. The targeting moiety may further comprise a detectable label or alternately a detectable label may serve as a targeting moiety. When the conjugate has a targeting group comprising a detectable label, the amount and/or distribution/location of the polymer and/or the moiety (e.g., active agent) to which the polymer is coupled can be determined by using a suitable detector. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric (e.g., dyes), metal ions, radioactive moieties, gold particles, quantum dots, and the like. \n\n\n[0038] \"Branched\", in reference to the geometry or overall structure of an oligomer, refers to an oligomer having two or more polymer \"aims\" from a branch point. \n\n\n[0039] \"Forked\", in reference to the geometry or overall structure of an oligomer, refers to an oligomer having two or more functional groups (typically through one or more atoms) extending from a branch point. \n\n\n [0040] A \"branch point\" refers to a bifurcation point comprising one or more atoms at which an oligomer branches or forks from a linear structure into one or more additional aims. \n\n\n[0041] The term \"reactive\" or \"activated\" refers to a functional group that reacts readily or at a practical rate under conventional conditions of organic synthesis. This is in contrast to those groups that either do not react or require strong catalysts or impractical reaction conditions in order to react (i.e., a \"nonreactive\" or \"inert\" group). \n\n\n [0042] \"Not readily reactive,\" with reference to a functional group present on a molecule in a reaction mixture, indicates that the group remains largely intact under conditions that are effective to produce a desired reaction in the reaction mixture. \n\n\n [0043] A \"protecting group\" is a moiety that prevents or blocks reaction of a particular chemically reactive functional group in a molecule under certain reaction conditions. The protecting group may vary depending upon the type of chemically reactive group being protected as well as the reaction conditions to be employed and the presence of additional reactive or protecting groups in the molecule. Functional groups which may be protected include, by way of example, carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, thiol groups, carbonyl groups \n\n and the like. Representative protecting groups for carboxylic acids include esters (such as a -methoxybenzyl ester), amides and hydrazides; for amino groups, carbamates (such as tert-butoxycarbonyl) and amides; for hydroxyl groups, ethers and esters; for thiol groups, thioethers and thioesters; for carbonyl groups, acetals and ketals; and the like. Such protecting groups are well-known to those skilled in the art and are described, for example, in T.W. Greene and G.M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1 99, and references cited therein. \n\n\n [0044] A functional group in \"protected form\" refers to a functional group bearing a protecting group. As used herein, the term \"functional group\" or any synonym thereof encompasses protected forms thereof. \n\n\n [0045] A \"physiologically cleavable\" or \"hydrolyzable\" or \"degradable\" bond is a relatively labile bond that reacts with water (i.e., is hydrolyzed) under physiological conditions. The tendency of a bond to hydrolyze in water may depend not only on the general type of linkage connecting two central atoms but also on the substituents attached to these central atoms. Appropriate hydrolytically unstable or weak linkages include but are not limited to carboxylate ester, phosphate ester, anhydrides, acetals, ketals, acyloxyalkyl ether, imines, orthoesters, peptides, oligonucleotides, thioesters, thiolesters, and carbonates. \n\n\n[0046] An \"enzymatically degradable linkage\" means a linkage that is subject to degradation by one or more enzymes. \n\n\n [0047] A \"stable\" linkage or bond refers to a bond, typically a covalent bond, that is substantially stable in water, that is to say, does not undergo hydrolysis under physiological conditions to any appreciable extent over an extended period of time. Examples of \n\n\nhydrolytically stable linkages include but are not limited to the following: carbon-carbon bonds (e.g., in aliphatic chains), ethers, amides, urethanes, amines, and the like. Generally, a stable linkage is one that exhibits a rate of hydrolysis of less than about 1-2% per day under physiological conditions. Hydrolysis rates of representative chemical bonds can be found in most standard chemistry textbooks. \n\n\n [0048] \"Substantially\" or \"essentially\" means nearly totally or completely, for instance,\n\n\n95% or greater, in certain embodiments 97% or greater, in certain embodiments 98% or greater, in certain embodiments 99% or greater, and in certain embodiments 99.9% or greater. \n\n [0049] \"Monodisperse\" refers to an oligomer composition wherein substantially all of the oligomers in the composition have a well-defined, single molecular weight and defined number of monomers, as determined by chromatography or mass spectrometry. Monodisperse oligomer compositions are in one sense pure, that is, substantially having a single and definable number (as a whole number) of monomers rather than a large distribution. A monodisperse oligomer composition possesses a MW/Mn value of 1.0005 or less, and in certain embodiments, a MW/Mn value of 1.0000. By extension, a composition comprised of monodisperse conjugates means that substantially all oligomers of all conjugates in the composition have a single and definable number (as a whole number) of monomers rather than a large distribution and would possess a MW/Mn value of 1.0005, and in certain embodiments, a MW/Mn value of 1.0000, if the oligomer were not attached to the moiety derived from a small molecule drug. A \n\n\ncomposition comprised of monodisperse conjugates may however, include one or more nonconjugate substances such as solvents, reagents, excipients, and so forth. \n\n\n[0050] \"Bimodal,\" in reference to an oligomer composition, refers to an oligomer composition wherein substantially all oligomers in the composition have one of two definable and different numbers (as whole numbers) of monomers rather than a large distribution, and whose distribution of molecular weights, when plotted as a number fraction versus molecular weight, appears as two separate identifiable peaks. In certain embodiments, for a bimodal oligomer composition as described herein, each peak is generally symmetric about its mean, although the size of the two peaks may differ. Ideally, the polydispersity index of each peak in the bimodal distribution, Mw/Mn, is 1.01 or less, in certain embodiments 1.001 or less, and in certain embodiments 1.0005 or less, and in certain embodiments a MW/Mn value of 1.0000. By extension, a composition comprised of bimodal conjugates means that substantially all oligomers of all conjugates in the composition have one of two definable and different numbers (as whole numbers) of monomers rather than a large distribution and would possess a MW/Mn value of 1.01 or less, in certain embodiments 1.001 or less and even in certain embodiments 1.0005 or less, and in certain embodiments a MW/Mn value of 1.0000 if the oligomer were not attached to the moiety derived from a small molecule drug. A composition comprised of bimodal conjugates can include, however, one or more nonconjugate substances such as solvents, reagents, excipients, and so forth \n\n [0051] A \"tricyclic\" refers to an organic, inorganic, or organometallic compound typically having a molecular weight of less than about 1000 Daltons and having some degree of activity as tricyclic therapeutic as described herein. \n\n\n [0052] A \"biological membrane\" is any membrane made of cells or tissues that serves as a barrier to at least some foreign entities or otherwise undesirable materials. As used herein a \"biological membrane\" includes those membranes that are associated with physiological protective barriers including, for example: the blood-brain barrier (BBB); the \n\n\nblood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier; the blood-placental barrier; the blood-milk barrier; the blood-testes barrier; and mucosal barriers including the vaginal mucosa, urethral mucosa, anal mucosa, buccal mucosa, sublingual mucosa, and rectal mucosa. Unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, the term \"biological membrane\" does not include those membranes associated with the middle gastro-intestinal tract (e.g., stomach and small intestines). \n\n\n[0053] A \"biological membrane crossing rate,\" provides a measure of a compound's ability to cross a biological membrane (such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB)). A variety of methods may be used to assess transport of a molecule across any given biological membrane. Methods to assess the biological membrane crossing rate associated with any given biological barrier (e.g., the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, the blood-placental barrier, the blood-milk barrier, the intestinal barrier, and so forth), are described herein and/or in the relevant literature, and/or may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n [0054] A \"reduced rate of metabolism\" in reference to the present invention, refers to a measurable reduction in the rate of metabolism of a water-soluble oligomer-small molecule dmg conjugate as compared to the rate of metabolism of the small molecule drug not attached to the water-soluble oligomer (i.e., the small molecule drug itself) or a reference standard material. In the special case of \"reduced first pass rate of metabolism,\" the same \"reduced rate of metabolism\" is required except that the small molecule drug (or reference standard material) and the corresponding conjugate are administered orally. Orally administered drugs are absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract into the portal circulation and may pass through the liver prior to reaching the systemic circulation. Because the liver is the primary site of drug metabolism or biotransformation, a substantial amount of drug may be metabolized before it reaches the systemic circulation. The degree of first pass metabolism, and thus, any reduction thereof, may be measured by a number of different approaches. For instance, animal blood samples may be \n\n collected at timed intervals and the plasma or serum analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for metabolite levels. Other techniques for measuring a \"reduced rate of metabolism\" associated with the first pass metabolism and other metabolic processes are known, described herein and/or in the relevant literature, and/or may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. In certain embodiments, a conjugate of the invention may provide a reduced rate of metabolism reduction satisfying at least one of the following values: at least about 30%; at least about 40%; at least about 50%; at least about 60%; at least about 70%; at least about 80%; and at least about 90%. A compound (such as a small molecule drug or conjugate thereof) that is \"orally bioavailable\" is one that in certain embodiments possesses a bioavailability when administered orally of greater than 25%, and in certain embodiments greater than 70%, where a compound's bioavailability is the fraction of administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation in unmetabolized form. \n\n\n [0055] \"Alkyl\" refers to a hydrocarbon chain ranging from about 1 to 20 atoms in length.\n\n\nSuch hydrocarbon chains are preferably but not necessarily saturated and may be branched or straight chain, although typically straight chain is preferred. Exemplary alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, 2-methylbutyl, 2-ethylpropyl, 3-methylpentyl, and the like. As used herein, \"alkyl\" includes cycloalkyl when three or more carbon atoms are referenced. \n\n\n[0056] \"Lower alkyl\" refers to an alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and may be straight chain or branched, as exemplified by methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, t-butyl. \n\n\n[0057] \"Non-interfering substituents\" are those groups that, when present in a molecule, are typically non-reactive with other functional groups contained within the molecule. \n\n\n[0058] \"Alkoxy\" refers to an -O-R group, wherein R is alkyl or substituted alkyl, in certain embodiments Ci-C\n2\no alkyl (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy, etc.), in certain \n\n\nembodiments Ci-C\n7\n. \n\n\n [0059] \"Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient\" or \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" refers to component that may be included in the compositions of the invention causes no significant adverse toxicological effects to a patient. \n\n\n [0060] The term \"aryl\" means an aromatic group having up to 14 carbon atoms. Aryl groups include phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, phenanthrenyl, naphthalenyl, and the like. \n\n\n\"Substituted phenyl\" and \"substituted aryl\" denote a phenyl group and aryl group, respectively, substituted with one, two, three, four or five (e.g. 1-2,1-3 or 1-4 substituents) chosen from halo \n\n (F, CI, Br, I), hydroxy, cyano, nitro, alkyl (e.g., Ci\n-6\n alkyl), alkoxy (e.g., Ci_6 alkoxy), benzyloxy, carboxy, aryl, and so forth. \n\n\n [0061] Chemical moieties are defined and referred to throughout primarily as univalent chemical moieties (e.g., alkyl, aryl, etc.). Nevertheless, such terms are also used to convey corresponding multivalent moieties under the appropriate structural circumstances clear to those skilled in the art. For example, while an \"alkyl\" moiety generally refers to a monovalent radical (e.g., CH\n3\n-CH\n2\n-), in certain circumstances a bivalent linking moiety can be \"alkyl,\" in which case those skilled in the art will understand the alkyl to be a divalent radical (e.g., -CH2-CH\n2\n-), which is equivalent to the term \"alkyl ene.\" (Similarly, in circumstances in which a divalent moiety is required and is stated as being \"aryl,\" those skilled in the art will understand that the term \"aryl\" refers to the corresponding multivalent moiety, arylene). All atoms are understood to have their normal number of valences for bond formation (i.e., 1 for H, 4 for carbon, 3 for N, 2 for O, and 2, 4, or 6 for S, depending on the oxidation state of the S). \n\n\n [0062] \"Pharmacologically effective amount,\" \"physiologically effective amount,\" and\n\n\n\"therapeutically effective amount\" are used interchangeably herein to mean the amount of a water-soluble oligomer-small molecule drug conjugate present in a composition that is needed to provide a desired level of active agent and/or conjugate in the bloodstream or in the target tissue. The precise amount may depend upon numerous factors, e.g., the particular active agent, the components and physical characteristics of the composition, intended patient population, patient considerations and may readily be determined by one skilled in the art, based upon the information provided herein and available in the relevant literature. \n\n\n [0063] A \"difunctional\" oligomer is an oligomer having two functional groups contained therein, typically at its termini. When the functional groups are the same, the oligomer is said to be homodifunctional. When the functional groups are different, the oligomer is said to be \n\n\nheterodifunctional . \n\n\n [0064] A basic reactant or an acidic reactant described herein include neutral, charged, and any corresponding salt forms thereof. \n\n\n [0065] The term \"patient,\" refers to a living organism suffering from or prone to a condition that can be prevented or treated by administration of a conjugate as described herein, and includes both humans and animals. \n\n [0066] \"Optional\" or \"optionally\" means that the subsequently described circumstance may but need not necessarily occur, so that the description includes instances where the \n\n\ncircumstance occurs and instances where it does not. \n\n\n [0067] \"Nil\" refers to the absence of a substituent group. Thus, when a substituent is nil, the substituent may be represented in the structure as a chemical bond or hydrogen in the resulting structure. \n\n\n [0068] As indicated above, the present invention is directed to (among other things) a compound comprising a tricyclic residue covalently attached via a stable or degradable linkage to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer. \n\n\n [0069] In one or more embodiments of the invention, a compound is provided, the compound comprising a tricyclic residue covalently attached via a stable or degradable linkage to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer, wherein the tricyclic residue is a residue of a \n\n\ncompound having a structure encompassed by the following formula: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Formula I \n\n\nwherein: \n\n\n D and R\n1\n, taken together, are selected from HC-R\n1\n, -C=R\n[\n, and -N-R\n1\n; \n\n\n R\n1\n is selected from the group alkyl, amino, acylamino, acyl, amido, aryloxy, alkylamino, dialkylamino having about 2 to 4 inclusive carbon atoms, piperidino, pyrrolidino, N-(lower alkyl)-2- piperidyl, morpholino, 1 -piperizinyl, 4-(lower alkyl)- 1 -piperizinyl, 4-(hydroxyl-lower alkyl)- 1- piperizinyl, and 4-(methoxy- lower alkyl)- 1 -piperizinyl, each of which is independently optionally substituted; \n\n\n Y is selected from-CH\n2\n-, -CH-, -CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-, -CH=CH-, -CH\n2\n-S-, CH\n2\n-0-,-C(0)-CH\n2\n- , -C(- OR\n10\n)-CH\n2\n-, -C¾-NH-, -S-CH\n2\n-, -0-CH\n2\n, -NH-CH\n2\n-, -NH-S(0)\n2\n-, -NH-C(O)-, -HN-, -0-, -N=C-, -C=N-, and -S-, each of which is independently optionally substituted; \n\n each of R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8\n, and R\n9\n, are independently selected from hydrogen, halo, cyano, hydroxy, carboxy, keto, thioketo, amino, acylamino, acyl, amido, aryloxy, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, heteroalkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, dioxo, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, and heterocycloalkyl, each of which is independently optionally substituted; and \n\n\n R\n10\n is selected from hydrogen, alkyl, and acyl. \n\n\n[0070] In one or more embodiments of the invention, a compound is provided, the compound comprising a tricyclic residue covalently attached via a stable or degradable linkage to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer, wherein the tricyclic residue is a residue of a compound having a structure encompassed by the following formula: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Formula I \n\n\nwherein: \n\n\n D and R\n1\n, taken together form -N-R\n1\n; \n\n\n R\n1\n is amido; \n\n\n Y is selected from -C(0)-CH\n2\n- and -C(-OR\n10\n)-CH\n2\n-; \n\n\neach of R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8\n, and R\n9\n, are hydrogen; \n\n\n and R\n10\n is selected from hydrogen, alkyl, and acyl. \n\n\n[0071] In one or more embodiments of the invention, D and R\n1\n taken together form N-R\n1\n. \n\n\n [0072] In one or more embodiments of the invention, R\n1\n is amido. \n\n\n [0073] In one or more embodiments of the invention, Y is selected from -,-C(0)-CH;>- , -C(-\n\n\nOR\n10\n)- and R\n10\n is selected from hydrogen, alkyl, and acyl. In certain embodiments R\n10\n is selected from lower alkyl and lower acyl. In certain embodiments, R\n10\n is acetyl. \n\n\n [0074] In one or more embodiments of the invention, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8\n, and R\n9\n, are each hydrogen. \n\n\n [0075] Examples of specific tricyclic compounds include those selected from the group consisting of amineptine, amitriptyline, amitriptylinoxide, amoxapine, butriptyline, clomiprimine, \n\n demexiptiline, desipramine, dibenzepin, dimetacrine, dothiepin, doxepin, fluacizine, imipramine, imipramine N-oxide, lofepramine, melitracen, metapramine, mirtazapine, nortriptyline, opipramol, propizepine, protriptyline, quinupramine, tianeptine, trimipramine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, chlorpromazine, promethazine, clozapine, loxapine, and eslicarbazepine. \n\n\n[0076] In one or more embodiments of the invention, the tricyclic residue is a residue of a compound selected from oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, and eslicarbazepine. \n\n\n[0077] In one or more embodiments of the invention, the tricyclic residue is a residue of oxcarbazepine. \n\n\n[0078] It is believed that an advantage of the compounds of the present invention is their ability to retain some degree of tricyclic activity while also exhibiting a decrease in metabolism. Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the tricyclic residue- and oligomer-containing compounds described herein ~ in contrast to the oligomer-free \"original\" tricyclic structure -- are not metabolized as readily because the oligomer serves to reduce the overall affinity of the compound to substrates that may metabolize tricyclics. In addition (and again, not wishing to be bound by theory), the extra size introduced by the oligomer - in contrast to the oligomer-free \"original\" tricyclic structure ~ reduces the ability of the compound to cross the blood-brain barrier. Even should the linkage between the residue of the tricyclic and the oligomer be degradable, the compound still offers advantages (such as avoiding first-pass metabolism upon initial absoiption). \n\n\n [0079] Use of discrete oligomers (e.g., from a monodisperse or bimodal composition of oligomers, in contrast to relatively impure compositions) to form oligomer-containing \n\n\ncompounds may advantageously alter certain properties associated with the corresponding small molecule drug. For instance, a compound of the invention, when administered by any of a number of suitable administration routes, such as parenteral, oral, transdermal, buccal, pulmonary, or nasal, exhibits reduced penetration across the blood-brain barrier. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention exhibit slowed, minimal or effectively no crossing of the blood-brain barrier, while still crossing the gastro-intestinal (GI) walls and into the systemic circulation if oral delivery is intended. Moreover, the compounds of the invention maintain a degree of bioactivity as well as bioavailability in comparison to the bioactivity and bioavailability of the compound free of all oligomers. \n\n [0080] With respect to the blood-brain barrier (\"BBB\"), this barrier restricts the transport of drugs from the blood to the brain. This barrier consists of a continuous layer of unique endothelial cells joined by tight junctions. The cerebral capillaries, which comprise more than 95% of the total surface area of the BBB, represent the principal route for the entry of most solutes and drugs into the central nervous system. \n\n\n [0081] For compounds whose degree of blood-brain barrier crossing ability is not readily known, such ability may be determined using a suitable animal model such as an in situ rat brain perfusion (\"RBP\") model as described herein. Briefly, the RBP technique involves cannulation of the carotid artery followed by perfusion with a compound solution under controlled conditions, followed by a wash out phase to remove compound remaining in the vascular space. (Such analyses may be conducted, for example, by contract research organizations such as Absoiption Systems, Exton, PA). In one example of the RBP model, a cannula is placed in the left carotid artery and the side branches are tied off. A physiologic buffer containing the analyte (typically but not necessarily at a 5 micromolar concentration level) is perfused at a flow rate of about 10 mL/minute in a single pass perfusion experiment. After 30 seconds, the perfusion is stopped and the brain vascular contents are washed out with compound- free buffer for an additional 30 seconds. The brain tissue is then removed and analyzed for compound \n\n\nconcentrations via liquid chromatograph with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC/MS/MS). Alternatively, blood-brain barrier permeability can be estimated based upon a calculation of the compound's molecular polar surface area (\"PSA\"), which is defined as the sum of surface contributions of polar atoms (usually oxygens, nitrogens and attached hydrogens) in a molecule. The PSA has been shown to correlate with compound transport properties such as blood-brain barrier transport. Methods for determining a compound's PSA can be found, e.g., in, Ertl, P., et al., J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 3714-3717; and Kelder, J., et al, Pharm. Res. 1999, 16, 1514- 1519. \n\n\n[0082] With respect to the blood-brain barrier, the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer-small molecule drug conjugate exhibits a blood-brain barrier crossing rate that is reduced as compared to the crossing rate of the small molecule drug not attached to the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer. Exemplary reductions in blood-brain barrier crossing rates for the compounds described herein include reductions of: at least about 5%; at least about 10%; at least about 25%; at least about 30%; at least about 40%; at least about 50%; at least about 60%; at least about 70%; at least about 80%; or at least about 90%, when compared to the \n\n blood-brain barrier crossing rate of the small molecule drug not attached to the water-soluble oligomer. In certain embodiments, a reduction in the blood-brain barrier crossing rate for a conjugate of the invention is at least about 20%. \n\n\n [0083] As indicated above, the compounds of the invention include a tricyclic residue.\n\n\nAssays for determining whether a given compound (regardless of whether the compound includes a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer or not) can act as an antidepressant, anticonvulsant, or as an analgesic are described infra. \n\n\n [0084] The variables, notations, and symbols used in the following paragraphs with respect to formula may not relate to other paragraphs. Therefore, definitions of the notations and symbols in each paragraph are normally limited to it and should not be used to construe other paragraphs, unless indicated otherwise. \n\n\n [0085] In one

residue is a residue of a tricyclic compound having the formula: \n\n\n\n\n \n\n wherein R is selected from lower alkyl and lower acyl. In certain embodiments, R is acetyl. \n\n\n[0104] In some instances, tricyclics can be obtained from commercial sources. In addition, tricyclics can be obtained through chemical synthesis. Examples of tricyclics as well as synthetic approaches for preparing tricyclics are described in the literature and in, for example, DE2030492A1, DE2030492A, DE2030492B2, DE2030492C3, GB1191800A, US2554736, US2948718, US3177209, US3205264, US3244748, US3271451, US3299139, US3312689, US3409640, US3419547, US3438981, US3442949, US3454554, US3467650, US3527766, US3574852, US3622565, US3637660, US3663696, US3758528, US3963778, and US3642775. Each of these (and other) tricyclics can be covalently attached (either directly or through one or more atoms) to a water-soluble and non-peptidic oligomer. \n\n\n [0105] Exemplary molecular weights of small molecule drugs include molecular weights of: less than about 950; less than about 900; less than about 850; less than about 800; less than about 750; less than about 700; less than about 650; less than about 600; less than about 550; less than about 500; less than about 450; less than about 400; less than about 350; and less than about 300. \n\n\n [0106] The small molecule drug used in the invention, if chiral, may be in a racemic mixture, or an optically active form, for example, a single optically active enantiomer, or any combination or ratio of enantiomers (i.e., scalemic mixture). In addition, the small molecule drug may possess one or more geometric isomers. With respect to geometric isomers, a composition can comprise a single geometric isomer or a mixture of two or more geometric isomers. A small molecule dmg for use in the present invention can be in its customary active form, or may possess some degree of modification. For example, a small molecule drug may \n\n have a targeting agent, tag, or transporter attached thereto, prior to or after covalent attachment of an oligomer. Alternatively, the small molecule drug may possess a lipophilic moiety attached thereto, such as a phospholipid (e.g., distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine or \"DSPE,\" dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine or \"DPPE,\" and so forth) or a small fatty acid. In some instances, however, it is preferred that the small molecule drug moiety does not include attachment to a lipophilic moiety. The tricyclic for coupling to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer possesses a free hydroxyl, carboxyl, thio, amino group, or the like (i.e., \"handle\") suitable for covalent attachment to the oligomer. In addition, the tricyclic may be modified by introduction of a reactive group, in certain embodiments by conversion of one of its existing functional groups to a functional group suitable for formation of a stable covalent linkage between the oligomer and the drug. Both approaches are illustrated in the Experimental section. \n\n\n[0107] Accordingly, each oligomer is composed of up to three different monomer types selected from the group consisting of: alkylene oxide, such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide; olefinic alcohol, such as vinyl alcohol, 1-propenol or 2-propenol; vinyl pyrrolidone; \n\n\nhydroxyalkyl methacrylamide or hydroxyalkyl methacrylate, where alkyl is methyl; a-hydroxy acid, such as lactic acid or glycolic acid; phosphazene, oxazoline, amino acids, carbohydrates such as monosaccharides, alditol such as mannitol; and N-acryloylmorpholine. Certain monomer types include alkylene oxide, olefinic alcohol, hydroxyalkyl methacrylamide or methacrylate, N-acryloylmorpholine, and a-hydroxy acid. In certain embodiments, each oligomer is, independently, a co-oligomer of two monomer types selected from this group, or, in certain embodiments, is a homo-oligomer of one monomer type selected from this group. \n\n\n[0108] The two monomer types in a co-oligomer may be of the same monomer type, for example, two alkylene oxides, such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. In certain embodiments, the oligomer is a homo-oligomer of ethylene oxide. Usually, although not necessarily, the terminus (or termini) of the oligomer that is not covalently attached to a small molecule is capped to render it unreactive. Alternatively, the terminus may include a reactive group. When the terminus is a reactive group, the reactive group is either selected such that it is unreactive under the conditions of formation of the final oligomer or during covalent attachment of the oligomer to a small molecule drug, or it is protected as necessary. One common end- functional group is hydroxyl or -OH, particularly for oligoethylene oxides. \n\n [0109] The water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer (e.g., \"POLY\" in various structures provided herein) can have any of a number of different geometries. For example, the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer can be linear, branched, or forked. Most typically, the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer is linear or is branched, for example, having one branch point. Although much of the discussion herein is focused upon poly(ethylene oxide) as an illustrative oligomer, the discussion and structures presented herein can be readily extended to encompass any of the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomers described above. \n\n\n[0110] The molecular weight of the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer, excluding the linker portion, is generally relatively low. Exemplary values of the molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer include: below about 1500; below about 1450; below about 1400; below about 1350; below about 1300: below about 1250; below about 1200; below about 1 150; below about 1 100; below about 1050; below about 1000; below about 950; below about 900; below about 850; below about 800; below about 750; below about 700; below about 650; below about 600; below about 550; below about 500; below about 450; below about 400; below about 350; below about 300; below about 250; below about 200; and below about 100 Daltons. \n\n\n[0111] Exemplary ranges of molecular weights of the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer (excluding the linker) include: from about 100 to about 1400 Daltons; from about 100 to about 1200 Daltons; from about 100 to about 800 Daltons; from about 100 to about 500 Daltons; from about 100 to about 400 Daltons; from about 200 to about 500 Daltons; from about 200 to about 400 Daltons; from about 75 to 1000 Daltons; and from about 75 to about 750 Daltons. \n\n\n [0112] In certain embodiments, the number of monomers in the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer falls within one or more of the following ranges: between about 1 and about 30 (inclusive); between about 1 and about 25; between about 1 and about 20; between about 1 and about 15; between about 1 and about 12; between about 1 and about 10. In certain instances, the number of monomers in series in the oligomer (and the corresponding conjugate) is one of 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. In additional embodiments, the oligomer (and the corresponding conjugate) contains 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 monomers. In yet further embodiments, the oligomer (and the corresponding conjugate) possesses 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30 monomers in series. Thus, for example, when the water-soluble and non-peptidic polymer includes CH3-(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\n-, \"n\" is an integer that can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, \n\n 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30, and can fall within one or more of the following ranges: between about 1 and about 25; between about 1 and about 20; between about 1 and about 15; between about 1 and about 12; between about 1 and about 10. \n\n\n [0113] When the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 monomers, these values correspond to a methoxy end-capped oligo(ethylene oxide) having a molecular weights of about 75, 119, 163, 207, 251, 295, 339, 383, 427, and 471 Daltons, respectively. When the oligomer has 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 monomers, these values correspond to methoxy end-capped oligo(ethylene oxide) having molecular weights corresponding to about 515, 559, 603, 647, and 691 Daltons, respectively. \n\n\n [0114] When the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer is attached to the tricyclic (in contrast to the step-wise addition of one or more monomers to effectively \"grow\" the oligomer onto the tricyclic), the composition containing an activated form of the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer may be monodisperse. In those instances, however, where a bimodal composition is employed, the composition will possess a bimodal distribution centering around any two of the above numbers of monomers. For instance, a bimodal oligomer may have any one of the following exemplary combinations of monomer subunits: 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-9, 1-10, and so forth; 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, 2-7, 2-8, 2-9, 2-10, and so forth; 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 3-7, 3-8, 3-9, 3-10, and so forth; 4-5, 4-6, 4-7, 4-8, 4-9, 4-10, and so forth; 5-6, 5-7, 5-8, 5-9, 5-10, and so forth; 6-7, 6-8, 6-9, 6-10, and so forth; 7-8, 7-9, 7- 10, and so forth; and 8-9, 8-10, and so forth. \n\n\n [0115] In some instances, the composition containing an activated form of the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer will be trimodal or even tetramodal, possessing a range of monomers units as previously described. Oligomer compositions possessing a well-defined mixture of oligomers (i.e., being bimodal, trimodal, tetramodal, and so forth) can be prepared by mixing purified monodisperse oligomers to obtain a desired profile of oligomers (a mixture of two oligomers differing only in the number of monomers is bimodal; a mixture of three oligomers differing only in the number of monomers is trimodal; a mixture of four oligomers differing only in the number of monomers is tetramodal), or alternatively, can be obtained from column chromatography of a polydisperse oligomer by recovering the \"center cut\", to obtain a mixture of oligomers in a desired and defined molecular weight range. \n\n [0116] In certain embodiments the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer is obtained from a composition that is unimolecular or monodisperse. That is, the oligomers in the composition possess the same discrete molecular weight value rather than a distribution of molecular weights. Some monodisperse oligomers can be purchased from commercial sources such as those available from Sigma- Aldrich, or alternatively, can be prepared directly from commercially available starting materials such as Sigma-Aldrich. Water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomers can be prepared as described in Chen Y., Baker, G.L., J. Org. Chem., 6870-6873 (1999), \n\n\nWO 02/098949, and U.S. Patent Application Publication 2005/0136031. \n\n\n[0117] When present, the spacer moiety (through which the water-soluble, non-peptidic polymer is attached to the tricyclic) may be a single bond, a single atom, such as an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom, two atoms, or a number of atoms. A spacer moiety is typically but is not necessarily linear in nature. The spacer moiety, \"X,\" is hydrolytically stable, and in certain embodiments is also enzymatically stable. In certain embodiments, the spacer moiety \"X\" is one having a chain length of less than about 12 atoms, and in certain embodiments less than about 10 atoms, and in certain embodiments less than about 8 atoms and in certain embodiments less than about 5 atoms, whereby length is meant the number of atoms in a single chain, not counting substituents. For instance, a urea linkage such as this, R\no\nii\ng0mer\n-NH-(C=O)-NH-R'\nc\nj\nn\n,\ng>\n is considered to have a chain length of 3 atoms (-NH-C(O)-NH-). In selected embodiments, the linkage does not comprise further spacer groups. \n\n\n [0118] In some instances, the spacer moiety \"X\" comprises an ether, amide, urethane, amine, thioether, urea, or a carbon-carbon bond. Functional groups such as those discussed below, and illustrated in the examples, are typically used for forming the linkages. The spacer moiety may also comprise (or be adjacent to or flanked by) other atoms, as described further below. \n\n\n [0119] More specifically, in selected embodiments, a spacer moiety of the invention, X, may be any of the following: \"-\" (i.e., a covalent bond, that may be stable or degradable, between the tricyclic residue and the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer), -0-, -NH-, -S-, -C(O)-, -C(0)0-, -OC(O)-, -CH\n2\n-C(0)0-, -CH\n2\n-OC(0)-, -C(0)0-CH\n2\n-, -OC(0)-CH\n2\n-, C(0)-NH, NH- C(0)-NH, 0-C(0)-NH, -C(S)-, -CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -O-CH2-, -CH\n2\n-0-, -0-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-0-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-0-, -0-C¾-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, \n\n\n-CH\n2\n-0-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-0-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-0-, -0-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, \n\n -CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-0-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-0-CH\n2\n-, \n\n\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-0-, -C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-, -C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-C(0)-NH-, -C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, \n\n\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-C(0)-NH-, -C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-C¾-C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, \n\n\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, \n\n\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-C(0)-NH -, -NH-C(0)-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-NH-C(0)-CH\n2\n-, \n\n\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-NH-C(0)-CH\n2\n-, -NH-C(0)-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -C¾-NH-C(0)-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n, -CH\n2\n-C¾- NH-C(0)-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n, -C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-, -C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -0-C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-, \n\n\n-0-C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -NH-CH2-, -NH-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-NH-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-NH-CH\n2\n-, - C(0)-C¾-, -C(0)-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-C(0)-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-C(0)-CH\n2\n-, \n\n\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-C(0)-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-C(0)-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-NH-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-NH-C(0)-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-C(0)-NH-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-NH- C(0)-CH\n2\n-, bivalent cycloalkyl group, -N(R\n6\n)-, R\n6\n is H or an organic radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl and substituted aryl. Additional spacer moieties include, acylamino, acyl, aryloxy, alkylene bridge containing between 1 and 5 inclusive carbon atoms, alkylamino, dialkylamino having about 2 to 4 inclusive carbon atoms, piperidino, pyrrolidino, N-(lower alkyl)-2-piperidyl, morpholino, 1-piperizinyl, 4-(lower alkyl)- 1-piperizinyl, 4-(hydroxyl-lower alkyl)- 1-piperizinyl, and 4-(methoxy- lower alkyl)- 1-piperizinyl. \n\n\n [0120] For purposes of the present invention, however, a group of atoms is not considered a linkage when it is immediately adjacent to an oligomer segment, and the group of atoms is the same as a monomer of the oligomer such that the group would represent a. mere extension of the oligomer chain. \n\n\n [0121] The linkage \"X\" between the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer and the small molecule is typically formed by reaction of a functional group on a terminus of the oligomer (or nascent oligomer when it is desired to \"grow\" the oligomer onto the tricyclic) with a \n\n\ncorresponding functional group within the tricyclic. Illustrative reactions are described briefly below, For example, an amino group on an oligomer ma}' be reacted with a carboxylic acid or an activated carboxylic acid derivative on the small molecule, or vice versa, to produce an amide linkage. Alternatively, reaction of an amine on an oligomer with an activated carbonate (e.g. \n\n succinimidyl or benzotriazyl carbonate) on the drug, or vice versa, forms a carbamate linkage. Reaction of an amine on an oligomer with an isocyanate (R-N=C=0) on a drug, or vice versa, forms a urea linkage (R-NH-(C=0)-NH-R'). Further, reaction of an alcohol (alkoxide) group on an oligomer with an alkyl halide, or halide group within a drug, or vice versa, forms an ether linkage. In yet another coupling approach, a small molecule having an aldehyde function is coupled to an oligomer amino group by reductive amination, resulting in formation of a secondary amine linkage between the oligomer and the small molecule. \n\n\n[0122] In certain embodiments the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer is an oligomer bearing an aldehyde functional group. In this regard, the oligomer will have the following structure: CH\n3\n0-(CH\n2\n-C¾-0)\nn\n-(CH\n2\n)\np\n-C(0)H, wherein (n) is one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 and (p) is one of 1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. In certain embodiments, the (n) values include 3, 5 and 7 and the (p) values include 2, 3 and 4. \n\n\n [0123] The termini of the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer not bearing a functional group is capped to render it unreactive. When the oligomer includes a further functional group at a terminus other than that intended for formation of a conjugate, that group is either selected such that it is unreactive under the conditions of formation of the linkage \"X,\" or it is protected during the formation of the linkage \"X.\" \n\n\n [0124] As stated above, the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer includes at least one functional group prior to conjugation. The functional group typically comprises an electrophilic or nucleophilic group for covalent attachment to a small molecule, depending upon the reactive group contained within or introduced into the small molecule. Examples of nucleophilic groups that may be present in either the oligomer or the small molecule include hydroxyl, amine, hydrazine (-NHNH\n2\n), hydrazide (-C(0)NH H\n2\n), and thiol. In certain embodiments nucleophiles include amine, hydrazine, hydrazide, and thiol, particularly amine. Most small molecule drugs for covalent attachment to an oligomer will possess a free hydroxyl, amino, thio, aldehyde, ketone, or carboxyl group. \n\n\n [0125] Examples of electrophilic functional groups that may be present in either the oligomer or the small molecule include carboxylic acid, carboxylic ester, particularly imide esters, orthoester, carbonate, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, aldehyde, ketone, thione, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, sulfone, maleimide, disulfide, iodo, epoxy, sulfonate, thiosulfonate, silane, alkoxysilane, and halosilane. More specific examples of these groups \n\n include succinimidyl ester or carbonate, imidazoyl ester or carbonate, benzotriazole ester or carbonate, vinyl sulfone, chloroethylsulfone, vinylpyridine, pyridyl disulfide, iodoacetamide, glyoxal, dione, mesylate, tosylate, and tresylate (2,2,2-trifluoroethanesulfonate). \n\n\n[0126] Also included are sulfur analogs of several of these groups, such as thione, thione hydrate, thioketal, is 2-thiazolidine thione, etc., as well as hydrates or protected derivatives of any of the above moieties (e.g. aldehyde hydrate, hemiacetal, acetal, ketone hydrate, hemiketal, ketal, thioketal, thioacetal). \n\n\n [0127] An \"activated derivative\" of a carboxylic acid refers to a carboxylic acid derivative that reacts readily with nucleophiles, generally much more readily than the underivatized carboxylic acid. Activated carboxylic acids include, for example, acid ha!ides (such as acid chlorides), anhydrides, carbonates, and esters. Such esters include imide esters, of the general form -(CO)0-N[(CO)-]\n2\n; for example, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS) esters or N-hydroxyphthalimidy] esters. Also included are imidazolyl esters and benzotriazole esters and propionic acid or butanoic acid esters, as described in co-owned U.S. Patent No. 5,672,662. These include groups of the form -(CH\n2\n)2-3C(=0)0-Q, where Q is selected from N-succinimide, N-sulfosuccinimide, N-phthalimide, N-glutarimide, N-tetrahydrophthalimide, N-norbornene-2,3- dicarboximide, benzotriazole, 7-azabenzotriazole, and imidazole. \n\n\n[0128] Other electrophilic groups include succinimidyl carbonate, maleimide, benzotriazole carbonate, glycidyl ether, imidazoyl carbonate, p-nitrophenyl carbonate, acrylate, tresylate, aldehyde, and orthopyridyl disulfide. \n\n\n [0129] These electrophilic groups are subject to reaction with nucleophiles, e.g., hydroxy, thio, or amino groups, to produce various bond types. In certain embodiments the reactions favor formation of a hydrolytically stable linkage. For example, carboxylic acids and activated derivatives thereof, which include orthoesters, succinimidyl esters, imidazolyl esters, and benzotriazole esters, react with the above types of nucleophiles to form esters, thioesters, and amides, respectively, of which amides are the most hydrolytically stable. Carbonates, including succinimidyl, imidazolyl, and benzotriazole carbonates, react with amino groups to form carbamates. Isocyanates (R-N=C=0) react with hydroxyl or amino groups to form, respectively, carbamate (RNH-C(O)-OR') or urea (RNH-C(O)-NHR') linkages. Aldehydes, ketones, glyoxals, diones and their hydrates or alcohol adducts (i.e., aldehyde hydrate, hemiacetal, acetal, ketone \n\n hydrate, hemiketal, and ketal) are preferably reacted with amines, followed by reduction of the resulting imine, if desired, to provide an amine linkage (reductive amination). \n\n\n[0130] Several of the electrophilic functional groups include electrophilic double bonds to which nucleophilic groups, such as thiols, can be added, to form, for example, thioether bonds. These groups include maleimides, vinyl sulfones, vinyl pyridine, acrylates, methacrylates, and acrylamides. Other groups comprise leaving groups that can be displaced by a nucleophile; these include chloroethyl sulfone, pyridyl disulfides (which include a cleavable S-S bond), iodoacetamide, mesylate, tosylate, thiosulfonate, and tresylate. Epoxides react by ring opening by a nucleophile, to form, for example, an ether or amine bond. Reactions involving \n\n\ncomplementary reactive groups such as those noted above on the oligomer and the small molecule are utilized to prepare the conjugates of the invention. \n\n\n[0131] In some instances the tricyclic may not have a functional group suited for conjugation. In this instance, it is possible to modify (or \"functionalize\") the \"original\" tricyclic so that it does have a functional group suited for conjugation. For example, if the tricyclic has an amide group, but an amine group is desired, it is possible to modify the amide group to an amine group by way of a Hofmann rearrangement, Curtius rearrangement (once the amide is converted to an azide) or Lossen rearrangement (once amide is concerted to hydroxamide followed by treatment with tolyene-2-sulfonyl chloride/base). \n\n\n [0132] It is possible to prepare a conjugate of small molecule tricyclic bearing a carboxyl group wherein the carboxyl group-bearing small molecule tricyclic is coupled to an amino- terminated oligomeric ethylene glycol, to provide a conjugate having an amide group covalently linking the small molecule tricyclic to the oligomer. This can be performed, for example, by combining the carboxyl group-bearing small molecule tricyclic with the amino-terminated oligomeric ethylene glycol in the presence of a coupling reagent, (such as \n\n\ndicyclohexylcarbodiimidc or \"DCC\") in an anhydrous organic solvent. \n\n\n [0133] Further, it is possible to prepare a conjugate of a small molecule tricyclic bearing a hydroxyl group wherein the hydroxyl group-bearing small molecule tricyclic is coupled to an oligomeric ethylene glycol halide to result in an ether (-0-) linked small molecule conjugate. This can be performed, for example, by using sodium hydride to deprotonate the hydroxyl group followed by reaction with a halide-terminated oligomeric ethylene glycol. \n\n [0134] Further, it is possible to prepare a conjugate of a small molecule tricyclic moiety bearing a hydroxyl group (such as, for example, the tricyclic moieties having structures encompassed within Formula I) wherein the hydroxyl group-bearing small molecule tricyclic moiety is coupled to an oligomeric ethylene glycol bearing an haloformate group [e.g., \n\n\nCH\n3\n(OCH2CH\n2\n)\nn\nOC(0)-halo, where halo is chloro, bromo, iodo] to result in a carbonate \n\n\n[-0-C(0)-0-] linked small molecule conjugate. This can be performed, for example, by combining a tricyclic moiety and an oligomeric ethylene glycol bearing a haloformate group in the presence of a nucleophilic catalyst (such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine or \"DMAP\") to thereby result in the corresponding carbonate-linked conjugate. \n\n\n [0135] In another example, it is possible to prepare a conjugate of a small molecule tricyclic bearing a ketone group by first reducing the ketone group to form the corresponding hydroxyl group. Thereafter, the small molecule tricyclic now bearing a hydroxyl group can be coupled as described herein. \n\n\n [0136] In still another instance, it is possible to prepare a conjugate of a small molecule tricyclic bearing an amine group. In one approach, the amine group-bearing small molecule tricyclic and an aldehyde-bearing oligomer are dissolved in a suitable buffer after which a suitable reducing agent (e.g., NaCNBH\n3\n) is added. Following reduction, the result is an amine linkage formed between the amine group of the amine group-containing small molecule tricyclic and the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde-bearing oligomer. \n\n\n [0137] In another approach for preparing a conjugate of a small molecule tricyclic bearing an amine group, a carboxylic acid-bearing oligomer and the amine group-bearing small molecule tricyclic are combined, typically in the presence of a coupling reagent (e.g., DCC).\n\n\nThe result is an amide linkage formed between the amine group of the amine group-containing small molecule tricyclic and the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid-bearing oligomer. \n\n\n [0138] The conjugates of the invention can exhibit a reduced blood-brain barrier crossing rate. Moreover, the conjugates maintain at least about 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%,\n\n\n70%, or more of the bioactivity of the unmodified parent small molecule drug. \n\n\n [0139] While it is believed that the full scope of the conjugates disclosed herein behave as described, an optimally sized oligomer can be identified as follows. \n\n\n [0140] First, an oligomer obtained from a monodisperse or bimodal water soluble oligomer is conjugated to the small molecule drug. In certain embodiments, the drug is orally \n\n bioavailable, and on its own, exhibits a non-negligible blood-brain barrier crossing rate. Next, the ability of the conjugate to cross the blood-brain barrier is determined using an appropriate model and compared to that of the unmodified parent drug. If the results are favorable, that is to say, if, for example, the rate of crossing is significantly reduced, then the bioactivity of conjugate is further evaluated. Preferably, the compounds according to the invention maintain a significant degree of bioactivity relative to the parent drug, i.e., greater than about 30% of the bioactivity of the parent drag, or in certain embodiments, greater than about 50% of the bioactivity of the parent drug. \n\n\n [0141] The above steps are repeated one or more times using oligomers of the same monomer type but having a different number of subunits and the results compared. \n\n\n[0142] For each conjugate whose ability to cross the blood-brain barrier is reduced in comparison to the non-conjugated small molecule drug, its oral bioavailability is then assessed. Based upon these results, that is to say, based upon the comparison of conjugates of oligomers of varying size to a given small molecule at a given position or location within the small molecule, it is possible to determine the size of the oligomer most effective in providing a conjugate having an optimal balance between reduction in biological membrane crossing, oral bioavailability, and bioactivity. The small size of the oligomers makes such screenings feasible and allows one to effectively tailor the properties of the resulting conjugate. By making small, incremental changes in oligomer size and utilizing an experimental design approach, one can effectively identify a conjugate having a favorable balance of reduction in biological membrane crossing rate, bioactivity, and oral bioavailability. In some instances, attachment of an oligomer as described herein is effective to actually increase oral bioavailability of the drug. \n\n\n[0143] For example, one of ordinary skill in the art, using routine experimentation, can determine a best suited molecular size and linkage for improving oral bioavailability by first preparing a series of oligomers with different weights and functional groups and then obtaining the necessary clearance profiles by administering the conjugates to a patient and taking periodic blood and/or urine sampling. Once a series of clearance profiles have been obtained for each tested conjugate, a suitable conjugate can be identified. \n\n\n [0144] Animal models (rodents and dogs) can also be used to study oral drug transport.\n\n\nIn addition, non- n vivo methods include rodent everted gut excised tissue and Caco-2 cell , monolayer tissue-culture models. These models are useful in predicting oral drug bioavailability. \n\n [0145] To determine whether the tricyclic or the conjugate of a tricyclic and a water-soluble non-peptidic polymer has activity as a tricyclic therapeutic, it is possible to test such a compound. The tricyclic compounds have sedative, hypnotic, anti-anxiety, tranquilizing, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant effects in mammals and birds. They also exhibit antidepressant and analgesic actions in mammals. \n\n\n [0146] In vitro binding studies to receptors using various cell lines have become routine in pharmaceutical industry. \n\n\n [0147] Sedative effects: Chimney test: The test determines the ability of mice to back up and out of a vertical glass cylinder within 30 seconds. At an effective dosage, 50% of the mice will fail doing it (ED50). \n\n\n [0148] Dish test: Mice in Petri dishes (10 cm diameter, 5 cm high, partially embedded in wood shavings), climb out in a very short time, when not treated. Mice remaining in the dish for more than 3 minutes indicate tranquilization. ED50 equals the dose of test compound at which 50% of the mice remain in the dish. \n\n\n [0149] Pedestal test: The untreated mouse leaves the pedestal in less than a minute to climb back to the floor of the standard mouse box. Tranquilized mice will stay on the pedestal for more than 1 minute. The ED50 (intraperitoneal administration) is determined by identifying the amount of compound that causes 50% of the mice to stay on the pedestal. \n\n\n[0150] Nicotine antagonism test: Mice in a group of 6 are injected with the test compound. Thirty minutes later the mice including control (untreated) mice are injected with nicotine salicylate (2 mg/kg). The control mice show over-stimulation, i.e., (1) running convulsions followed by (2) tonic extensor fits; followed by (3) death. The ED50 (intraperitoneal administration) is determined by identifying the amount of compound that causes 50% of the mice to not show over-stimulation. \n\n\n [0151] Antagonism to strychnine (as sulfate): The test consists of orally administering into mice the test compound, and 30 minutes later 3 mg/kg strychnine sulfate intraperitoneally. The survivors after 4 hours reflect the activity of the compound as a muscle relaxant and antispasmodic. \n\n\n [0152] The main function of an anti-depressant is to return the depressed individual to normal functioning. This should be carefully differentiated from psychic stimulants such as the amphetamines which produce over-stimulation in the normal individual. \n\n [0153] Many different methods have been and are used to evaluate antidepressant activity. In general these methods involve antagonism to a depressant such as reserpine or tetrabenazine or a synergistic increase of the toxicity of certain compounds (i.e. yohimbine or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) and comparison of the drug action of the new compound with other known antidepressants. No single test alone can determine whether or not a new compound is an antidepressant or not, but the profile evidenced by various tests will establish the anti-depressant action if present. A number of such tests are described below. \n\n\n[0154] Hypothermic tests with oxotermorine: [l-(4-pyrrolidino-2-butynyl)-2- pyrrolidinone], Oxotremorine (as well as apomorphine and tetrabenazine) produces hypothermic responses in mice. This response is blocked by anticholinergics and anti-depressants such as atropine and imipramine respectively. Mice are injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg of oxotremorine. The lowering of the body temperature is measured rectally with an electronic thermometer, before and 30 minutes after drug administration. About four degree centigrade difference between the control mice (oxotremorine alone) and the treated mice (oxotremorine and test compound) is used to indicate the antagonistic action of the test compound. \n\n\n[0155] Potentiation of yohimbine aggregation toxicity: Mice are injected with the antidepressant and 30 minutes later with 30 mg of yohimbine hydrochloride in saline solution. After two hours, the LD\n50\n are determined. Normally no mice are killed by 30 mg of yohimbine. If yohimbine is administered in the presence of an anti-depressant an increase of the toxicity of yohimbine is observed. The ED\n50\n value of the test compound is determined. \n\n\n[0156] Potentiation of apomorphine gnawing: Mice are administered the test compound intraperitoneally one hour prior to the subcutaneous injection of apomorphine hydrochloride 10 mg/kg. The mice are then placed in a plastic box (6\"xl 1 \"x5\") lined at the bottom with a cellophane-backed, absorbent paper. The degree of damage to the paper at the end of 30 min is scored from zero to 4. The scores of 3 and 4 indicate that the compound is a potentiator of apomorphine in this test. \n\n\n [0157] To determine whether the tricyclic derivative itself or the conjugate of tricyclic or a derivative thereof has activity (such as analgesic activity), it is possible to test such a compound. For example, the compound of interest can be administered to a mouse topically and analgesia assessed as described in olesnikov et al. (1999) J, Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 290: \n\n\n247-252. Briefly, the distal portion of the tail (2-3 cm) is immersed in a DMSO solution \n\n containing the compound of interest for the stated time, typically two minutes. Testing is performed on the portion of the tail immersed in the treatment solution, because the analgesic actions of agents administered in this manner are restricted to the exposed portions of the tail. Antinociception, or analgesia, is defined as a tail-flick latency for an individual animal that is twice its baseline latency or greater. Baseline latencies typically range from 2.5 to 3.0 seconds, with a maximum cutoff latency of 10 seconds to minimize tissue damage in analgesic animals. ED\n50\n values can be determined. \n\n\n [0158] In another approach for evaluating analgesic activity of the tricyclic derivative itself or the conjugate of tricyclic or a derivative thereof, a \"writhing test\" can be conducted. Briefly, a 0.7% acetic acid solution is administered (i.p.) to a mouse and the numbers of writhing responses are counted for ten minutes. Thereafter, the compound to be tested is administered [by, for example, injection (e.g., subcutaneous injection)] to the mouse and antinociception is quantified as per cent inhibition using the following formula: % inhibition = [(control responses- test responses)/control responses] x 100. \n\n\n [0159] The present invention also includes pharmaceutical preparations comprising a conjugate as provided herein in combination with a pharmaceutical excipient. Generally, the conjugate itself will be in a solid form (e.g., a precipitate), which can be combined with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient that can be in either solid or liquid form. \n\n\n[0160] Exemplary excipients include, without limitation, those selected from the group consisting of carbohydrates, inorganic salts, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, surfactants, buffers, acids, bases, and combinations thereof. \n\n\n [0161] A carbohydrate such as a sugar, a derivatized sugar such as an alditol, aldonic acid, an esterified sugar, and/or a sugar polymer may be present as an excipient. Specific carbohydrate excipients include, for example: monosaccharides, such as fructose, maltose, galactose, glucose, D-mannose, sorbose, and the like; disaccharides, such as lactose, sucrose, trehalose, cellobiose, and the like; polysaccharides, such as raffmose, melezitose, maltodextrins, dextrans, starches, and the like; and alditols, such as mannitol, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol, sorbitol, myoinositol, and the like. \n\n\n [0162] The excipient can also include an inorganic salt or buffer such as citric acid, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium nitrate, sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, and combinations thereof. \n\n [0163] The preparation may also include an antimicrobial agent for preventing or deterring microbial growth. Nonlimiting examples of antimicrobial agents suitable for the present invention include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorobutanol, phenol, phenylethyl alcohol, phenylmercuric nitrate, thimersol, and combinations thereof. \n\n\n [0164] An antioxidant can be present in the preparation as well. Antioxidants are used to prevent oxidation, thereby preventing the deterioration of the conjugate or other components of the preparation. Suitable antioxidants for use in the present invention include, for example, ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, hypophosphorous acid, monothioglycerol, propyl gallate, sodium bisulfite, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, sodium metabisulfite, and combinations thereof. \n\n\n [0165] A surfactant may be present as an excipient. Exemplary surfactants include: polysorbates, such as \"T een 20\" and \"Tween 80,\" and pluronics such as F68 and F88 (both of which are available from BASF, Mount Olive, NJ); sorbitan esters; lipids, such as phospholipids such as lecithin and other phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, fatty acids and fatty esters; steroids, such as cholesterol; and chelating agents, such as EDTA, zinc and other such suitable cations. \n\n\n [0166] Pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases may be present as an excipient in the preparation. Nonlimiting examples of acids that can be used include those acids selected from the group consisting of hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, formic acid, trichloroacetic acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, and combinations thereof. Examples of suitable bases include, without limitation, bases selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, sodium acetate, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium formate, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, potassium fumerate, and combinations thereof. \n\n\n [0167] The amount of the conjugate in the composition will vary depending on a number of factors, but will optimally be a therapeutically effective dose when the composition is stored in a unit dose container. A therapeutically effective dose can be determined experimentally by repeated administration of increasing amounts of the conjugate in order to determine which amount produces a clinically desired endpoint. \n\n [0168] The amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary depending on the activity of the excipient and particular needs of the composition. Typically, the optima] amount of any individual excipient is determined through routine experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other parameters, and then determining the range at which optimal performance is attained with no significant adverse effects. \n\n\n [0169] Generally, however, excipients will be present in the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, in certain embodiments from about 5%-98% by weight, in certain embodiments from about 15-95% by weight of the excipient, and in certain embodiments less than 30% by weight. \n\n\n [0170] These foregoing pharmaceutical excipients along with other excipients and general teachings regarding pharmaceutical compositions are described in \"Remington: The Science & Practice of Pharmacy\", 19\nth\n ed., Williams & Williams, (1 95), the \"Physician's Desk Reference\", 52\nnd\n ed., Medical Economics, Montvale, NJ (1998), and ibbe, A.H., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3\nrd\n Edition, American Pharmaceutical Association, Washington, D.C., 2000. \n\n\n [0171] The pharmaceutical compositions can take any number of forms and the invention is not limited in this regard. Exemplary preparations are most preferably in a form suitable for oral administration such as a tablet, caplet, capsule, gel cap, troche, dispersion, suspension, solution, elixir, syrup, lozenge, transdermal patch, spray, suppository, and powder. \n\n\n[0172] Oral dosage forms are preferred for those conjugates that are orally active, and include tablets, caplets, capsules, gel caps, suspensions, solutions, elixirs, and syrups, and can also comprise a plurality of granules, beads, powders or pellets that are optionally encapsulated. Such dosage forms are prepared using conventional methods known to those in the field of pharmaceutical formulation and described in the pertinent texts. \n\n\n [0173] Tablets and caplets, for example, can be manufactured using standard tablet processing procedures and equipment. Direct compression and granulation techniques are preferable when preparing tablets or caplets containing the conjugates described herein. In addition to the conjugate, the tablets and caplets will generally contain inactive, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier materials such as binders, lubricants, disintegrants, fillers, stabilizers, surfactants, coloring agents, flow agents, and the like. Binders are used to impart cohesive \n\n qualities to a tablet, and thus ensure that the tablet remains intact. Suitable binder materials include, but are not limited to, starch (including com starch and pregelatinized starch), gelatin, sugars (including sucrose, glucose, dextrose and lactose), polyethylene glycol, waxes, and natural and synthetic gums, e.g., acacia sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulosic polymers (including hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, and the like), and Veegum. Lubricants are used to facilitate tablet manufacture, promoting powder flow and preventing particle capping (i.e., particle breakage) when pressure is relieved. Useful lubricants are magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, and stearic acid. Disintegrants are used to facilitate disintegration of the tablet, and are generally starches, clays, celluloses, algins, gums, or crosslinked polymers. Fillers include, for example, materials such as silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, alumina, talc, kaolin, powdered cellulose, and microcrystalline cellulose, as well as soluble materials such as mannitol, urea, sucrose, lactose, dextrose, sodium chloride, and sorbitol. Stabilizers, as well known in the art, are used to inhibit or retard drug decomposition reactions that include, by way of example, oxidative reactions. \n\n\n[0174] Capsules are also preferred oral dosage forms, in which case the \n\n\nconjugate-containing composition can be encapsulated in the form of a liquid or gel (e.g., in the case of a gel cap) or solid (including particulates such as granules, beads, powders or pellets). Suitable capsules include hard and soft capsules, and are generally made of gelatin, starch, or a cellulosic material. Two-piece hard gelatin capsules are preferably sealed, such as with gelatin bands or the like. \n\n\n [0175] Included are parenteral formulations in the substantially dry form (typically as a lyophilizate or precipitate, v/hich can be in the form of a powder or cake), as well as \n\n\nformulations prepared for injection, which are typically liquid and requires the step of reconstituting the dry form of parenteral formulation. Examples of suitable diluents for reconstituting solid compositions prior to injection include bacteriostatic water for injection, dextrose 5% in water, phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution, saline, sterile water, deionized water, and combinations thereof. \n\n\n [0176] In some cases, compositions intended for parenteral administration can take the form of nonaqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions, each typically being sterile. Examples \n\n of nonaqueous solvents or vehicles are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. \n\n\n[0177] The parenteral formulations described herein can also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. The formulations are rendered sterile by incorporation of a sterilizing agent, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, irradiation, or heat. \n\n\n [0178] The conjugate can also be administered through the skin using conventional transdermal patch or other transdermal delivery system, wherein the conjugate is contained within a laminated structure that serves as a drug delivery device to be affixed to the skin. In such a structure, the conjugate is contained in a layer, or \"reservoir,\" underlying an upper backing layer. The laminated structure can contain a single reservoir, or it can contain multiple reservoirs. \n\n\n [0179] The conjugate can also be formulated into a suppository for rectal administration.\n\n\nWith:respect to suppositories, the conjugate is mixed with a suppository base material which is (e.g., an excipient that remains solid at room temperature but softens, melts or dissolves at body temperature) such as coca butter (theobroma oil), polyethylene glycols, glycerinated gelatin, fatty acids, and combinations thereof. Suppositories can be prepared by, for example, performing the following steps (not necessarily in the order presented): melting the suppository base material to form a melt; incorporating the conjugate (either before or after melting of the suppository ba se material); pouring the melt into a mold; cooling the melt (e.g., placing the melt-containing mold in a room temperature environment) to thereby form suppositories; and removing the suppositories from the mold. \n\n\n [0180] The invention also provides a method for administering a conjugate as provided herein to a patient suffering from a condition that is responsive to treatment with the conjugate. The method comprises administering, generally orally, a therapeutically effective amount of the conjugate (preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation). Other modes of administration are also contemplated, such as pulmonary, nasal, buccal, rectal, sublingual, transdermal, and parenteral. As used herein, the term \"parenteral\" includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intra-arterial, intraperitoneal, intracardiac, intrathecal, and intramuscular injection, as well as infusion injections. \n\n [0181] In instances where parenteral administration is utilized, it may be necessary to employ somewhat bigger oligomers than those described previously, with molecular weights ranging from about 500 to 30K Daltons (e.g., having molecular weights of about 500, 1000, 2000, 2500, 3000, 5000, 7500, 10000, 15000, 20000, 25000, 30000 or even more). \n\n\n[0182] The method of administering may be used to treat any condition that can be ' remedied or prevented by administration of the particular conjugate. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate which conditions a specific conjugate can effectively treat. The actual dose to be administered will vary depend upon the age, weight, and general condition of the subject as well as the severity of the condition being treated, the judgment of the health care professional, and conjugate being administered. Therapeutically effective amounts are known to those skilled in the art and/or are described in the pertinent reference texts and literature. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount will range from about 0.001 mg to 1000 mg, preferably in doses from 0.01 mg/day to 750 mg/day, and in certain embodiments in doses from 0.10 mg/day to 500 mg/day. \n\n\n [0183] The unit dosage of any given conjugate (again, preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation) can be administered in a variety of dosing schedules depending on the judgment of the clinician, needs of the patient, and so forth. The specific dosing schedule will be known by those of ordinary skill in the art or can be determined experimentally using routine methods. Exemplary dosing schedules include, without limitation, administration five times a day, four times a day, three times a day, twice daily, once daily, three times weekly, twice weekly, once weekly, twice monthly, once monthly, and any combination thereof. Once the clinical endpoint has been achieved, dosing of the composition is halted. \n\n\n[0184] One advantage of administering the conjugates of the present invention is that a reduction in first pass metabolism may be achieved relative to the parent drug. Such a result is advantageous for many orally administered drugs that are substantially metabolized by passage through the gut. In this way, clearance of the conjugate can be modulated by selecting the oligomer molecular size, linkage, and position of covalent attachment providing the desired clearance properties. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine the ideal molecular size of the oligomer based upon the teachings herein. In certain embodiments reductions in first pass metabolism for a conjugate as compared to the corresponding nonconjugated small drug molecule include: at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30; at least about 40; at \n\n least about 50%; at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80% and at least about 90%. \n\n\n [0185] Thus, the invention provides a method for reducing the metabolism of an active agent. The method comprises the steps of: providing monodisperse or bimodal conjugates, each conjugate comprised of a moiety derived from a small molecule drug covalently attached by a stable linkage to, a water-soluble oligomer, wherein said conjugate exhibits a reduced rate of metabolism as compared to the rate of metabolism of the small molecule drug not attached to the water-soluble oligomer; and administering the conjugate to a patient. Typically, administration is carried out via one type of administration selected from the group consisting of oral administration, transdermal administration, buccal administration, transmucosa! administration, vaginal administration, rectal administration, parenteral administration, and pulmonary administration. \n\n\n [0186] Although useful in reducing many types of metabolism (including both Phase I and Phase II metabolism can be reduced), the conjugates are particularly useful when the small molecule drug is metabolized by a hepatic enzyme (e.g., one or more of the cytochrome P450 isoforms) and/or by one or more intestinal enzymes. \n\n\n [0187] All articles, books, patents, patent publications and other publications referenced herein are incorporated by reference in their entireties.

Other aspects, advantages and modifications within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains. \n\n\n [0189] All non-PEG chemical reagents referred to in the appended examples are commercially available unless otherwise indicated. The preparation of PEG-mers is described in, for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0136031. \n\n [0190] All H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) data were generated by a NMR spectrometers. A list of certain compounds as well as the source of the compounds is provided below. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0191] Desipramine, iminodibenzyl, sodium hydride (NaH), l-bromo-3-chloropropane, lithium amide (LiNH\n2\n) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). DCM was dislilled from Ca¾. DMF (anhydrous), toluene (anhydrous), and other organic solvents were used as they purchased. \n\n\n [0192] Desipramine (2.00 g, 6,60 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (40 mL) and saturated NaHC0\n3\n (80 mL). The reaction was kept at room temperature for 30 min and the solution pH was >10. After the methanol was removed under reduced pressure, the aqueous solution was extracted with DCM (50 mL + 25 mL x 2). The combined organic layers were dried over Na\n2\nS0\n4\n, filtered, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was solidified overnight by vacuum drying and a yellowish sample (1.79 g, >100% yield) was obtained. \n\n\n [0193] The above free desipramine (170 mg, 0.64 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (3.2 mL). NaH (46 mg, 1.92 mmol, 3 eq) was added and the reaction was kept at room temperature for 5 min. mPEG\n3\n-Br (283 μί, 1.28 mmol, 2 eq) was added and the reaction was allowed to stir overnight (16 h). Upon obtaining a clear solution, the reaction was quenched with NH\n4\nCI (50 mL) and extracted with DCM (15 mL x 3). The organic phases were combined and dried over Na\n2\nS0\n4\n. After filtration, DCM was evaporated and DMF was rotavapped under high vacuum. \n\n The resulting residue was loaded onto a Biotage 12M column and purified with 2-20% methanol in DCM within 15 CV. The product was monitored under 254 nm and collected (1 4.7 mg, 74% yield). A mixture of product and starting material was also collected and saved. \n\n\n[0194] mPEG\n5\n-Br and mPEG\n8\n-Br were used for the other desipramine derivative syntheses using a similar procedure.

The solution was protected under N\n2\n. After l -bromo-3- chloropropane ( 1 .48 mL, 15 mmol) was added, the solution became clear at room temperature. LiNH\n2\n (276 rag, 12 mmol) was then added and the tube was sealed. The microwave reaction was carried oiit at I 20°C over 18 hrs. The reaction was quenched with a saturated aqueciw NaHCOj solution and . extracted with EtOAc (50 mL x 2). The combined organic phases, were dried over MgS0\n4\n and the solvent removed under reduced pressure, The resulting residue was loaded onto a Biotage 25M column and eluted with 1 -6% of EtOAc in Iiexarie over 15 CV. A pure sample fraction was used to mn NMR and all other fraction mixtures were combined. A slight yellowish product (2.57 g, 95% yield) was collected after overnight drying under high vacuum. \n\n\n[0200] mPEG\n7\n-desipramine: The above iminodibenzyl alleviation product mixture (325 mg, 1.2 mmol) was added to a microwave reaction tube together with mPEG7-NH\n2\n (340 μί, 1.0 mmol), K2CO3 (207 mg, 1.5 mmol) was added with H\n2\n0 (1 mL). The starting material was suspended at the top layer f the water phase - stirring was difficult before heating occurred. The microwave reaction was carried oat at 120°C over 2 hrs, The reaction was monitored by TLC for the disappearance of mPEG-NI¾. The reaction was then diluted with an aqueous NalTCO? solution and extracted with CM (10 mL x 3). The combined organic phases were dried over MgSC>4, filtered, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was loaded onto a Biotage 25M column and purified with eluting 2- 1 8% methanol in DCM over 20 CV. A colorless product (193 mg, 34% yield) was collected after overnight drying. The desired \n\n product was identified by NMR and LC-MS and analytical -HP LC indicated the purity to be over 98%. \n\n\n [0201] mPEG\n3\n-desipramine: The reaction was carried out in a similar manner as above.\n\n\nHowever,\n'\n the product mixture contained a nearly 1 : 1 ratio of mono- to di-alkylation products which were inseparable by TLC.

The radioligands used were specific for each receptor subtype and the assay conditions are described in Table 2. Following incubations, the membranes were washed and the bound radioactivity was \n\n measured. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of excess unlabelled ligand; this value was subtracted from the total binding yielding the specific binding at each test compound concentration. \n\n\n [0219] IC50 values were obtained from non-linear regression analysis of dose-response curves and were calculated only for those compounds that showed >50% inhibition of binding at the highest concentration tested. ¾ was obtained using the Cheng Prusoff correction using experimental ¾ values that were previously determined under the same assay conditions. \n\n\n[0220] The binding affinities of amitriptyline and mPEG-amitriptyline conjugates are shown in Table 1. Amitriptyline and PEG-amitriptyline conjugates displayed high affinity binding to the HI receptor. PEG conjugation resulted in less than 20-fold reduction in binding affinity, and this effect was PEG size dependent. \n\n\n [0221] Binding affinity at the H2 receptor was nearly 3 orders of magnitude lower than that at the HI receptors for all the molecules tested. mPEG conjugation also resulted in a reduction in binding affinity at the H2 receptors, and this effect was also PEG size dependent. \n\n\n[0222] Kj values could not be determined for the mPEG-6 and mPEG-7 amitriptyline at the H2 receptors, since >50% inhibition could not be observed at the highest concentration tested. The loss in binding affinity at the H2 receptor (>63-fold versus parent) was greater than the loss in binding affinity at the HI receptor (<23 -fold versus parent) suggesting that mPEG conjugation increased the HI :H2 receptor selectivity, making the mPEG-amitriptyline conjugates more selective for HI receptors. No measurable binding to the H3 and H4 receptors was detected at the highest concentrations tested.

The procedure produced rod-shaped, ion tolerant cells which were used within 24 hours after isolation (Dumb el aL 1995, Am J Physiol 263:Hi335-H1342). \n\n\n [0225] Dorsal root ganglion neurons were prepared from rats, post-natal day 14-13 (Blair aud-Bean, 2002, JNeurosci 22: 10277- 10290). Animals were anesthetized with iscflurane, decapitated, and ganglia were removed. Pieces of ganglia were treated to produce individual cells that were used within 43 hours after isolation. \n\n\n [0226] The whole-cell patch clamp technique was earned out at 23 ± 1 °C with precise micromanipulation under high power visual magnification to measure sodium currents. Glass pipettes were fire polished to produce tip diameters of 1-4.μιη. The tip of the pipette, filled with electrolyte \"internal\" solution (a composition of (m ): 115 CsF, 20 CsCl, lO NaF, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA; pH adjusted to 7,2 with CsOH) was positioned onto a cell. The cell was in a bathing \"external\" solution (consisting of (nyM): 115 TMA chloride, 10 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 1.8 Ca'¾ 1.2 MgCl\n2\n, 10 HEPES, 1 1 dextrose, pH adjusted to 7.4 with TMA-OH). Pipette tip resistance was approximately 1.0 to 2.0 ΜΩ when filled with the internal solution. Suction was then applied to the pipette interior to seal■\n)\n tie cell membrane onto the tip. Another suction pulse then broke the membrane, establishing electrical access into the interior of the. cell. The cellular interior .tb^n became dialyzed by the solution the patch pipette was filled .with. \n\n\n [0227] \n.\n After rupture of the cell membrane (entering whole-cell mode), current kinetics and amplitudes were allowed to stabilize (currents elicited by a series of voltage pulses given, at 0.1 Hz were superimposed), as the cell was dialyzed with internal solution and paced at 1 Hz. (3- 5 minutes). Sodium current (I\nNa\n) was measured using a voltage pulse to -20 mV (40 ins pulse duration) from a holding potential of -120 mV. Peak inward current was measured for I\nNa\n. \n\n Pacing rates of 0.1 and 3 Hz were examined. Test article, at concentrations of 0.1, 1. 3, 10, 30, and 100 μΜ, was added in a cumulative manne to a cell, Stock solutions of all compounds were prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 10 n M. To test for cell sensitivity, 1 μΜ TTX \n\n\n(tetrodotoxin) was added after exposure to test article. Exposure of 2 cardiac cells to TTX · resulted in 47.2 arid 56.8% reduction of I\nNa\n. Exposure of 2 neuronal cells to TTX resulted in 93.2 and 96.8% reduction of I\nNa\n. \n\n\n [0228] Currents and voltages were recorded with patch-clamp amplifiers (Axopatch 1-B,\n\n\nAxon Instruments). Creation of voltage clamp pulses and data acquisition was controlled by a computer using electrophysiology software (pCLAMP version 9.2, Axon Instruments, now MDS, Sunnyvale, CA). Data was presented as % reduction of current amplitude, measured as current reduction after a steady-state effect had been reached in the presence of test article relative to current amplitude before introduction of test article (control). Each cell served as its own control. \n\n\n [0229] Approximate 1C\n50\n values (Table 3) were obtained from non-linear regression analysis of dose-response curves, using GraphPad's Prism 5.01 software, for cardiac and neuronal ]·►\n¾\n. Alternativel , data were analyzed for mean percent inhibition ± SEM at the highest concentration tested (100 μΜ) where >50% inhibition of IN\n3\n could not be obtained. \n\n\n[0230] Carbamazepine and its PEG conjugates were tested for rate-dependent inhibition of cardiac and neuronal sodium channels. All PEG conjugates had similar activity as the parent compound at both cardiac. (Figure 1) and neuronal (Figure 2) sodium channels. Under the conditions of the assay, all test articles produced incomplete block of sodium channels and a reliable IC50 could not be obtained when concentrations up to 100 μΜ were used. All test articles exhibited a lower affinity for neuronal versus cardiac I a (Figure 3); the. response of the. parent compound was consistent with published reports demonstrating that carbamazepine has a lower affinity for neuronal IN\n8\n versus cardiac IN\n≥\n. The data suggest that PEG conjugation does not alter the intrinsic pharmacology of the parent carbamazepine at cardiac and neuronal sodium channels. \n\n Table 3. Summary of sodium channel blocking effects of carbamazepine series. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 7 \n\n\nNoradrenalin Transporter Binding Assay \n\n\n[0231] The binding affinities of desipramine and five PEG conjugates were evaluated using radioligand binding assays in membranes prepared from rat forebrain which express noradrenalin transporters. \n\n\n [0232] Competition binding experiments were conducted by incubating membranes with\n\n\n1.0 nM of radioligand, [ H]-nisoxetine, in the presence of variable concentrations (0.1 nM to 3 μΜ and 3 nM to 100 μΜ for parent and PEG conjugates, respectively) of test compounds. The reaction was carried out in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1 at 0-4°C for 4 hours. Following incubations, the membranes were washed, and the bound radioactivity was measured. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of excess desipramine (1.0 μΜ) as the cold ligand; this value was subtracted from the total binding to yield the specific binding at each test compound concentration. \n\n\n [0233] IC50 values were obtained from non-linear regression analysis of dose-response curves (Figure 4) and were calculated for those compounds that showed >50% inhibition of binding at the highest concentration tested. Kj was obtained using the Cheng Prusoff correction using experimental ¾ values that were previously determined under these assay conditions. \n\n\n[0234] The binding affinities of desipramine and mPEG-desipramine conjugates are shown in Table 4. PEG-desipramine conjugates displayed lower affinity to noradrenalin transporters relative to de ipramine. PEG conjugation resulted in greater than 739-folds reduction in binding affinity, and this effect was dependent on chemistry at the conjugation site. \n\n\n[0235] Compared to the parent, the loss in binding affinity was smaller for inPEG-N- than those for mPEG-NH- conjugates at similar PEG sizes (739 to 1058-folds and 2972 to 3336- folds, respectively, relative to parent). \n\n Table 4. Summary of binding affinity to noradrenalin transporters. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 8 \n\n\nMuscarinic Receptor Binding Assay \n\n\n[0236] The receptor binding affinities of amitriptyline and four amitriptyline-PEG conjugates were evaluated using radioligand binding assays in membranes prepared from CHO cells that express the recombinant human Ml, M2, M3, M4 or M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Competition binding experiments were conducted by incubating membranes with a fixed concentration of rad ioligand in the presence of variabl e concentrations of test compounds. \n3\nH-N-Methylscopolamine at 0.8 nM was used as the radioligand for all receptor subtypes. \n\n\nIncubations were carried out for 2 hours at 25°C in buffer containing 50 raM Tris HC1, 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM EDTA. Following incubations, the membranes were washed the bound radioactivity was measured. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of excess Atropine as the cold ligand and subtraction of this value from the total binding yielded the specific binding at each test compound concentration. IC\n50\n values were obtained from non-linear regression analysis of dose-response curves and were calculated only for those compounds that showed >50% inhibition of binding at the highest concentration tested. Ki was obtained using the \n\n Cheng Prusoff correction using Kd values that were experimental determined previously under these assay conditions. \n\n\n [0237] The binding affinities of amitriptyline and the PEG conjugates at the five muscarinic receptor subtypes are shown in Table 1. Amitriptyline displayed high binding affinity to all muscarinic receptor subtypes, with Ki values ranging from ~10 -90 nM and displayed little selectivity for any muscarinic receptor subtype. In contrast, the PEG conjugates displayed a marked reduction in binding affinity at all subtypes- the Ki at any particular receptor subtype\n,\n was reduced 10-100-fold. In several cases, a significant inhibition of radioligand binding could not be obtained at the highest concentration tested and hence data are shown as \"no significant binding\". These data suggest that PEG conjugation significantly reduces the binding affinity of amitriptyline to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. \n\n\nMolecule Ki (nM) \n\n\nMl M2 M3 M4 M5 \n\n\nAmitriptyline 9.83 87.1 35.4 23.9 17 mPEG-3- No No No No No \n\n\n Amitriptyline significant significant significant significant significant binding binding binding binding binding mPEG-5- No No No No No \n\n\n Amitriptyline significant significant significant significant significant binding binding binding binding binding mPEG-6- 869 1170 No No No \n\n\n Amitriptyline significant significant significant binding binding binding mPEG-7- No 1 140 No No No \n\n\n Amitriptyline significant significant significant significant binding binding\n'\n binding binding \n\n EXAMPLE 9 \n\n\n Analgesic Assay \n\n\n[0238] An analgesic assay was used to determine whether a given compound can reduce and/or prevent visceral pain in mice. \n\n\n [0239] The assay utilized CD- 1 male mice (5-8 mice per group), each mouse being approximately 0.015-0.030 kg on the study day. Mice were treated according to standard protocols. \n\n\n [0240] Mice were given a single \"pretreatment\" dose of a compound lacking covalent attachment of a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer, a corresponding version comprising the compound covalently attached to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer, or control solution (IV, SC, IP or orally) thirty minutes prior to the administration of the acetic acid solution. The animal was given an IP injection of an irritant (acetic acid) that induces \"writhing\" which may include: contractions of the abdomen, twisting and turning of the trunk, arching of the back and the extension of the hindlimbs. Mice were given a single IP injection (0.1 mL/10 g bodyweight) of a 0.5% acetic acid solution. After the injection the animals were returned to their observation enclosure and their behavior was observed. Contractions were counted between 0 and 20 minutes after the injection. The animals were used once. Each tested article was dosed at 1 , 3 and 10 mg/kg (n=5 animal s/dose). \n\n\n [0241] Figure 5 shows the analgesia activity of the tested compound against the standard analgesic, morphine. \n\n\n EXAMPLE 10 \n\n\n S nthesis of mPEG-n-Oxcarbazapine \n\n\n \n\n n = 3, 5, 7 \n\n [0242] Oxcarbazepine (e.g., 118 mg, 0.5 mmol) is dissolved in 5 ml THF, and NaH\n\n\n(60%, 60 mg, 1.5 mmol) is added to the solution. The mixture is stirred for 5 min. before mPEG\nn\n-Br [n = 3, 5, 7] (0.6 mmol) is added. The resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 14 h. The solid is removed and 150 ml dichloromethane is added. The organic phase is washed with H\n2\n0 (2 x 1 0mL), dried over Na\n2\nS0\n4\n and solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The crude product is purified by column chromatography (Biotage Flash \n\n\nChromatography System, [A: MeOH, 1-4% (20CV), 4-6% (10CV), B: DCM]. The desired product is obtained as sticky oil (yield: 60-80%). \n\n\n Example 11 \n\n\n Nueropathic Pain Model \n\n\n[0243] The following model was used to asses certain compounds of the present invention. \n\n\n [0244] Animals: Male Holtzman rats were purchased from Harlan Laboratories.\n\n\nThe weight of the animals at the time of surgery averaged 200-250 grams. Animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled environment with a constant natural 12 hours light/12 hours dark cycle and adequate food and water at all times. \n\n\n [0245] Anesthesia method: General anesthesia for L5 spinal nerve transection was induced and maintained with isoflurane (3% for induction, 2% for maintenance). \n\n\n[0246] L5 spinal nerve transection: A clean, aseptic technique was used for the entire procedure. To expose the L5 spinal nerve, a 3-cm incision was made to the skin overlying L5- Sl. The muscle tissue was separated and retracted from the left superior articular processes and the transverse process. The L6 transverse process was then partially removed. The L5 spinal nerve was transected after being gently separated from the L4 spinal nerve. The wound was then irrigated with sterile saline and closed in two layers using 5-0 silk suture (fascial plane) and surgical skin staples. \n\n\n [0247] Oral administration procedure: Test article (Oxcarbazepine, m-PEG-3 oxcarbazapine, m-PEG-5 oxcarbazapine, and m-PEG-7 oxcarbazapine, as prepared in Example 10) was administered in blinded fashion at 50 mg/kg on day 7 post-L5 spinal nerve transection via oral gauvage. \n\n [0248] Mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia: Animals were acclimated to the environment and the experimenter prior to the start of the study. Mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia were evaluated using a series of calibrated von Frey filaments (2-, 6-, 10-, 15-, 26- and 60-gram filaments; Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) to elicit a cutaneous flexion withdrawal response (paw withdrawal response) in rats on an elevated wire mesh (2 mm openings) under non-restrained conditions. The von Frey filaments were pressed to the point of bending against the plantar surface of the hindpaw on the same side as the nerve transection. A positive response was scored when the rat lifts its paw. The 2 g, 6 g and 10 g von Frey filaments were used to assess allodynia since these stimuli are normally innocuous to na\n'\nive animals and elicit few responses prior to nerve transection. Following nerve transection and prior to oral administration of test articles the animals respond robustly to the 2 g, 6 g, and 10 g von Frey filaments. The 15 g, 26 g and 60 g filaments are used to assess hyperalgesia (response to noxious stimulus) since these stimuli elicit paw withdrawals in na\n'\nive animals and an increased number of paw withdrawals followed nerve transection. In the absence of treatment, the mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia remains stable for at least 3 weeks. Evaluation of mechanical allodynia or hyperalgesia was determined by counting the number of paw withdrawals in response to 5 applications of each of the von Frey filaments to the hindpaw on the same side as the nerve transection. Results are expressed either as the total number of paw withdrawals for the allodynic filaments (2 g, 6 g and 10 g for a total of 15 possible paw withdrawals) or the hyperalgesic filaments (15 g, 26 g and 60 g for a total of 15 possible paw withdrawals). \n\n\n[0249] Thermal hyperalgesia: Thermal hyperalgesia was evaluated using the Hargreaves test. For these studies, individual rats were tested in a plexiglass boxes placed on a room temperature glass surface above a radiant heat source focused on the medial plantar surface of the affected hindpaw. When the heat source is turned on, the animals hindpaw is heated from below. The time until the animal lifts its hindpaw (paw withdrawal latency, measured in seconds) is an indicator of thermal hyperalgesia. Under the conditions used in this study, paw withdrawal latency decreases from 10-12 seconds prior to nerve injury to 6-8 seconds after L5 nerve transection, indicating the development of thermal hyperalgesia. In the absence of further treatment, the thermal hyperalgesia remained stable for at least three weeks. \n\n\n[0250] The results of the above tests are summarized in Figures 6-8."
