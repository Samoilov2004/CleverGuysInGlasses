Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 12/881,234 filed Sep. 14, 2010, which is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 12/141,228 filed Jun. 18, 2008 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/948,213 filed Jul. 6, 2007.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to non-basic melanin concentrating hormone receptor-1 (MCHR1) antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions containing MCHR1 antagonists and methods of treating diabetes, obesity and related diseases employing such MCHR1 antagonists.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nSeveral lines of pharmacological and genetic evidence support the role of Melanin Concentrating Hormone Receptor-1 (hereafter “MCHR1”) as a modulator of food intake and body weight. Central administration of melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) increases food intake and body weight both in rats and in mice. Chronic ICV infusion of MCH causes increased food intake and ultimately obesity in mice, while infusion of an MCH peptide antagonist blocks MCH-induced food intake and results in weight loss and decreased feeding in diet-induced obese mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression of both the MCH peptide and receptor are modulated by nutritional status. MCH mRNA is upregulated both in hyperphagic obese mice (ob/ob), and fasted animals. Targeted disruption of the gene for MCH peptide results in hypophagia and leanness. Disruption of the MCHR1 gene causes leanness, altered metabolism, and hyperlocomotion accompanied by mild hyperphagia. Conversely, over-expression of MCH peptide results in hyperphagia, obesity and diabetes. Small molecule MCHR1 antagonists have been shown to cause weight loss in rodent weight and feeding models after both oral and intraperitoneal administration; \nEur. J. Pharmacol., \n438:129-135 (2002), \nNat. Med., \n8:825-830 (2002), \nEur. J. Pharmacol., \n497:41-47 (2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous non-peptide MCHR1 antagonists have been disclosed. The scope of the genus for each reflects a common perception regarding the criteria required for ligand recognition as MCHR1 agonists. A recent review of MCHR1 patent disclosures emphasized the commonality of these structures by the following description; “Ubiquitous throughout the MCH patent literature are molecules consisting of a central scaffold to which linkers to an aryl or heteroaryl group and a basic amino functionality are attached.” (Kowalski, T. J. et al., \nExpert Opin. Investig. Drugs, \n13:1113-1122 (2004)). Pharmacophore models of these geni consistently envision a presumed prerequisite electrostatic interaction between a basic amine center of the antagonist ligand and aspartic acid 123 of the receptor which presumably is envisaged to emulate the mandatory interaction between arginine 14 of MCH peptide agonists with aspartic acid 123 of the MCHR1 receptor. (Ulven, T., \nJ. Med. Chem., \n48:5684-5697 (2005)) However, incorporation of this basic amine in a MCHR1 antagonist increases substantially the probability of binding to off-target ion-channels and biogenic amine receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, there is provided a series of novel high affinity selective MCHR1 antagonists for which binding affinity is not dependent upon inclusion of a basic amine functionality that is common to most of the disclosed MCHR antagonists. As a consequence, the absence of the basic center greatly reduces the probability of off-target interactions such as binding to other biogenic amine receptors as well as binding to ion channels such as the HERG receptor in the heart. The reduction abolition of affinity for the HERG receptor is especially important since ligand occupancy is associated with initiation of fatal arrhythmias.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, a compound of the Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is provided\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis a phenylene ring or a heteroaryl ring which is a monocyclic ring or a bicyclic ring which contains one or two nitrogen atoms or one oxygen atom;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nis Z—Y—X—, wherein\n\n \n \n \n \n \nX is O, S,\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nY is a bond, a 3- to 6-membered cycloalkyl, or an alkyl chain; and\n\n\nZ is aryl such as phenyl and naphthyl, or heteroaryl such as pyridinyl, pyridimidinyl, pyrazinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, or other “heteroaryl”;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nR\n2 \nis -E-G-(J)\nm\n, with m being an integer from 1 to 3;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nE is O, S, or a bond;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG is lower alkyl, phenylalkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, alkylcycloalkyl, cycloalkoxy, alkylcycloalkoxy, or cycloalkoxyalkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \neach J is independently hydrogen, hydroxyl, CN, —SO\n2\nR\n7\n, —SR\n7\n, —SOR\n7\n, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, CF\n3\n, CF\n3\nO—, —COOR\n5 \n(wherein R\n5 \nis H, C\n1-3 \nalkyl, or cycloalkyl), or —CO—NR\n5a\nR\n6 \nwherein R\n5a \nand R\n6 \nare each independently selected from H, alkyl, or cycloalkyl, or R\n5a \nand R\n6 \ntaken together can be propanediyl, butanediyl or pentanediyl to form with the N atom to which they are attached a 4-, 5- or 6-membered cyclic amine, such as azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, or piperazinyl, optionally substituted with substituents as set out for “heterocyclo”;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n7 \nis lower alkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n3 \nis C\n1-6 \nalkyl, cycloalkyl, C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, halogen, hydrogen, —S—C\n1-6 \nalkyl, CN, CF\n3\nO, or CF\n3\n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nand wherein R\n2 \nand R\n3 \ncan be taken together to form a 5- to 7-membered ring which is saturated, unsaturated, or partially unsaturated and may include an E heteroatom, which is O, or 0, 1 or 2 N atoms, which ring is substituted with one or two of —O-G-(J)\nm \ngroups, wherein at least one J is OH, and optionally other substituents as set out for “alkyl”, “aryl”, or “heteroaryl”, such as alkyl and/or OH;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwith the proviso that where\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis a phenylene ring, E-G and R\n3 \nare not identical unsubstituted lower alkoxy groups, and when G is lower alkyl and J is H, R\n3 \nis not hydrogen; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n8 \nand R\n9 \nare each independently hydrogen, halogen, or lower alkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nincluding esters thereof, prodrugs thereof, solvates thereof, and all stereoisomers thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the foregoing Z moieties may either be unsubstituted or substituted with 1, 2 or 3 of amino, halo, C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n1-3 \nalkylamino, di-C\n1-3 \nalkylamino, C\n1-3 \nalkoxy, C\n1-3 \nthioalkyl, C\n1-3 \ntrifluoroalkoxy, trifluoromethyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkoxy, or heteroaryl such as pyridyl or substituted with any of the substituents as set out for “aryl”, “heteroaryl”, or “alkyl”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of substituents for the J group in the form of a cyclic amine include but are not limited to lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, OH, CF\n3\n, or CF\n3\nO, or other substituents as set out for “alkyl” and “heteroaryl”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which contains a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the invention Formula I as defined above, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is also provided a method for the treatment of diabetes, obesity and other related conditions involving the MCHR1 in a mammal (such as a human, dog or cat) in need thereof, which includes the steps of administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of Formula I of the invention as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also sets forth one or more methods for making the compound of Formula I of the invention.

Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred. If the compounds of Formula I have, for example, at least one basic center, they can form acid addition salts. These are formed, for example, with strong inorganic acids, such as mineral acids, for example sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid (phosphate ester) or a hydrohalic acid, with organic carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example acetic acid, which are unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by halogen as chloroacetic acid, such as saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or terephthalic acid, such as hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, such as amino acids, (for example aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, valine, lysine, or arginine), or benzoic acid, or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C\n1\n-C\n4\n) alkyl or arylsulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted, for example by halogen, for example methyl- or p-toluene-sulfonic acid. Corresponding acid addition salts can also be formed having, if desired, an additionally present basic center. The compounds of Formula I having at least one acid group (for example COOH) can also form salts with bases. Suitable salts with bases are, for example, metal salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium or magnesium salts, or salts with ammonia or an organic amine, such as morpholine, thiomorpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, a mono, di or tri-lower alkylamine, for example ethyl, tart-butyl, diethyl, diisopropyl, triethyl, tributyl or dimethyl-propylamine, or a mono, di or trihydroxy lower alkylamine, for example mono, di or triethanolamine. Corresponding internal salts may furthermore be formed. Salts which are unsuitable for pharmaceutical uses but which can be employed, for example, for the isolation or purification of free compounds of Formula I or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are also included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred salts of the compounds of Formula I which contain a basic group include monohydrochloride, hydrogensulfate, methanesulfonate, phosphate, nitrate or acetate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred salts of the compounds of Formula I which contain an acid group include sodium, potassium and magnesium salts and pharmaceutically acceptable organic amines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention are contemplated, either in admixture or in pure or substantially pure form. The compounds of the present application can have asymmetric centers at any of the carbon atoms including any one of the R substituents. Consequently, compounds of Formula I can exist in enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms or in mixtures thereof. The processes for preparation can utilize racemates, enantiomers or diastereomers as starting materials. When diastereomeric or enantiomeric products are prepared, they can be separated by conventional methods for example, chromatographic or fractional crystallization.\n\n\n \nUtility\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present application can be administered to mammals, preferably humans, for the treatment of a variety of conditions and disorders, including, but not limited to metabolic and eating disorders as well as conditions associated with metabolic disorders (e.g., obesity, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, polycystic ovary disease, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, dermatological disorders, impaired glucose hemostasis, insulin resistance, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, choletithiasis, dislipidemic conditions, bulimia nervosa and compulsive eating disorders); sleep disorders; and psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, substance abuse, cognition-enhancement and Parkinson's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds described in the present application could be used to enhance the effects of cognition-enhancing agents, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., tacrine), muscarinic receptor-1 agonists (e.g., milameline), nicotinic agonists, glutamic acid receptor (AMPA and NMDA) modulators, and nootropic agents (e.g., piracetam, levetiracetam).

Therefore, the compounds described in the present application could be used in combination with therapeutics for treating sleep disorders. Examples of suitable therapies for treatment of sleeping disorders for use in combination with the compounds of the present application include melatonin analogs, melatonin receptor antagonists, ML 1 B agonists, GABA receptor modulators; NMDA receptor modulators, histamine-3 (H3) receptor modulators, dopamine agonists and orexin receptor modulators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMCHR1 antagonists may reduce or ameliorate substance abuse or addictive disorders. Therefore, combination of cannabinoid receptor modulators with agents used to treat addictive disorders may reduce the dose requirement or improve the efficacy of current addictive disorder therapeutics. Examples of agents used to treat substance abuse or addictive disorders are: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), methadone, buprenorphine, nicotine and bupropion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMCHR1 antagonists may reduce anxiety or depression; therefore, the compounds described in this application may be used in combination with anti-anxiety agents or antidepressants. Examples of suitable anti-anxiety agents for use in combination with the compounds of the present application include benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, chlorazepate, halazepam and prazepam), 5HT1A receptor agonists (e.g., buspirone, flesinoxan, gepirone and ipsapirone), and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable classes of anti-depressants for use in combination with the compounds of the present application include norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (tertiary and secondary amine tricyclics), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (isocarboxazid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, selegiline), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (RIMAs) (moclobemide), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (venlafaxine), corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptor antagonists, alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists, and atypical antidepressants (bupropion, lithium, nefazodone, trazodone and viloxazine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combination of a conventional antipsychotic drug with a MCHR1 antagonist could also enhance symptom reduction in the treatment of psychosis or mania. Further, such a combination could enable rapid symptom reduction, reducing the need for chronic treatment with antipsychotic agents. Such a combination could also reduce the effective antipsychotic dose requirement, resulting in reduced probability of developing the motor dysfunction typical of chronic antipsychotic treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable antipsychotic agents for use in combination with the compounds of the present application include the phenothiazine (chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, thioridazine, acetophenazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine and trifluoperazine), thioxanthine (chlorprothixene, thiothixene), heterocyclic dibenzazepine (clozapine, olanzepine and aripiprazole), butyrophenone (haloperidol), diphenylbutylpiperidine (pimozide) and indolone (molindolone) classes of antipsychotic agents. Other antipsychotic agents with potential therapeutic value in combination with the compounds in the present application include loxapine, sulpiride and risperidone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombination of the compounds in the present application with conventional antipsychotic drugs could also provide an enhanced therapeutic effect for the treatment of schizophrenic disorders, as described above for manic disorders. As used here, schizophrenic disorders include paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated and residual schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder and psychotic disorder not specified. Examples of suitable antipsychotic drugs for combination with the compounds in the present application include the antipsychotics mentioned above, as well as dopamine receptor antagonists, muscarinic receptor agonists, 5HT2A receptor antagonists and 5HT2A/dopamine receptor antagonists or partial agonists (e.g., olanzepine, aripiprazole, risperidone, ziprasidone).\n\n\n \nDosage Forms\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be administered in oral dosage form The dosage form for said pharmaceutical composition includes such oral dosage forms as granules, powders, tablets, capsules, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, etc. and such non-oral dosage fruits as injections (e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular and intraperitoneal injections), drip infusions, external application forms (e.g., nasal spray preparations, transdermal preparations, ointments, etc.), and suppositories (e.g., rectal and vaginal suppositories).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese dosage forms can be manufactured by the per se known technique conventionally used in pharmaceutical procedures. The specific manufacturing procedures are as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo manufacture an oral dosage form, an excipient (e.g., lactose, sucrose, starch, mannitol, etc.), a disintegrator (e.g., calcium carbonate, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, etc.), a binder (e.g., α-starch, gum arabic, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylcellulose, etc.), and a lubricant (e.g., talc, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol 6000, etc.), for instance, are added to the active component or components and the resulting composition is compressed. Where necessary, the compressed product is coated, by the per se known technique, for masking the taste or for enteric dissolution or sustained release. The coating material that can be used includes, for instance, ethylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyoxyethylene glycol, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, and Eudragit (Rohm & Haas, Germany, methacrylic-acrylic copolymer).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjections can be manufactured typically by the following procedure. The active component or components are dissolved, suspended or emulsified in an aqueous vehicle (e.g., distilled water, physiological saline, Ringer's solution, etc.) or an oily vehicle (e.g., vegetable oil such as olive oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, etc. or propylene glycol) together with a dispersant, e.g., Tween 80 (Atlas Powder, U.S.A.), HCO 60 (Nikko Chemicals), polyethylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, sodium alginate, etc.), a preservative (e.g., methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, benzyl alcohol, chlorobutanol, phenol, etc.), an isotonizing agent (e.g., sodium chloride, glycerol, sorbitol, glucose, inverted sugar, etc.) and other additives. If desired, a solubilizer (e.g., sodium salicylate, sodium acetate, etc.), a stabilizer (e.g., human serum albumin), a soothing agent (e.g., benzalkonium chloride, procaine hydrochloride, etc.) and other additives can also be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA dosage form for external application can be manufactured by processing the active component or components into a solid, semi-solid or liquid composition. To manufacture a solid composition, for instance, the active component or components, either as they are or in admixture with an excipient (e.g., lactose, mannitol, starch, microcrystalline cellulose, sucrose, etc.), a thickener (e.g., natural gums, cellulose derivatives, acrylic polymers, etc.), etc., are processed into powders. The liquid composition can be manufactured in substantially the same manner as the injections mentioned above. The semi-solid composition is preferably provided in a hydrous or oily gel form or an ointment form. These compositions may optionally contain a pH control agent (e.g., carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, etc.), and a preservative (e.g., p-hydroxybenzoic acid esters, chlorobutanol, benzalkonium chloride, etc.), among other additives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuppositories can be manufactured by processing the active component or components into an oily or aqueous composition, whether solid, semi-solid or liquid. The oleaginous base that can be used includes, for instance, higher fatty acid glycerides [e.g., cacao butter, Witepsols (Dinamit-Nobel), etc.], medium-chain fatty acids [e.g., Migriols (Dinamit-Nobel), etc.], vegetable oils (e.g., sesame oil, soybean oil, cotton-seed oil, etc.), etc. The water-soluble base includes, for instance, polyethylene glycols propylene glycol, etc. The hydrophilic base includes, for instance, natural gums, cellulose derivatives, vinyl polymers, and acrylic polymers, etc.\n\n\n \nDosages\n\n\n \n \n \nThe dosage of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be appropriately determined with reference to the dosages recommended for the respective active components and can be selected appropriately according to the recipient, the recipient's age and body weight, current clinical status, administration time, dosage form, method of administration, and combination of the active components, among other factors. For example, the dosage of the compound of Formula I of the invention for a human adult can be selected from the clinical oral dose range of 0.01 to 30 mg/kg body weight (preferably 0.05 to 10 mg/kg body weight, more preferably 0.05 to 5 mg/kg body weight) or the clinical parenteral dose range of 0.005 to 10 mg/kg body weight (preferably 0.01 to 10 mg/kg body weight, more preferably 0.01 to 1 mg/kg body weight) or 1 to 1000 mg/day. The other active component or components having different modes of action for use in combination can also be used in dose ranges selected by referring to the respective recommended clinical dose ranges. Administration is generally carried out in a single dose/day or in divided doses, for example, 2 to 4 times a day.\n\n\n \nAbbreviations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following abbreviations may be employed herein:\n\n\n \n \nPh=phenyl\n\n\nBn=benzyl\n\n\nt-Bu=tertiary butyl\n\n\nMe=methyl\n\n\nEt=ethyl\n\n\nTMS=trimethylsilyl\n\n\nTBS tert-butyldimethylsilyl\n\n\nEt\n2\nO=diethyl ether\n\n\nEtOAc=ethyl acetate\n\n\nMeOH=methanol\n\n\nEtOH=ethanol\n\n\ni-PrOH=isopropanol\n\n\nHOAc or AcOH=acetic acid\n\n\ni-Pr\n2\nNEt=diisopropylethylamine\n\n\nEt\n3\nN=triethylamine\n\n\nDMAP=4-dimethylaminopyridine\n\n\nNaBH\n4\n=sodium borohydride\n\n\nn-BuLi=n-butyllithium\n\n\nPd/C=palladium on carbon\n\n\nKOH=potassium hydroxide\n\n\nNaOH=sodium hydroxide\n\n\nLiOH=lithium hydroxide\n\n\nK\n2\nCO\n3\n=potassium carbonate\n\n\nNaHCO\n3\n=sodium bicarbonate\n\n\nAr=argon\n\n\nN\n2\n=nitrogen\n\n\nmin=minute(s)\n\n\nh or hr=hour(s)\n\n\nL=liter\n\n\nmL=milliliter\n\n\nμL=microliter\n\n\ng=gram(s)\n\n\nmg=milligram(s)\n\n\nmol=moles\n\n\nmmol=millimole(s)\n\n\nmeq=milliequivalent\n\n\nRT=room temperature\n\n\nsat or sat'd=saturated\n\n\naq.=aqueous\n\n\nTLC=thin layer chromatography\n\n\nHPLC=high performance liquid chromatography\n\n\nLC/MS=high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry\n\n\nMS or Mass Spec=mass spectrometry\n\n\nNMR=nuclear magnetic resonance\n\n\nmp=melting point\n\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are provided to illustrate various preferred embodiments of the invention, and should not be construed as limiting the scope thereof.\n\n\n \nGeneral Experimental Information Section\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the following examples, nomenclature conforms to either IUPAC or CAS guidelines; was generated using (or is consistent with) the Autonom® module (version 2.1) distributed with ChemDraw Ultra 6.0®; or are taken from vendor literature.\n\n\n \n \nbrine=saturated aqueous sodium chloride\n\n\nDIC=diisopropylcarbodiimide\n\n\n\n \nDMF=N,N-dimethylformamide\n\n\nHOBT=Hydroxybenzotriazole\n\n\n \n \n \nPyBOP=benzotriazo-1-yl-oxy-trispyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluoroborate\n\n\nTFA=trifluoroacetic acid\n\n\nTHF=tetrahydrofuranyl\n\n\nWSC=1[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride\n\n\n\n \nAnalytical Chromatography Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nHPLC: column:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethod 1: Phenom-Luna (ODS) S-5, 4.6 mm×50 mm; flow-5.0 mL/min.; detection at 220 nm; solvent—A=10% methanol/water+0.2% phosphoric acid, B=90% methanol/water+0.2% phosphoric acid; gradient-linear, 0% B to 100% B over 4 min and 100% B for 1 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethod 2: YMC Combiscreen S-5, 4.6 mm×50 mm; flow-4.0 mL/min.; detection at 220 nm; solvent—A=10% methanol/water+0.2% phosphoric acid, B=90% methanol/water+0.2% phosphoric acid; gradient-linear, 0% B to 100% B over 4 min and 100% B for 1 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLC MS: column-Phen-Luna (S5 ODS column) 4.6 mm×30 mm; detection at 220 nm; flow-4 mL/min; solvent—A=10% methanol/water+0.1% TFA, B=90% methanol/water+0.1% TFA; linear gradient, 0% B to 100% B over 2 min and 100% B for 1 min.\n\n\n \nPreparative HPLC Chromatography Method\n\n\n \n \n \nPhenomenex Luna C18, S5, 21×100 mm; flow-20 mL/min, detection at 220 nm; solvent—A=10% methanol/water+0.1% TFA, B=90% methanol/water+0.1% TEA; gradient-linear, 10% B to 90% B over 20 min.\n\n\n \nGeneral Experimental Procedures for Preparation of 3-(Arylthio)-1-(aryl)pyrazin-2(1H)-one\n\n\nPreparation of 1-Aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEthyl oxalyl chloride (7.8 g, 6.8 mL, 57 mmol) was added to a mixture of 3,4-dimethoxyaniline (4.4 g, 29 mmol) and K\n2\nCO\n3 \n(14 g, 140 mmol) in EtOAc (44 mL) and water (12 mL) at 0° C.

In the case of 3-methoxy-4-(2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethoxy)aniline which contained a basic amine, the reaction was brought to pH 6 to 7 with saturated NaHCO\n3 \nand then evaporated in vacuo. The residue was absorbed on silica gel and purified by flash chromatography (5 to 15% 2N NH\n3 \nin MeOH/CH\n2\nCl\n2\n) to afford the desired 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione in 36% yield. This material was subsequently converted to final product following the procedure described in Method 2.\n\n\n \nMethod 4\n\n\n \n \n \nIf the oxalamide as described in Part A contained a primary or secondary alcohol, prolonged thermal heating in TFA/HOAc at 78° C. for 1 day not only effected ring closure but also converted the alcohol moiety to an acetate. The resulting 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione was converted to the desired 3-thio substituted-1-arylpyrazin-2-one employing Method 1. Following workup and purification as described in Method 1, the acetylated product was converted to the desired 3-thio substituted-1-arylpyrazin-2-one (19 mg, 0.041 mmol) bearing a free hydroxyl by dissolution in MeOH (1.0 mL) and H\n2\nO (0.1 mL) and stirring at ambient temperature for 1 h after addition of potassium carbonate (30 mg). The reaction was then diluted with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n/H\n2\nO prior to extraction with CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(2×). After drying the combined organic layers over MgSO\n4\n, concentration afforded the desired final product (16 mg, 93% yield).\n\n\n \nMethod 5\n\n\n \n \n \nFor weakly nucleophilic thiols more forcing conditions were required effect PyBOP mediated conversion of the 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione to a 3-thio substituted-1-arylpyrazin-2-ones. Accordingly, a DMF solution (0.4 mL) containing the 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione prepared in Part B (92 mg, 0.30 mmol), PyBOP (0.27 g, 0.53 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.16 mL, 0.9 mmol) was stirred for 3 h before addition of a DMF solution prepared by stirring 5-methoxybenzo[d]thiazole-2-thiol (296 mg, 1.502 mmol) with NaH (60.1 mg, 1.502 mmol, rinsed with hexane 2×) in DMF (0.2 mL) at ambient temperature for 10 min. After stirring at ambient temperature for 7 days, the reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and washed sequentially with water (2×) and brine prior to drying over MgSO\n4\n. After evaporation of the solvent, CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(10 mL) was added to the 0.30 g of crude product. Filtration to remove any residual solids followed by evaporation of the filtrate afforded 0.10 g crude product. Final purification required flash chromatography on 12 g silica gel using gradient elution (0 to 100% EtOAc/CH\n2\nCl\n2\n) followed by preparatory HPLC (YMC S5 ODS 20×100 mm, 20 mL/min, 30 to 100% B in A over 10 min, Solvent A=10% MeOH/H\n2\nO-0.1% TFA, Solvent B=90% MeOH/H\n2\nO−0.1% TFA) to afford pure desired product (6.3 mg, 4% yield).\n\n\n \nMethod 6\n\n\nGeneral Experimental Procedures for Preparation of 1-(4-(2-Hydroxy-2-methylpropoxy)-3-methylphenyl)-3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylthio)pyrazin-2(1H)-one\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPart A.

The rats were conditioned for 5 days prior to the start of the study to having a choice of foods. A normal chow (Harlan Teklad, 2018) that contains 18% protein, 5% fat and 73% carbohydrate and a high fat high sugar diet (Research Diets (D2327) that contains 20% protein, 40% fat and 40% carbohydrate where the carbohydrate is entirely sucrose and the fat is soybean and coconut oil. Studies have revealed that rats exhibit a high preference for the high fat/high sucrose diet (80% preference). Body weight and consumption of both kinds of food as well as water intake were measured daily. Water was available ad lib throughout the study.

Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83:1017-1066) as well as in peripheral tissues, such as, for example, in the pancreas, brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, placenta, and liver (Giang, D. K. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997, 94, 2238-2242; Cravatt et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004, 101, 29, 10821-10826). FAAH hydrolyzes the fatty acid amide (FAA) family of endogenous signaling lipids. General classes of fatty acid amides include the N-acylethanolamides (NAEs) and fatty acid primary amides (FAPAs). Examples of NAEs include anandamide (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA). An example of FAPAs includes 9-Z-octadecenamide or oleamide. (McKinney M K and Cravatt B F. 2005. Annu Rev Biochem 74:411-32). Another class of fatty acid amide family of endogenous signaling lipids is N-acyl taurines that have also been shown to be elevated upon FAAH deletion or inhibition and appear to act on transient receptor potential (TRP) family of calcium channels, although the functional consequences are not yet clear (Saghatelian A, et al. Biochemistry. 2004, 43:14332-9, Saghatelian A, et al. Biochemistry, 2006, 45:9007-9015). In addition to fatty acid amides, FAAH can also hydrolyze certain fatty acid esters, such as, for example, 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) another endocannabinoid (Mechoulam et al. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50:83-90; Stella et al. Nature, 1997; 388:773-778; Suguria et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215:89-97).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of FAAH is expected to lead to an increase in the level of anandamide and other fatty acid amides. This increase in fatty acid amides leads to an increase in the noiceptive threshold. Thus, inhibitors of FAAH are useful in the treatment of pain (Cravatt, B F; Lichtman, A H Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2003, 7, 469-475). Such inhibitors are useful in the treatment of other disorders that can be treated using fatty acid amides or modulators of cannabinoid receptors, such as, for example, anxiety, sleep disorder, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson's disease, eating disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and inflammation (Simon et al Archives of Gen. Psychiatry, 2006, 63, 824-830. Kunos, G et al. \nPharmacol Rev \n2006, 58,389-462). In some embodiments, FAAH inhibitor compounds may be peripherally restricted and may not substantially affect neural disorders, such as, for example, depression and anxiety. Finally, agonism of cannabinoid receptors has also been shown to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis in animal models (see Steffens et al. Nature, 2005, 434, 782-786; and Steffens et al., Curr Opin. Lipid., 2006, 17, 519-526). Thus, increasing the level of endogenous cannabinergic fatty acid amides (e.g., anandamide) is expected to effectively treat or reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of FAAH also leads to elevation of palmitoylethanolamide which is thought to work, in part, through activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α) to regulate multiple pathways including, for example, pain perception in neuropathic and inflammatory conditions such as convulsions, neurotoxicity, spacticity and to reduce inflammation, for example, in atopic eczema and arthritis (LoVerme J et al. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha mediates the anti-inflammatory actions of palmitoylethanolamide. \nMol Pharmacol \n2005, 67, 15-19; LoVerme Jet al The search for the palmitoylethanolamide receptor. \nLife Sci \n2005, 77: 1685-1698. Lambert D M et al. The palmitoylethanolamide family: a new class of anti-inflammatory agents? \nCurr Med Chem \n2002, 9: 663-674; Eberlein B, et al. Adjuvant treatment of atopic eczema: assessment of an emollient containing N-palmitoylethanolamine (ATOPA study). J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2008, 22:73-82. Re G, et al. Palmitoylethanolamide, endocannabinoids and related cannabimimetic compounds in protection against tissue inflammation and pain: potential use in companion animals. Vet J. 2007 173:21-30.). Thus, inhibition of FAAH is useful for the treatment of various pain and inflammatory conditions, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, skeletomuscular pain, and fibromyalgia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also thought that certain fatty acid amides, such as, for example, OEA, act through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α) to regulate diverse physiological processes, including, e.g., feeding and lipolysis. Consistent with this, human adipose tissue has been shown to bind and metabolize endocannabinoids such as anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol (see Spoto et al., Biochimie 2006, 88, 1889-1897; and Matias et al., J. Clin. Endocrin. & Met., 2006, 91, 3171-3180). Thus, inhibiting FAAH activity in vivo leads to reduced body fat, body weight, caloric intake, and liver triglyceride levels. However, unlike other anti-lipidemic agents that act through PPAR-α, e.g., fibrates, FAAH inhibitors do not cause adverse side effects such as rash, fatigue, headache, erectile dysfunction, and, more rarely, anemia, leukopenia, angioedema, and hepatitis (see, e.g., Muscari et al. Cardiology, 2002, 97: 115-121).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany fatty acid amides are produced on demand and rapidly degraded by FAAH. As a result, hydrolysis by FAAH is considered to be one of the essential steps in the regulation of fatty acid amide levels in the central nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues and fluids. The broad distribution of FAAH combined with the broad array of biological effects of fatty acid amides (both endocannabinoid and non-endocannabinoid mechanisms) suggests that inhibition of FAAH leads to altered levels of fatty acid amides in many tissues and fluids and may be useful to treat many different conditions. FAAH inhibitors increase the levels of endogenous fatty acid amides. FAAH inhibitors block the degradation of endocannabinoids and increase the tissue levels of these endogenous substances. FAAH inhibitors can be used in this respect in the prevention and treatment of pathologies in which endogenous cannabinoids and or any other substrates metabolized by the FAAH enzyme are involved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe various fatty acid ethanolamides have important and diverse physiological functions. As a result, inhibitor molecules that selectively inhibit FAAH enzymatic activity would allow a corresponding selective modulation of the cellular and extra-cellular concentrations of a FAAH substrate. FAAH inhibitors that are biologically compatible could be effective pharmaceutical compounds when formulated as therapeutic agents for any clinical indication where FAAH enzymatic inhibition is desired. In some embodiments, FAAH activity in peripheral tissues can be preferentially inhibited. In some embodiments, FAAH inhibitors that do substantially cross the blood-brain-barrier can be used to preferentially inhibit FAAH activity in peripheral tissues. In some embodiments, FAAH inhibitors that preferentially inhibit FAAH activity in peripheral tissues can minimize the effects of FAAH inhibition in the central nervous system. In some embodiments, it is preferred to inhibit FAAH activity in peripheral tissues and minimize FAAH inhibition in the central nervous system.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to certain oxazole derivatives which are useful as inhibitors of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH). The invention is also concerned with pharmaceutical formulations comprising these compounds as active ingredients and the use of the compounds and their formulations in the treatment of certain disorders, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, skeletomuscular pain, and fibromyalgia, as well as acute pain, migraine, sleep disorder,

Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds. Formula I shows the structure of the class of compounds without preferred stereochemistry. The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration. If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is described using the following definitions unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “halogen” or “halo” includes F, Cl, Br, and I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkyl” means linear or branched structures and combinations thereof, having the indicated number of carbon atoms.

Neurological and psychological disorders that would benefit from inhibition of FAAH activity include, for example, pain, depression, anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive compulsive disorders, stress, stress urinary incontinence, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, schizophrenia, psychosis, Parkinson's disease, muscle spasticity, epilepsy, diskenesia, seizure disorders, jet lag, and insomnia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFAAH inhibitors can also be used in the treatment of a variety of metabolic syndromes, diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including but not limited to, insulin resistance syndrome, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease, obesity, atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis. FAAH inhibitors are useful in the treatment of a variety of painful syndromes, diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including but not limited to those characterized by non-inflammatory pain, inflammatory pain, peripheral neuropathic pain, central pain, deafferentiation pain, chronic nociceptive pain, stimulus of nociceptive receptors, phantom and transient acute pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of FAAH activity can also be used in the treatment of a variety of conditions involving inflammation. These conditions include, but are not limited to arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder tendonitis or bursitis, gouty arthritis, and aolymyalgia rheumatica), organ-specific inflammatory diseases (such as thyroiditis, hepatitis, inflammatory bowel diseases), asthma, other autoimmune diseases (such as multiple sclerosis), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic rhinitis, and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, FAAH inhibitors are useful in preventing neurodegeneration or for neuroprotection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, it has been shown that when FAAH activity is reduced or absent, one of its substrates, anandamide, acts as a substrate for COX-2, which converts anandamide to prostamides (Weber et al J Lipid. Res. 2004; 45:757). Concentrations of certain prostamides may be elevated in the presence of a FAAH inhibitor. Certain prostamides are associated with reduced intraocular pressure and ocular hypotensivity. Thus, in one embodiment, FAAH inhibitors may be useful for treating glaucoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, FAAH inhibitors can be used to treat or reduce the risk of EMDs, which include, but are not limited to, obesity, appetite disorders, overweight, cellulite, Type I and Type II diabetes, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, steatohepatitis, liver steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, Syndrome X, insulin resistance, diabetic dyslipidemia, anorexia, bulimia, anorexia nervosa, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, inflammatory disorders or conditions, Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease, vascular inflammation, inflammatory bowel disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, thrombosis, or cachexia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, FAAH inhibitors can be used to treat or reduce the risk of insulin resistance syndrome and diabetes, i.e., both primary essential diabetes such as Type I Diabetes or Type II Diabetes and secondary nonessential diabetes. Administering a composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of an in vivo FAAH inhibitor reduces the severity of a symptom of diabetes or the risk of developing a symptom of diabetes, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, liver steatosis, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, foot ulceration, or cataracts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, FAAH inhibitors can be used to treat food abuse behaviors, especially those liable to cause excess weight, e.g., bulimia, appetite for sugars or fats, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, FAAH inhibitors can be used to treat a subject suffering from an EMD and also suffers from a depressive disorder or from an anxiety disorder. Preferably, the subject is diagnosed as suffering from the depressive or psychiatric disorder prior to administration of the FAAH inhibitor composition. Thus, a dose of a FAAH inhibitor that is therapeutically effective for both the EMD and the depressive or anxiety disorder is administered to the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the subject to be treated is human. However, the methods can also be used to treat non-human mammals. Animal models of EMDs such as those described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,946,491 are particularly useful.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFAAH inhibitor compositions can also be used to decrease body-weight in individuals wishing to decrease their body weight for cosmetic, but not necessarily medical considerations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA FAAH inhibitor composition can be administered in combination with a drug for lowering circulating cholesterol levels (e.g., statins, niacin, fibric acid derivatives, or bile acid binding resins). FAAH inhibitor compositions can also be used in combination with a weight loss drug, e.g., orlistat or an appetite suppressant such as diethylpropion, mazindole, orlistat, phendimetrazine, phentermine, or sibutramine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “treating” encompasses not only treating a patient to relieve the patient of the signs and symptoms of the disease or condition but also prophylactically treating an asymptomatic patient to prevent the onset of the disease or condition or preventing, slowing or reversing the progression of the disease or condition. The term “amount effective for treating” is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The term also encompasses the amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “treating” encompasses not only treating a patient to relieve the patient of the signs and symptoms of the disease or condition but also prophylactically treating an asymptomatic patient to prevent the onset of the disease or condition or preventing, slowing or reversing the progression of the disease or condition. The term “amount effective for treating” is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.

The present invention is meant to comprehend such possible diastereomers as well as their racemic and resolved, enantiomerically pure fowls and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula I as an active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, thereof, and may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethyl-morpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compound of the present invention is basic, salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids, including inorganic and organic acids. Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and the like. Particularly preferred are citric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, maleic, phosphoric, sulfuric, and tartaric acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood that in the discussion of methods of treatment which follows, references to the compounds of Formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe magnitude of prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of Formula I will, of course, vary with the nature and the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of Formula I and its route of administration. It will also vary according to a variety of factors including the age, weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and response of the individual patient. In general, the daily dose from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, preferably 0.01 mg to about 10 mg per kg. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain from about 0.5 mg to about 5 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain from about 1 mg to about 2 g of an active ingredient, typically 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, or 1000 mg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the treatment of FAAH mediated diseases the compound of Formula I may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In addition to the treatment of warm-blooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, cats, etc., the compound of the invention is effective in the treatment of humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, solutions, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavouring agents, colouring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl mono stearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water-miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents, one or more flavouring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavouring and colouring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Cosolvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols may also be used. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ambient temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical use, creams, ointments, gels, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing a compound of Formula I are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.) Topical formulations may generally be comprised of a pharmaceutical carrier, cosolvent, emulsifier, penetration enhancer, preservative system, and emollient.\n\n\n \nAssays\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following assays illustrate the utility of the invention:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention underwent pharmacological evaluations to determine their inhibitory effect on the enzyme FAAH (Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assist in assay development stable cell lines for human, murine and rat full length FAAH were developed. Human FAAH cDNA (Accession No: N114\n—\n001441.1) was purchased from Origene (Rockville, Md.). The full length FAAH was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pcDEF.neo, using XbaI and EcoRI restriction sites and used for stable cell line generation.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruct\n\n\nPrimer\n\n\nSequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull length\n\n\n1\n\n\nCAAGGTACCGCCACCATGGTGCTGAGCGAA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrodent FAAH\n\n\n \n\n\nGTGTGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull length\n\n\n2\n\n\nCCGGAATTCTCAAGATGGCCGCTTTTCAGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmurine FAAH\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull length\n\n\n3\n\n\nCCGGAATTCTCACGATGGCTGCTTTTGAGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat FAAH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMurine (accession number NM 010173) and Rat FAAH (accession number NM 024132) was amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from brain cDNA (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) using primers 1 and 2 or primers 1 and 3 respectively (see Table). The resulting PCR product was ligated into pCR4 TOPO and DNA sequence confirmed. The full length murine FAAH was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pcDEFneo using either EcoRI (murine) or KpnI and EcoRI (rat) restriction sites. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were transfected following manufacturers protocol (AMAXA). Forty eight hours post transfection, cells were trypsinized and transferred to 96 well plates in Iscove's DMEM media supplemented with 2 mM Glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mg/ml geneticin and HT Supplement (0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 0.016 mM thymidine) in order to isolate single clones. Following selection in geneticin, individual clones were selected and FAAH activity was assessed using a whole cell fluorescent anandamide assay, modified from Ramarao et al (2005). Following removal of tissue culture media cells were dislodged following addition of Cellstripper (Mediatech, Inc. Manassas, Va.) and transferred to 96 well black clear bottom assay plate, centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 3 mins and media removed and replaced with assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA). The reaction was initiated by addition of fluorescent substrate, AMC Arachidonoyl Amide (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Mich.) to 1 μM and reaction allowed to proceed for 2 hours at room temperature. Release of fluorescence was monitored in a CytoFluor Multiplate Reader. Cells expressing the highest amount of FAAH activity were selected for study with FAAH inhibitors.\n\n\n \nPreparation of Lysate and Microsomes\n\n\n \n \n \nCHO cells expressing FAAH were used to prepare either crude cell lysate or microsome fractions. To harvest cells, tissue culture media was decanted, the monolayer washed three times with Ca\n++\nMg\n++\n free PBS and cells recovered after 15 min in enzyme free dissociation media (Millipore Corp, Billerica, Mass.). Cells were collected by centrifuging at 2000 rpm for 15 mM. and the cell pellet re-suspended with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM EDTA and the protease inhibitors aprotinin (1 mg/ml) and leupeptin (100 μM). The suspension was sonicated at 4° C. and the cell lysate recovered after centrifuging at 12,000×g (14,600 rpm, SS34 rotor) for 20 min at 4° C. to form a crude pellet of cell debris, nuclei, peroxisomes, lysosomes, and mitochondria; the supernatant or cell lysate was used for FAAH enzyme assay. In some cases, microsomes fractions enriched in FAAH were prepared by centrifuging the cell lysate further at 27,000 rpm (100,000×g) in SW28 rotor for 50 minutes at 4° C. The pellet containing FAAH-enriched microsomes was re-suspend in 50 mM HEPES, (pH 7.4) 1 mM EDTA, and any remaining DNA sheared by passage of material through a 23 gauge needle and aliquots of enzyme were store at −80° C. prior to use.\n\n\n \nFAAH Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nSeveral assays have been used to demonstrate the inhibitory activity. Enzyme activity was demonstrated in a radioenzymatic test based on measuring the product of hydrolysis (ethanolamine [\n3\nH]) of anandamide [ethanolamine 1-.sup.3H] (American Radiolabeled Chemicals; 1 mCi/ml) with FAAH (Life Sciences (1995), 56, 1999-2005 and Journal of Pharmacology and Experimented Therapeutics (1997), 283, 729-734), Analytical. Biochemistry (2003), 318, 270-5. In addition, routine assays were performed monitoring hydrolysis of arachidonyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin amide (AAMCA) by following increase in fluorescence upon release of 7-amino 4-methyl coumarin (λ\nEX\n=355 nm, (λ\nEM\n=460 nm). Analytical. Biochemistry (2005). 343, 143-51\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays are performed on either cell lysate or microsome fractions prepared as described or in whole cell format employing either the fluorescent substrate AAMCA (Cayman chemical, Ann Arbor, Mich.,) or \n3\nH-anandmaide ([ETHANOLAMINE-1-3H] American Radiolabeled Chemicals; 1 mCi/ml). The cell lysate or microsome assay is performed in Costar black wall, clear bottom plates by adding FAAH_CHO (whole cell, cell lysate or microsome) in assay buffer (50 mM Phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 200 mM KCl, 0.2% glycerol, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA) to each well, followed by either DMSO or compound and allowed to incubate at 22-25° C. for fifteen minutes. AAMCA substrate was used to achieve a final concentration of 1 μM and reaction allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1-3 hours. Fluorescent release as a measure of FAAH activity was monitored by reading the plate in a CytoFluor Multiplate Reader (Ex: 360/40 nM; Em: 460/40 nM). Whole cell assay is conducted with cells harvested after rinsing tissue culture flasks three times with Ca\n++\nMg\n++\n free PBS, incubating for 10 min in Enzyme free dissociation media and centrifuging for 5 minutes at 1,000 rpm in table top centrifuge. Cells are resuspended in assay buffer at desired cell number in (4×10\n4 \ncells/assay in 96-well format; 1×10\n4 \ncells/assay in 384-well format) and assayed as described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, assays are performed using anandamide [ethanolamine 1-.sup.3H] (specific activity of 10 Ci/mmol) diluted with cold anandamide to achieve a final assay concentration of 1 μM anandamide (˜50,000 cpm). Enzyme (CHO cell lysate, brain or liver homogenate) is incubated in assay buffer (50 mM Phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 200 mM KCl, 0.2% glycerol, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA) with inhibitor at 25° C. for 30 minutes. The reaction was terminated by addition of 2 volumes of chloroform: methanol (1:1) and mixed by vortexing. Following a centrifugation step, 2000 rpm for 10 min, at room temperature, the aqueous phase containing the released \n3\nH-ethanolamide was recovered and quantitated by liquid scintillation as a reflection of FAAH enzyme activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRamarao M.
