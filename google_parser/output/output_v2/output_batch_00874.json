particularly an agent of reducing amyloid beta (hereinafter referred to as Aβ) production, which is effective in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases caused by Aβ, such as Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome.\n\n\n \nBackground Art\n\n\n \n \n \nAlzheimer's disease is a disease characterized by degeneration and loss of neurons and also by the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary change. Presently, treatment of Alzheimer's disease is limited to symptomatic therapies with a symptom-improving agent represented by an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and the basic remedy which prevents progress of the disease has not been developed. A method of controlling the cause of onset of pathologic conditions needs to be developed for creation of the basic remedy of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAβ protein, which is a metabolite of amyloid precursor protein (hereinafter referred to as APP), is considered to be greatly involved in degeneration and loss of neurons as well as onset of demential conditions (for example, see Non-Patent Document 1 and Non-Patent Document 2). The main components of Aβ protein are Aβ40 consisting of 40 amino acids and Aβ42 having two additional amino acids at the C-terminal. The Aβ40 and Aβ42 tend to aggregate (for example, see Non-Patent Document 3) and constitute main components of senile plaques (for example, Non-Patent Document 3, Non-Patent Document 4 and Non-Patent Document 5), and furthermore, it is known that mutations of APP and presenelin genes, which is observed in familial Alzheimer's disease, increase production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 (for example, see Non-Patent Document 6, Non-Patent Document 7 and Non-Patent Document 8). Therefore, compounds which reduce production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 are expected as an agent for controlling progress of Alzheimer's disease or for preventing the disease.\n\nThese Aβs are produced when APP is cleaved by beta secretase and subsequently clipped by gamma secretase. In consideration of this, creation of inhibitors of γ secretase and β secretase has been attempted for the purpose of reducing production of Aβs. Many of these secretase inhibitors already known are peptides or peptidomimetics such as L-685,458 (for example, see Non-Patent Document 9) and LY-411575 (for example, see Non-Patent Document 10, Non-Patent Document 11 and Non-Patent Document 12).\n\n \n \n \nNon-Patent Document 1:\n Klein WL, and seven others, Related Articles, Links Alzheimer's disease-affected brain: presence of oligomeric Aβ ligands (ADDLs) suggests a molecular basis for reversible memory loss, Proceeding National Academy of Science USA, 2003, Sep 2, 100(18), p. 10417-10422\n;\n \nNon-Patent Document 2: \nNitsch RM, and 16 others, Antibodies against β-amyloid slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, Neuron, 2003, May 22, 38(4), p. 547-554\n;\n \nNon-Patent Document 3: \nJarrett JT, and 2 others, The carboxy terminus of the β amyloid protein is critical for the seeding of amyloid formation: implications for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Biochemistry, 1993, May 11, 32(18), p. 4693-4697\n;\n \nNon-Patent Document 4: \nGlenner GG, and another, Alzheimer's disease: initial report of the purification and characterization of a novel cerebrovascular amyloid protein, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 1984, May 16, 120(3), p. 885-890\n;\n \nNon-Patent Document 5: \nMasters CL, and six others, Amyloid plaque core protein in Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome, Proceeding National Academy of Science USA, 1985, Jun, 82(12), p. 4245-4249\n;\n \nNon-Patent Document 6: \nGouras GK, and eleven others, Intraneuronal Aβ42 accumulation in human brain, American Journal of Pathology, 2000, Jan, 156(1), p. 15-20\n;\n \nNon-Patent Document 7: \nScheuner D, and twenty others, Secreted amyloid β-protein similar to that in the senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease is increased in vivo by the presenilin 1 and 2 and APP mutations linked to familial Alzheimer's disease, Nature Medicine, 1996, Aug, 2(8), p. 864-870\n;\n \nNon-Patent Document 8: \nForman MS, and 4 others, Differential effects of the swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein on β-amyloid accumulation and secretion in neurons and nonneuronal cells, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 1997, Dec 19, 272(51), p. 32247-32253\n;\n \nNon-Patent Document 9: \nShearman MS, and nine others, L-685,458, an aspartyl protease transition state mimic, is a potent inhibitor of amyloid β-protein precursor γ-secretase activity, Biochemistry, 2000, Aug 1,39(30), p. 8698-8704\n;\n \nNon-Patent Document 10: \nShearman MS, and six others, Catalytic site-directed γ-secretase complex inhibitors do not discriminate pharmacologically between Notch S3 and β-APP cleavages, Biochemistry, 2003, Jun 24, 42(24), p. 7580-7586\n;\n \nNon-Patent Document 11: \nLanz TA, and three others, Studies of Aβ pharmacodynamics in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma in young (plaque-free) Tg2576 mice using the γ-secretase inhibitor N2-[(2S)-2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethanoyl]-N1-[(7S)-5-methyl-6-oxo-6,7-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,d]azepin-7-yl]-L-alaninamide (LY-411575), Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 2004, Apr, 309(1), p. 49-55\n;\n \nNon-Patent Document 12: \nWong GT, and twelve others, Chronic treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitor LY-411,575 inhibits β-amyloid peptide production and alters lymphopoiesis and intestinal cell differentiation, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2004, Mar 26, 279(13), p. 12876-12882\n.\n \n\n\nDisclosure of the Invention\n\n\nProblems to be Solved by the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, compounds which prevent production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 from APP are expected as an preventive or therapeutic agent for diseases caused by Aβ represented by Alzheimer's disease.

The embryos were aseptically removed from a pregnant rat under ether anesthesia. The brain was isolated from the embryo, and immersed in ice-cold L-15 medium (for example, Invitrogen Corp. Cat #11415-064, Carlsbad, CA, USA, or SIGMA L1518, St. Louis. MO, USA). The cerebral cortex was collected under a stereoscopic microscope from the brain. The cerebral cortex fragments collected were subjected to enzyme treatment in an enzyme solution containing 0.25% trypsin (for example, Invitrogen Corp., Cat #15050-065, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 0.01% DNase (for example, Sigma D5025, St. Louis. MO, USA) at 37C for 30 minutes to allow for cell dispersion. The enzyme reaction was terminated by addition of same volume of heat-inactivated horse serum. After centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes, the supernatant was removed and 5-10 ml of medium was added to the cell pellet. Neurobasal medium\n™\n (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 2% B-27 supplement (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA), 25 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME, WAKO, 139-06861, Osaka, Japan), 0.5 mM L-glutamine (for example, Invitrogen Corp., Cat # 25030-081, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and 1% antibiotics-antimycotics (Invitrogen Corp., Cat # 15240-062, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used as the culture medium (Neurobasal/B27/2-ME). At the compound evaluation, the medium of the same composition not to add 2-ME alone (Neurobasal/B27) was used. The cell pellet was triturated by mild pipetting. Remaining cell pellet was removed by filtering through a 40-µm nylon mesh (Cell Strainer, Cat # 35-2340, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and a neuronal cell suspension was obtained. The neuronal cell suspension was diluted with the Neurobasal/B27/2-ME medium and then plated in a volume of 100 µl/well to obtain an initial cell density of 5 × 10\n5\n cells/cm\n2\n in a 96-well polystyrene plate pre-coated with poly-L or D-lysine (for example, Falcon MICROTEST\n™\n Tissue culture plate 96 well flat bottom with low evaporation lid (Cat # 35-3075, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) coated with poly-L-lysine using the method shown below, or BIOCOAT\n™\n cell environments Poly-D-lysine cell ware 96-well plate, Cat # 35-6461, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Poly-L-lysine coating was carried out as follows. Poly-L-lysine (SIGMA P2636, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution at 100 µg/ml was prepared aseptically with 0.15 M Borate = buffer (pH 8.5). The solution was added to a 96-well polystyrene incubator at 50-100 µl/well and incubated at room temperature for one hour or more, or at 4C overnight or longer. This was rinsed 4 or more times with sterile water, and then dried or rinsed with, for example, sterile PBS or medium, and used for plating cells. Cells were cultured for one day in an incubator of 5% CO\n2\n-95% air at 37C, the entire amount of the medium was exchanged with fresh Neurobasal/B27/2-ME, and the cells were then cultured for further 3 days.\n\n\n \n\n\nAddition of Compounds\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDrugs were added on day 4 of culture as follows. The entire amount of the medium was removed from culture well, and Neurobasal/B27 medium was added at 180 µl/well. The test compound dimethyl sulfoxide (hereinafter abbreviated as DMSO) solution was diluted with Neurobasal/B27 so than it would be 10-fold of the desired final concentration. A diluent was added at 20 µl/well and mixed well. The final concentration of DMSO was 1 % or less. Only DMSO was added to the control group.\n\n\n \n\n\nSampling\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAfter incubation for 3 days, the entire amount of the medium was collected as ELISA sample. This was used without any dilution for Aβx-42 measurement, and diluted to 5-fold with the diluent supplied with ELISA kit for Aβx-40 measurement, before subjecting to respective ELISA assays.\n\n\n \n\n\nEvaluation of Cell Survival\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCell survival was evaluated by MTT assay. MTT assay was carried out according to the following protocols. Pre-warmed medium of 100 µl/well was added to the wells after collecting the medium. A solution of 8 mg/ml of MTT (SIGMA M2128, St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in D-PBS(-) (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered Saline, SIGMA D8537, ST. Louis, MO, USA) was added at 8 µl/well, and this was incubated in an incubator of 5% CO2-95% air at 37C for 20 minutes. MTT solubilizing buffer was added to this at 100 µl/well, MTT formazan crystals were dissolved well in an incubator of 5% CO\n2\n-95% air at 37C, and absorbance was measured at 550 nm. MTT solubilizing buffer was prepared as follows. N, N'-dimethylformamide (for example, WAKO 045-02916, Osaka, Japan) and distilled water 250 ml each were mixed together. To this 100 g of SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate (for example, sodium lauryl sulfate, WAKO 191-07145, Osaka, Japan)) was dissolved. Conc. HCl and conc. Acetic acid 350 µl each were added to allow for a final pH of about 4.7.\n\nUpon measurement, wells without plating any cells containing only the medium and MTT solution were set as background (bkg). Individual measured values were subjected to the following formula and calculate the proportion against the control group (group without treatment with drugs, CTRL) (% of CTRL), to compare and evaluate cell survival. \n \n \n%\n \n \n \nof\n \n \n \nCTRL\n \n=\n \n \nA\n \n⁢\n \n550\n \n_sample\n \n-\n \nA\n \n⁢\n \n550\n \n_bkg\n \n \n/\n \n \nA\n \n⁢\n \n550\n \n_CTRL\n \n-\n \nA\n \n⁢\n \n550\n \n_bkg\n \n \n×\n \n100\n \n \n \n \n\n(A550_sample: absorbance at 550 nm of sample well,\n\nA550_bkg: absorbance at 550 nm of background well,\n\nA550_CTRL: absorbance at 550 nm of control group well)\n\n\n \n\n\nAβ ELISA\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor Aβ ELISA, Human Amyloid beta (1-42) Assay Kit (#17711 or #27711) and Human Amyloid beta (1-40) Assay Kit (#17713 or #27713) from Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Co., Ltd.
