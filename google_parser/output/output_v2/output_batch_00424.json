Description\n\n\n\n\n TGR5 AGONISTS \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nField of the Invention \n\n\n [0001] The invention relates to agonists of the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5, compositions comprising them, methods of making the compounds and compositions and using them for the treatment of diseases TGR5 mediates or is implicated in. \n\n\nSummary of the Related Art \n\n\n [0002] Bile acids play essential roles in the absorption of dietary lipids and in the regulation of bile acid biosynthesis. While bile acids have long been known to be essential in dietary lipid absorption and cholesterol catabolism, in recent years an important role for bile acids as signaling molecules has emerged. Bile acids activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, are ligands for the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) TGR5, and activate nuclear hormone receptors such as farnesoid X receptor a (FXR-a). Through activation of these diverse signaling pathways, bile acids can regulate their own enterohepatic circulation, but also triglyceride, cholesterol, energy, and glucose homeostasis. Thus, bile acid (BA) controlled signaling pathways are promising novel drug targets to treat common metabolic diseases, such as obesity, type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerosis. Houten et ah, The EMBO Journal (2006) 25, 1419-1425). \n\n\n [0003] Watanabe et al, Nature 2006, 439(7075) 484-489 showed that the administration of bile acids to mice increases energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue, preventing obesity and resistance to insulin. This novel metabolic effect of bile acids is critically dependent on induction of the cyclic-AMP-dependent thyroid hormone activating enzyme type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) because it is lost in D2-/- mice. Treatment of brown adipocytes and human skeletal myocytes with bile acids increases D2 activity and oxygen consumption. These effects are independent of FXR-a, and instead are mediated by increased cAMP production that stems from the binding of bile acids with TGR5. In both rodents and humans, the most thermogenically important tissues are specifically targeted by this mechanism because they coexpress D2 and TGR5. The BA-TGR5-cAMP-D2 signaling pathway is therefore a crucial mechanism for fine-tuning energy homeostasis that can be targeted to improve metabolic control. \n\n\n [0004] Glucagon- like peptide- 1 (GLP-1) is produced by L-cells in the distal digestive tract and affects multiple metabolic parameters, including enhanced insulin secretion, \n\n glucagon suppression, and lowering of blood glucose. TGR5 expression in L-cells is linked to increased GLP-1 secretion. Katsuma, et ah, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005, 329(1), 386-390) showed that bile acids promote glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion through TGR5 in a murine enteroendocrine cell line STC-1. RNA interference experiments showed that reduced expression of TGR5 resulted in reduced secretion of GLP-1. Furthermore, transient transfection of STC-1 cells with an expression plasmid containing TGR5 significantly enhanced GLP-1 secretion. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n[0005] The present invention comprises TGR5 agonists of structural formula VIII(Q), \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein X, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, and R\n5\n are defined hereinbelow, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

\n\n\n Pharmaceutical Formulations and Dosage Forms \n\n\n [00169] Administration of the compounds of this disclosure, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, in pure form or in an appropriate pharmaceutical composition, can be carried out via any of the accepted modes of administration or agents for serving similar utilities. Thus, administration can be, for example, orally, nasally, parenterally (intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous), topically, transdermally, intravaginally, intravesically, intracistemally, or rectally, in the form of solid, semi-solid, lyophilized powder, or liquid dosage forms, such as for example, tablets, suppositories, pills, soft elastic and hard gelatin capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, or aerosols, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages. \n\n\n [00170] The compositions will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier, excipient, and/or diluent and a compound of this disclosure as the/an active agent, and, in addition, can include carriers and adjuvants, etc. \n\n\n [00171] Adjuvants include preserving, wetting, suspending, sweetening, flavoring, perfuming, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It can also be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. \n\n\n [00172] If desired, a pharmaceutical composition of the compounds in this disclosure can also contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, antioxidants, and the like, such as, for example, citric acid, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, butylalted hydroxytoluene, etc. \n\n [00173] The choice of formulation depends on various factors such as the mode of drug administration (e.g., for oral administration, formulations in the form of tablets, pills or capsules are preferred) and the bioavailability of the drug substance. Recently, pharmaceutical formulations have been developed especially for drugs that show poor bioavailability based upon the principle that bioavailability can be increased by increasing the surface area i.e., decreasing particle size. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,107,288 describes a pharmaceutical formulation having particles in the size range from 10 to 1,000 nm in which the active material is supported on a crosslinked matrix of macromolecules. U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,684 describes the production of a pharmaceutical formulation in which the drug substance is pulverized to nanoparticles (average particle size of 400 nm) in the presence of a surface modifier and then dispersed in a liquid medium to give a pharmaceutical formulation that exhibits remarkably high bioavailability. \n\n\n [00174] Compositions suitable for parenteral injection can comprise physiologically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, glycerol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. \n\n\n [00175] One preferable route of administration is oral, using a convenient daily dosage regimen that can be adjusted according to the degree of severity of the disease-state to be treated. \n\n\n[00176] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert customary excipient (or carrier) such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate or (a) fillers or extenders, as for example, starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, (b) binders, as for example, cellulose derivatives, starch, alignates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and gum acacia, (c) humectants, as for example, glycerol, (d) disintegrating agents, as for example, agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, croscarmellose sodium, complex silicates, and sodium carbonate, (e) solution retarders, as for example paraffin, (f) absorption accelerators, as for example, quaternary ammonium compounds, (g) wetting agents, as for example, cetyl alcohol, and glycerol \n\n monostearate, magnesium stearate and the like (h) adsorbents, as for example, kaolin and bentonite, and (i) lubricants, as for example, talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, or mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms can also comprise buffering agents. \n\n\n[00177] Solid dosage forms, as described above, can be prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and others well known in the art. They can contain pacifying agents, and can also be of such composition that they release the active compound or compounds in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of embedded compositions that can be used are polymeric substances and waxes. The active compounds can also be in microencapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients. \n\n\n[00178] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. Such dosage forms are prepared, for example, by dissolving, dispersing, etc., a compound(s) of this disclosure, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like; solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, as for example, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propyleneglycol, 1,3- butyleneglycol, dimethylformamide; oils, in particular, cottonseed oil, groundnut oil, corn germ oil, olive oil, castor oil and sesame oil, glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethyleneglycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan; or mixtures of these substances, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. \n\n\n [00179] Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, can contain suspending agents, as for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances, and the like. \n\n\n [00180] Compositions for rectal administrations are, for example, suppositories that can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this disclosure with, for example, suitable non- irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethyleneglycol or a suppository wax, which are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at body temperature and therefore, melt while in a suitable body cavity and release the active component therein. \n\n\n [00181] Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this disclosure include ointments, powders, sprays, and inhalants. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a physiologically acceptable carrier and any preservatives, buffers, or \n\n propellants as can be required. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, and solutions are also contemplated for the compounds in this disclosure. \n\n\n [00182] Compressed gases can be used to disperse a compound of this disclosure in aerosol form. Inert gases suitable for this purpose are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc. \n\n\n[00183] Generally, depending on the intended mode of administration, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions will contain about 1% to about 99% by weight of a compound(s) of this disclosure, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and 99% to 1% by weight of a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. In one example, the composition will be between about 5% and about 75% by weight of a compound(s) of this disclosure, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with the rest being suitable pharmaceutical excipients. \n\n\n [00184] Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., (Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1990). The composition to be administered will, in any event, contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this disclosure, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for treatment of a disease-state in accordance with the teachings of this disclosure. \n\n\n [00185] The compounds of this disclosure, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are administered in a therapeutically effective amount which will vary depending upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of the compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular disease-states, and the host undergoing therapy. The compounds of this disclosure can be administered to a patient at dosage levels in the range of about 0.1 to about 1,000 mg per day. For a normal human adult having a body weight of about 70 kilograms, a dosage in the range of about 0.01 to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day is an example. The specific dosage used, however, can vary. For example, the dosage can depend on a number of factors including the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the pharmacological activity of the compound being used. The determination of optimum dosages for a particular patient is well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n [00186] The compositions will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound of this disclosure as the/an active agent, and, in addition, can include other medicinal agents and pharmaceutical agents. Compositions of the compounds in this disclosure can be used in combination with anticancer and/or other agents that are generally \n\n administered to a patient being treated for cancer, e.g. surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapeutic agent(s). Chemotherapeutic agents that can be useful for administration in combination with compounds of Formula I in treating cancer include alkylating agents, platinum containing agents. \n\n\n[00187] If formulated as a fixed dose, such combination products employ the compounds of this disclosure within the dosage range described above and the other pharmaceutically active agent(s) within its approved dosage range. Compounds of this disclosure can alternatively be used sequentially with known pharmaceutically acceptable agent(s) when a combination formulation is inappropriate. \n\n\n[00188] The compounds described herein, as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or other derivatives thereof, can exist in isotopically-labeled form, in which one or more atoms of the compounds are replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chloride, such as \n2\nH (deuterium), \n3\nH (tritium), \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\n0, . \n17\n0, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF and \n36\nC1, respectively. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, prodrugs, solvates, hydrates or other derivatives thereof, generally can be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples and Preparations below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non- isotopically labeled reagent. \n\n\n [00189] In the compounds of the invention, unless otherwise stated, any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom at its natural abundance. When a position is designated as \"H\" or \"hydrogen\", the position is to be understood to have hydrogen at its natural abundance isotopic composition, with the understanding that some variation of natural isotopic abundance occurs in a synthesized compound depending upon the origin of chemical materials used in the synthesis. When a particular position is designated as \"D\" or \"deuterium\", it is to be understood that the abundance of deuterium at that position is substantially greater than the natural abundance of deuterium, which is 0.015%, and typically has at least 50% deuterium incorporation at that position. \n\n\n [00190] The methods disclosed herein also include methods of treating diseases by administering deuterated compounds of the invention or other isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention alone or as pharmaceutical compositions. In some of these \n\n situations, substitution of hydrogen atoms with heavier isotopes such as deuterium can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements). \n\n\n [00191] Moreover, certain isotopically-labeled compounds, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as \n3\nH and \n14\nC are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays such as positron emission tomgraphy (PET). Tritiated, (\n3\nH) and carbon- 14 (\n14\nC) isotopes are useful for these embodiments because of their detectability. \n\n\nDefinitions \n\n\n [00192] Terms used herein may be preceded and/or followed by a single dash, or a double dash, \"=\", to indicate the bond order of the bond between the named substituent and its parent moiety; a single dash indicates a single bond and a double dash indicates a double bond. In the absence of a single or double dash it is understood that a single bond is formed between the substituent and its parent moiety; further, substituents are intended to be read \"left to right\" unless a dash indicates otherwise. For example, Ci-Cealkoxycarbonyloxy and -OC(0)OCi-C\n6\nalkyl indicate the same functionality. Also, for instance, when variable X of formual VIII(Q) is defined as =N- or =C(R\n4\n)-, the bonds are only to indicate attachment points and the bonds are not meant to add additional bonds to the parent structure. So, for instance, when variable X of formula VIII(Q) is defined as =N-, this would mean the same thing as X being defined as N. \n\n\n[00193] Certain variables used herein are indicated as divalent linking moieties, for example, L\nD\n is a divalent moiety linking R\nD1\n to the parent structure. For such divalent variables, particular members defining L\nD\n may be written, for example, in the form -X-Y- or -Y-X-. When certain groups, such as alkyl groups, are part of a linker, these groups are also divalent moieties. \n\n\n[00194] \"Administration\" and variants thereof (e.g., \"administering\" a compound) in reference to a compound of the invention means introducing the compound or a prodrug of the compound into the system of the animal in need of treatment. When a compound of the invention or prodrug thereof is provided in combination with one or more other active agents (e.g., surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and the like), \"administration\" and its variants are each understood to include concurrent and sequential introduction of the compound or prodrug thereof and other agents. \n\n [00195] \"Alkoxy\" means the group -OR wherein R is alkyl, as defined herein.

Examples of alkylamino groups include, but are not limited to, methylamino, ethylamino, isopropylamino, hexylamino, and the like. \n\n\n [00199] \"Alkylaminocarbonyl\" means an alkylamino group, as defined herein, appended to a parent moiety via a carbonyl group (i.e., a group of the form, -C(O)N(H)R\n0\n, wherein R° is alkyl, as defined herein). Examples of alkylaminocarbonyl groups include, but are not limited to, methylaminocarbonyl, ethylaminocarbonyl, isopropylaminocarbonyl, t- butylaminocarbonyl, and n-hexylaminocarbonyl. \n\n\n[00200] \"Amino\" means a -NH\n2\n group. \n\n\n[00201] \"Aryl\" means a monovalent, monocyclic, or polycyclic radical having 6 to 14 ring carbon atoms. The monocyclic aryl radical is aromatic and whereas the polycyclic aryl radical may be partially saturated, at least one of the rings comprising a polycyclic radical is aromatic. The polycyclic aryl radical includes fused, bridged, and spiro ring systems. Any 1 or 2 ring carbon atoms of any nonaromatic rings comprising a polycyclic aryl radical may be replaced by a -C(O)-, -C(S)-, or -C(=NH)- group. Unless stated otherwise, the valency may be located on any atom of any ring of the aryl group, valency rules permitting. Representative examples include phenyl, naphthyl, indanyl, and the like. \n\n [00202] \"Carbonyl\" means a -C(O)- group. \n\n\n [00203] \"Cycloalkyl\" means a monocyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon radical having 3 to 13 carbon ring atoms.

In this application, fused-polycyclics and fused ring systems are not necessarily all aromatic ring systems. Typically, but not necessarily, fused-polycyclics share a vicinal set of atoms, for example naphthalene or 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalene. A spiro ring system is not a fused-polycyclic by this definition, but fused polycyclic ring systems of the invention may themselves have spiro rings attached thereto via a single ring atom of the fused-polycyclic. In some examples, as appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, two adjacent groups on an aromatic system may be fused together to form a ring structure. The fused ring structure may contain heteroatoms and may be optionally substituted with one or more groups. It should additionally be noted that saturated carbons of such fused groups (i.e., saturated ring structures) can contain two substitution groups. \n\n\n [00208] \"Halo\" and \"halogen\" mean a fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo group. \n\n [00209] \"Haloalkyl\" means an alkyl radical, as defined herein, substituted with one or more halo atoms. For example, halo-substituted (Ci_4)alkyl includes trifluoromethyl, 2,2-dichloroethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, perchloroethyl, 2-bromopropyl, and the like. \n\n\n[00210] \"Heteroaryl\" means a monovalent monocyclic or polycyclic radical having 5 to 14 ring atoms of which one or more of the ring atoms, for example one, two, three, or four ring atoms, are heteroatoms independently selected from -0-, -S(0)\nn\n- (n is 0, 1, or 2), -N-, -N(R\nX\n)-, and the remaining ring atoms are carbon atoms, where R\nx\n is hydrogen, alkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, -C(O)R\n0\n or -S(0)2R°, where R° is alkyl. The monocyclic heteroaryl radical is aromatic and whereas the polycyclic heteroaryl radical may be partially saturated, at least one of the rings comprising a polycyclic radical is aromatic. The polycyclic heteoaryl radical includes fused, bridged and spiro ring systems. Any 1 or 2 ring carbon atoms of any nonaromatic rings comprising a polycyclic heteroaryl radical may be replaced by a -C(O)-, -C(S)-, or -C(=NH)- group. Unless stated otherwise, the valency may be located on any atom of any ring of the heteroaryl group, valency rules permitting. In particular, when the point of valency is located on the nitrogen, then R\nx\n is absent. More specifically, the term heteroaryl includes, but is not limited to, 1,2,4-triazolyl, 1,3,5-triazolyl, phthalimidyl, pyridinyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, thienyl, furanyl, indolyl, 2,3-dihydro-lH-indolyl (including, for example, 2,3-dihydro-lH-indol-2-yl, 2,3-dihydro-lH-indol-5-yl, and the like), isoindolyl, indolinyl, isoindolinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzodioxol-4-yl, benzofuranyl, cinnolinyl, indolizinyl, naphthyridin-3-yl, phthalazin-3-yl, phthalazin-4-yl, pteridinyl, purinyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, tetrazoyl, pyrazolyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, oxazolyl, isooxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, tetrahydroisoquinolinyl (including, for example, tetrahydroisoquinolin-4-yl, tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-yl, and the like), 2,3,3a,7a-tetrahydro-lH-isoindolyl, pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridinyl (including, for example, pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridin-2-yl, pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridin-7-yl, and the like), benzopyranyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzothienyl, and the N-oxide derivatives thereof. \n\n\n[00211] \"Heterocyclyl\" means a monovalent, monocyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon radical having 3 to 13 ring atoms of which one or more of the ring atoms, for example 1, 2, 3 or 4 ring atoms, are heteroatoms independently selected from -0-, -S(0)\nn\n- (n is 0, 1, or 2), -N= and -N(R\ny\n)- (where R\ny\n is hydrogen, alkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, -C(O)R\n0\n or -S(0)\n2\nR°, where R° is alkyl, as defined herein), and the remaining ring atoms are carbon. The heterocycloalkyl radical may be saturated or partially unsaturated, but cannot contain an aromatic ring. The heteocycloalkyl radical includes fused, bridged and spiro ring systems. Any 1 or 2 ring carbon atoms independently may be replaced by a -C(O)-, -C(S)-, or -C(=NH)- group. Unless \n\n otherwise stated, the valency of the group may be located on any atom of any ring within the radical, valency rules permitting. In particular, when the point of valency is located on a nitrogen atom, R\ny\n is absent. More specifically the term heterocycloalkyl includes, but is not limited to, azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, 2-oxopyrrolidinyl, 2,5-dihydro-lH-pyrrolyl, piperidinyl, 4-piperidonyl, morpholinyl, piperazinyl, 2-oxopiperazinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, 2-oxopiperidinyl, thiomorpholinyl, thiamorpholinyl, perhydroazepinyl, pyrazolidinyl, imidazolinyl, imidazolidinyl, dihydropyridinyl, tetrahydropyridinyl, oxazolinyl, oxazolidinyl, isoxazolidinyl, thiazolinyl, thiazolidinyl, quinuclidinyl, isothiazolidinyl, octahydroindolyl, octahydroisoindolyl, decahydroisoquinolyl, tetrahydrofuryl, l,4-dioxa-8-azaspiro[4.5]decan-8-yl and tetrahydropyranyl, and the N-oxide derivatives thereof. \n\n\n [00212] \"Heterocyclylalkyl\" means a heterocyclyl group appended to a parent moiety via an alkyl group, as defined herein.

One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that with respect to any molecule described as containing one or more substituents, only sterically practical and/or synthetically feasible compounds are meant to be included. Unless otherwise specified in this specification, when a variable is said to optionally substituted or substituted with a substituent(s), this is to be understood that this substitution occurs by replacing a hydrogen that is covalently bound to the variable with one these substituent(s). This meaning shall apply to all variables that are \n\n stated to be substituted or optionally substituted in the specification. For instance, when it is stated that variable R can be optionally substituted with R , this means that this substitution, when it occurs, takes place by replacing a hydrogen that is covalently bound to with R . Other non-limiting examples of variables that are described in certain instances in the specification as being optionally substituted or substituted with various substituents include, but are not limited to, R\nD1\n, A groups, B groups, and R\n5\n. \n\n\n[00215] Polyethylene glycol (PEG) are polymers of ethylene oxide. Polyethylene glycol refers to the polymer with molecular weight less than 50,000. A polymer is made by joining molecules of ethylene oxide and water together in a repeating pattern. Polyethylene glycol has the following structure: -(CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-0)n-. \n\n\n [00216] \"Saturated bridged ring system\" refers to a bicyclic or polycyclic ring system that is not aromatic. Such a system may contain isolated or conjugated unsaturation, but not aromatic or heteroaromatic rings in its core structure (but may have aromatic substitution thereon). For example, hexahydro-furo[3,2-¾]furan, 2,3,3a,4,7,7a-hexahydro-lH-indene, 7-aza-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane and l,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydro-naphthalene are all included in the class \"saturated bridged ring system.\" \n\n\n [00217] \"Spiro ring\" refers to a ring originating from a particular annular carbon of another ring. For example, as depi ted below: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na ring atom of a saturated bridged ring system (rings C and C), but not a bridgehead atom, can be a shared atom between the saturated bridged ring system and a spiro ring (ring D) attached thereto. A representative example of a spiro ring system is 2 , 3 -dioxa- 8 -azaspiro [4.5 ] decan- 8 -y 1. \n\n\n [00218] \"Isomers\" means compounds having identical molecular formulae but differing in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or in the arrangement of their atoms in space. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed \"stereoisomers.\" Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed \"diastereomers\" and stereoisomers that are nonsuperimposable mirror images are termed \"enantiomers\" or sometimes \"optical isomers.\" A carbon atom bonded to four nonidentical substituents is termed a \"chiral center.\" A compound with one chiral center has two enantiomeric forms of opposite chirality is termed a \"racemic mixture.\" A compound that has \n\n more than one chiral center has 2\nn l\n enantiomeric pairs, where n is the number of chiral centers. Compounds with more than one chiral center may exist as ether an individual diastereomer or as a mixture of diastereomers, termed a \"diastereomeric mixture.\" When one chiral center is present a stereoisomer may be characterized by the absolute configuration of that chiral center. Absolute configuration refers to the arrangement in space of the substituents attached to the chiral center. Enantiomers are characterized by the absolute configuration of their chiral centers and described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog. Conventions for stereochemical nomenclature, methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well known in the art (e.g., see \"Advanced Organic Chemistry,\" 3rd edition, March, Jerry, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1985). The names and illustration used in this application to describe compounds of the invention, unless indicated otherwise, are meant to be encompassed all possible stereoisomers and any mixture, racemic or otherwise, thereof. \n\n\n [00219] The present invention also includes N-oxide derivatives of the compounds of the invention. N-oxide derivatives mean derivatives of compounds of the invention in which nitrogens are in an oxidized state (i.e., N→0), e.g., pyridine N-oxide, and which possess the desired pharmacological activity. \n\n\n [00220] \"Metabolite\" refers to the break-down or end product of a compound or its salt produced by metabolism or biotransformation in the animal or human body; for example, biotransformation to a more polar molecule such as by oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis, or to a conjugate (see Goodman and Gilman, \"The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\" 8.sup.th Ed., Pergamon Press, gilman et al. (eds), 1990 for a discussion of biotransformation). As used herein, the metabolite of a compound of the invention or its salt may be the biologically active form of the compound in the body. In one example, a prodrug may be used such that the biologically active form, a metabolite, is released in vivo. In another example, a biologically active metabolite is discovered serendipitously, that is, no prodrug design per se was undertaken. An assay for activity of a metabolite of a compound of the present invention is known to one of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. \n\n\n[00221] \"Patient\" and \"subject\" for the purposes of the present invention includes humans and other animals, particularly mammals, and other organisms. Thus the methods are applicable to both human therapy and veterinary applications. In another embodiment the patient is a mammal, and in another embodiment the patient is human. \n\n\n [00222] A \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" of a compound means a salt that is pharmaceutically acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the \n\n parent compound. It is understood that the pharmaceutically acceptable salts are non-toxic. Additional information on suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be found in Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17\nth\n ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 1985, or S. M. Berge, et al, \"Pharmaceutical Salts,\" J. Pharm. Sci., 1977;66: 1-19. It is also understood that the compound can have one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts associated with it. \n\n\n [00223] Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; as well as organic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 1 ,2-ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-toluenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, glucoheptonic acid, 4,4'-methylenebis-(3-hydroxy-2-ene-l-carboxylic acid), 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic acid, lauryl sulfuric acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, muconic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. \n\n\n[00224] Examples of a pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include those formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound is replaced by a metal ion, such as sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum salts and the like.

Exemplary organic bases are isopropylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, trimethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, choline, and caffeine. \n\n [00225] \"Prodrug\" refers to compounds that are transformed (typically rapidly) in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formulae, for example, by hydrolysis in blood. Aommon examples include, but are not limited to, ester and amide forms of a compound having an active form bearing a carboxylic acid moiety. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, alkyl esters (for example with between about one and about six carbons) the alkyl group is a straight or branched chain. Acceptable esters also include cycloalkyl esters and arylalkyl esters such as, but not limited to benzyl. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable amides of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, primary amides and secondary and tertiary alkyl amides (for example with between about one and about six carbons). Amides and esters of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared according to conventional methods. A thorough discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, \"Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\" Vol 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. \n\n\n [00226] \"Therapeutically effective amount\" is an amount of a compound of the invention, that when administered to a patient, effectively treats the disease. The amount of a compound of the invention which constitutes a \"therapeutically effective amount\" will vary depending upon a sundry of factors including the activity, metabolic stability, rate of excretion and duration of action of the compound, the age, weight, general health, sex, diet and species of the patient, the mode and time of administration of the compound, the concurrent administration of adjuvants or additional therapies and the severity of the disease for which the therapeutic effect is sought. The therapeutically effective amount for a given circumstance can be determined without undue experimentation. \n\n\n [00227] \"Treating\" or \"treatment\" of a disease, disorder, or syndrome, as used herein, includes (i) preventing the disease, disorder, or syndrome from occurring in a human, i.e., causing the clinical symptoms of the disease, disorder, or syndrome not to develop in an animal that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease, disorder, or syndrome but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease, disorder, or syndrome; (ii) inhibiting the disease, disorder, or syndrome, i.e., arresting its development; and (iii) relieving the disease, disorder, or syndrome, i.e., causing regression of the disease, disorder, or syndrome. As is known in the art, adjustments for systemic versus localized delivery, the age, weight, general health, sex, diet and species of the patient, the mode and time of \n\n administration of the compound, the concurrent administration of adjuvants or additional therapeutically active ingredients and the severity of the disease for which the therapeutic effect is sought may be necessary, and will be ascertainable with routine experimentation. \n\n\n[00228] The compounds disclosed herein and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can exist as single stereoisomers, racemates, and as mixtures of enantiomers and diastereomers. The compounds disclosed herein can also exist as geometric isomers. All such single stereoisomers, racemates and mixtures thereof, and geometric isomers are intended to be within the scope of the compounds disclosed herein. \n\n\n [00229] It is assumed that when considering generic descriptions of compounds of the 2disclosed herein for the purpose of constructing a compound, such construction results in the creation of a stable structure. That is, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that theoretically some constructs which would not normally be considered as stable compounds (that is, sterically practical and/or synthetically feasible, supra). \n\n\n [00230] Methods for the preparation and/or separation and isolation of single stereoisomers from racemic mixtures or non-racemic mixtures of stereoisomers are well known in the art. For example, optically active (R)- and (S)- isomers can be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. Enantiomers (R- and S-isomers) can be resolved by methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art, for example by: formation of diastereoisomeric salts or complexes which can be separated, for example, by crystallization; via formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives which can be separated, for example, by crystallization, selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic oxidation or reduction, followed by separation of the modified and unmodified enantiomers; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support, such as silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent. It will be appreciated that where a desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation procedures described above, a further step can be required to liberate the desired enantiomeric form. Alternatively, specific enantiomer can be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents or by converting on enantiomer to the other by asymmetric transformation. For a mixture of enantiomers, enriched in a particular enantiomer, the major component enantiomer can be further enriched (with concomitant loss in yield) by recrystallization. \n\n\n [00231] In addition, the compounds of this disclosure can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. \n\n In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the compounds of this disclosure. \n\n\n [00232] In addition, it is intended that the present disclosure cover compounds made either using standard organic synthetic techniques, including combinatorial chemistry or by biological methods, such as bacterial digestion, metabolism, enzymatic conversion, and the like. \n\n\n [00233] The examples and scheme below depict the general synthetic procedure for the compounds disclosed herein. Synthesis of the compounds of Formulae VIII(Q) disclosed herein, and embodiments thereof, are not limited by these examples and schemes. One skilled in the art will know that other procedures can be used to synthesize the compounds of Formulae VIII(Q) disclosed herein, and that the procedures described in the examples and schemes is only one such procedure. In the descriptions below, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that specific reaction conditions, added reagents, solvents, and reaction temperatures can be modified for the synthesis of specific compounds that fall within the scope of this disclosure. All intermediate compounds described below, for which there is no descripton of how to synthesize such intermediates within these examples below, are commercially available compounds unless otherwise specified. \n\n\nSynthesis \n\n\n [00234] In the following general methods, X, L\nD\n, Q\nA\n, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n4\n, R\n8\n, R \n\n\nR\nD11D\n, and R\nY\n are as previously defined for a compound of formula VIII(Q), and embodiments thereof, unless otherwise stated.

Description\n\n\n\n\n TITLE \n\n\n AZOCYCLIC INHIBITORS OF FATTY ACID AMIDE HYDROLASE\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n This invention relates to certain isoxazolyl-substituted piperidine and piperazine urea and carbamate compounds, their N-oxides and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds. The invention also relates to compositions containing the compounds and the uses of the compounds in treating diseases or conditions associated with fatty acid amide hydrolase activity. \n\n\n BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n Fatty acid amides represent a class of signaling lipids with diverse cellular and physiological effects. Fatty acid amides are hydrolyzed to their corresponding fatty acids by an enzyme known as fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). FAAH is a mammalian integral membrane serine hydrolase responsible for the hydrolysis of a number of primary and secondary fatty acid amides, including the neuromodulatory compounds anandamide and oleamide. Anandamide has been shown to possess cannabinoid-like analgesic properties and is released by stimulated neurons. The effects and endogenous levels of anandamide increase with pain stimulation, implying it has a role in suppressing pain neurotransmission and behavioral analgesia. Small-molecule FAAH inhibitors that elevate brain anandamide levels have demonstrated efficacy in animal models of pain, inflammation, anxiety and depression. Further description of FAAH inhibitors and methods of evaluating their activity can be found in A. H. Lichtman et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004, 311(2), 441-448; A. Jayamanne et al. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006, 147(3), 281-288; S. Kathuria et al. Nature Med. 2003, 9(1), 76-81; and D. Piomelli et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2005, 102(51), 18620-18625. \n\n\n There remains a need for new compounds that are inhibitors of FAAH and are useful in the treatment of a wide range of diseases, disorders and conditions, including pain. \n\n\n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n This invention relates to compounds of Formula 1 (including all stereoisomers), N-oxides, and salts thereof: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein \n\n\n A is O, S or NR\n6\n;

The term \"treating\" refers to reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing a disease, disorder or condition to which such term applies, or to reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing one or more symptoms of such disease, disorder or condition. The phrase \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to the quantity of a compound that may be used for treating a subject, which amount may depend on the weight and age of the subject and the route of administration, among other things. The terms \"excipient\" or \"adjuvant\" refer to any substance in a pharmaceutical formulation that is not an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The phrase \"pharmaceutical composition\" refers to the combination of one or more drug substances and one or more excipients. The phrases \"drug product\", \"pharmaceutical dosage form\", \"dosage form\", \"final dosage form\" and the like, refer to a pharmaceutical composition that is administered to a subject in need of treatment and generally may be in the form of tablets, capsules, liquid solutions or suspensions, patches, films and the like. \n\n\n Physiological pain is an important protective mechanism designed to warn of danger from potentially injurious stimuli from the external environment. The system operates through a specific set of primary sensory neurons and is activated by noxious stimuli via peripheral transducing mechanisms (see Millan, Prog. Neurobiol. 1999, 57, 1-164 for a review). These sensory fibers are known as nociceptors and are characteristically small diameter axons with slow conduction velocities. Nociceptors encode the intensity, duration and quality of noxious stimulus and by virtue of their topographically organized projection to the spinal cord, the location of the stimulus. The nociceptors are found on nociceptive \n\n nerve fibers of which there are two main types, A-delta fibers (myelinated) and C fibers (non-myelinated). The activity generated by nociceptor input is transferred, after complex processing in the dorsal horn, either directly, or via brain stem relay nuclei, to the ventrobasal thalamus and then on to the cortex, where the sensation of pain is generated. \n\n\n Pain may generally be classified as acute or chronic. Acute pain begins suddenly and is short-lived (usually twelve weeks or less). It is usually associated with a specific cause such as a specific injury and is often sharp and severe. It is the kind of pain that can occur after specific injuries resulting from surgery, dental work, a strain or a sprain. Acute pain does not generally result in any persistent psychological response. In contrast, chronic pain is long-term pain, typically persisting for more than three months and leading to significant psychological and emotional problems. Common examples of chronic pain are neuropathic pain (e.g., painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia), carpal tunnel syndrome, back pain, headache, cancer pain, arthritic pain and chronic post-surgical pain. \n\n\n When a substantial injury occurs to body tissue, via disease or trauma, the characteristics of nociceptor activation are altered and there is sensitisation in the periphery, locally around the injury and centrally where the nociceptors terminate. These effects lead to a heightened sensation of pain. In acute pain these mechanisms can be useful, in promoting protective behaviors which may better enable repair processes to take place. Sensitivity is expected to return to normal once the injury has healed. However, in many chronic pain states, the hypersensitivity far outlasts the healing process and is often due to nervous system injury. This injury often leads to abnormalities in sensory nerve fibers associated with maladaptation and aberrant activity (Woolf & Salter Science 2000, 288, 1765-1768). \n\n\n Clinical pain is present when discomfort and abnormal sensitivity feature among the patient's symptoms. Patients tend to be quite heterogeneous and may present with various pain symptoms. Such symptoms include: (1) spontaneous pain which may be dull, burning, or stabbing; (2) exaggerated pain responses to noxious stimuli (hyperalgesia); and (3) pain produced by normally innocuous stimuli (allodynia - Textbook of Pain Meyer et al. 1994, 13- 44). Although patients suffering from various forms of acute and chronic pain may have similar symptoms, the underlying mechanisms may be different and may, therefore, require different treatment strategies. Pain can also therefore be divided into a number of different subtypes according to differing pathophysiology, including nociceptive, inflammatory and neuropathic pain. \n\n\n Nociceptive pain is induced by tissue injury or by intense stimuli with the potential to cause injury. Pain afferents are activated by transduction of stimuli by nociceptors at the site of injury and activate neurons in the spinal cord at the level of their termination. This is then relayed up the spinal tracts to the brain where pain is perceived (Textbook of Pain, Meyer et al, 1994, 13-44). The activation of nociceptors activates two types of afferent nerve fibers. \n\n Myelinated A-delta fibers transmit rapidly and are responsible for sharp and stabbing pain sensations, while unmyelinated C fibers transmit at a slower rate and convey a dull or aching pain. Moderate to severe acute nociceptive pain is a prominent feature of pain from central nervous system trauma, strains/sprains, burns, myocardial infarction and acute pancreatitis, postoperative pain (pain following any type of surgical procedure), posttraumatic pain, renal colic, cancer pain and back pain. Cancer pain may be chronic pain such as tumor related pain (e.g., bone pain, headache, facial pain or visceral pain) or pain associated with cancer therapy (e.g., postchemotherapy syndrome, chronic postsurgical pain syndrome or post radiation syndrome). Cancer pain may also occur in response to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiotherapy. Back pain may be due to herniated or ruptured intervertabral discs or abnormalities of the lumber facet joints, sacroiliac joints, paraspinal muscles or the posterior longitudinal ligament. Back pain may resolve naturally but in some patients, where it lasts over 12 weeks, it becomes a chronic condition which can be particularly debilitating. \n\n\n Neuropathic pain is currently defined as pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system. Nerve damage can be caused by trauma and disease and thus the term \"neuropathic pain\" encompasses many disorders with diverse etiologies. These include, but are not limited to, peripheral neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, back pain, cancer neuropathy, HIV neuropathy, phantom limb pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, central post-stroke pain and pain associated with chronic alcoholism, hypothyroidism, uremia, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and vitamin deficiency. Neuropathic pain is pathological as it has no protective role. It is often present well after the original cause has dissipated, commonly lasting for years, significantly decreasing a patient's quality of life (Woolf and Mannion Lancet 1999, 353, 1959-1964). The symptoms of neuropathic pain are difficult to treat, as they are often heterogeneous even between patients with the same disease (Woolf & Decosterd Pain Supp. 1999, 6, S141-S147; Woolf and Mannion Lancet 1999, 353, 1959- 1964). They include spontaneous pain, which can be continuous, and paroxysmal or abnormal evoked pain, such as hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to a noxious stimulus) and allodynia (sensitivity to a normally innocuous stimulus). \n\n\n The inflammatory process is a complex series of biochemical and cellular events, activated in response to tissue injury or the presence of foreign substances, which results in swelling and pain {Textbook of Pain Levine and Taiwo, 1994, 45-56). Arthritic pain is the most common inflammatory pain. Rheumatoid disease is one of the commonest chronic inflammatory conditions in developed countries and rheumatoid arthritis is a common cause of disability. The exact etiology of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, but current hypotheses suggest that both genetic and microbiological factors may be important {Textbook of Pain Grennan & Jayson, 1994, 397-407). It has been estimated that almost 16 million Americans \n\n have symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) or degenerative joint disease, most of whom are over 60 years of age, and this is expected to increase to 40 million as the age of the population increases, making this a public health problem of enormous magnitude (Houge & Mersfelder Ann Pharmacother. 2002, 36, 679-686; Textbook of Pain McCarthy et al, 1994, 387-395). Most patients with osteoarthritis seek medical attention because of the associated pain. Arthritis has a significant impact on psychosocial and physical function and is known to be the leading cause of disability in later life. Ankylosing spondylitis is also a rheumatic disease that causes arthritis of the spine and sacroiliac joints. It varies from intermittent episodes of back pain that occur throughout life to a severe chronic disease that attacks the spine, peripheral joints and other body organs. \n\n\n Another type of inflammatory pain is visceral pain which includes pain associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Visceral pain is pain associated with the viscera, which encompass the organs of the abdominal cavity. These organs include the sex organs, spleen and part of the digestive system. Pain associated with the viscera can be divided into digestive visceral pain and non-digestive visceral pain. Commonly encountered gastrointestinal (GI) disorders that cause pain include functional bowel disorder (FBD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These GI disorders include a wide range of disease states that are currently only moderately controlled, including, in respect of FBD, gastroesophageal reflux, dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS), and, in respect of IBD, Crohn's disease, ileitis and ulcerative colitis, all of which regularly produce visceral pain. Other types of visceral pain include the pain associated with dysmenorrhea, cystitis and pancreatitis and pelvic pain. \n\n\n It should be noted that some types of pain have multiple etiologies and thus can be classified in more than one area, e.g., back pain and cancer pain have both nociceptive and neuropathic components. Other types of pain include pain resulting from musculo-skeletal disorders, including myalgia, fibromyalgia, spondylitis, sero-negative (non-rheumatoid) arthropathies, non-articular rheumatism, dystrophinopathy, glycogenolysis, polymyositis and pyomyositis; heart and vascular pain, including pain caused by angina, myocardical infarction, mitral stenosis, pericarditis, Raynaud's phenomenon, scleredoma and skeletal muscle ischemia; head pain, such as migraine (including migraine with aura and migraine without aura), cluster headache, tension-type headache mixed headache and headache associated with vascular disorders; and orofacial pain, including dental pain, otic pain, burning mouth syndrome and temporomandibular myofascial pain. \n\n\n As described above, the compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be used to treat CNS disorders, including schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, and cognitive disorders, such as delirium, dementia, and amnestic disorders.

For example, a composition, mixture, process or method that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such composition, mixture, process or method. \n\n\n The transitional phrase \"consisting of excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified. If in the claim, such would close the claim to the inclusion of materials other than those recited except for impurities ordinarily associated therewith. When the phrase \"consisting of appears in a clause of the body of a claim, rather than immediately following the preamble, it limits only the element set forth in that clause; other elements are not excluded from the claim as a whole. \n\n\n The transitional phrase \"consisting essentially of is used to define a composition or method that includes materials, steps, features, components, or elements, in addition to those literally disclosed, provided that these additional materials, steps, features, components, or elements do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed invention. The term \"consisting essentially of occupies a middle ground between \"comprising\" and \"consisting of. \n\n\n Where applicants have defined an invention or a portion thereof with an open-ended term such as \"comprising,\" it should be readily understood that (unless otherwise stated) the description should be interpreted to also describe such an invention using the terms \"consisting essentially of or \"consisting of.\" \n\n\n Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, \"or\" refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present). \n\n\n Also, the indefinite articles \"a\" and \"an\" preceding an element or component of the invention are intended to be nonrestrictive regarding the number of instances (i.e. \n\n occurrences) of the element or component. Therefore \"a\" or \"an\" should be read to include one or at least one, and the singular word form of the element or component also includes the plural unless the number is obviously meant to be singular. \n\n\n In the above recitations, the term \"alkyl\", used either alone or in compound words such as \"alkylthio\" or \"haloalkyl\" includes straight-chain or branched alkyl, such as, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, /-propyl, and the different butyl isomers. \"Alkenyl\" includes straight-chain or branched alkenes such as ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, and the different butenyl isomers. \"Alkenyl\" also includes polyenes such as 1 ,2-propadienyl. \"Alkynyl\" includes straight-chain or branched alkynes such as ethynyl, 1-propynyl, 2-propynyl, and the different butynyl isomers. \n\n\n \"Alkoxy\" includes, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propyloxy, /-propyloxy, and the different butoxy isomers. \"Alkylthio\" includes branched or straight-chain alkylthio moieties such as methylthio, ethylthio, and the different propylthio and butylthio isomers. \"Alkylsulfmyl\" includes both enantiomers of an alkylsulfmyl group.

Further, when used in compound words such as \"haloalkyl\", or when used in descriptions such as \"alkyl substituted with halogen\" said alkyl may be partially or fully substituted with halogen atoms which may be the same or different. Examples of \"haloalkyl\" or \"alkyl substituted with halogen\" include F\n3\nC, C1CH\n2\n, CF\n3\nCH\n2\n and CF\n3\nCC1\n2\n. The terms \"haloalkenyl\", \"haloalkynyl\", \"haloalkoxy\", \"haloalkylthio\", \"haloalkylsulfmyl\", \"haloalkylsulfonyl\", \"halocycloalkyl\", and the like, are defined analogously to the term \n\n \"haloalkyl\". Examples of \"haloalkenyl\" include C1\n2\nC=CHCH\n2\n and CF\n3\nCH\n2\nCH=CH. Examples of \"haloalkynyl\" include HC≡CCHC1, CF\n3\nC≡C, CC1\n3\nC≡C and FCH\n2\nC≡CCH\n2\n. Examples of \"haloalkoxy\" include CF\n3\n0, CC1\n3\nCH\n2\n0, F\n2\nCHCH\n2\nCH\n2\n0 and CF\n3\nCH\n2\n0. Examples of \"haloalkylthio\" include CC1\n3\nS, CF\n3\nS, CC1\n3\nCH\n2\nS and C1CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nS.

Examples of \"halocycloalkyl\" include chlorocyclopropyl, fluorocyclobutyl and chlorocyclohexyl. \n\n\n The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the \"C\nj\n-Cj\" prefix where i and j are numbers from 1 to 10. For example, C 1 -C4 alkylsulfonyl designates methylsulfonyl through butylsulfonyl; C\n2\n alkoxyalkyl designates CH\n3\nOCH\n2\n; C\n3\n alkoxyalkyl designates, for example, CH\n3\nOCH\n2\nCH\n2\n or CH\n3\nCH\n2\nOCH\n2\n; and C\n4\n alkoxyalkyl designates the various isomers of an alkyl group substituted with an alkoxy group containing a total of four carbon atoms, examples including CH\n3\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nOCH\n2\n and CH\n3\nCH\n2\nOCH\n2\nCH\n2\n. \n\n\n The term \"unsubstituted\" in connection with a group such as a ring means the group does not have any substituents other than its one or more attachments to the remainder of Formula 1. The term \"optionally substituted\" means that the number of substituents can be zero. Unless otherwise indicated, optionally substituted groups may be substituted with as many optional substituents as can be accommodated by replacing a hydrogen atom with a non-hydrogen substituent on any available carbon or nitrogen atom. Commonly, the number of optional substituents (when present) range from 1 to 3. As used herein, the term \"optionally substituted\" is used interchangeably with the phrase \"substituted or unsubstituted\" or with the term \"(un)substituted.\" \n\n\n The number of optional substituents may be restricted by an expressed limitation. For example, the phrase \"optionally substituted with up to 2 substituents independently selected from R\n9a\n on carbon atom ring members\" means that 0, 1 or 2 substituents can be present (if the number of potential connection points allows). Similarly, the phrase \"optionally substituted with up to 3 substituents independently selected from R\n5a\n on carbon atom ring members\" means that 0, 1, 2 or 3 substituents can be present if the number of available connection points allows. When a range specified for the number of substituents (e.g., k being an integer from 0 to 3 in Exhibit 1) exceeds the number of positions available for substituents on a ring (e.g., only 2 positions are available for (R\nv\n)k on U-12 in Exhibit 1), the actual higher end of the range is recognized to be the number of available positions. \n\n\n When a group is substituted with a substituent bearing a subscript that indicates the number of said substituents can exceed 1, said substituents (when they exceed 1) are independently selected from the group of defined substituents (e.g., (R\nv\n)k wherein k is 1, 2, or 3 in Exhibit 1). When a group is substituted with a substituent bearing a subscript that indicates the substituent to be optionally attached, for example (R\n3\n)\nm\n wherein m can be zero, \n\n then hydrogen may be at the position regardless of wherther hydrogen is recited in the variable group definition. When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R\n2a\n, then when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted. When one or more positions on a group are said to be \"not substituted\" or \"unsubstituted\", then hydrogen atoms are attached to take up any free valency. \n\n\n The term \"ring member\" refers to an atom (e.g., C, O, N or S) or other moiety (e.g., C(=0), C(=S) or S(=O)\nu\n(=NR\n10\n)\nz\n) forming the backbone of a ring or ring system. \n\n\n \"Aromatic\" indicates that each of the ring atoms is essentially in the same plane and has a /^-orbital perpendicular to the ring plane, and that (4n + 2) π electrons, where n is a positive integer, are associated with the ring to comply with Huckel's rule. An aromatic ring system denotes a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system in which at least one ring of the ring system is aromatic. An aromatic heterocyclic ring system denotes a heterocyclic ring system in which at least one ring of the ring system is aromatic. \n\n\n The term \"carbocyclic ring\" denotes a ring wherein the atoms forming the ring backbone are selected only from carbon. Unless otherwise indicated, a carbocyclic ring can be a saturated, partially unsaturated, or fully unsaturated ring. When a fully unsaturated carbocyclic ring satisfies Huckel's rule, then said ring is also called an \"aromatic ring\". \"Saturated carbocyclic\" refers to a ring having a backbone consisting of carbon atoms linked to one another by single bonds; unless otherwise specified, the remaining carbon valences are occupied by hydrogen atoms. \n\n\n The terms \"heterocyclic ring\", \"heterocycle\" or \"heterocyclic ring system\" denote a ring or ring system in which at least one atom forming the ring backbone is not carbon, e.g., nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. Typically a heterocyclic ring contains no more than 2 nitrogens, no more than 2 oxygens and no more than 2 sulfurs. Unless otherwise indicated, a heterocyclic ring can be a saturated, partially unsaturated, or fully unsaturated ring. When a fully unsaturated heterocyclic ring satisfies Huckel's rule, then said ring is also called a \"heteroaromatic ring\" or \"aromatic heterocyclic ring\". Unless otherwise indicated, heterocyclic rings and ring systems can be attached through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen. \n\n\n As noted in the Summary of the Invention, a pair of R\n8a\n and R\n3\n substituents besides the possibility of being separate substituents, may also be connected to form a ring. The portion of the ring form by joining R\n8a\n and R\n3\n can contain 5-, 6- or 7-members including as ring members the two carbon atoms to which the substituents R\n8a\n and R\n3\n are attached. The other 3 to 5 ring members are provided by the pair of R\n8a\n and R\n3\n substituents taken together. These other ring members are selected from carbon atoms and up to 2 heteroatoms independently selected from up to 1 O, up to 1 S, up to 1 N, wherein up to 2 carbon atom ring members are independently selected from C(=0) and C(=S), the sulfur atom ring \n\n member is selected from S(=O)\nu\n(=NR\n10\n)\nz\n, each ring optionally substituted with up to 2 substituents independently selected from R\n9\n on carbon atom ring members and R\n9\n^ on the nitrogen atom ring member. In this definition the heteroatoms are optional, because the number of heteroatom ring members may be zero. The nitrogen atom ring members may be oxidized as N-oxides, because compounds relating to Formula 1 also include N-oxide derivatives. The portion of the ring system formed by the pair of R\n8a\n and R\n3\n taken together can be optionally substituted with up to 2 substituents independently selected from R\n9a\n on carbon atom ring members and R\n9\n^ on the nitrogen atom ring member. \n\n\n As noted in the Summary of the Invention, a pair of R\n8\n^ and R\n3\n substituents besides the possibility of being separate substituents, may also be connected to form a ring. The portion of the ring taken form by joining R\n8\n^ and R\n3\n can contain 5-, 6- or 7-members including as ring members the carbon and nitrogen atoms to which the substituents R\n8\n^ and R\n3\n are attached. The other 3 to 5 ring members are provided by the pair of R\n8\n^ and R\n3\n substituents taken together. These other ring members are selected from carbon atoms and 1 to 2 heteroatoms independently selected from up to 1 O, up to 1 S, up to 1 N, wherein up to 2 carbon atom ring members are independently selected from C(=0) and C(=S), the sulfur atom ring member is selected from S(=O)\nu\n(=NR\n10\n)\nz\n, each ring optionally substituted with up to 2 substituents independently selected from R\n9\n on carbon atom ring members and R\n9\n^ on the nitrogen atom ring member. In this definition the nitrogen atom ring members may be oxidized as N-oxides, because compounds relating to Formula 1 also include N-oxide derivatives. The portion of the ring system formed by the pair of R\n8\n^ and R\n3\n taken together can be optionally substituted with up to 2 substituents independently selected from R\n9a\n on carbon atom ring members and R\n9\n^ on the nitrogen atom ring member. \n\n\n A wide variety of synthetic methods are known in the art to enable preparation of aromatic and nonaromatic heterocyclic rings and ring systems; for extensive reviews see the eight volume set of Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, A. R. Katritzky and C. W. Rees editors-in-chief, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1984 and the twelve volume set of Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II, A. R. Katritzky, C. W. Rees and E. F. V. Scriven editors-in-chief, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1996. \n\n\n Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. The compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers or as an optically active form. For example, Formula 1 possesses a chiral center at the carbon atom \n\n to which R\n4\n is bonded. The two enantiomers are depicted as Formula 1' and Formula 1\" with the chiral center identified with an asterisk *). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Compounds of Formula 1 comprise racemic mixtures, for example, equal amounts of the enantiomers of Formulae 1' and 1\". In addition, compounds of Formula 1 include compounds that are enriched compared to the racemic mixture in an enantiomer of Formula 1. Also included are the essentially pure enantiomers of compounds of Formula 1, for example, Formula 1' and Formula 1\". \n\n\n Compounds of Formula 1 can comprise additional chiral centers. For example, substituents and other molecular constituents such as R\n2\n and R\n3\n may themselves contain chiral centers. This invention comprises racemic mixtures as well as enriched and essentially pure stereoconfigurations at these additional chiral centers. \n\n\n Molecular depictions drawn herein follow standard conventions for depicting stereochemistry. To indicate stereoconfiguration, bonds rising from the plane of the drawing and towards the viewer are denoted by solid wedges wherein the broad end of the wedge is attached to the atom rising from the plane of the drawing towards the viewer. Bonds going below the plane of the drawing and away from the viewer are denoted by dashed wedges wherein the narrow end of the wedge is attached to the atom further away from the viewer. Constant width lines indicate bonds with a direction opposite or neutral relative to bonds shown with solid or dashed wedges; constant width lines also depict bonds in molecules or parts of molecules in which no particular stereoconfiguration is intended to be specified. \n\n\n When enantiomerically enriched, one enantiomer is present in greater amounts than the other, and the extent of enrichment can be defined by an expression of enantiomeric excess (\"ee\"), which is defined as (2χ-1)· 100%, where x is the mole fraction of the dominant enantiomer in the mixture (e.g., an ee of 20% corresponds to a 60:40 ratio of enantiomers). \n\n\n Preferably the compositions of this invention of Formula 1 have at least a 50% enantiomeric excess; more preferably at least a 75% enantiomeric excess; still more preferably at least a 90% enantiomeric excess; and the most preferably at least a 94% enantiomeric excess of the more active isomer. Of particular note are enantiomerically pure embodiments of the more active isomer. \n\n\n Compounds of Formula 1 can exist as one or more conformational isomers due to restricted rotation about the amide bond (e.g., C(=W)-N) in Formula 1. Compounds of Formula 1 comprise mixtures of conformational isomers. In addition, compounds of Formula 1 include compounds that are enriched in one conformer relative to others. \n\n The compounds of the present invention include N-oxide derivatives of Formula 1. One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen-containing heterocycles can form N-oxides since the nitrogen requires an available lone pair of electrons for oxidation to the oxide; one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen-containing heterocycles which can form N-oxides. One skilled in the art will also recognize that tertiary amines can form N-oxides. Synthetic methods for the preparation of N-oxides of heterocycles and tertiary amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the oxidation of heterocycles and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium perborate, and dioxiranes such as dimethyldioxirane. These methods for the preparation of N-oxides have been extensively described and reviewed in the literature, see for example: T. L. Gilchrist in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, vol. 7, pp 748-750, S. V. Ley, Ed., Pergamon Press; M. Tisler and B. Stanovnik in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 3, pp 18-20, A. J. Boulton and A. McKillop, Eds., Pergamon Press; M. R. Grimmett and B. R. T. Keene in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 43, pp 149- 161, A. R. Katritzky, Ed., Academic Press; M. Tisler and B. Stanovnik in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 9, pp 285-291, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press; and G. W. H. Cheeseman and E. S. G. Werstiuk in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 22, pp 390-392, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press. \n\n\n One skilled in the art recognizes that because in the environment and under physiological conditions salts of chemical compounds are in equilibrium with their corresponding nonsalt forms, salts share the biological utility of the nonsalt forms. When the compounds forming the present mixtures and compositions contain acidic or basic moieties, a wide variety of salts can be formed, and these salts are useful in the present mixtures and compositions for controlling plant diseases caused by fungal plant pathogens (i.e. are agriculturally suitable). When a compound contains a basic moiety such as an amine function, salts include acid-addition salts with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrobromic, hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, butyric, fumaric, lactic, maleic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, salicylic, tartaric, 4-toluenesulfonic or valeric acids. When a compound contains an acidic moiety such as a carboxylic acid or phenol, salts include those formed with organic or inorganic bases such as pyridine, triethylamine or ammonia, or amides, hydrides, hydroxides or carbonates of sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium or barium. \n\n\n The compounds described and specifically named herein may form pharmaceutically acceptable complexes, salts, solvates and hydrates. The salts include acid addition salts and base salts. \n\n Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include salts derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, hydrofluoric acid, and phosphorous acids, as well salts derived from organic acids, such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, etc. Such salts include acetate, adipate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bicarbonate, carbonate, bisulfate, sulfate, borate, camsylate, citrate, cyclamate, edisylate, esylate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hexafluorophosphate, hibenzate, hydrochloride, chloride, hydrobromide, bromide, hydroiodide, iodide, isothionate, lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, mesylate, methylsulfate, naphthylate, 2-napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, oxalate, almitate, pamoate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, dihydrogen phosphate, pyroglutamate, saccharate, stearate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, tosylate, trifluoroacetate and xinofoate salts. \n\n\n Pharmaceutically acceptable base salts include salts derived from bases, including metal cations, such as an alkali or alkaline earth metal cation, as well as amines. Examples of suitable metal cations include sodium (Na\n+\n), potassium (K\n+\n), magnesium (Mg\n2+\n), calcium (Ca\n2+\n), zinc (Zn\n2+\n), and aluminum (Al\n3+\n). Examples of suitable amines include arginine, Ν,Ν'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethylamine, diethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, ethylenediamine, glycine, lysine, N-methylglucamine, olamine, 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-l,3-diol, and procaine. For a discussion of useful acid addition and base salts, see S. M. Berge et al., \"Pharmaceutical Salts,\" J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19; see also Stahl and Wermuth, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use (2002). \n\n\n The compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from fully amorphous to fully crystalline. They may also exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. The term \"solvate\" describes a molecular complex comprising the compound and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules (e.g., EtOH). The term \"hydrate\" is a solvate in which the solvent is water. Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates include those in which the solvent may be isotopically substituted (e.g., D\n2\n0, d\n6\n-acetone, d\n6\n-DMSO). \n\n\n A currently accepted classification system for solvates and hydrates of organic compounds is one that distinguishes between isolated site, channel, and metal-ion coordinated solvates and hydrates. See, e.g., K. R. Morris (H. G. Brittain ed.) Polymorphism in Pharmaceutical Solids (1995). Isolated site solvates and hydrates are ones in which the solvent (e.g., water) molecules are isolated from direct contact with each other by intervening molecules of the organic compound. In channel solvates, the solvent molecules lie in lattice channels where they are next to other solvent molecules. In metal-ion coordinated solvates, the solvent molecules are bonded to the metal ion. \n\n When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and in hygroscopic compounds, the water or solvent content will depend on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm. \n\n\n Compounds selected from Formula 1, stereoisomers, N-oxides, and salts thereof, typically exist in more than one form, and Formula 1 thus includes all crystalline and noncrystalline forms of the compounds that Formula 1 represents. Non-crystalline forms include embodiments which are solids such as waxes and gums as well as embodiments which are liquids such as solutions and melts. Crystalline forms include embodiments which represent essentially a single crystal type and embodiments which represent a mixture of polymorphs (i.e. different crystalline types). The term \"polymorph\" refers to a particular crystalline form of a chemical compound that can crystallize in different crystalline forms, these forms having different arrangements and/or conformations of the molecules in the crystal lattice. Although polymorphs can have the same chemical composition, they can also differ in composition due the presence or absence of co-crystallized water or other molecules, which can be weakly or strongly bound in the lattice. Polymorphs can differ in such chemical, physical and biological properties as crystal shape, density, hardness, color, chemical stability, melting point, hygroscopicity, suspensibility, dissolution rate and biological availability. One skilled in the art will appreciate that a polymorph of a compound represented by Formula 1 can exhibit beneficial effects (e.g., suitability for preparation of useful formulations, improved biological performance) relative to another polymorph or a mixture of polymorphs of the same compound represented by Formula 1. Preparation and isolation of a particular polymorph of a compound represented by Formula 1 can be achieved by methods known to those skilled in the art including, for example, crystallization using selected solvents and temperatures. \n\n\n The compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may also exist as multicomponent complexes (other than salts and solvates) in which the compound and at least one other component are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Complexes of this type include clathrates (drug-host inclusion complexes) and co- crystals. The latter are typically defined as crystalline complexes of neutral molecular constituents which are bound together through non-covalent interactions, but could also be a complex of a neutral molecule with a salt. Co-crystals may be prepared by melt crystallization, by recrystallization from solvents, or by physically grinding the components together. See, e.g., O. Almarsson and M. J. Zaworotko, Chem. Commun. 2004 17, 1889- 1896. For a general review of multi-component complexes, see J. K. Haleblian, J. Pharm. Sci. 1975, 64, 1269-88. \n\n The invention includes prodrugs and metabolites of the compounds of Formula 1. \"Prodrugs\" refer to compounds that when metabolized in vivo, undergo conversion to compounds having the desired pharmacological activity. Prodrugs may be prepared by replacing appropriate functionalities present in pharmacologically active compounds with \"pro-moieties\"-as described, for example, in H. Bundgaar, Design of Prodrugs (1985). Examples of prodrugs include ester, ether or amide derivatives of the compounds herein, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. For further discussions of prodrugs, see e.g., T. Higuchi and V. Stella \"Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\" ACS Symposium Series 14 (1975) and E. B. Roche ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design (1987). \n\n\n \"Metabolites\" refer to compounds formed in vivo upon administration of pharmacologically active compounds. Examples include hydroxymethyl, hydroxy, secondary amino, primary amino, phenol, and carboxylic acid derivatives of compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having methyl, alkoxy, tertiary amino, secondary amino, phenyl, and amide groups, respectively. \n\n\n Compounds described herein also include all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopic variations, in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include, for example, isotopes of hydrogen, such as \n2\nH and \n3\nH; isotopes of carbon, such as \nU\nC, \n13\nC and \n14\nC; isotopes of nitrogen, such as \n13\nN and \n15\nN; isotopes of oxygen, such as \n15\n0 , \n17\n0 and \n18\n0; isotopes of sulfur, such as \n35\nS; isotopes of fluorine, such as \n18\nF; isotopes of chlorine, such as \n6\nC1, and isotopes of iodine, such as \n12\n Iand \n125\nI. Use of isotopic variations (e.g., deuterium, \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. Additionally, certain isotopic variations of the disclosed compounds may incorporate a radioactive isotope (e.g., tritium, H, or \n14\nC), which may be useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as C, \n18\nF, \n15\n0 and \n1\n N, may be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labelled compounds may be prepared by processes analogous to those described elsewhere in the disclosure using an appropriate isotopically-labelled reagent in place of a non-labelled reagent. \n\n\n Embodiments of the present invention as described in the Summary of the Invention include those described below.

A wide array of amine protecting groups are suitable for the method of Scheme 9 (see, for example, T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991), and the choice of the appropriate protecting groups will be apparent to one skilled in chemical synthesis. After deprotection, the amine of Formula 3 can be isolated as its acid salt or the free amine by general methods known in the art. \n\n\n Scheme 9 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n wherein Y is an amine protecting group \n\n\n One skilled in the art will recognize that many compounds of Formula 17 can be prepared by methods analogous to those described in Schemes 4 through 8 above where the group R\n1\nA(C=W)- is replaced by Y\n5\n. Thus, compounds corresponding to Formulae 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 in which the group R\n1\nA(C=W)- is replaced by Y\n5\n are useful intermediates for the preparation of compounds of Formula 1. \n\n\n Thioamides of Formula 18 are particularly useful intermediates for preparing compounds of Formula 1 and 17. A thioamide of Formula 18 can be prepared by the addition of hydrogen sulfide to the corresponding nitrile of Formula 19 wherein X is a carbon atom and Y\n7\n is a nitrile moiety as shown in Scheme 10. The methods of Scheme 10 can be carried out by contacting a compound of Formula 19 with hydrogen sulfide in the presence of an amine such as pyridine, diethylamine or diethanolamine. Alternatively, hydrogen sulfide can be used in the form of its bisulfide salt with an alkali metal or ammonia. This type of reaction is well documented in the literature see; for example, European Patent EP 696581. \n\n Scheme 10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n wherein Y is R A(C=W)- or an amine protecting group \n\n\n As also shown in Scheme 10, a thioamide of Formula 18 can be prepared by the reaction of a compound of Formula 19 wherein X is a nitrogen atom and Y\n7\n is H and thiocarbonyl diimidazole followed by treatment with ammonia as described by J. L. Collins, et al, J. Med. Chem. 1998, 41, 5037-5054. \n\n\n Halomethyl isoxazoline ketones of Formula 24 are also particularly useful intermediates for preparing certain chiral compounds of Formula 1. Halomethyl isoxazoline ketones of Formula 24 can be prepared by the multi-step reaction sequences shown in Scheme 11. \n\n\n One skilled in the art will recognize that Scheme 11 can also be practiced without the use of a resolving agent, so that a compound of Formula 21 is converted directly to a racemic analog of Formula 20a, which can then be used to prepare racemic analogs of Formulae 23 and 24 and certain racemic compounds of Formula 1. \n\n\n Scheme 11 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30 \n\n\n wherein R is C\n2\n-C\n8\n dialkylamino, C\n2\n-Cg haloalkylamino, 1 -piperidinyl, 1 -pyrrolidinyl or 4-morpholinyl; and Y\n1\n is CI, Br or I \n\n The preparation of racemic carboxylic acids of Formula 21 can be accomplished according to the well-known methods of basic or acidic hydrolysis of the corresponding compounds of Formula 20, preferably using a slight excess of sodium hydroxide in a water- miscible co-solvent such as methanol or tetrahydrofuran at about 25 to 45 °C. The product can be isolated by adjusting the pH of the reaction mixture to about 1 to 3 and then filtration or extraction, optionally after removal of the organic solvent by evaporation. The racemic carboxylic acids of Formula 21 can be resolved by classical fractional crystallization of diastereomeric salts of suitable chiral amine bases such as cinchonine, dihydrocinchonine or a mixture thereof. A cinchonine-dihydrocinchonine mixture in about a 85: 15 ratio is particularly useful, as it provides, for example, the (i?)-configured carboxylic acids of Formula 22, wherein R\n4\n is a substituted phenyl group, as the less soluble salt. Furthermore, these chiral amine bases are readily available on a commercial scale. The halomethyl ketones of Formula 24 can be prepared by first reacting the corresponding amides of Formula 20, either as pure enantiomers (i.e. Formula 20a) or in enantiomerically enriched or racemic mixtures, with one molar equivalent of a methylmagnesium halide (Grignard reagent) in a suitable solvent or solvent mixture such as tetrahydrofuran and toluene at about 0 to 20 °C, and the crude ketone products of Formula 23 can be isolated by quenching with aqueous acid, extraction, and concentration. Then the crude ketones of Formula 23 are halogenated with a reagent such as sulfuryl chloride to afford the chloromethyl ketones of Formula 24 wherein Y\n1\n is CI or molecular bromine to afford the corresponding bromomethyl ketones of Formula 24 wherein Y\n1\n is Br. The halomethyl ketones of Formula 24 can be purified by crystallization from a solvent such as hexanes or methanol, or can be used without further purification in the condensation reaction with thioamides of Formula 18 to form compounds of Formula 1 where G is a thiazole ring. \n\n\n The isoxazoline carboxamides of Formula 20 can be prepared by cycloaddition of the corresponding hydroxamoyl chlorides of Formula 25 with olefin derivatives of Formula 26, as shown in Scheme 12. \n\n\n Scheme 12 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n wherein R 30 is C\n2\n-Cg dialkylamino, C\n2\n-Cg haloalkylamino, 1 -piperidinyl, 1 -pyrrolidinyl or 4-morpholinyl In this method, all three reacting components (the compounds of Formulae 25 and 26, and the base) are contacted so as to minimize hydrolysis or dimerization of the hydroxamoyl \n\n chloride of Formula 25. In one typical procedure, the base, which can either be a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine or an inorganic base such as an alkali metal or alkaline- earth carbonate, bicarbonate or phosphate, is mixed with the olefin derivative of Formula 26, and the hydroxamoyl chloride of Formula 25 is added gradually at a temperature at which the cycloaddition proceeds at a relatively rapid rate, typically between 5 and 25 °C. Alternatively, the base can be added gradually to the other two components (the compounds of Formulae 25 and 26). This alternative procedure is preferable when the hydroxamoyl chloride of Formula 25 is substantially insoluble in the reaction medium. The solvent in the reaction medium can be water or an inert organic solvent such as toluene, hexane or even the olefin derivative used in excess. The product can be separated from the salt co-product by filtration or washing with water, followed by evaporation of the solvent. The crude product can be purified by crystallization, or the crude product can be used directly in the methods of Scheme 11. Compounds of Formula 20 are useful precursors to the corresponding methyl ketones of Formula 23 and halomethyl ketones of Formula 24, and are also useful for preparing the resolved enantiomers of the compounds of Formulae 23 and 24 by hydrolysis, resolution, methyl ketone synthesis and halogenation, as shown in Scheme 11. \n\n\n It is recognized that some reagents and reaction conditions described above for preparing compounds of Formula 1 may not be compatible with certain functionalities present in the intermediates. In these instances, the incorporation of protection/deprotection sequences or functional group interconversions into the synthesis will aid in obtaining the desired products. The use and choice of the protecting groups will be apparent to one skilled in chemical synthesis (see, for example, Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991). One skilled in the art will recognize that, in some cases, after the introduction of a given reagent as it is depicted in any individual scheme, it may be necessary to perform additional routine synthetic steps not described in detail to complete the synthesis of compounds of Formula 1. One skilled in the art will also recognize that it may be necessary to perform a combination of the steps illustrated in the above schemes in an order other than that implied by the particular sequence presented to prepare the compounds of Formula 1. \n\n\n One skilled in the art will also recognize that compounds of Formula 1 and the intermediates described herein can be subjected to various electrophilic, nucleophilic, radical, organometallic, oxidation, and reduction reactions to add substituents or modify existing substituents or the oxidation state within rings. \n\n\n Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art using the preceding description can utilize the present invention to its fullest extent. The following Examples are, therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limiting of the disclosure in any way whatsoever. Steps in the following Examples illustrate a procedure for each step in an overall synthetic transformation, and the starting material for each step may not have \n\n necessarily been prepared by a particular preparative run whose procedure is described in other Examples or Steps.

Step D: Preparation of (5i?)-4,5-dihydro-N,N-dimethyl-5-phenyl-3-isoxazole- carboxamide \n\n\n The cinchonine salt of (5i?)-4,5-dihydro-5-phenyl-3-isoxazolecarboxylic acid (i.e. the product of Example 5, Step C) (98%> diastereomeric excess, 16.5 g, 34.3 mmol) was slurried in a mixture of 1 N hydrochloric acid (90 mL), cyclohexane (100 mL) and ethyl acetate (40 mL). After all the solids dissolved, the phases were separated, and the organic layer was washed with brine (20 mL) and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 5.6 g of white solid. To a solution of the resulting free acid (5.0 g, 26.2 mmol) in ethyl acetate (100 mL) at room temperature was added N,N-dimethylformamide (1 drop) followed by thionyl chloride (4.25 g, 35.7 mmol). The reaction mixture was then heated under reflux for 3 h. The resulting mixture was cooled and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue containing crude acid chloride was dissolved in ethyl acetate (25 mL), and this solution was added in portions to a pre-cooled (5 °C) mixture of dimethylamine in tetrahydrofuran (29 mL of a 2.0 M solution), while maintaining the temperature of the mixture at 5-10 °C. When the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and diluted with water (50 mL). The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with water and suction-dried overnight to give 4.1 g of the title compound as a light tan solid, melting at 59-61 °C. This compound was of sufficient purity to use in subsequent reactions. \n\n\n Step E: Preparation of 2-bromo-l-[(5i?)-4,5-dihydro-5-phenyl-3-isoxazolyl]ethanone\n\n\nA solution of (5i?)-4,5-dihydro-N,N-dimethyl-5-phenyl-3-isoxazolecarboxamide (i.e. the product of Example 5, Step D) (3.5 g, 16.0 mmol) in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) and toluene (10 mL) was cooled to -15 °C, and methyl magnesium bromide (3.0 M solution in tetrahydrofuran, 8.8 mL, 26.4 mmol) was added over 1 h at -15 °C. Then the reaction mixture was poured over a mixture of 20 g of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 80 g of ice, \n\n and the organic phase was separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL), and the combined extract was washed with brine (40 mL) and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 3.2 g of l-[(5i?)-4,5-dihydro-5-phenyl-3-isoxazoyl]ethanone. \n\n\n!H MR (CDC1\n3\n) δ 2.55 (s, 3H), 3.17 (dd, 1H), 3.54 (dd, 1H), 5.75 (dd, 1H), 7.35 (m, 5H). l-[(5i?)-4,5-dihydro-5-phenyl-3-isoxazoyl]ethanone (3.2 g, 16.7 mmol) was dissolved in 1 ,2-dichloroethane (15 mL), and a solution of bromine (2.13 g, 13.3 mmol) in dichloroethane (5 mL) was added over 30 minutes while maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture at about 30 °C. The reaction mixture was diluted with water (10 mL), and the organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by medium-pressure liquid chromatography using 35% of dichloromethane in hexanes as eluant to give 2.6 g of the title compound as a white solid, melting at 31-33 °C. \n\n\n !H NMR (CDCI3): δ 3.20 (dd, 1H), 3.60 (dd, 1H), 4.49 (s, 2H), 5.80 (dd, 1H), 7.35 (m, 5H). Step F: Preparation of 4-cyano-N-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)piperidinecarboxamide \n\n\n A solution of 4-cyanopiperidine (11.0 g, 100 mmol) in diethyl ether (350 mL) was cooled to 0 °C with an ice-water bath. A solution of 2,5-dimethylphenyl isocyanate (14.7 g, 100 mmol) in diethyl ether (50 mL) was added into the reaction mixture over 30 minutes to give a thick precipitate. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature, and the resulting solids were filtered, washed with diethyl ether and air-dried to give 25.3 g of the title compound as a white powder, melting at 187-190 °C. \n\n\n!H NMR (CDCI3) δ 1.95 (m, 4H), 2.19 (s, 3H), 2.30 (s, 3H), 2.90 (m, 1H), 3.45 (m, 2H), 3.70 (m, 2H), 6.10 (br s, 1H), 6.85 (m, 1H), 7.04 (m, 1H), 7.37 (m, 1H). \n\n\nStep G: Preparation of N-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-4-thiocarbamoylpiperidine- carboxamide \n\n\n A mixture of 4-cyano-N-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)piperidinecarboxamide (i.e. the product of Step F) (12.75 g, 49.6 mmol), sodium hydrosulfide hydrate (11.1 g, 150 mmol) and diethylamine hydrochloride (10.9 g, 100 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (50 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 3 days. The resulting thick, green suspension was added dropwise into ice water (600 mL). The resulting solid was filtered, washed with water and air-dried to give 12.5 g of the title compound as a tan solid decomposing at 155-156 °C. !H NMR (DMSO- ) δ 1.67 (m, 4H), 2.10 (s, 3H), 2.23 (s, 3H), 2.75 (m, 3H), 4.15 (m, 2H), 6.85 (m, 1H), 7.0 (m, 1H), 7.05 (m, 1H), 7.95 (br s, 1H), 9.15 (br s, 1H), 9.22 (br s, 1H).

They may be administered alone or in combination with one another or with one or more pharmacologically active compounds which are different than the compounds described or specifically named herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Generally, one or more these compounds are administered as a pharmaceutical composition (a formulation) in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The choice of excipients depends on the particular mode of administration, the effect of the excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form, among other things. Useful pharmaceutical compositions and methods for their preparation may be found, for example, in A. R. Gennaro (ed.), Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th ed., 2000). \n\n\n Also provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or excipients. The compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be administered orally. Oral administration may involve swallowing in which case the compound enters the bloodstream via the gastrointestinal tract. Alternatively or additionally, oral administration may involve mucosal administration (e.g., buccal, sublingual, supralingual administration) such that the compound enters the bloodstream through the oral mucosa. Formulations suitable for oral administration include solid, semi-solid and liquid systems such as tablets; soft or hard capsules containing multi- or nano-particulates, liquids, or powders; lozenges which may be liquid-filled; chews; gels; fast dispersing dosage forms; films; ovules; sprays; and buccal or mucoadhesive patches. \n\n\n Liquid formulations include suspensions; solutions, syrups and elixirs. Such formulations may be employed as fillers in soft or hard capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) and typically comprise a carrier (e.g., water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, or a suitable oil) and one or more emulsifying agents, suspending agents or both. Liquid formulations may also be prepared by the reconstitution of a solid (e.g., from a sachet). \n\n\n The compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may also be used in fast-dissolving, fast-disintegrating dosage forms such as those described in Liang and Chen, Expert Opinion in Therapeutic Patents 2001, 11, 981-986. \n\n\n For tablet dosage forms, depending on dose, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) may comprise from about 1 to about 80 wt. % of the dosage form or more typically from about 5 to about 60 wt. % of the dosage form. In addition to the API, tablets may include one or more disintegrants, binders, diluents, surfactants, glidants, lubricants, antioxidants, colorants, flavoring agents, preservatives, and taste-masking agents. Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone, \n\n methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, ^-Cg alkyl-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose, starch, pregelatinized starch, and sodium alginate. Generally, the disintegrant will comprise from about 1 to about 25 wt. % or from about 5 to about 20 wt. %of the dosage form. \n\n\n Binders are generally used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation.\n\n\nSuitable binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, sugars, polyethylene glycol, natural and synthetic gums, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pregelatinized starch, hydroxypropylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. Tablets may also contain diluents, such as lactose (monohydrate, spray-dried monohydrate, anhydrous), mannitol, xylitol, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate. Tablets may also include surface active agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate, and glidants such as silicon dioxide and talc. When present, surface active agents may comprise from about 0.2 to about 5 wt. % of the tablet, and glidants may comprise from about 0.2 about 1 wt. % of the tablet. Tablets may also contain lubricants such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and mixtures of magnesium stearate with sodium lauryl sulfate. Lubricants may comprise from about 0.25 about 10 wt. % or from about 0.5 to about 3 wt. % of the tablet. Tablet blends may be compressed directly or by roller compaction to form tablets. Tablet blends or portions of blends may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt-congealed, or extruded before tableting. If desired, prior to blending, one or more of the components may be sized by screening or milling or both. The final dosage form may comprise one or more layers and may be coated, uncoated, or encapsulated. Exemplary tablets may contain up to about 80 wt. % of API, from about 10 to about 90 wt. % of binder, from about 0 to about 85 wt. % of diluent, from about 2 to about 10 wt. % of disintegrant, and from about 0.25 to about 10 wt. % of lubricant. For a discussion of blending, granulation, milling, screening, tableting, coating, as well as a description of alternative techniques for preparing drug products, see A. R. Gennaro (ed.), Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th ed., 2000); H. A. Lieberman et al. (ed.), Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Vol. 1-3 (2d ed., 1990); and D. K. Parikh &C. K. Parikh, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Granulation Technology, Vol. 81 (1997). \n\n\n Consumable oral films for human or veterinary use are pliable water-soluble or water- swellable thin film dosage forms which may be rapidly dissolving or mucoadhesive. In addition to the API, a typical film includes one or more film-forming polymers, binders, solvents, humectants, plasticizers, stabilizers or emulsifiers, viscosity-modifying agents, and solvents. Other film ingredients may include anti-oxidants, colorants, flavorants and flavor enhancers, preservatives, salivary stimulating agents, cooling agents, co-solvents (including oils), emollients, bulking agents, anti-foaming agents, surfactants, and taste-masking agents. Some components of the formulation may perform more than one function. In addition to \n\n dosing requirements, the amount of API in the film may depend on its solubility. If water soluble, the API would typically comprise from about 1 to about 80 wt. %of the non-solvent components (solutes) in the film or from about 20 to about 50 wt. % of the solutes in the film. A less soluble API may comprise a greater proportion of the composition, typically up to about 88 wt. % of the non-solvent components in the film. \n\n\n The film-forming polymer can be selected from natural polysaccharides, proteins, or synthetic hydrocolloids and typically comprises from about 0.01 to about 99 wt. % or from about 30 to about 80 wt. %of the film. Film dosage forms are typically prepared by evaporative drying of thin aqueous films coated onto a peelable backing support or paper, which may carried out in a drying oven or tunnel (e.g., in a combined coating-drying apparatus), in lyophilization equipment, or in a vacuum oven. \n\n\n Useful solid formulations for oral administration may include immediate release formulations and modified release formulations. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted-, and programmed-release. For a general description of suitable modified release formulations, see US Patent No. 6,106,864. For details of other useful release technologies, such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles, see Verma et al, Pharmaceutical Technology On-line 2001 25, 1-14. Compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may also be administered directly into the blood stream, muscle, or an internal organ of the subject. Suitable techniques for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular, intrasynovial, and subcutaneous administration. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle injectors, including microneedle injectors, needle- free injectors, and infusion devices. \n\n\n Parenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (e.g., pH of from about 3 to about 9). For some applications, however, the compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water. The preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions (e.g., by lyophilization) may be readily accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques. \n\n\n The solubility of compounds which are used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased through appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents. Formulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed, sustained, pulsed, controlled, targeted, and programmed release. Thus, compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be formulated as a suspension, a solid, a semi-solid, or a thixotropic liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing \n\n modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug- coated stents and semi-solids and suspensions comprising drug-loaded poly(DL-lactic- coglycolic)acid (PGLA) microspheres. \n\n\n The compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may also be administered topically, intradermally, or transdermally to the skin or mucosa. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibers, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers may include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Topical formulations may also include penetration enhancers. See, e.g., Finnin and Morgan, J. Pharm. Sci. 1999, 88, 955-958. Other means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and microneedle or needle-free injection. Formulations for topical administration may be formulated to be immediate or modified release as described above. \n\n\n The compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder, an aerosol spray, or nasal drops. An inhaler may be used to administer the dry powder, which comprises the API alone, a powder blend of the API and a diluent, such as lactose, or a mixed component particle that includes the API and a phospholipid, such as phosphatidylcholine. For intranasal use, the powder may include a bioadhesive agent, e.g., chitosan or cyclodextrin. A pressurized container, pump, sprayer, atomizer, or nebulizer, may be used to generate the aerosol spray from a solution or suspension comprising the API, one or more agents for dispersing, solubilizing, or extending the release of the API (e.g., EtOH with or without water), one or more solvents (e.g., 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) which serve as a propellant, and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid. An atomizer using electrohydrodynamics may be used to produce a fine mist. \n\n\n Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is usually comminuted to a particle size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically 90% of the particles, based on volume, having a largest dimension less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate size reduction method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing, high pressure homogenization, or spray drying. \n\n\n Capsules, blisters and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose) for use in an inhaler or insufflator maybe formulated to contain a powder mixture of the active compound, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch, and a performance modifier such as L-Ieucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or monohydrated. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose, and trehalose. \n\n A suitable solution formulation for use in an atomizer using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from about 1 μg to about 20 mg of the API per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from about 1 μΐ\n^\n to about 100 μί. A typical formulation may comprise one or more of the compounds herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, propylene glycol, sterile water, EtOH, and NaCl. Alternative solvents, which may be used instead of propylene glycol, include glycerol and polyethylene glycol. \n\n\n Formulations for inhaled administration, intranasal administration, or both, may be formulated to be immediate or modified release using, for example, PGLA. Suitable flavors, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or sodium saccharin, may be added to formulations intended for inhaled/intranasal administration. \n\n\n In the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve that delivers a metered amount. Units are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or \"puff containing from about 10 μg to about 1000 μg of the API. The overall daily dose will typically range from about 100 μg to about 10 mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day. \n\n\n The active compounds may be administered rectally or vaginally, e.g., in the form of a suppository, pessary, or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate. Formulations for rectal or vaginal administration may be formulated to be immediate or modified release as described above. \n\n\n The compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronized suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, gels, biodegradable implants (e.g., absorbable gel sponges, collagen), non-biodegradable implants (e.g., silicone), wafers, lenses, and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. The formulation may include one or more polymers and a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Typical polymers include crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, cellulosic polymers (e.g., hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, methyl cellulose), and heteropolysaccharide polymers (e.g., gelan gum). Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis. Formulations for ocular or aural administration may be formulated to be immediate or modified release as described above. \n\n\n As noted above, the compounds herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and their pharmaceutically active complexes, solvates and hydrates, may be combined with one another or with one or more other active pharmaceutically active compounds to treat various diseases, conditions and disorders. In such cases, the active compounds may be combined in a single dosage form as described above or may be provided in the form of a kit which is suitable for co-administration of the compositions. The kit comprises (1) two or more different pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of \n\n which contains a compound of Formula 1; and (2) a device for separately retaining the two pharmaceutical compositions, such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets or capsules. The kit is suitable for administering different types of dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral) or for administering different pharmaceutical compositions at separate dosing intervals, or for titrating the different pharmaceutical compositions against one another. To assist with patient compliance, the kit typically comprises directions for administration and may be provided with a memory aid. \n\n\n For administration to human patients, the total daily dose of the claimed and disclosed compounds is typically in the range of about 0.1 mg to about 3000 mg depending on the route of administration. For example, oral administration may require a total daily dose of from about 1 mg to about 3000 mg, while an intravenous dose may only require a total daily dose of from about 0.1 mg to about 300 mg. The total daily dose may be administered in single or divided doses and, at the physician's discretion, may fall outside of the typical ranges given above. Although these dosages are based on an average human subject having a mass of about 60 kg to about 70 kg, the physician will be able to determine the appropriate dose for a patient (e.g., an infant) whose mass falls outside of this weight range. \n\n\n The claimed and disclosed compounds may be combined with one or more other pharmacologically active compounds for the treatment of one or more related disorders, the pharmacologically active compounds can be selected from: (1) an opioid analgesic, e.g., morphine, fentanyl, codeine, etc.; (2) a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, diclofenac, etodolac, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.; (3) a barbiturate sedative, e.g., pentobarbital; (4) a benzodiazepine having a sedative action, e.g., diazepam, lorazepam, etc.; (5) an HI antagonist having a sedative action, e.g., diphenhydramine; (6) a sedative such as glutethimide, meprobamate, methaqualone or dichloralphenazone; (7) a skeletal muscle relaxant, e.g., baclofen, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol or orphrenadine; (8) an NMDA receptor antagonist; (9) an alpha-adrenergic;\n\n\n(10) a tricyclic antidepressant, e.g., desipramine, imipramine, amitriptyline or nortriptyline;\n\n\n(11) an anticonvulsant, e.g., carbamazepine, lamotrigine, topiratmate or valproate; (12) a tachykinin (NK) antagonist, particularly an NK-3, NK-2 or NK-1 antagonist; (13) a muscarinic antagonist, e.g., oxybutynin, tolterodine, etc.; (14) a COX-2 selective inhibitor, e.g., celecoxib, valdecoxib, etc.; (15) a coal-tar analgesic, in particular paracetamol; (16) a neuroleptic such as haloperidol, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, or Miraxion®; (17) a vanilloid receptor (VR1; also known as transient receptor potential channel, TRPV1) agonist (e.g., resinferatoxin) or antagonist (e.g., capsazepine); (18) a beta- adrenergic such as propranolol; (19) a local anaesthetic such as mexiletine; (20) a corticosteroid such as dexamethasone; (21) a 5-HT receptor agonist or antagonist, particularly a 5HT\n1B\n/\n1D\n agonist such as eletriptan, sumatriptan, naratriptan, zolmitriptan or \n\n rizatriptan; (22) a 5-HT\n2\nA receptor antagonist such as i?(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-l- [2-(4-fluorophenylethyl)]-4-piperidinemethanol (MDL- 100907); (23) a cholinergic (nicotinic) analgesic, such as ispronicline (TC-1734), (E)-N-methyl-4-(3-pyridinyl)-3-buten- 1 -amine (RJR-2403), (R)-5-(2-azetidinylmethoxy)-2-chloropyridine (ABT-594) or nicotine, or a nicotine partial agonist such as varenicline; (24) Tramadol®; (25) a PDEV inhibitor; (26) an alpha-2-delta ligand such as gabapentin, pregabalin, 3-methylgabapentin, etc.; (27) a cannabinoid receptor (CB1 , CB2) ligand, either agonist or antagonist such as rimonabant; (28) metabotropic glutamate subtype 1 receptor (mGluRl) antagonist; (29) a serotonin reuptake inhibitor such as sertraline, sertraline metabolite demethylsertraline, fluoxetine, etc.; (30) a noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitor, such as buproprion, buproprion metabolite hydroxybuproprion, especially a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor such as reboxetine, in particular (S^-reboxetine; (31) a dual serotonin- noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, such as venlafaxine.

Amino acids 2008, 34, 127-133. The region of the gene corresponding to amino acids 34 to 579 was cloned into pMAL-c4x (New England BioLabs, Inc.) using EcoRl and Sail restriction sites. E. coli T7 Express cells, containing the FAAH constructs, were used for expression of protein by induction with IPTG (isopropyl-P-D- thiogalactopyranoside) (100 μΜ) overnight at room temperature in Lennox Broth with 0.2% glucose. After harvest, the cells were resuspended in 20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 200 mM NaCl, 2mM DTT (dithiothreitol). The cell suspension was lysed by sonication, and the cell debris removed by centrifugation. The soluble extract was adjusted to 2.5 mg/mL protein, and the FAAH fusion protein (-105 kDa) loaded onto a 5 mL column of amylose affinity resin. The enzyme was eluted using 15 mM maltose as per manufacturer's (New England BioLabs, Inc.) instruction. Fractions containing FAAH were concentrated and further purified using Sephacryl™ SI 00 (HIPrep™ 26/60, GE Healthcare, Inc.) chromatography. Fractions enriched in FAAH were pooled, concentrated, and made \n\n 10% in glycerol then stored at -80°C until use. All column chromatography steps used the Hepes buffer described above. \n\n\n FAAH assay - Enzyme activity was measured using the fluorogenic substrate, decanoyl 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (D-AMC) as described by Kage, K.L. et al. J. of Neuroscience Methods 2007, 161, 47-54. Briefly, the assay buffer consisted of 125 mM Tris-CL, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% BSA (pH 8.0). D-AMC was used at final concentration of 5 μΜ in all assays. Reactions were carried out in black 96-well microplates (Costar, Inc) using a SpectraMax Gemini™ (Molecular Devices, Inc.) fluorescence plate reader in a reaction volume of 200 per well at 37 °C. Reaction rates were monitored at an emission wavelength of 430 nm using an excitation wavelength of 351 nm over 30 to 40 minutes. Experimental compounds were initially evaluated at a single concentration of 2 μΜ. Compounds inhibiting the reaction > 90%> were subsequently retested to determine IC\n50\n values. Representative results for compounds tested in the assay are listed in Table A. \n\n\n Table A \n\n\n Compound IC\n50\n (nM) \n\n\n 1 190 \n\n\n 11 0.04 \n\n\n 12 600 \n\n\n 23 35 \n\n\n 49 220 \n\n\n 52 29 \n\n\n 57 0.6 \n\n\n 58 0.2 \n\n\n 61 0.06 \n\n\n 62 0.04 \n\n\n 63 42 \n\n\n 64 2000 \n\n\n 65 0.41 \n\n\n 66 0.08 \n\n\n Evaluation of FAAH Inhibitor Selectivity \n\n\n The specificity of FAAH inhibition relative to other mechanistically similar enzymes, such as porcine liver esterase and porcine pancreatic elastase, was also explored for selected compounds. Both enzymes and substrates were obtained from commercial sources, and assayed in microplate format. N-succinyl-ala-ala-ala-/?-nitroanilide was used as a substrate for pancreatic elastase, and 4-nitrophenyl butyrate was used as a substrate for measuring liver esterase activity. Briefly, enzyme activity was measured by following the release of /?-nitroaniline and /?-nitrophenol at 400 nm from the respective chromogenic substrates using \n\n a SpectraMax™ Plus (Molecular Devices, Inc.) plate reader. The assay reaction mixture contained enzyme, 100 uM substrate, 0.125 M TrisCl, and 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 in a total volume of 200 μί. Reactions were started by the addition of substrate. Control reactions give linear reaction rates (20 to 50 mOD/min) over at least 5 min. Table B describes IC50 results for a series of selected compounds. All compounds tested showed at most, only slight inhibition of pancreatic elastase at the highest concentration tested (10 μΜ). Several compounds should some level of inhibition of liver esterase, but IC\n50\n values were orders of magnitude less potent compared to FAAH inhibition. These results indicated a high degree of specificity for FAAH inhibition by these compounds. \n\n\n Table B \n\n\n Compound IC50 (nM) Porcine Liver Esterase IC50 (nM) Porcine Elastase Pancreas\n\n\n49 > 10 >10 \n\n\n 1 5.6 >10 \n\n\n 61 0.87 >10 \n\n\n 66 0.47 >10 \n\n\n 62 0.84 >10 \n\n\n 11 2.8 >10 \n\n\n Inhibition of porcine esterase and elastase were measured using 4-nitophenyl butyrate and V-succinyl- ala-ala-ala-/>-nitroanilide as substrates respectively. \n\n\n Evaluation of Analgesic Potential of FAAH Inhibitors by Tail Immersion Assy in Mice The analgesic potential of Compounds 1, 11, 61 and 49 were determined by tail immersion assay. Anandamide (a brain lipid involved in natural analgesic response) was used as negative control, and OL-135 alone (an inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase that metabolizes anandamide) and a combination of OL-135 and anandamide were used as positive controls. Two vehicle controls (2:2: 16 DMSO:Alkamuls:saline and 1 : 1 : 18 EtOH:Alkamuls: saline) were also evaluated. Previous research indicates that administration of anandamide alone is largely ineffective in causing hypothermia or analgesia. However, when anandamide is administered along with OL-135, the analgesic effect was significantly elevated (A. H. Lichtman, et al. The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2004, 311, 441-448) Since Compounds 1, 11, 61 and 49 were shown to inhibit FAAH in vitro, the potential analgesic effects of these compounds were assessed by administering them in combination with anandamide in the present screening study. Test substances were injected once by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route to female Crl:CDl(ICR) mice. The tail immersion assay was conducted prior to administration of compounds to establish baseline values and again after administration of compounds. \n\n\n Analgesia was evaluated in female mice by immersing approximately 3.5 cm of each tail into water that was maintained at 52 +/- 1 °C for a maximum of 10 seconds (sec). The \n\n length of time until the animal removed its tail from the water or made a significant tail movement was measured. If the response time was less than 5 sec, a second trial was conducted. The test data are shown in Table C. \n\n\n A preliminary study was conducted to determine the optimal time interval between administration of OL-135 or the test substances and the administration of anandamide, and to determine the time interval between treatment with anandamide and conducting the tail immersion assay. Based on the results of the preliminary study, the time interval between administration of the test substances and anandamide was established as 40 minutes. In addition, the time interval between administration of anandamide and conducting the tail immersion assay was established to be 40 minutes. \n\n\n The formulations were made on the day of dosing and administered once by intraperitoneal route. Anandamide, OL-135, Compound 61 and Compound 49 were formulated in Vehicle 2 and Compound 1 and Compound 11 were formulated in Vehicle 1 Because the maximum mean response time of two vehicle controls, a negative control, and baseline evaluations of all groups was 7.5 sec, the treatments showing a mean response time equal to or below 7.5 sec were considered as having no analgesic effect. The mean response times with Compounds 1 and 49 were lower than 7.5 sec, and therefore, these compounds were considered to show no analgesic effects at the rate tested. Compounds 11 and 61 provided mean response times of > 7.5 sec, and 100% and 90%> of the treated animals, respectively, exhibited the maximum measured response time of 10 sec. Therefore, Compounds 11 and 61 were considered to show analgesic effects at the rate tested. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Table C \n\n\n Compound Baseline Time (sec) Test Time (sec) %MPE\n\n\nVehicle 1 4.0 (1.6) 4.6 (1.6) -1.0% (56.8%) Vehicle 2 7.0 (2.4) 5.2 (1.7) -23.9% (31.1%) \n\n Compound Baseline Time (sec) Test Time (sec) ΌΜΡΕ\n\n\nPositive Control 4.1 (1.9) 7.6 (2.4) 61.5% (41.5%) Negative Control 6.9 (3.1) 6.7 (3.0) 20.3% (44.0%) Compound 1 3.5 (0.9) 5.0 (1.1) 20.2% (27.5%) Compound 11 5.8 (2.7) 10.0 (0.0) 100.0% (0.0%) Compound 61 6.0 (3.0) 9.4 (1.9) 86.9% (34.6%) Compound 49 7.5 (2.9) 6.4 (2.9) -4.0% (71.8%)\n\n\nData presented as Mean (Standard Deviation) \n\n\n ΌΜΡΕ is percent of the maximum possible effect (test-baseline)/(10-baseline) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Anandamide OL-135"

Diagnostic methods using the antigen binding proteins are also provided. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) is a secreted polypeptide that belongs to a subfamily of Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) that includes FGF 19, FGF21, and FGF23 (Itoh et al., (2004) Trend Genet. 20:563-69). FGF21 is an atypical FGF in that it is heparin \n\n independent and functions as a hormone in the regulation of glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism. \n\n\n It is highly expressed in liver and pancreas and is the only member of the FGF family to be primarily expressed in liver. Transgenic mice overexpressing FGF21 exhibit metabolic phenotypes of slow growth rate, low plasma glucose and triglyceride levels, and an absence of age-associated type 2 diabetes, islet hyperplasia, and obesity. Pharmacological administration of recombinant FGF21 protein in rodent and primate models results in normalized levels of plasma glucose, reduced triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. In addition, FGF21 reduces body weight and body fat by increasing energy expenditure, physical activity, and metabolic rate. Experimental research provides support for the pharmacological administration of FGF21 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and other metabolic conditions or disorders in humans. \n\n\n FGF21 is a liver derived endocrine hormone that stimulates glucose uptake in adipocytes and lipid homeostasis through the activation of its receptor. Interestingly, in addition to the canonical FGF receptor, the FGF21 receptor also comprises the membrane associated β-Klotho as an essential cofactor. Activation of the FGF21 receptor leads to multiple effects on a variety of metabolic parameters. \n\n\n In mammals, FGFs mediate their action via a set of four FGF receptors, FGFR1 - 4, that in turn are expressed in multiple spliced variants, e.g., FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c and FGFR4. Each FGF receptor contains an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that is activated upon ligand binding, leading to downstream signaling pathways involving MAPKs (Erkl/2), RAF1, AKT1 and STATs. (Kharitonenkov et al, (2008) BioDrugs 22:37-44). Several reports suggested that the \"c\"-reporter splice variants of FGFR1-3 exhibit specific affinity to β-Klotho and could act as endogenous receptor for FGF21 (Kurosu et al, (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282:26687-26695); Ogawa et al, (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104:7432-7437); Kharitonenkov et al, (2008) J. Cell Physiol. 215: 1-7). In the liver, which abundantly expresses both β-Klotho and FGFR4, FGF21 does not induce phosphorylation of MAPK albeit the strong binding of FGF21 to the β-Klotho- FGFR4 complex. In 3T3-L1 cells and white adipose tissue, FGFR1 is by far the most abundant receptor, and it is therefore most likely that FGF21 's main functional receptors in this tissue are the β-Klotho/FGFRlc complexes. \n\n The present disclosure provides a human (or humanized) antigen binding protein, such as a monoclonal antibody, that induces FGF21-like signaling, e.g., an agonistic antibody that mimics the function of FGF21. Such an antibody is a molecule with FGF21-like activity and selectivity but with added therapeutically desirable characteristics typical for an antibody such as protein stability, lack of immunogenicity, ease of production and long half-life in vivo. \n\n\nSUMMARY \n\n\n An isolated antigen binding protein that induces FGF21 -mediated signaling is provided.

The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. \n\n\n Other than in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients or reaction conditions used herein should be understood as modified in all instances by the term \"about.\" The term \"about\" when used in connection with percentages can mean ±5%, e.g., 1%, 2%, 3%, or 4%. \n\n\nI. DEFINITIONS \n\n\n As used herein, the terms \"a\" and \"an\" mean \"one or more\" unless specifically stated otherwise. \n\n\n An \"antigen binding protein\" is a protein comprising a portion that binds to an antigen or target and, optionally, a scaffold or framework portion that allows the antigen binding portion to \n\n adopt a conformation that promotes binding of the antigen binding protein to the antigen. Examples of antigen binding proteins include a human antibody, a humanized antibody; a chimeric antibody; a recombinant antibody; a single chain antibody; a diabody; a triabody; a tetrabody; a Fab fragment; a F(ab')\n2\n fragment; an IgD antibody; an IgE antibody; an IgM antibody; an IgGl antibody; an IgG2 antibody; an IgG3 antibody; or an IgG4 antibody, and fragments thereof. The antigen binding protein can comprise, for example, an alternative protein scaffold or artificial scaffold with grafted CDRs or CDR derivatives. Such scaffolds include, but are not limited to, antibody-derived scaffolds comprising mutations introduced to, for example, stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the antigen binding protein as well as wholly synthetic scaffolds comprising, for example, a biocompatible polymer. See, e.g., Korndorfer et al., 2003, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, 53(1): 121-129 (2003); Roque et al., Biotechnol. Prog. 20:639-654 (2004). In addition, peptide antibody mimetics (\"PAMs\") can be used, as well as scaffolds based on antibody mimetics utilizing fibronectin components as a scaffold. \n\n\n An antigen binding protein can have, for example, the structure of a naturally occurring immunoglobulin. An \"immunoglobulin\" is a tetrameric molecule. In a naturally occurring immunoglobulin, each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \"light\" (about 25 kDa) and one \"heavy\" chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino- terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 1 10 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a \"J\" region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a \"D\" region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2\nnd\n ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site such that an intact immunoglobulin has two binding sites. \n\n\n Naturally occurring immunoglobulin chains exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, also called \n\n complementarity determining regions or CDRs. From N-terminus to C-terminus, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain can be done in accordance with the definitions of Kabat et al. in Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5\nth\n Ed., US Dept. of Health and Human Services, PHS, NIH, NIH Publication no. 91-3242, 1991. As desired, the CDRs can also be redefined according an alternative nomenclature scheme, such as that of Chothia (see Chothia & Lesk, 1987, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917; Chothia et al, 1989, Nature 342:878-883 or Honegger & Pluckthun, 2001, J . Mol. Biol. 309:657-670). \n\n\n In the context of the instant disclosure an antigen binding protein is said to \"specifically bind\" or \"selectively bind\" its target antigen when the dissociation constant (K\nD\n) is <10\n\"8\n M. The antibody specifically binds antigen with \"high affinity\" when the K\nD\n is <5x 10\n~9\n M, and with \"very high affinity\" when the K\nD\n is <5x 10\n\"10\n M. In one embodiment, the antibodies will bind to FGFRlc, β-Klotho, both FGFRlc and β-Klotho or a complex comprising FGFRlc and β-Klotho, including human FGFRlc, human β-Klotho or both human FGFRlc and human β-Klotho, with a K\nD\n of between about 10\n\"7\n M and 10\n\"12\n M, and in yet another embodiment the antibodies will bind with a K\nD\n≤5x 10\n~9\n. \n\n\n An \"antibody\" refers to an intact immunoglobulin or to an antigen binding portion thereof that competes with the intact antibody for specific binding, unless otherwise specified. Antigen binding portions can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Antigen binding portions include, inter alia, Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n, Fv, domain antibodies (dAbs), fragments including complementarity determining regions (CDRs), single-chain antibodies (scFv), chimeric antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, and polypeptides that contain at least a portion of an immunoglobulin that is sufficient to confer specific antigen binding to the polypeptide. \n\n\n A Fab fragment is a monovalent fragment having the V\nL\n, V\nH\n, C\nL\n and C\nH\nI domains; a\n\n\nF(ab')\n2\n fragment is a bivalent fragment having two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; a Fd fragment has the V\nH\n and C\nH\nI domains; an Fv fragment has the V\nL\n and V\nH\n domains of a single arm of an antibody; and a dAb fragment has a V\nH\n domain, a V\nL\n domain, or an antigen-binding fragment of a V\nH\n or V\nL\n domain (US Pat. Nos. 6,846,634, 6,696,245, US App. Pub. Nos. 05/0202512, 04/0202995, 04/0038291, 04/0009507, 03/0039958, Ward et al, Nature 341 :544-546 (1989)). \n\n A single-chain antibody (scFv) is an antibody in which a V\nL\n and a V\nH\n region are joined via a linker (e.g., a synthetic sequence of amino acid residues) to form a continuous protein chain wherein the linker is long enough to allow the protein chain to fold back on itself and form a monovalent antigen binding site (see, e.g., Bird et al, Science 242:423-26 (1988) and Huston et al, 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-83 (1988)). Diabodies are bivalent antibodies comprising two polypeptide chains, wherein each polypeptide chain comprises V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains joined by a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between two domains on the same chain, thus allowing each domain to pair with a complementary domain on another polypeptide chain (see, e.g., HoUiger et al, 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-48 (1993), and Poljak et al, Structure 2: 1121-23 (1994)). If the two polypeptide chains of a diabody are identical, then a diabody resulting from their pairing will have two identical antigen binding sites. Polypeptide chains having different sequences can be used to make a diabody with two different antigen binding sites. Similarly, tribodies and tetrabodies are antibodies comprising three and four polypeptide chains, respectively, and forming three and four antigen binding sites, respectively, which can be the same or different. \n\n\n Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FR) of a given antibody can be identified using the system described by Kabat et al. in Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., US Dept. of Health and Human Services, PHS, NIH, NIH Publication no. 91-3242, 1991 As desired, the CDRs can also be redefined according an alternative nomenclature scheme, such as that of Chothia (see Chothia & Lesk, 1987, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917; Chothia et al, 1989, Nature 342:878-883 or Honegger & Pluckthun, 2001, J. Mol. Biol. 309:657-670. One or more CDRs can be incorporated into a molecule either covalently or noncovalently to make it an antigen binding protein. An antigen binding protein can incorporate the CDR(s) as part of a larger polypeptide chain, can covalently link the CDR(s) to another polypeptide chain, or can incorporate the CDR(s) noncovalently. The CDRs permit the antigen binding protein to specifically bind to a particular antigen of interest. \n\n\n An antigen binding protein can have one or more binding sites. If there is more than one binding site, the binding sites can be identical to one another or can be different. For example, a naturally occurring human immunoglobulin typically has two identical binding sites, while a \"bispecific\" or \"bifunctional\" antibody has two different binding sites. \n\n The term \"human antibody\" includes all antibodies that have one or more variable and constant regions derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. In one embodiment, all of the variable and constant domains are derived from human immunoglobulin sequences (a fully human antibody). These antibodies can be prepared in a variety of ways, examples of which are described below, including through the immunization with an antigen of interest of a mouse that is genetically modified to express antibodies derived from human heavy and/or light chain- encoding genes, such as a mouse derived from a Xenomouse®, UltiMab™, or Velocimmune® system. Phage-based approaches can also be employed. \n\n\n A humanized antibody has a sequence that differs from the sequence of an antibody derived from a non-human species by one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or additions, such that the humanized antibody is less likely to induce an immune response, and/or induces a less severe immune response, as compared to the non-human species antibody, when it is administered to a human subject. In one embodiment, certain amino acids in the framework and constant domains of the heavy and/or light chains of the non-human species antibody are mutated to produce the humanized antibody. In another embodiment, the constant domain(s) from a human antibody are fused to the variable domain(s) of a non-human species. In another embodiment, one or more amino acid residues in one or more CDR sequences of a non-human antibody are changed to reduce the likely immunogenicity of the non-human antibody when it is administered to a human subject, wherein the changed amino acid residues either are not critical for immunospecific binding of the antibody to its antigen, or the changes to the amino acid sequence that are made are conservative changes, such that the binding of the humanized antibody to the antigen is not significantly worse than the binding of the non-human antibody to the antigen. Examples of how to make humanized antibodies can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,054,297, 5,886,152 and 5,877,293. \n\n\n The term \"chimeric antibody\" refers to an antibody that contains one or more regions from one antibody and one or more regions from one or more other antibodies. In one embodiment, one or more of the CDRs are derived from a human antibody that binds (i) β- Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. In another embodiment, all of the CDRs are derived from a human antibody that binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and \n\n FGFR4. In another embodiment, the CDRs from more than one human antibody that binds (i) β- Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 are mixed and matched in a chimeric antibody. For instance, a chimeric antibody can comprise a CDRl from the light chain of a first human antibody that binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, a CDR2 and a CDR3 from the light chain of a second human antibody that binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, and the CDRs from the heavy chain from a third antibody that binds (i) β- Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. Further, the framework regions can be derived from one of the same antibodies that bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, from one or more different antibodies, such as a human antibody, or from a humanized antibody. In one example of a chimeric antibody, a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with, homologous to, or derived from an antibody from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with, homologous to, or derived from an antibody or antibodies from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. Also included are fragments of such antibodies that exhibit the desired biological activity (e.g., the ability to specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4). \n\n\n The term \"light chain\" includes a full-length light chain and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity. A full-length light chain includes a variable region domain, VL, and a constant region domain, CL. The variable region domain of the light chain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide. Light chains include kappa (\"κ\") chains and lambda (\"λ\") chains. \n\n\n The term \"heavy chain\" includes a full-length heavy chain and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity. A full-length heavy chain includes a variable region domain, V\nH\n, and three constant region domains, C\nH\n1 , C\nH\n2, and C\nH\n3. \n\n The V\nH\n domain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide, and the C\nH\n domains are at the carboxyl-terminus, with the C\nH\n3 being closest to the carboxy-terminus of the polypeptide. Heavy chains can be of any isotype, including IgG (including IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 subtypes), IgA (including IgAl and IgA2 subtypes), IgM and IgE. \n\n\n The term \"immunologically functional fragment\" (or simply \"fragment\") of an antigen binding protein, e.g., an antibody or immunoglobulin chain (heavy or light chain), as used herein, is an antigen binding protein comprising a portion (regardless of how that portion is obtained or synthesized) of an antibody that lacks at least some of the amino acids present in a full-length chain but which is capable of specifically binding to an antigen. Such fragments are biologically active in that they bind specifically to the target antigen and can compete with other antigen binding proteins, including intact antibodies, for specific binding to a given epitope. In one aspect, such a fragment will retain at least one CDR present in the full-length light or heavy chain, and in some embodiments will comprise a single heavy chain and/or light chain or portion thereof. These biologically active fragments can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or can be produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of antigen binding proteins, including intact antibodies. Immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n, Fv, domain antibodies and single-chain antibodies, and can be derived from any mammalian source, including but not limited to human, mouse, rat, camelid or rabbit. It is contemplated further that a functional portion of the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein, for example, one or more CDRs, could be covalently bound to a second protein or to a small molecule to create a therapeutic agent directed to a particular target in the body, possessing bifunctional therapeutic properties, or having a prolonged serum half-life. \n\n\n An \"Fc\" region contains two heavy chain fragments comprising the C\nR\n2 and C\nR\n3 domains of an antibody. The two heavy chain fragments are held together by two or more disulfide bonds and by hydrophobic interactions of the C\nH\n3 domains. \n\n\n An \"Fab' fragment\" contains one light chain and a portion of one heavy chain that contains the V\nH\n domain and the C\nR\nI domain and also the region between the C\nR\nI and C\nR\n2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between the two heavy chains of two Fab' fragments to form an F(ab')\n2\n molecule. \n\n\n An \"F(ab')\n2\n fragment\" contains two light chains and two heavy chains containing a portion of the constant region between the C\nR\nI and C\nR\n2 domains, such that an interchain \n\n disulfide bond is formed between the two heavy chains. A F(ab')\n2\n fragment thus is composed of two Fab' fragments that are held together by a disulfide bond between the two heavy chains. \n\n\n The \"Fv region\" comprises the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains, but lacks the constant regions. \n\n\n A \"domain antibody\" is an immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain. In some instances, two or more V\nH\n regions are covalently joined with a peptide linker to create a bivalent domain antibody. The two V\nH\n regions of a bivalent domain antibody can target the same or different antigens. \n\n\n A \"hemibody\" is an immunologically functional immunoglobulin construct comprising a complete heavy chain, a complete light chain and a second heavy chain Fc region paired with the Fc region of the complete heavy chain. A linker can, but need not, be employed to join the heavy chain Fc region and the second heavy chain Fc region. In particular embodiments a hemibody is a monovalent form of an antigen binding protein disclosed herein. In other embodiments, pairs of charged residues can be employed to associate one Fc region with the second Fc region. The second heavy chain Fc region can comprise, for example, SEQ ID NO:441 and can be joined to the light chain via a linker (e.g., SEQ ID NO:440) An exemplary hemibody heavy chain comprises the sequence SEQ ID NO:453. \n\n\n A \"bivalent antigen binding protein\" or \"bivalent antibody\" comprises two antigen binding sites. In some instances, the two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. Bivalent antigen binding proteins and bivalent antibodies can be bispecific, as described herein. \n\n\n A multispecific antigen binding protein\" or \"multispecific antibody\" is one that targets more than one antigen or epitope. \n\n\n A \"bispecific,\" \"dual-specific\" or \"bifunctional\" antigen binding protein or antibody is a hybrid antigen binding protein or antibody, respectively, having two different antigen binding sites. Bispecific antigen binding proteins and antibodies are a species of multispecific antigen binding protein or multispecific antibody and can be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments.

The two binding sites of a bispecific antigen binding protein or antibody will bind to two different epitopes, which can reside on the same or different protein targets. \n\n The terms \"FGF21-like signaling\" and \"induces FGF21-like signaling,\" when applied to an antigen binding protein of the present disclosure, means that the antigen binding protein mimics, or modulates, an in vivo biological effect induced by the binding of (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 and induces a biological response that otherwise would result from FGF21 binding to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 in vivo. In assessing the binding and specificity of an antigen binding protein, e.g., an antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof, an antibody or fragment is deemed to induce a biological response when the response is equal to or greater than 5%, and preferably equal to or greater than 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%), 85%o, 90%) or 95%, of the activity of a wild type FGF21 standard comprising the mature form of SEQ ID NO:2 (i.e., the mature form of the human FGF21 sequence) and has the following properties: exhibiting an efficacy level of equal to or more than 5% of an FGF21 standard, with an EC50 of equal to or less than ΙΟΟηΜ, e.g., 90 nM, 80 nM, 70nM, 60nM, 50nM, 40nM, 30nM, 20nM or 10 nM in (1) the recombinant FGF21 receptor mediated luciferase- reporter cell assay of Example 5; (2) ER -phosphorylation in the recombinant FGF21 receptor mediated cell assay of Example 5; and (3) ERK-phosphorylation in human adipocytes as described in Example 7. The \"potency\" of an antigen binding protein is defined as exhibiting an EC50 of equal to or less than ΙΟΟηΜ, e.g., 90nM, 80nM, 70nM, 60nM, 50nM, 40nM, 30nM, 20nM, 10 nM and preferably less than ΙΟηΜ of the antigen binding protein in the following assays: (1) the recombinant FGF21 receptor mediated luciferase-reporter cell assay of Example 5; (2) the ERK-phosphorylation in the recombinant FGF21 receptor mediated cell assay of Example 5; and (3) ERK-phosphorylation in human adipocytes as described in Example 7. \n\n\n It is noted that not all of the antigen binding proteins of the present disclosure induce\n\n\nFGF21 -mediated signaling, nor is this property desirable in all circumstances. Nevertheless, antigen binding proteins that do not induce FGF21 -mediated signaling form aspects of the present disclosure and may be useful as diagnostic reagents or other applications. \n\n\n As used herein, the term \"FGF21R\" means a multimeric receptor complex that FGF21 is known or suspected to form in vivo. In various embodiments, FGF21R comprises (i) an FGFR, e.g., FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4, and (ii) β-Klotho. \n\n The term \"polynucleotide\" or \"nucleic acid\" includes both single-stranded and double- stranded nucleotide polymers. The nucleotides comprising the polynucleotide can be ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. Said modifications include base modifications such as bromouridine and inosine derivatives, ribose modifications such as 2', 3'-dideoxyribose, and internucleotide linkage modifications such as phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phoshoraniladate and phosphoroamidate. \n\n\n The term \"oligonucleotide\" means a polynucleotide comprising 200 or fewer nucleotides. In some embodiments, oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length. In other embodiments, oligonucleotides are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 nucleotides in length. Oligonucleotides can be single stranded or double stranded, e.g. , for use in the construction of a mutant gene. Oligonucleotides can be sense or antisense oligonucleotides. An oligonucleotide can include a label, including a radiolabel, a fluorescent label, a hapten or an antigenic label, for detection assays. Oligonucleotides can be used, for example, as PCR primers, cloning primers or hybridization probes. \n\n\n An \"isolated nucleic acid molecule\" means a DNA or RNA of genomic, mRNA, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof which is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the isolated polynucleotide is found in nature, or is linked to a polynucleotide to which it is not linked in nature. For purposes of this disclosure, it is understood that \"a nucleic acid molecule comprising\" a particular nucleotide sequence does not encompass intact chromosomes. Isolated nucleic acid molecules \"comprising\" specified nucleic acid sequences can include, in addition to the specified sequences, coding sequences for up to ten or even up to twenty other proteins or portions thereof, or can include operably linked regulatory sequences that control expression of the coding region of the recited nucleic acid sequences, and/or can include vector sequences. \n\n\n Unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of any single-stranded polynucleotide sequence discussed herein is the 5' end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5' direction. The direction of 5' to 3' addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA transcript that are 5' to the 5' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as \"upstream sequences;\" sequence regions on the DNA strand having \n\n the same sequence as the RNA transcript that are 3' to the 3' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as \"downstream sequences.\" \n\n\n The term \"control sequence\" refers to a polynucleotide sequence that can affect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which it is ligated. The nature of such control sequences can depend upon the host organism. In particular embodiments, control sequences for prokaryotes can include a promoter, a ribosomal binding site, and a transcription termination sequence. For example, control sequences for eukaryotes can include promoters comprising one or a plurality of recognition sites for transcription factors, transcription enhancer sequences, and transcription termination sequence. \"Control sequences\" can include leader sequences and/or fusion partner sequences. \n\n\n The term \"vector\" means any molecule or entity (e.g., nucleic acid, plasmid, bacteriophage or virus) used to transfer protein coding information into a host cell. \n\n\n The term \"expression vector\" or \"expression construct\" refers to a vector that is suitable for transformation of a host cell and contains nucleic acid sequences that direct and/or control (in conjunction with the host cell) expression of one or more heterologous coding regions operatively linked thereto. An expression construct can include, but is not limited to, sequences that affect or control transcription, translation, and, if introns are present, affect RNA splicing of a coding region operably linked thereto. \n\n\n As used herein, \"operably linked\" means that the components to which the term is applied are in a relationship that allows them to carry out their inherent functions under suitable conditions. For example, a control sequence in a vector that is \"operably linked\" to a protein coding sequence is ligated thereto so that expression of the protein coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the transcriptional activity of the control sequences. \n\n\n The term \"host cell\" means a cell that has been transformed, or is capable of being transformed, with a nucleic acid sequence and thereby expresses a gene of interest. The term includes the progeny of the parent cell, whether or not the progeny is identical in morphology or in genetic make-up to the original parent cell, so long as the gene of interest is present. \n\n\n The term \"transduction\" means the transfer of genes from one bacterium to another, usually by bacteriophage. \"Transduction\" also refers to the acquisition and transfer of eukaryotic cellular sequences by replication-defective retroviruses. \n\n The term \"transfection\" means the uptake of foreign or exogenous DNA by a cell, and a cell has been \"transfected\" when the exogenous DNA has been introduced inside the cell membrane. A number of transfection techniques are well known in the art and are disclosed herein. See, e.g., Graham et al, (1973) Virology 52:456; Sambrook et al, (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, supra; Davis et al, (1986) Basic Methods in Molecular Biology, Elsevier; Chu et al, (1981) Gene 13: 197. Such techniques can be used to introduce one or more exogenous DNA moieties into suitable host cells. \n\n\n The term \"transformation\" refers to a change in a cell's genetic characteristics, and a cell has been transformed when it has been modified to contain new DNA or RNA. For example, a cell is transformed where it is genetically modified from its native state by introducing new genetic material via transfection, transduction, or other techniques. Following transfection or transduction, the transforming DNA can recombine with that of the cell by physically integrating into a chromosome of the cell, or can be maintained transiently as an episomal element without being replicated, or can replicate independently as a plasmid. A cell is considered to have been \"stably transformed\" when the transforming DNA is replicated with the division of the cell. \n\n\n The terms \"polypeptide\" or \"protein\" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms also apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residues is an analog or mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers. The terms can also encompass amino acid polymers that have been modified, e.g., by the addition of carbohydrate residues to form glycoproteins, or phosphorylated. Polypeptides and proteins can be produced by a naturally-occurring and non-recombinant cell, or polypeptides and proteins can be produced by a genetically-engineered or recombinant cell. Polypeptides and proteins can comprise molecules having the amino acid sequence of a native protein, or molecules having deletions from, additions to, and/or substitutions of one or more amino acids of the native sequence. The terms \"polypeptide\" and \"protein\" encompass antigen binding proteins that specifically or selectively bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β- Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, or sequences that have deletions from, additions to, and/or substitutions of one or more amino acids of an antigen binding protein that specifically or selectively binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. The \n\n term \"polypeptide fragment\" refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal deletion, a carboxyl-terminal deletion, and/or an internal deletion as compared with the full-length protein. Such fragments can also contain modified amino acids as compared with the full-length protein. In certain embodiments, fragments are about five to 500 amino acids long. For example, fragments can be at least 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 20, 50, 70, 100, 110, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, or 450 amino acids long. Useful polypeptide fragments include immunologically functional fragments of antibodies, including binding domains. In the case of an antigen binding protein that binds to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, useful fragments include but are not limited to a CDR region, a variable domain of a heavy or light chain, a portion of an antibody chain or just its variable region including two CDRs, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"isolated protein\" referred means that a subject protein (1) is free of at least some other proteins with which it would normally be found, (2) is essentially free of other proteins from the same source, e.g., from the same species, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, (4) has been separated from at least about 50 percent of polynucleotides, lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is associated in nature, (5) is operably associated (by covalent or noncovalent interaction) with a polypeptide with which it is not associated in nature, or (6) does not occur in nature. Typically, an \"isolated protein\" constitutes at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 25%, or at least about 50%> of a given sample. Genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA or other RNA, of synthetic origin, or any combination thereof can encode such an isolated protein. Preferably, the isolated protein is substantially free from proteins or polypeptides or other contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic, research or other use. \n\n\n A \"variant\" of a polypeptide {e.g., an antigen binding protein, or an antibody) comprises an amino acid sequence wherein one or more amino acid residues are inserted into, deleted from and/or substituted into the amino acid sequence relative to another polypeptide sequence. Variants include fusion proteins. \n\n\n A \"derivative\" of a polypeptide is a polypeptide {e.g., an antigen binding protein, or an antibody) that has been chemically modified in some manner distinct from insertion, deletion, or substitution variants, e.g., by conjugation to another chemical moiety. \n\n The term \"naturally occurring\" as used throughout the specification in connection with biological materials such as polypeptides, nucleic acids, host cells, and the like, refers to materials which are found in nature. \n\n\n \"Antigen binding region\" means a protein, or a portion of a protein, that specifically binds a specified antigen, e.g., FGFRlc, β-Klotho or both FGFRlc and β-Klotho. For example, that portion of an antigen binding protein that contains the amino acid residues that interact with an antigen and confer on the antigen binding protein its specificity and affinity for the antigen is referred to as \"antigen binding region.\" An antigen binding region typically includes one or more \"complementary binding regions\" (\"CDRs\"). Certain antigen binding regions also include one or more \"framework\" regions. A \"CDR\" is an amino acid sequence that contributes to antigen binding specificity and affinity. \"Framework\" regions can aid in maintaining the proper conformation of the CDRs to promote binding between the antigen binding region and an antigen. \n\n\n In certain aspects, recombinant antigen binding proteins that bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, are provided. In this context, a \"recombinant protein\" is a protein made using recombinant techniques, i.e., through the expression of a recombinant nucleic acid as described herein. Methods and techniques for the production of recombinant proteins are well known in the art. \n\n\n The term \"compete\" when used in the context of antigen binding proteins {e.g., neutralizing antigen binding proteins, neutralizing antibodies, agonistic antigen binding proteins, agonistic antibodies and binding proteins that bind to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4) that compete for the same epitope or binding site on a target means competition between antigen binding proteins as determined by an assay in which the antigen binding protein {e.g., antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof) under study prevents or inhibits the specific binding of a reference molecule {e.g., a reference ligand, or reference antigen binding protein, such as a reference antibody) to a common antigen {e.g., FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, FGFR4, β-Klotho or a fragment thereof). Numerous types of competitive binding assays can be used to determine if a test molecule competes with a reference molecule for binding. Examples of assays that can be employed include solid phase direct or \n\n indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see, e.g., Stahli et ah, (1983) Methods in Enzymology 9:242-253); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Kirkland et ah, (1986) J. Immunol. 137:3614- 3619) solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, (1988) Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label RIA using 1-125 label (see, e.g., Morel et ah, (1988) Molec. Immunol. 25 :7- 15); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Cheung, et ah, (1990) Virology 176:546-552); and direct labeled RIA (Moldenhauer et ah, (1990) Scand. J. Immunol. 32:77-82). Typically, such an assay involves the use of a purified antigen bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of an unlabelled test antigen binding protein or a labeled reference antigen binding protein. Competitive inhibition is measured by determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test antigen binding protein. Usually the test antigen binding protein is present in excess. Antigen binding proteins identified by competition assay (competing antigen binding proteins) include antigen binding proteins binding to the same epitope as the reference antigen binding proteins and antigen binding proteins binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference antigen binding protein for steric hindrance to occur. Additional details regarding methods for determining competitive binding are provided in the examples herein. Usually, when a competing antigen binding protein is present in excess, it will inhibit specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein to a common antigen by at least 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70% or 75%. In some instance, binding is inhibited by at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 97% or more. \n\n\n The term \"antigen\" refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule capable of being bound by a selective binding agent, such as an antigen binding protein (including, e.g., an antibody or immunological functional fragment thereof), and may also be capable of being used in an animal to produce antibodies capable of binding to that antigen. An antigen can possess one or more epitopes that are capable of interacting with different antigen binding proteins, e.g., antibodies. \n\n\n The term \"epitope\" means the amino acids of a target molecule that are contacted by an antigen binding protein (for example, an antibody) when the antigen binding protein is bound to the target molecule. The term includes any subset of the complete list of amino acids of the target molecule that are contacted when an antigen binding protein, such as an antibody, is bound \n\n to the target molecule. An epitope can be contiguous or non-contiguous (e.g., (i) in a single- chain polypeptide, amino acid residues that are not contiguous to one another in the polypeptide sequence but that within in context of the target molecule are bound by the antigen binding protein, or (ii) in a multimeric receptor comprising two or more individual components, e.g., (i) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4, and (ii) β-Klotho, amino acid residues that are present on one or more of the individual components, but which are still bound by the antigen binding protein). In certain embodiments, epitopes can be mimetic in that they comprise a three dimensional structure that is similar to an antigenic epitope used to generate the antigen binding protein, yet comprise none or only some of the amino acid residues found in that epitope used to generate the antigen binding protein. Most often, epitopes reside on proteins, but in some instances can reside on other kinds of molecules, such as nucleic acids. Epitope determinants can include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl or sulfonyl groups, and can have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics. Generally, antigen binding proteins specific for a particular target molecule will preferentially recognize an epitope on the target molecule in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules. \n\n\n The term \"identity\" refers to a relationship between the sequences of two or more polypeptide molecules or two or more nucleic acid molecules, as determined by aligning and comparing the sequences. \"Percent identity\" means the percent of identical residues between the amino acids or nucleotides in the compared molecules and is calculated based on the size of the smallest of the molecules being compared. For these calculations, gaps in alignments (if any) must be addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer program (i.e., an \"algorithm\"). Methods that can be used to calculate the identity of the aligned nucleic acids or polypeptides include those described in Computational Molecular Biology, (Lesk, A. M., ed.), (1988) New York: Oxford University Press; Biocomputing Informatics and Genome Projects, (Smith, D. W., ed.), 1993, New York: Academic Press; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, (Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds.), 1994, New Jersey: Humana Press; von Heinje, G., (1987) Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, New York: Academic Press; Sequence Analysis Primer, (Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds.), 1991, New York: M. Stockton Press; and Carillo et al, (1988) SI AM J. Applied Math. 48: 1073. \n\n In calculating percent identity, the sequences being compared are aligned in a way that gives the largest match between the sequences. The computer program used to determine percent identity is the GCG program package, which includes GAP (Devereux et al, (1984) Nucl. Acid Res. 12:387; Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). The computer algorithm GAP is used to align the two polypeptides or polynucleotides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined. The sequences are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acid or nucleotide (the \"matched span\", as determined by the algorithm). A gap opening penalty (which is calculated as 3x the average diagonal, wherein the \"average diagonal\" is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the \"diagonal\" is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually 1/10 times the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. In certain embodiments, a standard comparison matrix {see, Dayhoff et al, (1978) Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure 5:345-352 for the PAM 250 comparison matrix; Henikoff et al, (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89: 10915-10919 for the BLOSUM 62 comparison matrix) is also used by the algorithm. \n\n\n Recommended parameters for determining percent identity for polypeptides or nucleotide sequences using the GAP program are the following: \n\n\n Algorithm: Needleman et al, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443-453; \n\n\n Comparison matrix: BLOSUM 62 from Henikoff et al, 1992, supra; \n\n\n Gap Penalty: 12 (but with no penalty for end gaps) \n\n\n Gap Length Penalty: 4 \n\n\n Threshold of Similarity: 0 \n\n\n Certain alignment schemes for aligning two amino acid sequences can result in matching of only a short region of the two sequences, and this small aligned region can have very high sequence identity even though there is no significant relationship between the two full-length sequences. Accordingly, the selected alignment method {e.g., the GAP program) can be adjusted if so desired to result in an alignment that spans at least 50 contiguous amino acids of the target polypeptide. \n\n\n As used herein, \"substantially pure\" means that the described species of molecule is the predominant species present, that is, on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other \n\n individual species in the same mixture. In certain embodiments, a substantially pure molecule is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least 50% (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. In other embodiments, a substantially pure composition will comprise at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of all macromolecular species present in the composition. In other embodiments, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity wherein contaminating species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods and thus the composition consists of a single detectable macromolecular species. \n\n\n The terms \"treat\" and \"treating\" refer to any indicia of success in the treatment or amelioration of an injury, pathology or condition, including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement; remission; diminishing of symptoms or making the injury, pathology or condition more tolerable to the patient; slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline; making the final point of degeneration less debilitating; improving a patient's physical or mental well-being. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subjective parameters; including the results of a physical examination, neuropsychiatric exams, and/or a psychiatric evaluation. For example, certain methods presented herein can be employed to treat Type 2 diabetes, obesity and/or dyslipidemia, either prophylactically or as an acute treatment, to decrease plasma glucose levels, to decrease circulating triglyceride levels, to decrease circulating cholesterol levels and/or ameliorate a symptom associated with type 2 diabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia. \n\n\n An \"effective amount\" is generally an amount sufficient to reduce the severity and/or frequency of symptoms, eliminate the symptoms and/or underlying cause, prevent the occurrence of symptoms and/or their underlying cause, and/or improve or remediate the damage that results from or is associated with diabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia. In some embodiments, the effective amount is a therapeutically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount. A \"therapeutically effective amount\" is an amount sufficient to remedy a disease state (e.g., diabetes, obesity or dyslipidemia) or symptoms, particularly a state or symptoms associated with the disease state, or otherwise prevent, hinder, retard or reverse the progression of the disease state or any other undesirable symptom associated with the disease in any way whatsoever. A \"prophylactically effective amount\" is an amount of a pharmaceutical composition that, when administered to a subject, will have the intended prophylactic effect, e.g., preventing or delaying the onset (or reoccurrence) of diabetes, obesity or dyslipidemia, or reducing the likelihood of the \n\n onset (or reoccurrence) of diabetes, obesity or dyslipidemia or associated symptoms. The full therapeutic or prophylactic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and can occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus, a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations. \n\n\n \"Amino acid\" takes its normal meaning in the art. The twenty naturally-occurring amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See, Immunology-A Synthesis, 2\nnd\n Edition, (E. S. Golub and D. R. Green, eds.), Sinauer Associates: Sunderland, Mass. (1991), incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural or non-naturally occurring amino acids such as α-,α- disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, and other unconventional amino acids can also be suitable components for polypeptides and are included in the phrase \"amino acid.\" Examples of non-naturally amino acids (which can be substituted for any naturally-occurring amino acid found in any sequence disclosed herein, as desired) include: 4-hydroxyproline, γ- carboxyglutamate, ε-Ν,Ν,Ν-trimethyllysine, ε-Ν-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5 -hydroxy lysine, σ-Ν-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and imino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline).

GENERAL OVERVIEW \n\n\n Antigen-binding proteins that bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, are provided herein. A unique property of the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein is the agonistic nature of these proteins, specifically the ability to mimic the in vivo effect of FGF21 and to induce FGF21-like signaling. More remarkably and specifically, some of the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein induce FGF21-like signaling in several in vitro cell- based assay, including the ELK-luciferase reporter assay of Example 5 under the following conditions: (1) the binding to and activity of the FGF21 receptor is β-Klotho dependent; (2) the activity is selective to FGFRlc^Klotho complex; (3) the binding to the FGFRlc^Klotho triggers FGF21-like signaling pathways; and (4) the potency (EC50) is comparable to a wild- type FGF21 standard comprising the mature form of SEQ ID NO:2, as measured in the following cell-based assays: (1) the recombinant FGF21 receptor mediated luciferase-reporter cell assay of Example 5; (2) the ERK-phosphorylation in the recombinant FGF21 receptor mediated cell assay of Example 5; and (3) ERK-phosphorylation in human adipocytes as described in more details in \n\n Example 7. The disclosed antigen binding proteins, therefore, are expected to exhibit activities in vivo that are consistent with the natural biological function of FGF21. This property makes the disclosed antigen binding proteins viable therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, NASH, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and broadly any disease or condition in which it is desirable to mimic or augment the in vivo effects of FGF21. \n\n\n In some embodiments of the present disclosure the antigen binding proteins provided can comprise polypeptides into which one or more complementary determining regions (CDRs) can be embedded and/or joined. In such antigen binding proteins, the CDRs can be embedded into a \"framework\" region, which orients the CDR(s) such that the proper antigen binding properties of the CDR(s) is achieved. In general, such antigen binding proteins that are provided can facilitate or enhance the interaction between FGFRlc and β-Klotho, and can substantially induce FGF21- like signaling. \n\n\n Certain antigen binding proteins described herein are antibodies or are derived from antibodies. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide structure of the antigen binding proteins is based on antibodies, including, but not limited to, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies, domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as \"antibody mimetics\"), chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, antibody fusions (sometimes referred to herein as \"antibody conjugates\"), hemibodies and fragments thereof. The various structures are further described herein below. \n\n\n The antigen binding proteins provided herein have been demonstrated to bind to (i) β- Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, and particularly to (i) human β-Klotho; (ii) human FGFRlc, human FGFR2c, human FGFR3c or human FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising human β-Klotho and one of human FGFRlc, human FGFR2c, human FGFR3c, and human FGFR4. As described and shown in the Examples presented herein, based the Western blot results, commercially-available anti^-Klotho or anti-FGFRlc antibodies bind to denatured β-Klotho or FGFRlc whereas the antigen binding protein (agonistic antibodies) do not. Conversely, the provided antigen binding proteins recognize the native structure of the FGFRlc and β-Klotho on the cell surface whereas the commercial antibodies do not, based on the FACS results provided. See Example 9. The antigen binding proteins that are provided therefore mimic \n\n the natural in vivo biological activity of FGF21. As a consequence, the antigen binding proteins provided herein are capable of activating FGF21-like signaling activity. In particular, the disclosed antigen binding proteins can have one or more of the following activities in vivo: induction of FGF21-like signal transduction pathways, lowering blood glucose levels, lowering circulating lipid levels, improving metabolic parameters and other physiological effects induced in vivo by the formation of the ternary complex of FGFRlc, β-Klotho and FGF21, for example in conditions such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, NASH, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. \n\n\n The antigen binding proteins that specifically bind to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 that are disclosed herein have a variety of utilities. Some of the antigen binding proteins, for instance, are useful in specific binding assays, in the affinity purification of (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, including the human forms of these disclosed proteins, and in screening assays to identify other agonists of FGF21-like signaling activity. \n\n\n The antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 that are disclosed herein can be used in a variety of treatment applications, as explained herein. For example, certain antigen binding proteins are useful for treating conditions associated with FGF21-like signaling processes in a patient, such as reducing, alleviating, or treating type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, NASH, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. Other uses for the antigen binding proteins include, for example, diagnosis of diseases or conditions associated with β-Klotho, FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, FGFR4 or FGF21, and screening assays to determine the presence or absence of these molecules. Some of the antigen binding proteins described herein can be useful in treating conditions, symptoms and/or the pathology associated with decreased FGF21-like signaling activity. Exemplary conditions include, but are not limited to, diabetes, obesity, NASH and dyslipidemia. \n\n FGF21 \n\n\n The antigen binding proteins disclosed herein induce FGF21 -mediated signaling, as defined herein. In vivo, the mature form of FGF21 is the active form of the molecule. The nucleotide sequence encoding full length FGF21 is provided; the nucleotides encoding the signal sequence are underlined. \n\n\n ATG GAC TCG GAC GAG ACC GGG TTC GAG CAC TCA GGA CTG TGG GTT TCT GTG CTG GCT GGT CTT CTG CTG GGA GCC TGC CAG GCA CAC CCC ATC CCT GAC TCC AGT CCT CTC CTG CAA TTC GGG GGC CAA GTC CGG CAG CGG TAC CTC TAC ACA GAT GAT GCC CAG CAG ACA GAA GCC CAC CTG GAG ATC AGG GAG GAT GGG ACG GTG GGG GGC GCT GCT GAC CAG AGC CCC GAA AGT CTC CTG CAG CTG AAA GCC TTG AAG CCG GGA GTT ATT CAA ATC TTG GGA GTC AAG ACA TCC AGG TTC CTG TGC CAG CGG CCA GAT GGG GCC CTG TAT GGA TCG CTC CAC TTT GAC CCT GAG GCC TGC AGC TTC CGG GAG CTG CTT CTT GAG GAC GGA TAC AAT GTT TAC CAG TCC GAA GCC CAC GGC CTC CCG CTG CAC CTG CCA GGG AAC AAG TCC CCA CAC CGG GAC CCT GCA CCC CGA GGA CCA GCT CGC TTC CTG CCA CTA CCA GGC CTG CCC CCC GCA CCC CCG GAG CCA CCC GGA ATC CTG GCC CCC CAG CCC CCC GAT GTG GGC TCC TCG GAC CCT CTG AGC ATG GTG GGA CCT TCC CAG GGC CGA AGC CCC AGC TAC GCT TCC TGA (SEQ ID NO: 1) The amino acid sequence of full length FGF21 is provided; the amino acids that make up the signal sequence are underlined: \n\n\n MDSDETGFEHSGLWVSVLAGLLLGACOAHPIPDSSPLLOFGGO VRQPvYLYTDDAQQTEAHLEIPvEDGTVGGAADQSPESLLQLKA LKPGVIQILGVKTSPvFLCQPvPDGA LY GSLHFDPEACSFRELLLE DGYNVYQSEAHGLPLHLPGNKSPHRDPAPRGPARFLPLPGLPP APPEPPGILAPQPPDVGSSDPLSMVGPSQGRSPSYAS (SEQ ID NO: 2) \n\n\nFGFRlc \n\n\n The antigen binding proteins disclosed herein bind to FGFRlc, in particular human FGFRlc, when associated with β-Klotho.

As used herein, the terms are used interchangeably to mean a co-receptor, in particular and unless otherwise specified, a human co-receptor, that upon association with FGFRlc and FGF21 induces FGF21- like signaling activity. \n\n\n The term β-Klotho also includes post-translational modifications of the β-Klotho amino acid sequence, for example, possible N-linked glycosylation sites. Thus, the antigen binding proteins can bind to or be generated from proteins glycosylated at one or more of the positions. \n\n\nAntigen Binding Proteins that Specifically Bind One or More of β-Klotho, FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3C, FGFR4c \n\n\n A variety of selective binding agents useful for modulating FGF21-like signaling are provided. These agents include, for instance, antigen binding proteins that contain an antigen binding domain (e.g. , single chain antibodies, domain antibodies, hemibodies, immunoadhesions, and polypeptides with an antigen binding region) and specifically bind to FGFRlc, β-Klotho or both FGFRlc and β-Klotho, in particular human FGFRlc and human β-Klotho. Some of the agents, for example, are useful in mimicking the signaling effect generated in vivo by the association of FGFRlc with β-Klotho and with FGF21, and can thus be used to enhance or modulate one or more activities associated with FGF21-like signaling. \n\n\n In general, the antigen binding proteins that are provided typically comprise one or more CDRs as described herein (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 CDRs). In some embodiments the antigen binding proteins are naturally expressed by clones, while in other embodiments, the antigen binding protein can comprise (a) a polypeptide framework structure and (b) one or more CDRs that are inserted into and/or joined to the polypeptide framework structure. In some of these embodiments a CDR forms a component of a heavy or light chains expressed by the clones described herein; in other embodiments a CDR can be inserted into a framework in which the CDR is not naturally expressed. A polypeptide framework structure can take a variety of different forms. For example, a polypeptide framework structure can be, or comprise, the framework of a naturally occurring antibody, or fragment or variant thereof, or it can be \n\n completely synthetic in nature. Examples of various antigen binding protein structures are further described below. \n\n\n In some embodiments in which the antigen binding protein comprises (a) a polypeptide framework structure and (b) one or more CDRs that are inserted into and/or joined to the polypeptide framework structure, the polypeptide framework structure of an antigen binding protein is an antibody or is derived from an antibody, including, but not limited to, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies, domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as \"antibody mimetics\"), chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, antibody fusions (sometimes referred to as \"antibody conjugates\"), and portions or fragments of each, respectively. In some instances, the antigen binding protein is an immunological fragment of an antibody (e.g., a Fab, a Fab', a F(ab')\n2\n, or a scFv). \n\n\n Certain of the antigen binding proteins as provided herein specifically bind to (i) β- Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, including the human forms of these proteins . In one embodiment, an antigen binding protein specifically binds to both human FGFRlc comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5, and human β-Klotho comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8, and in another embodiment an antigen binding protein specifically binds to both human FGFRlc comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 and human β-Klotho having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8 and induces FGF21-like signaling. Thus, an antigen binding protein can, but need not, induce FGF21-like signaling. \n\n\nAntigen Binding Protein Structure \n\n\n Some of the antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, including the human forms of these proteins that are provided herein have a structure typically associated with naturally occurring antibodies. The structural units of these antibodies typically comprise one or more tetramers, each composed of two identical couplets of polypeptide chains, though some species of mammals also produce antibodies having only a single heavy chain. In a typical antibody, each pair or couplet includes one full-length \"light\" chain (in certain embodiments, about 25 kDa) and one full-length \"heavy\" chain (in certain embodiments, about 50-70 kDa). Each individual immunoglobulin chain is \n\n composed of several \"immunoglobulin domains,\" each consisting of roughly 90 to 110 amino acids and expressing a characteristic folding pattern. These domains are the basic units of which antibody polypeptides are composed. The amino-terminal portion of each chain typically includes a variable domain that is responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion is more conserved evolutionarily than the other end of the chain and is referred to as the \"constant region\" or \"C region\". Human light chains generally are classified as kappa (\"κ\") and lambda (\"λ\") light chains, and each of these contains one variable domain and one constant domain. Heavy chains are typically classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon chains, and these define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. IgG has several subtypes, including, but not limited to, IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. IgM subtypes include IgM, and IgM2. IgA subtypes include IgAl and IgA2. In humans, the IgA and IgD isotypes contain four heavy chains and four light chains; the IgG and IgE isotypes contain two heavy chains and two light chains; and the IgM isotype contains five heavy chains and five light chains. The heavy chain C region typically comprises one or more domains that can be responsible for effector function. The number of heavy chain constant region domains will depend on the isotype. IgG heavy chains, for example, each contain three C region domains known as C\nH\nI , C\nH\n2 and C\nH\n3. The antibodies that are provided can have any of these isotypes and subtypes. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein that specifically binds one or more of (i) β- Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 is an antibody of the IgGl, IgG2, or IgG4 subtype. \n\n\n In full-length light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a \"J\" region of about twelve or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a \"D\" region of about ten more amino acids. See, e.g., Fundamental Immunology, 2nd ed., Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed.) 1989, New York: Raven Press (hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair typically form the antigen binding site. \n\n\n One example of an IgG2 heavy constant domain of an exemplary monoclonal antibody that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 has the amino acid sequence: \n\n ASTKGPSVFPLAPCSRSTSESTAALGCLVKDYFPEPVTVSWNSGALTSGV \n\n\n HTFPAVLQSSGLYSLSSVVTVPSSNFGTQTYTCNVDHKPSNTKVDKTVER KCCVECPPCPAPPVAGPSVFLFPPKPKDTLMISRTPEVTCVVVDVSHEDPE VQFNWYVDGVEVHNAKTKPREEQFNSTFRVVSVLTVVHQDWLNGKEYK CKVSNKGLPAPIEKTISKTKGQPREPQVYTLPPSREEMTK QVSLTCLVKG FYPSDIAVEWESNGQPENNYKTTPPMLDSDGSFFLYSKLTVDKSRWQQG NVFSCSVMHEALHNHYTQKSLSLSPGK (SEQ ID NO: 9). \n\n\nOne example of a kappa light constant domain of an exemplary monoclonal antibody that binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β- Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 has the amino acid sequence: \n\n\n RT V AAP S VFIFPP SDEQLKS GT AS V VCLLNNF YPRE AKVQ WKVDN ALQ S G NSQESVTEQDSKDSTYSLSSTLTLSKADYEKHKVYACEVTHQGLSSPVTK SFNRGEC (SEQ ID NO: 10). \n\n\nOne example of a lambda light constant domain of an exemplary monoclonal antibody that binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 has the amino acid sequence: \n\n\n GQPKANPTVTLFPPSSEELQANKATLVCLISDFYPGAVTVAWKADGSPVK\n\n\nAGVETTKPSKQSNNKYAASSYLSLTPEQWKSHRSYSCQVTHEGSTVEKT\n\n\nVAPTECS (SEQ ID NO: 1 1) \n\n\nVariable regions of immunoglobulin chains generally exhibit the same overall structure, comprising relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, more often called \"complementarity determining regions\" or CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each heavy chain/light chain pair mentioned above typically are aligned by the framework regions to form a structure that binds specifically with a specific epitope on the target protein (e.g., (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4). From N-terminal to C-terminal, naturally-occurring light and heavy chain variable regions both typically conform \n\n with the following order of these elements: FRl, CDRl, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. A numbering system has been devised for assigning numbers to amino acids that occupy positions in each of these domains. This numbering system is defined in Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (1987 and 1991, NIH, Bethesda, MD). As desired, the CDRs can also be redefined according an alternative nomenclature scheme, such as that of Chothia (see Chothia & Lesk, 1987, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917; Chothia et al, 1989, Nature 342:878-883 or Honegger & Pluckthun, 2001, J. Mol. Biol. 309:657-670. \n\n\n The various heavy chain and light chain variable regions of antigen binding proteins provided herein are depicted in Table 2. Each of these variable regions can be attached to the above heavy and light chain constant regions to form a complete antibody heavy and light chain, respectively. Further, each of the so-generated heavy and light chain sequences can be combined to form a complete antibody structure. It should be understood that the heavy chain and light chain variable regions provided herein can also be attached to other constant domains having different sequences than the exemplary sequences listed above. \n\n\n Specific examples of some of the full length light and heavy chains of the antibodies that are provided and their corresponding amino acid sequences are summarized in Tables 1A and IB.

infra, can be combined with any of the exemplary light chains shown in Table 1 A and 6A, infra, to form an antibody. Examples of such combinations include HI combined with any of LI through L18; H2 combined with any of LI through L18; H3 combined with any of LI through LI 8, and so on. In some instances, the antibodies include at least one heavy chain and one light chain from those listed in Tables 1A and IB and 6A, infra; particular examples pairings of light chains and heavy chains include LI with HI, L2 with H2, L3 with H3, L4 with H4, L5 with H5, L6 with H6, L7 with H7, L8 with H8, L9 with H9, L10 with H10, LI 1 with HI 1, L12 with H12, L13 with H13, L14 with H14, L15 with H15, L16 with H16, L17 with H17, and L18 with H18. In addition to antigen binding proteins comprising a heavy and a light chain from the same clone, a heavy chain from a first clone can be paired with a light chain from a second clone {e.g., a heavy chain from 46D11 paired with a light chain from 16H7 or a heavy chain from 16H7 paired with a light chain from 46D11). Generally, such pairings can include VL with 90% or greater homology can be paired with the heavy chain of the naturally occurring clone. In some instances, the antibodies comprise two different heavy chains and two different light chains listed in Tables 1A and IB and 6A, infra. In other instances, the antibodies contain two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains. As an example, an antibody or immunologically functional fragment can include two HI heavy chains and two LI light chains, or two H2 heavy chains and two L2 light chains, or two H3 heavy chains and two L3 light chains and other similar \n\n combinations of pairs of light chains and pairs of heavy chains as listed in Tables 1A and IB and 6 A, infra. \n\n\n In another aspect of the instant disclosure, \"hemibodies\" are provided. A hemibody is a monovalent antigen binding protein comprising (i) an intact light chain, and (ii) a heavy chain fused to an Fc region {e.g., an IgG2 Fc region of SEQ ID NO:441), optionally via a linker, The linker can be a (G\n4\nS)\nX\n linker where \"x\" is a non-zero integer {e.g., (G\n4\nS)\n8\n; SEQ ID NO:440). Hemibodies can be constructed using the provided heavy and light chain components. Specific examples of hemibodies are disclosed in Example 14. \n\n\n Other antigen binding proteins that are provided are variants of antibodies formed by combination of the heavy and light chains shown in Tables 1A and IB and 6 A, infra and comprise light and/or heavy chains that each have at least 70%, 75%, 80%>, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%), 97%), 98%) or 99% identity to the amino acid sequences of these chains. In some instances, such antibodies include at least one heavy chain and one light chain, whereas in other instances the variant forms contain two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains. \n\n\nVariable Domains of Antigen Binding Proteins \n\n\n Also provided are antigen binding proteins that contain an antibody heavy chain variable region selected from the group consisting of V\nH\n1, V\nH\n2, V\nH\n3, V\nH\n4, V\nH\n5, V\nH\n6, V\nH\n7, V\nH\n8, V\nH\n9, V\nH\nI O, V\nh\n11, V\nh\n12, V\nh\n13, V\nh\n14, V\nh\n15, V\nh\n16, V\nh\n17 and V\nH\n18 as shown in Table 2B and/or an antibody light chain variable region selected from the group consisting of V\nL\nI , V\nL\n2, V\nL\n3, V\nL\n4, V\nL\n5, V\nL\n6, V\nL\n7, V\nL\n8, V\nL\n9, V\nL\n10, V\nL\n11, V\nL\n12, V\nL\n13, V\nL\n14, V\nL\n15, V\nL\n16, V\nL\n17 and V\nL\n18 as shown in Table 2A, and immunologically functional fragments, derivatives, muteins and variants of these light chain and heavy chain variable regions.

The heavy chain variable region in some antigen binding proteins comprises a sequence of amino acids that has at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97% or 99% sequence identity to the amino acid sequences of the heavy chain variable region of V\nH\n1, V\nH\n2, \n\n V\nH\n3, V\nh\n4, V\nh\n5, V\nh\n6, V\nh\n7, V\nh\n8, V\nh\n9, V\nh\n10, V\nH\nH , V\nh\n12, V\nh\n13, V\nh\n14, V\nh\n15, V\nh\n16, V\nh\n17 and V\nH\n18. \n\n\n Certain antigen binding proteins comprise a light chain variable domain comprising a sequence of amino acids that differs from the sequence of a light chain variable domain selected from V\nL\n1, V\nL\n2, V\nL\n3, V\nL\n4, V\nL\n5, V\nL\n6, V\nL\n7, V\nL\n8, V\nL\n9, V\nL\n10, V\nL\n11, V\nL\n12, V\nL\n13, V\nL\n14, V\nL\n15, V\nL\n16, V\nL\n17 and V\nL\n18 at only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 amino acid residues, wherein each such sequence difference is independently either a deletion, insertion or substitution of one amino acid, with the deletions, insertions and/or substitutions resulting in no more than 15 amino acid changes relative to the foregoing variable domain sequences. The light chain variable region in some antigen binding proteins comprises a sequence of amino acids that has at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97% or 99% sequence identity to the amino acid sequences of the light chain variable region of V\nL\nI , V\nL\n2, V\nL\n3, V\nL\n4, V\nL\n5, V\nL\n6, V\nL\n7, V\nL\n8, V\nL\n9, V\nL\n10, V\nl\n11, V\nL\n12, V\nL\n13, V\nL\n14, V\nL\n15, V\nL\n16, V\nL\n17 or V\nL\n18. \n\n\n In additional instances, antigen binding proteins comprise the following pairings of light chain and heavy chain variable domains: V\nL\nI with V\nH\nI , V\nL\n2 with V\nH\n2, V\nL\n2 with V\nH\n3, V\nL\n3 with V\nH\n4, V\nL\n4 with V\nH\n5, V\nL\n5 with V\nH\n6, V\nL\n6 with V\nH\n7, V\nL\n7 with V\nH\n8, V\nL\n8 with V\nH\n8, V\nL\n9 with V\nH\n9, V\nL\n9 with V\nH\n10, V\nl\n10 with V\nH\nH, V\nL\n11 with V\nH\nH, V\nL\n12 with V\nH\n12, V\nL\n13 with V\nH\n13, V\nL\n14 with V\nH\n14, V\nL\n15 with V\nH\n15, V\nL\n16 with V\nH\n16, V\nL\n17 with V\nH\n17 and V\nL\n18 with V\nH\n18.

An antigen binding protein can have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 CDRs. An antigen binding protein thus can have, for example, one heavy chain CDR1 (\"CDRH1\"), and/or one heavy chain CDR2 (\"CDRH2\"), and/or one heavy chain CDR3 (\"CDRH3\"), and/or one light chain CDR1 (\"CDRLl\"), and/or one \n\n light chain CDR2 (\"CDRL2\"), and/or one light chain CDR3 (\"CDRL3\").

Specific heavy and light chain CDRs are identified in Tables 3A and 3B, respectively and in Table 6C, infra. \n\n\n Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FR) of a given antibody can be identified using the system described by Kabat et al, in Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., US Dept. of Health and Human Services, PHS, NIH, NIH Publication no. 91-3242, 1991. As desired, the CDRs can also be redefined according an alternative nomenclature scheme, such as that of Chothia (see Chothia & Lesk, 1987, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917; Chothia et al, 1989, Nature 342:878-883 or Honegger & Pluckthun, 2001, J. Mol. Biol. 309:657-670).

Briefly, in a traditional antibody, the CDRs are embedded within a framework in the heavy and light chain variable region where they constitute the regions responsible for antigen binding and recognition. A variable region comprises at least three heavy or light chain CDRs, see, supra (Kabat et al. , 1991 , Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Public Health Service N.I.H., Bethesda, MD; see also Chothia and Lesk, 1987, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901- 917; Chothia et al , 1989, Nature 342: 877-883), within a framework region (designated framework regions 1-4, FR1 , FR2, FR3, and FR4, by Kabat et al. , 1991 ; see also Chothia and Lesk, 1987, supra). The CDRs provided herein, however, can not only be used to define the antigen binding domain of a traditional antibody structure, but can be embedded in a variety of other polypeptide structures, as described herein. \n\n\n In one aspect, the CDRs provided are (a) a CDRH selected from the group consisting of (i) a CDRH1 selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 121-131 ; (ii) a CDRH2 selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 132-144; (iii) a CDRH3 selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 145-157; and (iv) a CDRH of (i), (ii) and (iii) that contains one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or insertions of no more than five, four, three, two, or one amino acids; (B) a CDRL selected from the group consisting of (i) a CDRLl selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 158-170; (ii) a CDRL2 selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 171-179; (iii) a CDRL3 selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 180- 194; and (iv) a CDRL of (i), (ii) and (iii) that contains one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or insertions of no more than 1 , 2, 3, 4, or 5 amino acids amino acids. \n\n\n In another aspect, an antigen binding protein comprises 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 variant forms of the CDRs listed in Tables 3A and 3B and Table 6C, infra, each having at least 80%, 85%, 90%>, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity to a CDR sequence listed in Tables 3A and 3B and Table 6C, infra. Some antigen binding proteins comprise 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 of the CDRs \n\n listed in Tables 3 A and 3B and Table 6C, infra, each differing by no more than 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acids from the CDRs listed in these tables. \n\n\n In still another aspect, an antigen binding protein includes the following associations of CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3: SEQ ID NOs: 167, 176, and 190; SEQ ID NOs: 167, 176, and 189, SEQ ID NOs: 166, 176, and 188; SEQ ID NOs: 166, 176, and 188; SEQ ID NOs: 161, 174, and 183; SEQ ID NOs:162, 173, and 184; SEQ ID NOs: 162, 173, and 186; SEQ ID NOs: 164, 173, and 186; SEQ ID NOs: 160, 173, and 182; SEQ ID NOs: 163, 173, and 185; SEQ ID NOs:163, 173, and 185; SEQ ID NOs: 159, 172, and 181; SEQ ID NOs: 165, 175, and 187; SEQ ID NOs: 158, 171, and 180; SEQ ID NOs: 168, 171, and 191; SEQ ID NOs: 169, 177 and 192; SEQ ID NOs: 170, 178, and 193; SEQ ID NOs: 163, 173, and 194; SEQ ID NOs: 163, 173 and 194; and SEQ ID NOs: 163, 179, and 194. \n\n\n In an additional aspect, an antigen binding protein includes the following associations of CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3: SEQ ID NOs: 122, 133, and 146; SEQ ID NOs: 122, 133, and 147; SEQ ID NOs: 122, 133, and 148; SEQ ID NOs: 122, 134, andl48; SEQ ID NOs: 124, 136, and 150; SEQ ID NOs: 124, 138, and 152; SEQ ID NOs: 124, 139, and 152; SEQ ID NOs:124, 137, and 151; SEQ ID NOs: 124, 137, and 151; SEQ ID NOs: 131, 140, and 153; SEQ ID NOs: 125, 140, and 153; SEQ ID NOs: 123, 135, and 149; SEQ ID NOs: 123, 135, and 149; SEQ ID NOs: 121, 132, and 145; SEQ ID NOs: 126, 133, and 154; SEQ ID NOs: 130, 144, and 157; SEQ ID NOs: 127, 135, and 155; SEQ ID NOs: 129, 142, and 156; SEQ ID NOs: 128, 141, and 156; and SEQ ID NOs: 128, 143, and 156. \n\n\n In another aspect, an antigen binding protein includes the following associations of CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3 with CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3: SEQ ID NOs: 167, 176, and 190; SEQ ID NOs: 167, 176, and 189, SEQ ID NOs: 166, 176, and 188; SEQ ID NOs: 166, 176, and 188; SEQ ID NOs: 161, 174, and 183; SEQ ID NOs: 162, 173, and 184; SEQ ID NOs:162, 173, and 186; SEQ ID NOs: 164, 173, and 186; SEQ ID NOs: 160, 173, and 182; SEQ ID NOs: 163, 173, and 185; SEQ ID NOs: 163, 173, and 185; SEQ ID NOs: 159, 172, and 181; SEQ ID NOs: 165, 175, and 187; SEQ ID NOs: 158, 171, and 180; SEQ ID NOs: 168, 171, and 191 ; SEQ ID NOs: 169, 177 and 192; SEQ ID NOs: 170, 178, and 193; SEQ ID NOs: 163, 173, and 194; SEQ ID NOs: 163, 173 and 194; SEQ ID NOs: 163, 179, and 194 with SEQ ID NOs: 122, 133, and 146; SEQ ID NOs: 122, 133, and 147; SEQ ID NOs: 122, 133, and 148; SEQ ID NOs: 122, 134, andl48; SEQ ID NOs: 124, 136, and 150; SEQ ID NOs: 124, 138, and 152; SEQ \n\n ID NOs: 124, 139, and 152; SEQ ID NOs: 124, 137, and 151; SEQ ID NOs: 124, 137, and 151 ; SEQ ID N0s: 131, 140, and 153; SEQ ID NOs: 125, 140, and 153; SEQ ID NOs: 123, 135, and 149; SEQ ID NOs:123, 135, and 149; SEQ ID N0s: 121, 132, and 145; SEQ ID NOs: 126, 133, and 154; SEQ ID NOs: 130, 144, and 157; SEQ ID NOs: 127, 135, and 155; SEQ ID NOs:129, 142, and 156; SEQ ID NOs: 128, 141, and 156; and SEQ ID NOs: 128, 143, and 156. \n\n\nConsensus Sequences \n\n\n In yet another aspect, the CDRs disclosed herein include consensus sequences derived from groups of related monoclonal antibodies.

In yet another embodiment, the antigen binding protein comprises the CDRLl, CDRL2, and CDRL3 sequences of light chain sequences LI, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9, L10, Ll l, L12, L13, L14, L15, L16, L17 or LI 8 as shown in Table 4B. \n\n\n In yet another embodiment, the antigen binding protein comprises all six CDRs of LI and HI, or L2 and H2, or L3 and H3, or L3 and H4, or L4 and H5, or L5 and H6, or L6 and H7, or L7 and H8, or L8 and H7, or L9 and H9, or L9 and H10, or L10 and HI 1, or LI 1 and HI 1, or \n\n L12 and H12, or L13 and H13, or L14 and H14, or L15 and H15, or L16 and H16, or L17 H17, or L18 and H18, as shown in Tables 4A and 4B. \n\n\n Table 4A - Heavy Chain Sequences \n\n\n \n\n Table 4B - Light Chain Sequences \n\n\n \n\n In one aspect, the isolated antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4provided herein can be a monoclonal antibody, a polyclonal antibody, a recombinant antibody, a human antibody, a humanized antibody, a chimeric antibody, a multispecific antibody, or an antibody fragment thereof. \n\n\n In another embodiment, the antibody fragment of the isolated antigen-binding proteins provided herein can be a Fab fragment, a Fab' fragment, an F(ab')\n2\n fragment, an Fv fragment, a diabody, or a single chain antibody molecule. \n\n\n In a further embodiment, an isolated antigen binding protein that specifically (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 provided herein is a human antibody and can be of the IgGl-, IgG2- IgG3- or IgG4-type. \n\n\n In another embodiment, an isolated antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β- Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 comprises a light or a heavy chain polypeptide as set forth in Tables 1A-1B. In some embodiments, an antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 comprises a variable light or variable heavy domain such as those listed in Tables 2A-2B. In still other embodiments, an antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 comprises one, two or three CDRHs or one, two or three CDRLs as set forth in Tables 3A-3B, 4A-4B and Table 6C, infra. Such antigen binding proteins, and indeed any of the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein, can be PEGylated with one or more PEG molecules, for examples PEG molecules having a molecular weight selected from the group consisting of 5K, 10K, 20K, 40K, 5 OK, 60K, 80K, 100K or greater than 100K. \n\n\n In yet another aspect, any antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 provided herein can be coupled to a labeling group and can compete for binding to the extracellular portion of (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, \n\n FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 with an antigen binding protein of one of the isolated antigen binding proteins provided herein. In one embodiment, the isolated antigen binding protein provided herein can reduce blood glucose levels, decrease triglyceride and cholesterol levels or improve other glycemic parameters and cardiovascular risk factors when administered to a patient. \n\n\n As will be appreciated, for any antigen binding protein comprising more than one CDR provided in Tables 3A-3B, and 4A-4B, any combination of CDRs independently selected from the depicted sequences may be useful. Thus, antigen binding proteins with one, two, three, four, five or six of independently selected CDRs can be generated. However, as will be appreciated by those in the art, specific embodiments generally utilize combinations of CDRs that are non- repetitive, e.g., antigen binding proteins are generally not made with two CDRH2 regions, etc. \n\n\n Some of the antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 that are provided herein are discussed in more detail below. \n\n\nAntigen Binding Proteins and Binding Epitopes and Binding Domains \n\n\n When an antigen binding protein is said to bind an epitope on (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, or the extracellular domain of β-Klotho, FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4, for example, what is meant is that the antigen binding protein specifically binds to a specified portion of (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. In some embodiments, e.g., in certain cases where the antigen binding protein binds only FGFRlc or β- Klotho, the antigen binding protein can specifically bind to a polypeptide consisting of specified residues (e.g., a specified segment of β-Klotho, FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4, such as those residues disclosed in Example 14). In other embodiments, e.g., in certain cases where an antigen binding protein interacts with both β-Klotho and one or more of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c and FGFR4, the antigen binding protein can bind residues, sequences of residues, or regions in both β-Klotho and FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4, depending on which receptor the antigen binding protein recognizes. In still other embodiments the antigen binding \n\n protein will bind residues, sequence or residues or regions of a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, for example FGFRlc. \n\n\n In any of the foregoing embodiments, such an antigen binding protein does not need to contact every residue of (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, or the extracellular domain of the recited proteins or complexes. Nor does every single amino acid substitution or deletion within (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, or the extracellular domain of the recited proteins or complexes, necessarily significantly affect binding affinity. \n\n\n Epitope specificity and the binding domain(s) of an antigen binding protein can be determined by a variety of methods. Some methods, for example, can use truncated portions of an antigen. Other methods utilize antigen mutated at one or more specific residues, such as by employing an alanine scanning or arginine scanning-type approach or by the generation and study of chimeric proteins in which various domains, regions or amino acids are swapped between two proteins (e.g., mouse and human forms of one or more of the antigens or target proteins), or by protease protection assays. \n\n\nCompeting Antigen Binding Proteins \n\n\n In another aspect, antigen binding proteins are provided that compete with one of the exemplified antibodies or functional fragments for binding to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. Such antigen binding proteins can also bind to the same epitope as one of the herein exemplified antigen binding proteins, or an overlapping epitope. Antigen binding proteins and fragments that compete with or bind to the same epitope as the exemplified antigen binding proteins are expected to show similar functional properties. The exemplified antigen binding proteins and fragments include those with the heavy and light chains HI -HI 8 and LI -L I 8, variable region domains VLI - VL18 and VHT - VH18, and CDRs provided herein, including those in Tables 1 , 2, 3, and 4. Thus, as a specific example, the antigen binding proteins that are provided include those that compete with an antibody comprising: \n\n (a) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or all 6 of the CDRs listed for an antibody listed in Tables 3A and 3B, and 4A and 4B and Table 6C, infra; \n\n\n (b) a V\nH\n and a V\nL\n selected from V\nL\nI - V\nL\n18 and V\nH\nI - V\nH\n18 and listed for an antibody listed in Tables 2 A and 2B; or \n\n\n (c) two light chains and two heavy chains as specified for an antibody listed in Tables\n\n\n1A and 12B and Table 6 A, infra. \n\n\n Thus, in one embodiment, the present disclosure provides antigen binding proteins that competes for binding to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 with a reference antibody, wherein the reference antibody comprises a combination of light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequences selected from the group consisting of L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L3H4, L4H5, L5H6, L6H7, L7H8, L8H8, L9H9, L9H10, L10H11, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17 or L18H18. In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides human antibodies that compete for binding to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 with a reference antibody, wherein the reference antibody is 17C3, 22H5, 16H7, 24H11, 18G1, 17D8, 26H11, 12E4, 12C11, 21H2, 21B4, 18B11.1, 18B11.2, 20D4, 46D11, 40D2, 37D3, 39F7, 39F1 or 39G5. \n\n\n In a further embodiment, an isolated human antibody is provided that binds to (i) β- Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 with substantially the same Kd as a reference antibody; initiates FGF21-like signaling in an in vitro ELK-Luciferase assay to the same degree as a reference antibody; lowers blood glucose; lowers serum lipid levels; and/or competes for binding with said reference antibody to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, wherein the reference antibody is selected from the group consisting of 17C3, 22H5, 16H7, 24H11, 18G1, 17D8, 26H11, 12E4, 12C11, 21H2, 21B4, 18B11.1, 18B11.2, 20D4, 46D11, 40D2, 37D3, 39F7, 39F1 or 39G5. \n\n\n The ability to compete with an antibody can be determined using any suitable assay, such as that described in Example 8, in which antigen binding proteins 17C3, 22H5, 16H7, \n\n 24H11, 18G1, 17D8, 26H11, 12E4, 12C11, 21H2, 21B4, 18B11.1, 18B11.2, 20D4, 46D11, 40D2, 37D3, 39F7, 39F1 or 39G5 can be used as the reference antibody. \n\n\nMonoclonal Antibodies \n\n\n The antigen binding proteins that are provided include monoclonal antibodies that bind to\n\n\n(i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, and induce FGF21-like signaling to various degrees. Monoclonal antibodies can be produced using any technique known in the art, e.g., by immortalizing spleen cells harvested from the transgenic animal after completion of the immunization schedule. The spleen cells can be immortalized using any technique known in the art, e.g., by fusing them with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas. Myeloma cells for use in hybridoma-producing fusion procedures preferably are non-antibody-producing, have high fusion efficiency, and enzyme deficiencies that render them incapable of growing in certain selective media which support the growth of only the desired fused cells (hybridomas). Examples of suitable cell lines for use in mouse fusions include Sp-20, P3-X63/Ag8, P3-X63- Ag8.653, NSl/l .Ag 4 1, Sp210-Agl4, FO, NSO/U, MPC-11, MPCl 1-X45-GTG 1.7 and S194/5XXO Bui; examples of cell lines used in rat fusions include R210.RCY3, Y3-Ag 1.2.3, IR983F and 4B210. Other cell lines useful for cell fusions are U-266, GM1500-GRG2, LICR- LON-HMy2 and UC729-6. \n\n\n In some instances, a hybridoma cell line is produced by immunizing an animal {e.g., a transgenic animal having human immunoglobulin sequences) with a FGFRlc, β-Klotho or FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho immunogen {e.g., a soluble complex comprising the extracellular domains of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4 and/or β-Klotho as shown in Examples 2, and 3; membranes on which the extracellular domains of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4 and/or β-Klotho are expressed, as shown in Examples 1 and 3; or whole cells expressing FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho, as shown in Examples 1 and 3); harvesting spleen cells from the immunized animal; fusing the harvested spleen cells to a myeloma cell line, thereby generating hybridoma cells; establishing hybridoma cell lines from the hybridoma cells, and identifying a hybridoma cell line that produces an antibody that binds to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 {e.g., as described in the Example 4) and can induce FGF21-like signaling \n\n (e.g., as described in Examples 5-7). Such hybridoma cell lines, and the monoclonal antibodies produced by them, form aspects of the present disclosure. \n\n\n Monoclonal antibodies secreted by a hybridoma cell line can be purified using any technique known in the art. Hybridomas or mAbs can be further screened to identify mAbs with particular properties, such as the ability to induce FGF21-like signaling. Examples of such screens are provided herein. \n\n\nChimeric and Humanized Antibodies \n\n\n Chimeric and humanized antibodies based upon the foregoing sequences can readily be generated. One example is a chimeric antibody, which is an antibody composed of protein segments from different antibodies that are covalently joined to produce functional immunoglobulin light or heavy chains or immunologically functional portions thereof. Generally, a portion of the heavy chain and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. For methods relating to chimeric antibodies, see, for example, United States Patent No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et ah, 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 8J_:6851-6855, which are hereby incorporated by reference. CDR grafting is described, for example, in United States Patent No. 6,180,370, No. 5,693,762, No. 5,693,761, No. 5,585,089, and No. 5,530,101. \n\n\n Generally, the goal of making a chimeric antibody is to create a chimera in which the number of amino acids from the intended patient/recipient species is maximized. One example is the \"CDR-grafted\" antibody, in which the antibody comprises one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the antibody chain(s) is/are identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. For use in humans, the variable region or selected CDRs from a rodent antibody often are grafted into a human antibody, replacing the naturally-occurring variable regions or CDRs of the human antibody. \n\n\nI l l \n\n One useful type of chimeric antibody is a \"humanized\" antibody. Generally, a humanized antibody is produced from a monoclonal antibody raised initially in a non-human animal. Certain amino acid residues in this monoclonal antibody, typically from non-antigen recognizing portions of the antibody, are modified to be homologous to corresponding residues in a human antibody of corresponding isotype. Humanization can be performed, for example, using various methods by substituting at least a portion of a rodent variable region for the corresponding regions of a human antibody (see, e.g., United States Patent No. 5,585,089, and No. 5,693,762; Jones et al, 1986, Nature 321 :522-525; Riechmann et al, 1988, Nature 332:323- 27; Verhoeyen et al, 1988, Science 239:1534-1536). \n\n\n In one aspect, the CDRs of the light and heavy chain variable regions of the antibodies provided herein (e.g. , in Tables 3 and 4) are grafted to framework regions (FRs) from antibodies from the same, or a different, phylogenetic species. For example, the CDRs of the heavy and light chain variable regions V\nH\n1, V\nH\n2, V\nH\n3, V\nH\n4, V\nH\n5, V\nH\n6, V\nH\n7, V\nH\n8, V\nH\n9, V\nH\n10, V\nH\n11, V\nH\n12, V\nH\n13, V\nH\n14, V\nH\n15, V\nH\n16, V\nH\n17 or V\nH\n18 and/or V\nL\n1, V\nL\n2, V\nL\n3, V\nL\n4, V\nL\n5, V\nL\n6, V\nL\n7, V\nL\n8, V\nL\n9, V\nL\n10, V\nl\n11, V\nh\n12, V\nl\n13, V\nl\n14, V\nl\n15, V\nl\n16, V\nl\n17 or V\nL\n18 can be grafted to consensus human FRs. To create consensus human FRs, FRs from several human heavy chain or light chain amino acid sequences can be aligned to identify a consensus amino acid sequence. In other embodiments, the FRs of a heavy chain or light chain disclosed herein are replaced with the FRs from a different heavy chain or light chain. In one aspect, rare amino acids in the FRs of the heavy and light chains of an antigen binding protein (e.g., an antibody) that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 are not replaced, while the rest of the FR amino acids are replaced. A \"rare amino acid\" is a specific amino acid that is in a position in which this particular amino acid is not usually found in an FR. Alternatively, the grafted variable regions from the one heavy or light chain can be used with a constant region that is different from the constant region of that particular heavy or light chain as disclosed herein. In other embodiments, the grafted variable regions are part of a single chain Fv antibody. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, constant regions from species other than human can be used along with the human variable region(s) to produce hybrid antibodies. \n\n Fully Human Antibodies \n\n\n Fully human antibodies are also provided by the instant disclosure. Methods are available for making fully human antibodies specific for a given antigen without exposing human beings to the antigen (\"fully human antibodies\"). One specific means provided for implementing the production of fully human antibodies is the \"humanization\" of the mouse humoral immune system. Introduction of human immunoglobulin (Ig) loci into mice in which the endogenous Ig genes have been inactivated is one means of producing fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in mouse, an animal that can be immunized with any desirable antigen. Using fully human antibodies can minimize the immunogenic and allergic responses that can sometimes be caused by administering mouse or mouse-derived mAbs to humans as therapeutic agents. \n\n\n Fully human antibodies can be produced by immunizing transgenic animals (typically mice) that are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. Antigens for this purpose typically have six or more contiguous amino acids, and optionally are conjugated to a carrier, such as a hapten. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al, (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:2551-2555; Jakobovits et al, (1993) Nature 362:255-258; and Bruggermann et al, (1993) Year in Immunol. 7:33. In one example of such a method, transgenic animals are produced by incapacitating the endogenous mouse immunoglobulin loci encoding the mouse heavy and light immunoglobulin chains therein, and inserting into the mouse genome large fragments of human genome DNA containing loci that encode human heavy and light chain proteins. Partially modified animals, which have less than the full complement of human immunoglobulin loci, are then cross-bred to obtain an animal having all of the desired immune system modifications. When administered an immunogen, these transgenic animals produce antibodies that are immunospecific for the immunogen but have human rather than murine amino acid sequences, including the variable regions. For further details of such methods, see, e.g., W096/33735 and WO94/02602. Additional methods relating to transgenic mice for making human antibodies are described in United States Patent No. 5,545,807; No. 6,713,610; No. 6,673,986; No. 6,162,963; No. 5,545,807; No. 6,300,129; No. 6,255,458; No. 5,877,397; No. 5,874,299 and No. 5,545,806; in PCT publications W091/10741, WO90/04036, and in EP 546073B1 and EP 546073 Al . \n\n The transgenic mice described above, referred to herein as \"HuMab\" mice, contain a human immunoglobulin gene minilocus that encodes unrearranged human heavy ([μ, mu] and [γ, gamma]) and [κ, kappa] light chain immunoglobulin sequences, together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous μ [mu] and κ [kappa] chain loci (Lonberg et al, 1994, Nature 368:856-859). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM or [κ, kappa] and in response to immunization, and the introduced human heavy and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high affinity human IgG [κ, kappa] monoclonal antibodies (Lonberg et al., supra.; Lonberg and Huszar, (1995) Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13: 65-93; Harding and Lonberg, (1995) Ann. N. Y Acad. Sci. 764:536-546). The preparation of HuMab mice is described in detail in Taylor et al, (1992) Nucleic Acids Research 20:6287-6295; Chen et al, (1993) International Immunology 5:647-656; Tuaillon et al, (1994) J. Immunol. 152:2912-2920; Lonberg et al, (1994) Nature 368:856-859; Lonberg, (1994) Handbook of Exp. Pharmacology 113:49-101; Taylor et al, (1994) International Immunology 6:579-591; Lonberg and Huszar, (1995) Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93; Harding and Lonberg, (1995) Ann. N. Y Acad. Sci. 764:536-546; Fishwild et al, (1996) Nature Biotechnology 14:845- 851; the foregoing references are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. See, further United States Patent No. 5,545,806; No. 5,569,825; No. 5,625,126; No. 5,633,425; No. 5,789,650; No. 5,877,397; No. 5,661,016; No. 5,814,318; No. 5,874,299; and No. 5,770,429; as well as United States Patent No. 5,545,807; International Publication Nos. WO 93/1227; WO 92/22646; and WO 92/03918, the disclosures of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. Technologies utilized for producing human antibodies in these transgenic mice are disclosed also in WO 98/24893, and Mendez et al, (1997) Nature Genetics 15: 146-156, which are hereby incorporated by reference. For example, the HCo7 and HCol2 transgenic mice strains can be used to generate antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) that bind to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 and may induce FGF21-like signaling. Further details regarding the production of human antibodies using transgenic mice are provided in the examples below. \n\n\n Using hybridoma technology, antigen-specific human mAbs with the desired specificity can be produced and selected from the transgenic mice such as those described above. Such \n\n antibodies can be cloned and expressed using a suitable vector and host cell, or the antibodies can be harvested from cultured hybridoma cells. \n\n\n Fully human antibodies can also be derived from phage-display libraries (as disclosed in Hoogenboom et al, (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 227:381; and Marks et al, (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222:581). Phage display techniques mimic immune selection through the display of antibody repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, and subsequent selection of phage by their binding to an antigen of choice. One such technique is described in PCT Publication No. WO 99/10494 (hereby incorporated by reference), which describes the isolation of high affinity and functional agonistic antibodies for MPL- and msk-receptors using such an approach. \n\n\nBispecific or Bifunctional Antigen Binding Proteins \n\n\n Also provided are bispecific and bifunctional antibodies that include one or more CDRs or one or more variable regions as described above. A bispecific or bifunctional antibody in some instances can be an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai and Lachmann, 1990, Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79:315-321; Kostelny et al, 1992, J. Immunol. 148: 1547-1553. When an antigen binding protein of the instant disclosure binds (i) both β-Klotho and one or more of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (ii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, the binding may lead to the activation of FGF21-like activity as measured by the FGF21-like functional and signaling assays described in Examples 5-7; when such an antigen binding protein is an antibody it is referred to as an agonistic antibody. Various Other Forms \n\n\n Some of the antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 that are provided in the present disclosure include variant forms of the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein {e.g., those having the sequences listed in Tables 1-4). \n\n In various embodiments, the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein can comprise one or more non-naturally occurring amino acids. For instance, some of the antigen binding proteins have one or more non-naturally occurring amino acid substitutions in one or more of the heavy or light chains, variable regions or CDRs listed in Tables 1-4. Examples of non-naturally amino acids (which can be substituted for any naturally-occurring amino acid found in any sequence disclosed herein, as desired) include: 4-hydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, ε-Ν,Ν,Ν- trimethyllysine, ε-Ν-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3- methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, σ-Ν-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and imino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline). In the polypeptide notation used herein, the left-hand direction is the amino terminal direction and the right-hand direction is the carboxyl-terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention. A non-limiting lists of examples of non- naturally occurring amino acids that can be inserted into an antigen binding protein sequence or substituted for a wild-type residue in an antigen binding sequence include β-amino acids, homoamino acids, cyclic amino acids and amino acids with derivatized side chains. Examples include (in the L-form or D-form; abbreviated as in parentheses): citrulline (Cit), homocitrulline (hCit), Na-methylcitrulline (NMeCit), Na-methylhomocitrulline (Na-MeHoCit), ornithine (Orn), Na-Methylornithine (Na-MeOrn or NMeOrn), sarcosine (Sar), homolysine (hLys or hK), homoarginine (hArg or hR), homoglutamine (hQ), Na-methylarginine (NMeR), Na- methylleucine (Na-MeL or NMeL), N-methylhomolysine (NMeHoK), Na-methylglutamine (NMeQ), norleucine (Nle), norvaline (Nva), 1 , 2,3, 4-tetrahydroisoquino line (Tic), Octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid (Oic), 3-(l-naphthyl)alanine (1-Nal), 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine (2-Nal), 1 ,2, 3, 4-tetrahydroisoquino line (Tic), 2-indanylglycine (Igl), para-iodophenylalanine (pl-Phe), para-aminophenylalanine (4AmP or 4-Amino-Phe), 4-guanidino phenylalanine (Guf), glycyllysine (abbreviated \"K(N8-glycyl)\" or \"K(glycyl)\" or \"K(gly)\"), nitrophenylalanine (nitrophe), aminophenylalanine (aminophe or Amino-Phe), benzylphenylalanine (benzylphe), γ-carboxyglutamic acid (γ-carboxyglu), hydroxyproline (hydroxypro), p-carboxyl-phenylalanine (Cpa), a-aminoadipic acid (Aad), Na-methyl valine (NMeVal), N-a-methyl leucine (NMeLeu), Na-methylnorleucine (NMeNle), cyclopentylglycine (Cpg), cyclohexylglycine (Chg), acetylarginine (acetylarg), a, β-diaminopropionoic acid (Dpr), a, γ-diaminobutyric acid (Dab), diaminopropionic acid (Dap), cyclohexylalanine (Cha), 4-methyl-phenylalanine (MePhe), β, β- diphenyl-alanine (BiPhA), aminobutyric acid (Abu), 4-phenyl-phenylalanine (or \n\n biphenylalanine; 4Bip), a-amino-isobutyric acid (Aib), beta-alanine, beta-aminopropionic acid, piperidinic acid, aminocaprioic acid, aminoheptanoic acid, aminopimelic acid, desmosine, diaminopimelic acid, N-ethylglycine, N-ethylaspargine, hydroxylysine, allo-hydroxylysine, isodesmosine, allo-isoleucine, N-methylglycine, N-methylisoleucine, N-methylvaline, 4- hydroxyproline (Hyp), γ-carboxyglutamate, ε-Ν,Ν,Ν-trimethyllysine, ε-Ν-acetyllysine, O- phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5 -hydroxylysine, ω- methylarginine, 4-Amino-O-Phthalic Acid (4APA), and other similar amino acids, and derivatized forms of any of those specifically listed. \n\n\n Additionally, the antigen binding proteins can have one or more conservative amino acid substitutions in one or more of the heavy or light chains, variable regions or CDRs listed in Tables 1-4. Naturally-occurring amino acids can be divided into classes based on common side chain properties: \n\n\n 1) hydrophobic: norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, He; \n\n\n 2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gin; \n\n\n 3) acidic: Asp, Glu; \n\n\n 4) basic: His, Lys, Arg; \n\n\n 5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and \n\n\n 6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe. \n\n\n Conservative amino acid substitutions can involve exchange of a member of one of these classes with another member of the same class. Conservative amino acid substitutions can encompass non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. See Table 5, infra. These include peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties. \n\n\n Non-conservative substitutions can involve the exchange of a member of one of the above classes for a member from another class. Such substituted residues can be introduced into regions of the antibody that are homologous with human antibodies, or into the non-homologous regions of the molecule. \n\n\n In making such changes, according to certain embodiments, the hydropathic index of amino acids can be considered. The hydropathic profile of a protein is calculated by assigning each amino acid a numerical value (\"hydropathy index\") and then repetitively averaging these values along the peptide chain. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the \n\n basis of its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics. They are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (-0.4); threonine (-0.7); serine (-0.8); tryptophan (-0.9); tyrosine (-1.3); proline (-1.6); histidine (-3.2); glutamate (-3.5); glutamine (-3.5); aspartate (-3.5); asparagine (-3.5); lysine (- 3.9); and arginine (-4.5). \n\n\n The importance of the hydropathic profile in conferring interactive biological function on a protein is understood in the art (see, e.g., Kyte et ah, 1982, J. Mol. Biol. 157: 105-131). It is known that certain amino acids can be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a similar biological activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathic index, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within ±2 is included. In some aspects, those which are within ±1 are included, and in other aspects, those within ±0.5 are included. \n\n\n It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity, particularly where the biologically functional protein or peptide thereby created is intended for use in immunological embodiments, as in the present case. In certain embodiments, the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with its immunogenicity and antigen- binding or immunogenicity, that is, with a biological property of the protein. \n\n\n The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0); aspartate (+3.0+1); glutamate (+3.0+1); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (-0.4); proline (-0.5+1); alanine (-0.5); histidine (-0.5); cysteine (-1.0); methionine (-1.3); valine (-1.5); leucine (-1.8); isoleucine (-1.8); tyrosine (-2.3); phenylalanine (-2.5) and tryptophan (-3.4). In making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within ±2 is included, in other embodiments, those which are within ±1 are included, and in still other embodiments, those within ±0.5 are included. In some instances, one can also identify epitopes from primary amino acid sequences on the basis of hydrophilicity. These regions are also referred to as \"epitopic core regions.\" \n\n\n Exemplary conservative amino acid substitutions are set forth in Table 5. \n\n Table 5 \n\n\n Conservative Amino Acid Substitutions \n\n\n \n\n A skilled artisan will be able to determine suitable variants of polypeptides as set forth herein using well-known techniques coupled with the information provided herein. One skilled in the art can identify suitable areas of the molecule that can be changed without destroying activity by targeting regions not believed to be important for activity. The skilled artisan also will be able to identify residues and portions of the molecules that are conserved among similar polypeptides. In further embodiments, even areas that can be important for biological activity or for structure can be subject to conservative amino acid substitutions without destroying the biological activity or without adversely affecting the polypeptide structure. \n\n Additionally, one skilled in the art can review structure-function studies identifying residues in similar polypeptides that are important for activity or structure. In view of such a comparison, one can predict the importance of amino acid residues in a protein that correspond to amino acid residues important for activity or structure in similar proteins. One skilled in the art can opt for chemically similar amino acid substitutions for such predicted important amino acid residues. \n\n\n One skilled in the art can also analyze the 3 -dimensional structure and amino acid sequence in relation to that structure in similar polypeptides. In view of such information, one skilled in the art can predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an antibody with respect to its three dimensional structure. One skilled in the art can choose not to make radical changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein, since such residues can be involved in important interactions with other molecules. Moreover, one skilled in the art can generate test variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each desired amino acid residue. These variants can then be screened using assays for FGF21-like signaling, (see the Examples provided herein) thus yielding information regarding which amino acids can be changed and which must not be changed. In other words, based on information gathered from such routine experiments, one skilled in the art can readily determine the amino acid positions where further substitutions should be avoided either alone or in combination with other mutations. \n\n\n A number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of secondary structure. See, Moult, (1996) Curr. Op. in Biotech. 7:422-427; Chou et al, (1974) Biochem. 13:222-245; Chou et al, (1974) Biochemistry 113:211-222; Chou et al, (1978) Adv. Enzymol Relat. Areas Mo I Biol 47:45-148; Chou et al, (1979) Ann. Rev. Biochem. 47:251-276; and Chou et al, (1979) Biophys. J. 26:367-384. Moreover, computer programs are currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example, two polypeptides or proteins that have a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40% can have similar structural topologies. The growth of the protein structural database (PDB) has provided enhanced predictability of secondary structure, including the potential number of folds within a polypeptide's or protein's structure. See, Holm et al, (1999) Nucl Acid. Res. 27:244-247. It has been suggested (Brenner et al, (1997) Curr. Op. Struct. Biol 7:369-376) that there are a limited \n\n number of folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that once a critical number of structures have been resolved, structural prediction will become dramatically more accurate. \n\n\n Additional methods of predicting secondary structure include \"threading\" (Jones, (1997) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 7:377-387; Sippl et al, (1996) Structure 4: 15-19), \"profile analysis\" (Bowie et al, (1991) Science 253 :164-170; Gribskov et al, (1990) Meth. Enzym. 183 :146-159; Gribskov et al, (1987) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 84:4355-4358), and \"evolutionary linkage\" (See, Holm, (1999) supra; and Brenner, (1997) supra). \n\n\n In some embodiments, amino acid substitutions are made that: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter ligand or antigen binding affinities, and/or (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties on such polypeptides. For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (in certain embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions) can be made in the naturally-occurring sequence. Substitutions can be made in that portion of the antibody that lies outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts). In such embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions can be used that do not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., one or more replacement amino acids that do not disrupt the secondary structure that characterizes the parent or native antigen binding protein). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed.), 1984, W. H. New York: Freeman and Company; Introduction to Protein Structure (Branden and Tooze, eds.), 1991, New York: Garland Publishing; and Thornton et al, (1991) Nature 354: 105, which are each incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n Additional preferred antibody variants include cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine residues in the parent or native amino acid sequence are deleted from or substituted with another amino acid (e.g., serine). Cysteine variants are useful, inter alia when antibodies must be refolded into a biologically active conformation. Cysteine variants can have fewer cysteine residues than the native antibody, and typically have an even number to minimize interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines. \n\n\n The heavy and light chains, variable regions domains and CDRs that are disclosed can be used to prepare polypeptides that contain an antigen binding region that can specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho \n\n and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 and may induce FGF21-like signaling. For example, one or more of the CDRs listed in Tables 3 and 4 can be incorporated into a molecule (e.g., a polypeptide) covalently or noncovalently to make an immunoadhesion. An immunoadhesion can incorporate the CDR(s) as part of a larger polypeptide chain, can covalently link the CDR(s) to another polypeptide chain, or can incorporate the CDR(s) noncovalently. The CDR(s) enable the immunoadhesion to bind specifically to a particular antigen of interest (e.g., (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 or an epitope thereon). \n\n\n The heavy and light chains, variable regions domains and CDRs that are disclosed can be used to prepare polypeptides that contain an antigen binding region that can specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 and may induce FGF21-like signaling. For example, one or more of the CDRs listed in Tables 3 and 4 can be incorporated into a molecule (e.g., a polypeptide) that is structurally similar to a \"half antibody comprising the heavy chain, the light chain of an antigen binding protein paired with a Fc fragment so that the antigen binding region is monovalent (like a Fab fragment) but with a dimeric Fc moiety. \n\n\n Mimetics (e.g., \"peptide mimetics\" or \"peptidomimetics\") based upon the variable region domains and CDRs that are described herein are also provided. These analogs can be peptides, non-peptides or combinations of peptide and non-peptide regions. Fauchere, 1986, Adv. Drug Res. 15 :29; Veber and Freidinger, 1985, TINS p. 392; and Evans et al, 1987, J. Med. Chem. 30: 1229, which are incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides can be used to produce a similar therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Generally, peptidomimetics are proteins that are structurally similar to an antibody displaying a desired biological activity, such as here the ability to specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from: -CH\n2\nNH-, -CH\n2\nS-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH-CH-(cis and trans), -COCH\n2\n-, -CH(OH)CH\n2\n-, and -CH\n2\nSO-, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the \n\n same type (e.g. , D-lysine in place of L-lysine) can be used in certain embodiments to generate more stable proteins. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation can be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch, 1992, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61:387), incorporated herein by reference), for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide. \n\n\n Derivatives of the antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 that are described herein are also provided. The derivatized antigen binding proteins can comprise any molecule or substance that imparts a desired property to the antibody or fragment, such as increased half-life in a particular use. The derivatized antigen binding protein can comprise, for example, a detectable (or labeling) moiety (e.g., a radioactive, colorimetric, antigenic or enzymatic molecule, a detectable bead (such as a magnetic or electrodense (e.g., gold) bead), or a molecule that binds to another molecule (e.g., biotin or streptavidin)), a therapeutic or diagnostic moiety (e.g., a radioactive, cytotoxic, or pharmaceutically active moiety), or a molecule that increases the suitability of the antigen binding protein for a particular use (e.g., administration to a subject, such as a human subject, or other in vivo or in vitro uses). Examples of molecules that can be used to derivatize an antigen binding protein include albumin (e.g., human serum albumin) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Albumin-linked and PEGylated derivatives of antigen binding proteins can be prepared using techniques well known in the art. Certain antigen binding proteins include a PEGylated single chain polypeptide as described herein. In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein is conjugated or otherwise linked to transthyretin (TTR) or a TTR variant. The TTR or TTR variant can be chemically modified with, for example, a chemical selected from the group consisting of dextran, poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone), polyethylene glycols, propropylene glycol homopolymers, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols and polyvinyl alcohols. \n\n\n Other derivatives include covalent or aggregative conjugates of the antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 that are disclosed herein with other proteins or polypeptides, such as by expression of recombinant fusion \n\n proteins comprising heterologous polypeptides fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of an antigen binding protein that induces FGF21-like signaling. For example, the conjugated peptide can be a heterologous signal (or leader) polypeptide, e.g., the yeast alpha- factor leader, or a peptide such as an epitope tag. An antigen binding protein-containing fusion protein of the present disclosure can comprise peptides added to facilitate purification or identification of an antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 {e.g., a poly-His tag) and that can induce FGF21-like signaling. An antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 also can be linked to the FLAG peptide as described in Hopp et ah, 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1204; and United States Patent No. 5,011,912. The FLAG peptide is highly antigenic and provides an epitope reversibly bound by a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), enabling rapid assay and facile purification of expressed recombinant protein. Reagents useful for preparing fusion proteins in which the FLAG peptide is fused to a given polypeptide are commercially available (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). \n\n\n Multimers that comprise one or more antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β- Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 form another aspect of the present disclosure. Multimers can take the form of covalently-linked or non-covalently-linked dimers, trimers, or higher multimers. Multimers comprising two or more antigen binding proteins that bind (i) β- Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 and which may induce FGF21-like signaling are contemplated for use as therapeutics, diagnostics and for other uses as well, with one example of such a multimer being a homodimer. Other exemplary multimers include heterodimers, homotrimers, heterotrimers, homotetramers, heterotetramers, etc. \n\n\n One embodiment is directed to multimers comprising multiple antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 joined via covalent or non-covalent interactions between peptide moieties fused to an antigen binding protein that \n\n specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. Such peptides can be peptide linkers (spacers), or peptides that have the property of promoting multimerization. Leucine zippers and certain polypeptides derived from antibodies are among the peptides that can promote multimerization of antigen binding proteins attached thereto, as described in more detail herein. \n\n\n In particular embodiments, the multimers comprise from two to four antigen binding proteins that bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. The antigen binding protein moieties of the multimer can be in any of the forms described above, e.g., variants or fragments. Preferably, the multimers comprise antigen binding proteins that have the ability to specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. \n\n\n In one embodiment, an oligomer is prepared using polypeptides derived from immunoglobulins. Preparation of fusion proteins comprising certain heterologous polypeptides fused to various portions of antibody-derived polypeptides (including the Fc domain) has been described, e.g., by Ashkenazi et al, (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 10535; Byrn et al, (1990) Nature 344:677; and HoUenbaugh et al, 1992 \"Construction of Immunoglobulin Fusion Proteins\", in Current Protocols in Immunology, Suppl. 4, pages 10.19.1-10.19.11. \n\n\n One embodiment comprises a dimer comprising two fusion proteins created by fusing an antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 to the Fc region of an antibody. The dimer can be made by, for example, inserting a gene fusion encoding the fusion protein into an appropriate expression vector, expressing the gene fusion in host cells transformed with the recombinant expression vector, and allowing the expressed fusion protein to assemble much like antibody molecules, whereupon interchain disulfide bonds form between the Fc moieties to yield the dimer. \n\n\n The term \"Fc polypeptide\" as used herein includes native and mutein forms of polypeptides derived from the Fc region of an antibody. Truncated forms of such polypeptides containing the hinge region that promotes dimerization also are included. Fusion proteins \n\n comprising Fc moieties (and oligomers formed therefrom) offer the advantage of facile purification by affinity chromatography over Protein A or Protein G columns. \n\n\n One suitable Fc polypeptide, described in PCT application WO 93/10151 and United States Patent. No. 5,426,048 and No. 5,262,522, is a single chain polypeptide extending from the N-terminal hinge region to the native C-terminus of the Fc region of a human IgGl antibody. Another useful Fc polypeptide is the Fc mutein described in United States Patent No. 5,457,035, and in Baum et al, (1994) EMBO J. 13:3992-4001. The amino acid sequence of this mutein is identical to that of the native Fc sequence presented in WO 93/10151, except that amino acid 19 has been changed from Leu to Ala, amino acid 20 has been changed from Leu to Glu, and amino acid 22 has been changed from Gly to Ala. The mutein exhibits reduced affinity for Fc receptors. \n\n\n In other embodiments, the variable portion of the heavy and/or light chains of a antigen binding protein such as disclosed herein can be substituted for the variable portion of an antibody heavy and/or light chain. \n\n\n Alternatively, the oligomer is a fusion protein comprising multiple antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, with or without peptide linkers (spacer peptides). Among the suitable peptide linkers are those described in United States Patent. No. 4,751,180 and No. 4,935,233. \n\n\n Another method for preparing oligomeric derivatives comprising that antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 involves use of a leucine zipper. Leucine zipper domains are peptides that promote oligomerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA- binding proteins (Landschulz et al, (1988) Science 240: 1759), and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble oligomeric proteins are described in PCT application WO 94/10308, and the leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD) described in Hoppe et al, (1994) FEBS Letters 344: 191, hereby incorporated by reference. The use of a modified leucine zipper that allows for stable trimerization of a heterologous protein fused thereto is described in \n\n Fanslow et al., (1994) Semin. Immunol. 6:267-278. In one approach, recombinant fusion proteins comprising an antigen binding protein fragment or derivative that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 is fused to a leucine zipper peptide are expressed in suitable host cells, and the soluble oligomeric antigen binding protein fragments or derivatives that form are recovered from the culture supernatant. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antigen binding protein has a K\nD\n (equilibrium binding affinity) of less than 1 pM, 10 pM, 100 pM, 1 nM, 2 nM, 5 nM, 10 nM, 25 nM or 50 nM. \n\n\n In another aspect the instant disclosure provides an antigen binding protein having a half- life of at least one day in vitro or in vivo {e.g., when administered to a human subject). In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein has a half- life of at least three days. In another embodiment, the antibody or portion thereof has a half-life of four days or longer. In another embodiment, the antibody or portion thereof has a half-life of eight days or longer. In another embodiment, the antibody or portion thereof has a half-life of ten days or longer. In another embodiment, the antibody or portion thereof has a half- life of eleven days or longer. In another embodiment, the antibody or portion thereof has a half-life of fifteen days or longer. In another embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof is derivatized or modified such that it has a longer half-life as compared to the underivatized or unmodified antibody. In another embodiment, an antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 contains point mutations to increase serum half life, such as described in WO 00/09560, published Feb. 24, 2000, incorporated by reference. \n\n\nGlycosylation \n\n\n An antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c,\n\n\nFGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 can have a glycosylation pattern that is different or altered from that found in the native species. As is known in the art, glycosylation patterns can depend on both the sequence of the protein {e.g., the presence or absence of particular glycosylation amino acid residues, discussed below), or the host cell or organism in which the protein is produced. Particular expression systems are discussed below. \n\n Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tri- peptide sequences asparagine -X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tri-peptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose, to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5 -hydroxy lysine can also be used. \n\n\n Addition of glycosylation sites to the antigen binding protein is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above- described tri-peptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration can also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the starting sequence (for O-linked glycosylation sites). For ease, the antigen binding protein amino acid sequence can be altered through changes at the DNA level, particularly by mutating the DNA encoding the target polypeptide at preselected bases such that codons are generated that will translate into the desired amino acids. \n\n\n Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the antigen binding protein is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the protein. These procedures are advantageous in that they do not require production of the protein in a host cell that has glycosylation capabilities for N- and O-linked glycosylation. Depending on the coupling mode used, the sugar(s) can be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO 87/05330 and in Aplin and Wriston, (1981) CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306. \n\n\n Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the starting antigen binding protein can be accomplished chemically or enzymatically. Chemical deglycosylation requires exposure of the protein to the compound trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, or an equivalent compound. This treatment results in the cleavage of most or all sugars except the linking sugar (N- acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine), while leaving the polypeptide intact. Chemical \n\n deglycosylation is described by Hakimuddin et al., (1987) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 259:52 and by Edge et al., (1981) Anal. Biochem. 118:131. Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al., (1987) Meth. Enzymol. 138:350. Glycosylation at potential glycosylation sites can be prevented by the use of the compound tunicamycin as described by Duskin et al. , (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257:3105. Tunicamycin blocks the formation of protein-N- glycoside linkages. \n\n\n Hence, aspects of the present disclosure include glycosylation variants of antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 wherein the number and/or type of glycosylation site(s) has been altered compared to the amino acid sequences of the parent polypeptide. In certain embodiments, antibody protein variants comprise a greater or a lesser number of N-linked glycosylation sites than the native antibody. An N- linked glycosylation site is characterized by the sequence: Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, wherein the amino acid residue designated as X can be any amino acid residue except proline. The substitution of amino acid residues to create this sequence provides a potential new site for the addition of an N-linked carbohydrate chain. Alternatively, substitutions that eliminate or alter this sequence will prevent addition of an N-linked carbohydrate chain present in the native polypeptide. For example, the glycosylation can be reduced by the deletion of an Asn or by substituting the Asn with a different amino acid. In other embodiments, one or more new N- linked sites are created. Antibodies typically have a N-linked glycosylation site in the Fc region. \n\n\nLabels and Effector Groups \n\n\n In some embodiments, an antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 comprises one or more labels. The term \"labeling group\" or \"label\" means any detectable label. Examples of suitable labeling groups include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or radionuclides {e.g., \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n35\nS, \n90\nY, \n99\nTc, \nm\nIn, \n125\nI, \n13\n fluorescent groups {e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic groups {e.g., horseradish peroxidase, β-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase), chemiluminescent groups, biotinyl groups, or predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by \n\n a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags). In some embodiments, the labeling group is coupled to the antigen binding protein via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance. Various methods for labeling proteins are known in the art and can be used as is seen fit. \n\n\n The term \"effector group\" means any group coupled to an antigen binding protein that specifically binds one (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 that acts as a cytotoxic agent. Examples for suitable effector groups are radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g., \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n35\nS, \n90\nY, \n99\nTc, \nU1\nln, \n125\nI, \n131\nI). Other suitable groups include toxins, therapeutic groups, or chemotherapeutic groups. Examples of suitable groups include calicheamicin, auristatins, geldanamycin and cantansine. In some embodiments, the effector group is coupled to the antigen binding protein via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance. \n\n\n In general, labels fall into a variety of classes, depending on the assay in which they are to be detected: a) isotopic labels, which can be radioactive or heavy isotopes; b) magnetic labels (e.g., magnetic particles); c) redox active moieties; d) optical dyes; enzymatic groups (e.g. horseradish peroxidase, β-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase); e) biotinylated groups; and f) predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags, etc.). In some embodiments, the labeling group is coupled to the antigen binding protein via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance. Various methods for labeling proteins are known in the art. \n\n\n Specific labels include optical dyes, including, but not limited to, chromophores, phosphors and fluorophores, with the latter being specific in many instances. Fluorophores can be either \"small molecule\" fluores, or proteinaceous fluores. \n\n\n By \"fluorescent label\" is meant any molecule that can be detected via its inherent fluorescent properties. Suitable fluorescent labels include, but are not limited to, fluorescein, rhodamine, tetramethylrhodamine, eosin, erythrosin, coumarin, methyl-coumarins, pyrene, Malacite green, stilbene, Lucifer Yellow, Cascade Blue, Texas Red, IAEDANS, EDANS, BODIPY FL, LC Red 640, Cy 5, Cy 5.5, LC Red 705, Oregon green, the Alexa-Fluor dyes (Alexa Fluor 350, Alexa Fluor 430, Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 546, Alexa Fluor 568, Alexa Fluor 594, Alexa Fluor 633, Alexa Fluor 647, Alexa Fluor 660, Alexa Fluor 680), Cascade Blue, \n\n Cascade Yellow and R-phycoerythrin (PE) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), FITC, Rhodamine, and Texas Red (Pierce, Rockford, IL), Cy5, Cy5.5, Cy7 (Amersham Life Science, Pittsburgh, PA). Suitable optical dyes, including fluorophores, are described in MOLECULAR PROBES HANDBOOK by Richard P. Haugland, hereby expressly incorporated by reference. \n\n\n Suitable proteinaceous fluorescent labels also include, but are not limited to, green fluorescent protein, including a Renilla, Ptilosarcus, or Aequorea species of GFP (Chalfie et al, (1994) Science 263 :802-805), EGFP (Clontech Labs., Inc., Genbank Accession Number U55762), blue fluorescent protein (BFP, Quantum Biotechnologies, Inc., Quebec, Canada; Stauber, (1998) Biotechniques 24:462-471 ; Heim et al, (1996) Curr. Biol. 6: 178-182), enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP, Clontech Labs., Inc.), luciferase (Ichiki et al, (1993) J. Immunol. 150:5408-5417), β galactosidase (Nolan et al, (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:2603-2607) and Renilla (W092/15673, WO95/07463, WO98/14605, W098/26277, WO99/49019, United States Patents No. 5292658, No. 5418155, No. 5683888, No. 5741668, No. 5777079, No. 5804387, No. 5874304, No. 5876995, No. 5925558). \n\n\nPreparing Of Antigen Binding Proteins \n\n\n Non-human antibodies that are provided can be, for example, derived from any antibody- producing animal, such as mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, donkey, or non-human primate (such as monkey {e.g., cynomolgus or rhesus monkey) or ape {e.g., chimpanzee)). Non-human antibodies can be used, for instance, in in vitro cell culture and cell-culture based applications, or any other application where an immune response to the antibody does not occur or is insignificant, can be prevented, is not a concern, or is desired. In certain embodiments, the antibodies can be produced by immunizing with full-length β-Klotho, FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4 (Example 1), with the extracellular domain of β-Klotho, FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4 (Example 2), or two of β-Klotho, FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c and FGFR4 (Example 1), with whole cells expressing FGFRlc, β-Klotho or both FGFRlc and β-Klotho (Example 1 and 3), with membranes prepared from cells expressing FGFRlc, β-Klotho or both FGFRlc and β- Klotho (Example 1 and 3), with fusion proteins, e.g., Fc fusions comprising FGFRlc, β-Klotho or FGFRlc and β-Klotho (or extracellular domains thereof) fused to Fc (Example 2 and 3), and other methods known in the art, e.g., as described in the Examples presented herein. Alternatively, the certain non-human antibodies can be raised by immunizing with amino acids \n\n which are segments of one or more of β-Klotho, FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4 that form part of the epitope to which certain antibodies provided herein bind. The antibodies can be polyclonal, monoclonal, or can be synthesized in host cells by expressing recombinant DNA. \n\n\n Fully human antibodies can be prepared as described above by immunizing transgenic animals containing human immunoglobulin loci or by selecting a phage display library that is expressing a repertoire of human antibodies. \n\n\n The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be produced by a variety of techniques, including conventional monoclonal antibody methodology, e.g., the standard somatic cell hybridization technique of Kohler and Milstein, (1975) Nature 256:495. Alternatively, other techniques for producing monoclonal antibodies can be employed, for example, the viral or oncogenic transformation of B-lymphocytes. One suitable animal system for preparing hybridomas is the murine system, which is a very well established procedure. Immunization protocols and techniques for isolation of immunized splenocytes for fusion are known in the art. For such procedures, B cells from immunized mice are fused with a suitable immortalized fusion partner, such as a murine myeloma cell line. If desired, rats or other mammals besides can be immunized instead of mice and B cells from such animals can be fused with the murine myeloma cell line to form hybridomas. Alternatively, a myeloma cell line from a source other than mouse can be used. Fusion procedures for making hybridomas also are well known. SLAM technology can also be employed in the production of antibodies. \n\n\n The single chain antibodies that are provided can be formed by linking heavy and light chain variable domain (Fv region) fragments via an amino acid bridge (short peptide linker), resulting in a single polypeptide chain. Such single-chain Fvs (scFvs) can be prepared by fusing DNA encoding a peptide linker between DNAs encoding the two variable domain polypeptides (V\nL\n and V\nH\n). The resulting polypeptides can fold back on themselves to form antigen-binding monomers, or they can form multimers (e.g., dimers, trimers, or tetramers), depending on the length of a flexible linker between the two variable domains (Kortt et al., (1997) Prot. Eng. 10:423; Kortt et al, (2001) Biomol. Eng. 18:95-108). By combining different V\nL\n and V\nH\n- comprising polypeptides, one can form multimeric scFvs that bind to different epitopes (Kriangkum et al, (2001) Biomol. Eng. 18:31-40). Techniques developed for the production of single chain antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, (1988) Science 242:423; Huston et al, (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:5879; Ward et al, (1989) Nature \n\n 334:544, de Graaf et al, (2002) Methods Mol Biol. 178:379-387. Single chain antibodies derived from antibodies provided herein include, but are not limited to scFvs comprising the variable domain combinations of the heavy and light chain variable regions depicted in Table 2, or combinations of light and heavy chain variable domains which include CDRs depicted in Tables 3 and 4. \n\n\n Antibodies provided herein that are of one subclass can be changed to antibodies from a different subclass using subclass switching methods. Thus, IgG antibodies can be derived from an IgM antibody, for example, and vice versa. Such techniques allow the preparation of new antibodies that possess the antigen binding properties of a given antibody (the parent antibody), but also exhibit biological properties associated with an antibody isotype or subclass different from that of the parent antibody. Recombinant DNA techniques can be employed. Cloned DNA encoding particular antibody polypeptides can be employed in such procedures, e.g., DNA encoding the constant domain of an antibody of the desired isotype. See, e.g., Lantto et al, (2002) Methods Mol. Biol. 178:303-316. \n\n\n Accordingly, the antibodies that are provided include those comprising, for example, the variable domain combinations described, supra., having a desired isotype (for example, IgA, IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgE, and IgD) as well as Fab or F(ab')\n2\n fragments thereof. Moreover, if an IgG4 is desired, it can also be desired to introduce a point mutation (CPSCP->CPPCP (SEQ ID NOS 380-381, respectively, in order of appearance)) in the hinge region as described in Bloom et al, (1997) Protein Science 6:407, incorporated by reference herein) to alleviate a tendency to form intra-H chain disulfide bonds that can lead to heterogeneity in the IgG4 antibodies. \n\n\n Moreover, techniques for deriving antibodies having different properties {i.e., varying affinities for the antigen to which they bind) are also known. One such technique, referred to as chain shuffling, involves displaying immunoglobulin variable domain gene repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, often referred to as phage display. Chain shuffling has been used to prepare high affinity antibodies to the hapten 2-phenyloxazol-5-one, as described by Marks et al, (1992) BioTechnology 10:779. \n\n\n Conservative modifications can be made to the heavy and light chain variable regions described in Table 2, or the CDRs described in Tables 3A and 3B, 4A and 4B, and Table 6C, infra (and corresponding modifications to the encoding nucleic acids) to produce an antigen \n\n binding protein having functional and biochemical characteristics. Methods for achieving such modifications are described above. \n\n\n Antigen binding proteins that specifically bind one or more of (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 can be further modified in various ways. For example, if they are to be used for therapeutic purposes, they can be conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEGylated) to prolong the serum half-life or to enhance protein delivery. Alternatively, the V region of the subject antibodies or fragments thereof can be fused with the Fc region of a different antibody molecule. The Fc region used for this purpose can be modified so that it does not bind complement, thus reducing the likelihood of inducing cell lysis in the patient when the fusion protein is used as a therapeutic agent. In addition, the subject antibodies or functional fragments thereof can be conjugated with human serum albumin to enhance the serum half-life of the antibody or fragment thereof. Another useful fusion partner for the antigen binding proteins or fragments thereof is transthyretin (TTR). TTR has the capacity to form a tetramer, thus an antibody-TTR fusion protein can form a multivalent antibody which can increase its binding avidity. \n\n\n Alternatively, substantial modifications in the functional and/or biochemical characteristics of the antigen binding proteins described herein can be achieved by creating substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the heavy and light chains that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the molecular backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulkiness of the side chain. A \"conservative amino acid substitution\" can involve a substitution of a native amino acid residue with a nonnative residue that has little or no effect on the polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at that position. See, Table 5, supra. Furthermore, any native residue in the polypeptide can also be substituted with alanine, as has been previously described for alanine scanning mutagenesis. \n\n\n Amino acid substitutions (whether conservative or non-conservative) of the subject antibodies can be implemented by those skilled in the art by applying routine techniques. Amino acid substitutions can be used to identify important residues of the antibodies provided herein, or to increase or decrease the affinity of these antibodies for one or more of (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of \n\n FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 or for modifying the binding affinity of other antigen- binding proteins described herein. \n\n\nMethods of Expressing Antigen Binding Proteins \n\n\n Expression systems and constructs in the form of plasmids, expression vectors, transcription or expression cassettes that comprise at least one polynucleotide as described above are also provided herein, as well host cells comprising such expression systems or constructs. \n\n\n The antigen binding proteins provided herein can be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. For example, antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β- Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 can be produced by recombinant expression systems, using any technique known in the art. See, e.g., Monoclonal Antibodies, Hybridomas: A New Dimension in Biological Analyses, Kennet et al. (eds.) Plenum Press, New York (1980); and Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Lane (eds.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1988). \n\n\n Antigen binding proteins can be expressed in hybridoma cell lines {e.g., in particular antibodies can be expressed in hybridomas) or in cell lines other than hybridomas. Expression constructs encoding the antibodies can be used to transform a mammalian, insect or microbial host cell. Transformation can be performed using any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell, including, for example packaging the polynucleotide in a virus or bacteriophage and transducing a host cell with the construct by transfection procedures known in the art, as exemplified by United States Patent No. 4,399,216; No. 4,912,040; No. 4,740,461; No. 4,959,455. The optimal transformation procedure used will depend upon which type of host cell is being transformed. Methods for introduction of heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, mixing nucleic acid with positively-charged lipids, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei. \n\n\n Recombinant expression constructs typically comprise a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide comprising one or more of the following: one or more CDRs provided herein; a light chain constant region; a light chain variable region; a heavy chain constant region {e.g., \n\n C\nH\nI , C\nH\n and/or C\nH\n3); and/or another scaffold portion of an antigen binding protein. These nucleic acid sequences are inserted into an appropriate expression vector using standard ligation techniques. In one embodiment, the heavy or light chain constant region is appended to the C- terminus of the anti- -Klotho, -FGFRlc, -FGFR2c, -FGFR3c, -FGFR4, or β-Klotho and FGFRlc-specific heavy or light chain variable region and is ligated into an expression vector. The vector is typically selected to be functional in the particular host cell employed (i.e., the vector is compatible with the host cell machinery, permitting amplification and/or expression of the gene can occur). In some embodiments, vectors are used that employ protein-fragment complementation assays using protein reporters, such as dihydrofolate reductase (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,270,964, which is hereby incorporated by reference). Suitable expression vectors can be purchased, for example, from Invitrogen Life Technologies or BD Biosciences (formerly \"Clontech\"). Other useful vectors for cloning and expressing the antibodies and fragments include those described in Bianchi and McGrew, (2003) Biotech. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 84:439-44, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Additional suitable expression vectors are discussed, for example, in Methods Enzymol., vol. 185 (D. V. Goeddel, ed.), 1990, New York: Academic Press. \n\n\n Typically, expression vectors used in any of the host cells will contain sequences for plasmid maintenance and for cloning and expression of exogenous nucleotide sequences. Such sequences, collectively referred to as \"flanking sequences\" in certain embodiments will typically include one or more of the following nucleotide sequences: a promoter, one or more enhancer sequences, an origin of replication, a transcriptional termination sequence, a complete intron sequence containing a donor and acceptor splice site, a sequence encoding a leader sequence for polypeptide secretion, a ribosome binding site, a polyadenylation sequence, a polylinker region for inserting the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide to be expressed, and a selectable marker element. Each of these sequences is discussed below. \n\n\n Optionally, the vector can contain a \"tag\"-encoding sequence, i.e., an oligonucleotide molecule located at the 5' or 3' end of an antigen binding protein coding sequence; the oligonucleotide sequence encodes polyHis (such as hexaHis (SEQ ID NO: 382)), or another \"tag\" such as FLAG, HA (hemaglutinin influenza virus), or myc, for which commercially available antibodies exist. This tag is typically fused to the polypeptide upon expression of the polypeptide, and can serve as a means for affinity purification or detection of the antigen binding \n\n protein from the host cell. Affinity purification can be accomplished, for example, by column chromatography using antibodies against the tag as an affinity matrix. Optionally, the tag can subsequently be removed from the purified antigen binding protein by various means such as using certain peptidases for cleavage. \n\n\n Flanking sequences can be homologous (i.e., from the same species and/or strain as the host cell), heterologous (i.e., from a species other than the host cell species or strain), hybrid (i.e., a combination of flanking sequences from more than one source), synthetic or native. As such, the source of a flanking sequence can be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism, any vertebrate or invertebrate organism, or any plant, provided that the flanking sequence is functional in, and can be activated by, the host cell machinery. \n\n\n Flanking sequences useful in the vectors can be obtained by any of several methods well known in the art. Typically, flanking sequences useful herein will have been previously identified by mapping and/or by restriction endonuclease digestion and can thus be isolated from the proper tissue source using the appropriate restriction endonucleases. In some cases, the full nucleotide sequence of a flanking sequence can be known. Here, the flanking sequence can be synthesized using the methods described herein for nucleic acid synthesis or cloning. \n\n\n Whether all or only a portion of the flanking sequence is known, it can be obtained using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or by screening a genomic library with a suitable probe such as an oligonucleotide and/or flanking sequence fragment from the same or another species. Where the flanking sequence is not known, a fragment of DNA containing a flanking sequence can be isolated from a larger piece of DNA that can contain, for example, a coding sequence or even another gene or genes. Isolation can be accomplished by restriction endonuclease digestion to produce the proper DNA fragment followed by isolation using agarose gel purification, Qiagen\n®\n column chromatography (Chatsworth, CA), or other methods known to the skilled artisan. The selection of suitable enzymes to accomplish this purpose will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n An origin of replication is typically a part of those prokaryotic expression vectors purchased commercially, and the origin aids in the amplification of the vector in a host cell. If the vector of choice does not contain an origin of replication site, one can be chemically synthesized based on a known sequence, and ligated into the vector. For example, the origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) is suitable for most \n\n gram-negative bacteria, and various viral origins (e.g., SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, vesicular stomatitus virus (VSV), or papillomaviruses such as HPV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (for example, the SV40 origin is often used only because it also contains the virus early promoter). \n\n\n A transcription termination sequence is typically located 3' to the end of a polypeptide coding region and serves to terminate transcription. Usually, a transcription termination sequence in prokaryotic cells is a G-C rich fragment followed by a poly-T sequence. While the sequence is easily cloned from a library or even purchased commercially as part of a vector, it can also be readily synthesized using methods for nucleic acid synthesis such as those described herein. \n\n\n A selectable marker gene encodes a protein necessary for the survival and growth of a host cell grown in a selective culture medium. Typical selection marker genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, tetracycline, or kanamycin for prokaryotic host cells; (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies of the cell; or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex or defined media. Specific selectable markers are the kanamycin resistance gene, the ampicillin resistance gene, and the tetracycline resistance gene. Advantageously, a neomycin resistance gene can also be used for selection in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells. \n\n\n Other selectable genes can be used to amplify the gene that will be expressed.\n\n\nAmplification is the process wherein genes that are required for production of a protein critical for growth or cell survival are reiterated in tandem within the chromosomes of successive generations of recombinant cells. Examples of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells include dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and promoterless thymidine kinase genes. Mammalian cell transformants are placed under selection pressure wherein only the transformants are uniquely adapted to survive by virtue of the selectable gene present in the vector. Selection pressure is imposed by culturing the transformed cells under conditions in which the concentration of selection agent in the medium is successively increased, thereby leading to the amplification of both the selectable gene and the DNA that encodes another gene, such as an antigen binding protein that binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. As a \n\n result, increased quantities of a polypeptide such as an antigen binding protein are synthesized from the amplified DNA. \n\n\n A ribosome -binding site is usually necessary for translation initiation of mRNA and is characterized by a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (prokaryotes) or a Kozak sequence (eukaryotes). The element is typically located 3' to the promoter and 5' to the coding sequence of the polypeptide to be expressed. \n\n\n In some cases, such as where glycosylation is desired in a eukaryotic host cell expression system, one can manipulate the various pre- or pro-sequences to improve glycosylation or yield.\n\n\nFor example, one can alter the peptidase cleavage site of a particular signal peptide, or add prosequences, which also can affect glycosylation. The final protein product can have, in the -1 position (relative to the first amino acid of the mature protein), one or more additional amino acids incident to expression, which may not have been totally removed. For example, the final protein product can have one or two amino acid residues found in the peptidase cleavage site, attached to the amino-terminus. Alternatively, use of some enzyme cleavage sites can result in a slightly truncated form of the desired polypeptide, if the enzyme cuts at such area within the mature polypeptide. \n\n\n Expression and cloning will typically contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and operably linked to the molecule encoding an antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. Promoters are untranscribed sequences located upstream (i.e., 5') to the start codon of a structural gene (generally within about 100 to 1000 bp) that control transcription of the structural gene. Promoters are conventionally grouped into one of two classes: inducible promoters and constitutive promoters. Inducible promoters initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA under their control in response to some change in culture conditions, such as the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature. Constitutive promoters, on the other hand, uniformly transcribe a gene to which they are operably linked, that is, with little or no control over gene expression. A large number of promoters, recognized by a variety of potential host cells, are well known. A suitable promoter is operably linked to the DNA encoding heavy chain or light chain comprising an antigen binding protein by removing the promoter from the source \n\n DNA by restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the desired promoter sequence into the vector. \n\n\n Suitable promoters for use with yeast hosts are also well known in the art. Yeast enhancers are advantageously used with yeast promoters. Suitable promoters for use with mammalian host cells are well known and include, but are not limited to, those obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, retroviruses, hepatitis-B virus, and Simian Virus 40 (SV40). Other suitable mammalian promoters include heterologous mammalian promoters, for example, heat-shock promoters and the actin promoter. \n\n\n Additional promoters which can be of interest include, but are not limited to: SV40 early promoter (Benoist and Chambon, (1981) Nature 290:304-310); CMV promoter (Thornsen et al, (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. U.S.A. 8J_:659-663); the promoter contained in the 3' long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto et al, (1980) Cell 22:787-797); herpes thymidine kinase promoter (Wagner et al, (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78: 1444-1445); promoter and regulatory sequences from the metallothionine gene (Prinster et al, (1982) Nature 296:39- 42); and prokaryotic promoters such as the beta-lactamase promoter (Villa-Kamaroff et al., (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75:3727-3731); or the tac promoter (DeBoer et al, (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:21-25). Also of interest are the following animal transcriptional control regions, which exhibit tissue specificity and have been utilized in transgenic animals: the elastase I gene control region that is active in pancreatic acinar cells (Swift et al, (1984) Cell 38:639-646; Ornitz et al, (1986) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 50:399-409; MacDonald, (1987) Hepatology 7:425-515); the insulin gene control region that is active in pancreatic beta cells (Hanahan, (1985) Nature 315: 115-122); the immunoglobulin gene control region that is active in lymphoid cells (Grosschedl et al, (1984) Cell 38:647-658; Adames et al, (1985) Nature 318:533-538; Alexander et al, (1987) Mol. Cell. Biol. 7: 1436-1444); the mouse mammary tumor virus control region that is active in testicular, breast, lymphoid and mast cells (Leder et al, (1986) Cell 45:485-495); the albumin gene control region that is active in liver (Pinkert et al, (1987) Genes and Devel. \\ :268-276); the alpha-feto-protein gene control region that is active in liver (Krumlauf et al, (1985) Mol. Cell. Biol. 5: 1639-1648; Hammer et al, (1987) Science 253:53-58); the alpha 1-antitrypsin gene control region that is active in liver (Kelsey et al, (1987) Genes and Devel.1: 161-171); the beta-globin gene control region that is \n\n active in myeloid cells (Mogram et al, (1985) Nature 315:338-340; Kollias et al, (1986) Cell 46:89-94); the myelin basic protein gene control region that is active in oligodendrocyte cells in the brain (Readhead et al, (1987) Cell 48:703-712); the myosin light chain-2 gene control region that is active in skeletal muscle (Sani, (1985) Nature 314:283-286); and the gonadotropic releasing hormone gene control region that is active in the hypothalamus (Mason et al, (1986) Science 234: 1372-1378). \n\n\n An enhancer sequence can be inserted into the vector to increase transcription of DNA encoding light chain or heavy chain comprising an antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 by higher eukaryotes, e.g., a human antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about 10-300 bp in length, that act on the promoter to increase transcription. Enhancers are relatively orientation and position independent, having been found at positions both 5' and 3' to the transcription unit. Several enhancer sequences available from mammalian genes are known (e.g., globin, elastase, albumin, alpha-feto-protein and insulin). Typically, however, an enhancer from a virus is used. The SV40 enhancer, the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer, and adenovirus enhancers known in the art are exemplary enhancing elements for the activation of eukaryotic promoters. While an enhancer can be positioned in the vector either 5' or 3' to a coding sequence, it is typically located at a site 5 ' from the promoter. A sequence encoding an appropriate native or heterologous signal sequence (leader sequence or signal peptide) can be incorporated into an expression vector, to promote extracellular secretion of the antibody. The choice of signal peptide or leader depends on the type of host cells in which the antibody is to be produced, and a heterologous signal sequence can replace the native signal sequence. Examples of signal peptides that are functional in mammalian host cells include the following: the signal sequence for interleukin-7 (IL-7) described in US Patent No. 4,965,195; the signal sequence for interleukin-2 receptor described in Cosman et al, (1984) Nature 312:768; the interleukin-4 receptor signal peptide described in EP Patent No. 0367 566; the type I interleukin-1 receptor signal peptide described in U.S. Patent No. 4,968,607; the type II interleukin-1 receptor signal peptide described in EP Patent No. 0 460 846. \n\n The expression vectors that are provided can be constructed from a starting vector such as a commercially available vector. Such vectors can but need not contain all of the desired flanking sequences. Where one or more of the flanking sequences described herein are not already present in the vector, they can be individually obtained and ligated into the vector. Methods used for obtaining each of the flanking sequences are well known to one skilled in the art. \n\n\n After the vector has been constructed and a nucleic acid molecule encoding light chain, a heavy chain, or a light chain and a heavy chain comprising an antigen binding protein that specifically binds (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 has been inserted into the proper site of the vector, the completed vector can be inserted into a suitable host cell for amplification and/or polypeptide expression. The transformation of an expression vector for an antigen binding protein into a selected host cell can be accomplished by well known methods including transfection, infection, calcium phosphate co-precipitation, electroporation, microinjection, lipofection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, or other known techniques. The method selected will in part be a function of the type of host cell to be used. These methods and other suitable methods are well known to the skilled artisan, and are set forth, for example, in Sambrook et ah, (2001), supra. \n\n\n A host cell, when cultured under appropriate conditions, synthesizes an antigen binding protein that can subsequently be collected from the culture medium (if the host cell secretes it into the medium) or directly from the host cell producing it (if it is not secreted). The selection of an appropriate host cell will depend upon various factors, such as desired expression levels, polypeptide modifications that are desirable or necessary for activity (such as glycosylation or phosphorylation) and ease of folding into a biologically active molecule. \n\n\n Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells {e.g., Hep G2), and a number of other cell lines. In certain embodiments, cell lines can be selected through determining which cell lines have high expression levels and constitutively produce antigen binding proteins with desirable binding properties {e.g., the ability to bind (i) β- \n\n Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4). In another embodiment, a cell line from the B cell lineage that does not make its own antibody but has a capacity to make and secrete a heterologous antibody can be selected. The ability to induce FGF21-like signaling can also form a selection criterion. \n\n\nUses of Antigen Binding Proteins for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Purposes \n\n\n The antigen binding proteins disclosed herein are useful for detecting (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 in biological samples and identification of cells or tissues that produce one or more of (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. For instance, the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein can be used in diagnostic assays, e.g., binding assays to detect and/or quantify (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 expressed in a tissue or cell. Antigen binding proteins that specifically bind to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 can be used in treatment of diseases related to FGF21- like signaling in a patient in need thereof, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, NASH, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. By forming a signaling complex comprising an antigen binding protein, and (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4, the natural in vivo activity of FGF21, which associates with FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, FGFR4 and β- Klotho in vivo to initiate signaling, can be mimicked and/or enchanced, leading to therapeutic effects. \n\n\nIndications \n\n\n A disease or condition associated with human FGF21 includes any disease or condition whose onset in a patient is caused by, at least in part, the induction of FGF21-like signaling, which is initiated in vivo by the formation of a complex comprising FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c \n\n or FGFR4 and β-Klotho and FGF21. The severity of the disease or condition can also be decreased by the induction of FGF21-like signaling. Examples of diseases and conditions that can be treated with the antigen binding proteins include type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, NASH, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. \n\n\n The antigen binding proteins described herein can be used to treat type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, NASH, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome, or can be employed as a prophylactic treatment administered, e.g., daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, bimonthly, biannually, etc to prevent or reduce the frequency and/or severity of symptoms, e.g., elevated plasma glucose levels, elevated triglycerides and cholesterol levels, thereby providing an improved glycemic and cardiovascular risk factor profile. \n\n\nDiagnostic Methods \n\n\n The antigen binding proteins described herein can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect, diagnose, or monitor diseases and/or conditions associated with FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, FGFR4, β-Klotho, FGF21 or combinations thereof. Also provided are methods for the detection of the presence of (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 in a sample using classical immunohistological methods known to those of skill in the art {e.g., Tijssen, 1993, Practice and Theory of Enzyme Immunoassays, Vol 15 (Eds R.H. Burdon and P.H. van Knippenberg, Elsevier, Amsterdam); Zola, (1987) Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques, pp. 147-158 (CRC Press, Inc.); Jalkanen et al, (1985) J. Cell. Biol. 101 :976-985; Jalkanen et al, (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105:3087-3096). The detection of (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 can be performed in vivo or in vitro. \n\n\n Diagnostic applications provided herein include use of the antigen binding proteins to detect expression of (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 and/or binding to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. Examples of methods useful in the detection of the presence of (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a \n\n complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). \n\n\n For diagnostic applications, the antigen binding protein typically will be labeled with a detectable labeling group. Suitable labeling groups include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g., \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n35\nS, \n90\nY, \n99\nTc, \nm\nIn, \n125\nI, \n131\nI), fluorescent groups (e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic groups (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, β-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase), chemiluminescent groups, biotinyl groups, or predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g. , leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags). In some embodiments, the labeling group is coupled to the antigen binding protein via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance. Various methods for labeling proteins are known in the art and can be used. \n\n\n In another aspect, an antigen binding protein can be used to identify a cell or cells that express (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. In a specific embodiment, the antigen binding protein is labeled with a labeling group and the binding of the labeled antigen binding protein to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 is detected. In a further specific embodiment, the binding of the antigen binding protein to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 detected in vivo. In a further specific embodiment, the antigen binding protein is isolated and measured using techniques known in the art. See, for example, Harlow and Lane, (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, New York: Cold Spring Harbor (ed. 1991 and periodic supplements); John E. Coligan, ed., (1993) Current Protocols In Immunology New York: John Wiley & Sons. \n\n\n Another aspect provides for detecting the presence of a test molecule that competes for binding to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 with the antigen binding proteins provided, as disclosed herein. An example of one such assay could involve detecting the amount of free antigen binding protein in a solution containing an amount of one or \n\n more of (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 in the presence or absence of the test molecule. An increase in the amount of free antigen binding protein (i.e., the antigen binding protein not bound to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4) would indicate that the test molecule is capable of competing for binding to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 with the antigen binding protein. In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein is labeled with a labeling group. Alternatively, the test molecule is labeled and the amount of free test molecule is monitored in the presence and absence of an antigen binding protein. \n\n\nMethods of Treatment: Pharmaceutical Formulations and Routes of Administration \n\n\n Methods of using the antigen binding proteins are also provided. In some methods, an antigen binding protein is provided to a patient. The antigen binding protein induces FGF21-like signaling. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a therapeutically effective amount of one or a plurality of the antigen binding proteins and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, solubilizer, emulsifier, preservative, and/or adjuvant are also provided. In addition, methods of treating a patient by administering such pharmaceutical composition are included. The term \"patient\" includes human patients. \n\n\n Acceptable formulation materials are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. In specific embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of human antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β- Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 are provided. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, acceptable formulation materials preferably are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can contain formulation materials for modifying, maintaining or preserving, for example, the pH, osmolarity, viscosity, clarity, color, isotonicity, odor, sterility, stability, rate of dissolution or release, adsorption or penetration of the composition. In such \n\n embodiments, suitable formulation materials include, but are not limited to, amino acids (such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine); antimicrobials; antioxidants (such as ascorbic acid, sodium sulfite or sodium hydrogen-sulfite); buffers (such as borate, bicarbonate, Tris-HCl, citrates, phosphates or other organic acids); bulking agents (such as mannitol or glycine); chelating agents (such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)); complexing agents (such as caffeine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, beta-cyclodextrin or hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin); fillers; monosaccharides; disaccharides; and other carbohydrates (such as glucose, mannose or dextrins); proteins (such as serum albumin, gelatin or immunoglobulins); coloring, flavoring and diluting agents; emulsifying agents; hydrophilic polymers (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone); low molecular weight polypeptides; salt- forming counterions (such as sodium); preservatives (such as benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, thimerosal, phenethyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, chlorhexidine, sorbic acid or hydrogen peroxide); solvents (such as glycerin, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol); sugar alcohols (such as mannitol or sorbitol); suspending agents; surfactants or wetting agents (such as Pluronics, PEG, sorbitan esters, polysorbates such as polysorbate 20, polysorbate, triton, tromethamine, lecithin, cholesterol, tyloxapal); stability enhancing agents (such as sucrose or sorbitol); tonicity enhancing agents (such as alkali metal halides, preferably sodium or potassium chloride, mannitol sorbitol); delivery vehicles; diluents; excipients and/or pharmaceutical adjuvants. See, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, (A.R. Gennaro, ed.), 1990, Mack Publishing Company. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the optimal pharmaceutical composition will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon, for example, the intended route of administration, delivery format and desired dosage. See, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra. In certain embodiments, such compositions can influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo clearance of the antigen binding proteins disclosed. In certain embodiments, the primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical composition can be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. For example, a suitable vehicle or carrier can be water for injection, physiological saline solution or artificial cerebrospinal fluid, possibly supplemented with other materials common in compositions for parenteral administration. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. In specific embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer of about pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate \n\n buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, and can further include sorbitol or a suitable substitute. In certain embodiments, compositions comprising antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β- Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 can be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra) in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. Further, in certain embodiments, antigen binding protein that bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 can be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose. \n\n\n The pharmaceutical compositions can be selected for parenteral delivery. Alternatively, the compositions can be selected for inhalation or for delivery through the digestive tract, such as orally. Preparation of such pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is within the skill of the art. \n\n\n The formulation components are present preferably in concentrations that are acceptable to the site of administration. In certain embodiments, buffers are used to maintain the composition at physiological pH or at a slightly lower pH, typically within a pH range of from about 5 to about 8. \n\n\n When parenteral administration is contemplated, the therapeutic compositions can be provided in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution comprising the desired antigen binding protein in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which the antigen binding protein is formulated as a sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved. In certain embodiments, the preparation can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (such as polylactic acid or polyglycolic acid), beads or liposomes, that can provide controlled or sustained release of the product which can be delivered via depot injection. In certain embodiments, hyaluronic acid can also be used, which can have the effect of promoting sustained duration in the circulation. In certain embodiments, implantable drug delivery devices can be used to introduce the desired antigen binding protein. \n\n Certain pharmaceutical compositions are formulated for inhalation. In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins that bind to (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 are formulated as a dry, inhalable powder. In specific embodiments, antigen binding protein inhalation solutions can also be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In certain embodiments, solutions can be nebulized. Pulmonary administration and formulation methods therefore are further described in International Patent Application No. PCT/US94/001875, which is incorporated by reference and describes pulmonary delivery of chemically modified proteins. Some formulations can be administered orally. Antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 that are administered in this fashion can be formulated with or without carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. In certain embodiments, a capsule can be designed to release the active portion of the formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic degradation is minimized. Additional agents can be included to facilitate absorption of an antigen binding protein. Diluents, flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants, suspending agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and binders can also be employed. \n\n\n Some pharmaceutical compositions comprise an effective quantity of one or a plurality of human antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 in a mixture with non-toxic excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. By dissolving the tablets in sterile water, or another appropriate vehicle, solutions can be prepared in unit-dose form. Suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, lactose, or calcium phosphate; or binding agents, such as starch, gelatin, or acacia; or lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc. \n\n\n Additional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art, including formulations involving antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 in sustained- or controlled-delivery formulations. \n\n Techniques for formulating a variety of other sustained- or controlled-delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible microparticles or porous beads and depot injections, are also known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, International Patent Application No. PCT/US93/00829, which is incorporated by reference and describes controlled release of porous polymeric microparticles for delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. Sustained-release preparations can include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices can include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,773,919 and European Patent Application Publication No. EP 058481, each of which is incorporated by reference), copolymers of L- glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al, 1983, Biopolymers 2:547-556), poly (2-hydroxyethyl-inethacrylate) (Langer et al, 1981, J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 15: 167-277 and Langer, 1982, Chem. Tech. 12:98-105), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al, 1981, supra) or poly-D(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (European Patent Application Publication No. EP 133,988). Sustained release compositions can also include liposomes that can be prepared by any of several methods known in the art. See, e.g., Eppstein et al, 1985, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82:3688- 3692; European Patent Application Publication Nos. EP 036,676; EP 088,046 and EP 143,949, incorporated by reference. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical compositions used for in vivo administration are typically provided as sterile preparations. Sterilization can be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. When the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using this method can be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. Compositions for parenteral administration can be stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. Parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, cells expressing a recombinant antigen binding protein as disclosed herein is encapsulated for delivery (see, Invest. Ophthalmol Vis Sci (2002) 43:3292- 3298 and Proc. Natl. Acad. Sciences USA (2006) 103:3896-3901). \n\n\n In certain formulations, an antigen binding protein has a concentration of at least 10 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml, 30 mg/ml, 40 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, 60 mg/ml, 70 mg/ml, 80 mg/ml, 90 mg/ml, 100 mg/ ml or 150 mg/ml. Some formulations contain a buffer, sucrose and polysorbate. An example of a formulation is one containing 50-100 mg/ml of antigen binding protein, 5-20 mM \n\n sodium acetate, 5-10% w/v sucrose, and 0.002 - 0.008% w/v polysorbate. Certain, formulations, for instance, contain 65-75 mg/ml of an antigen binding protein in 9-1 1 mM sodium acetate buffer, 8-10%) w/v sucrose, and 0.005-0.006%) w/v polysorbate. The pH of certain such formulations is in the range of 4.5-6. Other formulations have a pH of 5.0-5.5 (e.g., pH of 5.0, 5.2 or 5.4). \n\n\n Once the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it can be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, crystal, or as a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. Such formulations can be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form (e.g. , lyophilized) that is reconstituted prior to administration. Kits for producing a single-dose administration unit are also provided. Certain kits contain a first container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation. In certain embodiments, kits containing single and multi- chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes) are provided. The therapeutically effective amount of an antigen binding protein-containing pharmaceutical composition to be employed will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment will vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which the antigen binding protein is being used, the route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface or organ size) and/or condition (the age and general health) of the patient. In certain embodiments, the clinician can titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. \n\n\n A typical dosage can range from about 1 μg/kg to up to about 30 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In specific embodiments, the dosage can range from 10 μg/kg up to about 30 mg/kg, optionally from 0.1 mg/kg up to about 30 mg/kg, alternatively from 0.3 mg/kg up to about 20 mg/kg. In some applications, the dosage is from 0.5 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. In some instances, an antigen binding protein is dosed at 0.3 mg/kg, 0.5mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 20 mg/kg. The dosage schedule in some treatment regimes is at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg qW, 0.5mg/kg qW, 1 mg/kg qW, 3 mg/kg qW, 10 mg/kg qW, or 20 mg/kg qW. \n\n\n Dosing frequency will depend upon the pharmacokinetic parameters of the particular antigen binding protein in the formulation used. Typically, a clinician administers the composition until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The composition can therefore be administered as a single dose, or as two or more doses (which can but need not \n\n contain the same amount of the desired molecule) over time, or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or catheter. Appropriate dosages can be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data. In certain embodiments, the antigen binding proteins can be administered to patients throughout an extended time period. Chronic administration of an antigen binding protein minimizes the adverse immune or allergic response commonly associated with antigen binding proteins that are not fully human, for example an antibody raised against a human antigen in a non-human animal, for example, a non-fully human antibody or non-human antibody produced in a non-human species. \n\n\n The route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known methods, e.g., orally, through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intra- parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, intra-ocular, intraarterial, intraportal, or intralesional routes; by sustained release systems or by implantation devices. In certain embodiments, the compositions can be administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation device. \n\n\n The composition also can be administered locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge or another appropriate material onto which the desired molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. In certain embodiments, where an implantation device is used, the device can be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of the desired molecule can be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration. \n\n\n It also can be desirable to use antigen binding protein pharmaceutical compositions ex vivo. In such instances, cells, tissues or organs that have been removed from the patient are exposed to antigen binding protein pharmaceutical compositions after which the cells, tissues and/or organs are subsequently implanted back into the patient. \n\n\n In particular, antigen binding proteins that specifically bind (i) β-Klotho; (ii) FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4; or (iii) a complex comprising β-Klotho and one of FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 can be delivered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically engineered, using methods such as those described herein, to express and secrete the polypeptide. In certain embodiments, such cells can be animal or human cells, and can be autologous, heterologous, or xenogeneic. In certain embodiments, the cells can be immortalized. In other embodiments, in order to decrease the chance of an immunological response, the cells can be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. In further embodiments, the \n\n encapsulation materials are typically biocompatible, semi-permeable polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the release of the protein product(s) but prevent the destruction of the cells by the patient's immune system or by other detrimental factors from the surrounding tissues. Combination Therapies \n\n\n In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a method of treating a subject for diabetes with a therapeutic antigen binding protein of the present disclosure, such as the fully human therapeutic antibodies described herein, together with one or more other treatments. In one embodiment, such a combination therapy achieves an additive or synergistic effect. The antigen binding proteins can be administered in combination with one or more of the type 2 diabetes or obesity treatments currently available. These treatments for diabetes include biguanide (metaformin), and sulfonylureas (such as glyburide, glipizide). Additional treatments directed at maintaining glucose homeostasis include PPAR gamma agonists (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone); glinides (meglitinide, repaglinide, and nateglinide); DPP-4 inhibitors (Januvia® and Onglyza®) and alpha glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, voglibose). \n\n\n Additional combination treatments for diabetes include injectable treatments such as insulin and incretin mimetics (Byetta®, Exenatide®), other GLP-1 (glucagon- like peptide) analogs such as liraglutide, other GLP-1 R agonists and Symlin® (pramlintide). \n\n\n Additional combination treatments directed at weight loss include Meridia® and Xenical®. \n\n\nEXAMPLES \n\n\n The following examples, including the experiments conducted and the results achieved, are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 1 \n\n\n PREPARATION OF FGFRlc OVER EXPRESSING CELLS FOR USE AS AN \n\n\n ANTIGEN \n\n\n Nucleic acid sequences encoding the full length human FGFRlc polypepetide (SEQ ID NO:4; Figures 1A-1B) and a separate sequence encoding the full length human β-Klotho polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:7; Figures 2A-2C) were subcloned into suitable mammalian cell \n\n expression vectors (e.g., pcDNA3.1 Zeo, pcDNA3.1 Hyg (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or pDSRoc20. The pDSRa20 vector contains SV40 early promoter/enhancer for expressing the gene of interest and a mouse DHFR expression cassette for selection in CHO DHFR (-) host cells such as AMI CHO (a derivative of DG44, CHO DHFR (-)). \n\n\n AM-1 CHO cells were seeded at 1.5 xlO\n6\n cells per 100mm dish. After 24 hours, the cells were co-transfected with linearized DNAs of pDSRa20/huFGFRlc and pDSRa20/hu -Klotho with FuGene6 (Roche Applied Science). The transfected cells were trypsinized 2 days after transfection and seeded into CHO DHFR selective growth medium containing 10% dialyzed FBS and without hypoxanthine/thymidine supplement. After 2 weeks, the resulting transfected colonies were trypsinized and pooled. \n\n\n HEK293T cells were transfected with the full length huFGFRlc and Ιηιβ-Κΐοίΐιο in pcDNA3.1 series or pTT14 (an expression vector developed by Durocher, NRCC, with CMV promoter and EBV ori, similar to pTT5 and a puromycin selection marker) based vector and selected with the corresponding drugs following similar procedure as for the CHO transfection and selection. \n\n\n The FGF21R (i.e., FGFRlc and βΚΙοώο) transfected AMI CHO or 293T cell pools were sorted repeatedly using Alexa 647-labeled FGF21. As a cell-surface staining reagent, FGF21 was labeled with Alexa 647-NHS followed the method recommended by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Inc. Cat A 2006). The Alexa 647-labeled FGF21 showed specific staining of FGF21R receptor expressing cells and not the non-transfected parental cells (Figure 3). High expressing cells were collected at the end of the final sorting, expanded and frozen into vials. The AM-l/huFGF21R cells were prepared for immunization and the 293T/huFGF21R cells were used for titering mouse sera by FACS after immunization and in binding screens of the hybridoma supernatants by FMAT (see Example 4). \n\n\nEXAMPLE 2 \n\n\n PREPARATION OF A SOLUBLE FGFRlc/B-KLOTHO COMPLEX \n\n\n FOR USE AS ANTIGEN \n\n\n Soluble FGF21 receptor constructs were generated in pTT14 or pcDNA3.1 expression vectors. The FGFRlc ECD-Fc construct (SEQ ID NO:362, Figure 4) comprises the N-terminal extracelluar domain of FGFRlc (amino acid residues #1 - 374; SEQ ID NO:5) fused to Fc (SEQ \n\n ID NO:384). The β-Klotho ECD-Fc construct (SEQ ID NO:363, Figure 5) comprises the N- terminal extracellular domain of β-Klotho (amino acid residues #1-996; SEQ ID NO: 8) fused to Fc (SEQ ID NO:384). \n\n\n HEK293 cells (293F, Invitrogen) were transfected with huFGFRlc ECD-Fc/pTT5, Ιηιβ- Klotho ECD-Fc/pTT14-puro and dGFP/pcDNA3.1-Neo and selected in the presence of the corresponding drugs followed by repeated FACS sorting based on dGFP expression. Cells were grown in serum-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with nonessential amino acids in HyperFlasks (Corning) for 4 days and conditioned media (CM) harvested for purification. \n\n\n The 293 CM was concentrated 6 fold and applied to Protein A FF equilibrated in PBS.\n\n\nThe protein was eluted with Pierce Gentle Ag/Ab elution buffer. The Protein A pool was dialyzed against 20mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, lOmM NaCl and applied to SP HP at pH 7.0. The FGFRlc ECD-Fc was present in the flow-through (FT) and the heterodimer was eluted with linear gradient of 0- 0.4 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0. N-terminus amino acid sequencing verified the purified soluble FGF21R to be a heterodimer composed of (1 : 1) ratio of FGFRlc ECD-Fc and β-Klotho ECD-Fc. The purified soluble FGF21R-Fc (Figure 6) was used as the antigen for immunization. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 3 \n\n\n PREPARATION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES \n\n\n Immunizations were conducted using one or more suitable forms of FGF21 receptor antigen, including: (1) cell bound receptor of CHO transfectants expressing full length human FGFRlc and β-Klotho at the cell surface, obtained by transfecting CHO cells with cDNA encoding a human full length FGFRlc polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4 (see also Figuresla-b) and cDNA encoding a human β-Klotho polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 7 (see also Figures 2a-c); (2) membrane extract from the aforementioned cells expressing the FGF21R receptor complex; or (3) soluble FGF21R receptor obtainable by co-expressing the N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) of FGFRlc (SEQ ID NO:5; see also Figure 4) and the N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) of β-Klotho (SEQ ID NO:8; see also Figure 5) or (4) combinations thereof. \n\n\n A suitable amount of immunogen (i.e., 10 μgs/mouse of soluble FGF21R or 3 - 4 x 10\n6\n cells/mouse of stably transfected CHO cells or 150 μgs/mouse of purified FGF21R membranes \n\n prepared from CHO cells stably expressing FGF21R) was used for initial immunization in XenoMouse™ according to the methods disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/759,620, filed December 3, 1996 and International Patent Application Nos. WO 98/24893, and WO 00/76310, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Following the initial immunization, subsequent boost immunizations of immunogen (5 μg/mouse of soluble FGF21R or 1.7 x 10\n6\n FGF21R transfected cells/mouse or 75 μgs of purified FGF21R membranes) were administered on a schedule and for the duration necessary to induce a suitable anti-FGF21R titer in the mice. Titers were determined by a suitable method, for example, by enzyme immunoassay, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), or by other methods (including combinations of enzyme immunoassays and FACS). \n\n\n Animals exhibiting suitable titers were identified, and lymphocytes were obtained from draining lymph nodes and, if necessary, pooled for each cohort. Lymphocytes were dissociated from lymphoid tissue by grinding in a suitable medium (for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium; DMEM; obtainable from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to release the cells from the tissues, and suspended in DMEM. B cells were selected and/or expanded using standard methods, and fused with suitable fusion partner, for example, nonsecretory myeloma P3X63Ag8.653 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL 1580; Kearney et al, J. Immunol. 123, 1979, 1548-1550), using techniques that were known in the art. \n\n\n In one suitable fusion method, lymphocytes were mixed with fusion partner cells at a ratio of 1 :4. The cell mixture was gently pelleted by centrifugation at 400 x g for 4 minutes, the supernatant decanted, and the cell mixture gently mixed (for example, by using a 1 ml pipette). Fusion was induced with PEG/DMSO (polyethylene glycol/dimethyl sulfoxide; obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO; 1 ml per million of lymphocytes). PEG/DMSO was slowly added with gentle agitation over one minute followed, by one minute of mixing. IDMEM (DMEM without glutamine; 2 ml per million of B cells), was then added over 2 minutes with gentle agitation, followed by additional IDMEM (8 ml per million B-cells) which was added over 3 minutes. \n\n\n The fused cells were pelleted (400 x g 6 minutes) and resuspended in 20 ml Selection media (for example, DMEM containing Azaserine and Hypoxanthine [HA] and other supplemental materials as necessary) per million B-cells. Cells were incubated for 20-30 \n\n minutes at 37°C and then resuspended in 200 ml selection media and cultured for three to four days in T 175 flasks prior to 96 well plating. \n\n\n Cells were distributed into 96-well plates using standard techniques to maximize clonality of the resulting colonies. After several days of culture, supernatants were collected and subjected to screening assays as detailed in the examples below, including confirmation of binding to human FGF21 receptor, specificity and/or cross-species reactivity. Positive cells were further selected and subjected to standard cloning and subcloning techniques. Clonal lines were expanded in vitro, and the secreted human antibodies obtained for analysis. \n\n\n In this manner, mice were immunized with either cells or membranes expressing full length FGF21R cells, or soluble FGF21R extracellular domain, with a range of 11-17 immunizations over a period of approximately one to three and one-half months. Several cell lines secreting FGF21R- specific antibodies were obtained, and the antibodies were further characterized. The sequences thereof are presented herein and in the Sequence Listing, and results of various tests using these antibodies are provided. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 4 \n\n\n SELECTION OF BINDING ANTIBODIES BY FMAT \n\n\n After 14 days of culture, hybridoma supernatants were screened for FGF21R-specific monoclonal antibodies by Fluorometric Microvolume Assay Technology (FMAT) by screening against either the CHO AMl/huFGF21R cell line or recombinant HEK293 cells that were transfected with human FGF21R and counter-screening against parental CHO or HEK293 cells. Briefly the cells in Freestyle media (Invitrogen) were seeded into 384-well FMAT plates in a volume of 50 μΤΛνεΙΙ at a density of 4,000 cells/well for the stable transfectants, and at a density of 16,000 cells/well for the parental cells, and cells were incubated overnight at 37°C. 10 μίΛνεΙΙ of supernatant was then added, and the plates were incubated for approximately one hour at 4°C, after which 10 μίΛνεΙΙ of anti-human IgG-Cy5 secondary antibody was added at a concentration of 2.8 μg/ml (400ng/ml final concentration). Plates were then incubated for one hour at 4°C, and fluorescence was read using an FMAT Cellular Detection System (Applied Biosystems). \n\n In total, over 3,000 hybridoma supernatants were identified as binding to the FGF21 receptor expressing cells but not to parental cells by the FMAT method. These supernatants were then tested in the FGF21 functional assays as described below. EXAMPLE 5 \n\n\n SELECTION OF ANTIBODIES THAT INDUCE FGF21-LIKE SIGNALING \n\n\n Experiments were performed to identify functional antibodies that mimic wild-type FGF21 activity (e.g., the ability to induce FGF21-like signaling) using a suitable FGF21 reporter assay. The disclosed FGF21 reporter assay measures activation of FGFR signaling via a MAPK pathway readout. β-Klotho is a co-receptor for FGF21 signaling, and although it is believed not to have any inherent signaling capability due to its very short cytoplasmic domain, it is required for FGF21 to induce signaling through FGFRs. \n\n\nExample 5.1 \n\n\n ELK-Luciferase Reporter Assay \n\n\n ELK-luciferase assays were performed using a recombinant human 293T kidney cell or CHO cell system. Specifically, the host cells were engineered to over-express β-Klotho and luciferase reporter constructs. The reporter constructs contain sequences encoding GAL4-ELK1 and 5xUAS-Luc, a luciferase reporter driven by a promoter containing five tandem copies of the Gal4 binding site. Activation of the FGF21 receptor complex in these recombinant reporter cell lines induces intracellular signal transduction, which in turn leads to ERK and ELK phosphorylation. Luciferase activity is regulated by the level of phosphorylated ELK, and is used to indirectly monitor and quantify FGF21 activity. \n\n\n In one example, CHO cells were transfected sequentially using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the receptor constructs expressing β-Klotho, FGFRlc and the reporter plasmids: 5x Gal4-Luciferase (minimal TK promoter with 5xGal4 binding sites upstream of luciferase) and Gal4-ELK1. Gal4- ELK1 binds to the Gal4 binding sites and activates transcription when it is phosphorylated by ERK. Luciferase transcription, and thereby the corresponding enzymatic activity in this context is regulated by the level of phosphorylated ELK1 , and is used to indirectly monitor and quantify FGF21 activity. \n\n Clone 2E10 was selected as the FGF21 luciferase reporter cell line based on the optimal assay window of 10-20 fold with native FGF21 exhibiting an EC50 in the single nM range. \n\n\n For the assay, the ELK-luciferase reporter cells were plated in 96 well assay plates, and serum starved overnight. FGF21 or test samples were added for 6 hours at 37 degrees. The plates were then allowed to cool to room temperature and the luciferase activity in the cell lysates was measured with Bright-Glo (Promega). \n\n\nExample 5.2 \n\n\n ERK-Phosphorylation Assay \n\n\n Alternative host cell lines specifically L6 (a rat myoblastic cell line) was developed and applied to identify antibodies with FGF21-like signaling activity. The rat L6 cell line is a desirable host cell line for the activity assay because it is known to express minimal levels of endogeneous FGF receptors. The L6 cells do not respond to FGF21 even when transfected with β-Klotho expression vector and therefore provides a cleaner background. (Kurosu et al, (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 26687-26695). \n\n\n L6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing βΚΙοίΙιο and individual FGFR using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. \n\n\n Analysis of FGF signaling in L6 cells was performed as described in the literature (Kurosu et al, (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 26687-26695). Cell cultures were collected 10 min after the treatment of FGF21 or test molecules and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, homogenized in the lysis buffer and subjected to western blot analysis using an anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (ERK1/2) antibody and an anti-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling). The percent of phosphorylated ERK versus total ERK protein was determined in this way. \n\n\n In addition, the factor-dependent mouse BaF3 cell-based proliferation assay used frequently for cytokine receptors can also be developed and applied. \n\n\n Among the hybridoma supernatants tested in the CHO cell (clone 2E10) based human FGF21 ELK-luciferase reporter assay, over 30 were identified as positive (> 5% of the activity of FGF21) when compared to 20nM FGF21 as the positive control. Antibodies were then purified \n\n from the conditioned media of the hybridoma cultures of these positives and tested again in the CHO cell based ELK-luciferase reporter assay. (Figure 7) showed the representative antibodies in the dose-responsive potency assay with estimated EC50 less than ^g/ml (or 6.7nM). The activities were confirmed in the L6 cell based ER l/2-phosphrylation assay (Figure 8) with EC50 less than 10 nM which is consistent to the ELK-luciferase assay in the CHO stable cell line 2E10. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 6 \n\n\n INDUCTION OF FGF21-LIKE SIGNALING IS SPECIFIC \n\n\n TO THE FGFRlc/BKLOTHO COMPLEX \n\n\n FGF21 has been reported to signal through multiple receptor complexes including FGFRlc, 2c, 3c and 4 when paired with β-Klotho. The selectivity of the FGF21 agonistic antibodies was tested in the rat myoblastic L6 cells transfected with vectors expressing the respective FGFRs and βΚΙοίΙιο. The results shown in Figure 9 demonstrate that the activity was mediated selectively and exclusively through FGFRlc and not through FGFR2c, 3c or 4 when they were paired with β-Klotho because no activity was detected on the latter receptors up to 100 nM of the agonistic antibodies. This unique selectivity strongly suggests that the action of these antibodies is β-Klotho-dependent yet it must also involve specifically the FGFRlc component of the signaling complex. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 7 \n\n\n ACTIVITY IN PRIMARY HUMAN ADIPOCYTES\n\n\nFGF21 stimulates glucose uptake and lipolysis in cultured adipocytes, and adipocytes are considered to be more physiologically relevant than the recombinant reporter cell system. \n\n\n A panel of the antibodies was shown to exhibit Erk-phosphorylation activity similar to\n\n\nFGF21 in the human adipocyte assay (Figure 10) with estimated EC50 less than 10 nM. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 8 \n\n\n COMPETITION BINDING AND EPITOPE BINNING \n\n\n To compare the similarity of the binding sites of the antibodies on the FGF21 receptor, a series of competition binding experiments were performed and measured by Biacore. In one \n\n example (and as shown in Figure 11), two representative agonistic FGF21 receptor antibodies (24H11 and 17D8) and one non-functional FGF21 receptor binding antibodies (1A2.1) were immobilized on the sensor chip surface. Soluble human FGFRlc/ -Klotho ECD-Fc complex or β-Klotho was then captured on the immobilized antibody surfaces. Finally, several of the test FGF21 receptor antibodies were injected individually over the captured soluble human FGF21 receptor or β-Klotho. If the injected antibody recognizes a distinct binding site relative to that recognized by the immobilized antibody, a second binding event will be observed. If the antibodies recognize very similar binding site, no more binding will be observed. \n\n\n As shown in (Figure 11 A), there are two distinct yet partially overlapping binding sites for the agonistic antibodies tested. One site is covered by 24H11, 21H2, 18B11.1 and 17C3 (Group A) and the other site covered by 17D8, 12E4 and 18G1 (Group B). The two nonfunctional antibodies 2G10 and 1A2, bind to different sites from each other and are distinct from the two sites covered by the agonistic antibodies in Group A and B. Other functional antibodies binding to Group A epitope included 20D4, 22H5, 16H7, 40D2 and 46D11. Two other functional antibodies 26H11 and 37D3 were shown by this method to bind the same site covered by the Group B antibodies. In addition, a third binding site for functional antibodies was identified for 39F11, 39F7 and 39G5 (group C) which appeared to be distinct from Group A and B binding sites (Figure 11B). \n\n\n Another Biacore analysis was carried out with biotinylated-FGF21 immobilized on the sensor ship. 10 nM soluble β-Klotho was then passed over the chip alone or mixed with the individual test antibodies at lOOnM. (Figure 12) showed that several agonistic antibodies in group A (24H11, 18B11, 17C3) and antibody 12E4 (from group B) competed significantly with FGF21 in binding to soluble β-Klotho whereas the non- functional antibodies 2G10 and 1A2 and several other functional antibodies did not show competition binding with FGF21. \n\n\n Figure 11C summarizes the binning results obtained. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 9 \n\n\n RECOGNITION OF NATIVE AND DENATURES STRUCTURES \n\n\n The ability of disclosed antigen binding proteins to recognize denatured and native structures was investigated. The procedure and results were as follows. \n\n Example 9.1 \n\n\n FGF21 Receptor Agonistic Antibodies do not Recognize Denatured Structures, as Shown by FACS \n\n\n Cell lysates from CHO cells stably expressing FGF21 receptor (FGFRlc and β-Klotho) or CHO parental cells were diluted with sample buffer without beta-mercaptoethanol (non- reducing conditions). 20μ1 of cell lysate was loaded per lane on adjacent lanes separated with a molecular weight marker lane on 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels. Following electrophoresis, the gels were blotted onto 0.2μ nitrocellulose filters. The blots were treated with Tris-buffered saline/Triton-X (TBST) plus 5% non-fat milk (blocking buffer) for 30 minutes. The blots were then cut along the molecular weight marker lanes. The strips were then probed with FGF21 receptor agonistic antibodies (12C3, 26H11, 12E4, 21H2, 18B11, or 20D4), and commercial goat anti-murine βΚΙοίΙιο or mouse anti-huFGFRl (R&D Diagnostics) in TBST/5% milk. Blots were incubated with the antibodies for one hour at room temperature, followed by three washes with TBST + 1% milk. The blots were then probed with anti-human or anti-goat IgG-HRP secondary antibodies for 20 min. Blots were given three 15 min. washes with TBST followed by treatment with Pierce Supersignal West Dura developing reagent (1 min.) and exposure to Kodak Biomax X-ray film. \n\n\n The commercial anti- -Klotho and anti-FGFRl antibodies detected the corresponding receptor proteins in the SDS-PAGE indicating they bind to denatured receptor proteins. In contrast, none of the FGF21 receptor agonistic antibodies tested detected the corresponding protein species suggesting they bind to the native conformational epitope distinct from the commercial antibodies which bind to denatured sequences. \n\n\nExample 9.2 \n\n\n FGF21 Receptor Agonistic Antibodies Bind To Native Receptor Structure, \n\n\n As Shown By FACS \n\n\n A FACS binding assay was performed with several commercially available FGFRlc and β-Klotho antibodies, and several of the disclosed FGF21 receptor agonistic antibodies. The experiments were performed as follows. \n\n\n CHO cells stably expressing FGF21 receptor were treated with R&D Systems mouse anti-huFGFRl, goat anti-mu β-Klotho, or FGF21 receptor antibodies 24H11, 17C3, 17D8, \n\n 18G1, or 2G10 (1μ§ per lxlO\n6\n cells in ΙΟΟμΙ PBS/0.5% BSA). Cells were incubated with the antibodies at 4°C followed by two washes with PBS/BSA. Cells were then treated with FITC- labeled secondary antibodies at 4°C followed by two washes. The cells were resuspended in 1ml PBS/BSA and antibody binding was analyzed using a FACS Calibur instrument. \n\n\n Consistent with western blot results, all of the FGF21 receptor agonistic antibodies tested bind well to cell surface FGF21 receptor in FACS whereas the commercial anti^-Klotho or anti-FGFRl antibodies did not. This observation further confirmed that the FGF21 receptor agonistic antibodies recognize the native structure whereas the commercial antibodies to the receptor components do not. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 10 \n\n\n ARGININE SCANNING \n\n\n As described above, antigen binding proteins that bind human FGF21R, e.g., FGFRlc, β- Klotho or both FGFRlc and β-Klotho, were created and characterized. To determine the neutralizing determinants on human FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho that these various antigen binding proteins bound, a number of mutant FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho proteins can be constructed having arginine substitutions at select amino acid residues of human FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho. Arginine scanning is an art-recognized method of evaluating where antibodies, or other proteins, bind to another protein, see, e.g., Nanevicz et ah, (1995) J. Biol. Chem., 270:37, 21619-21625 and Zupnick et ah, (2006) J. Biol. Chem., 281 :29, 20464-20473. In general, the arginine sidechain is positively charged and relatively bulky as compared to other amino acids, which can disrupt antibody binding to a region of the antigen where the mutation is introduced. Arginine scanning is a method that determines if a residue is part of a neutralizing determinant and/or an epitope. \n\n\n Various amino acids distributed throughout the human FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho extracellular domains can be selected for mutation to arginine. The selection can be biased towards charged or polar amino acids to maximize the possibility of the residue being on the surface and reduce the likelihood of the mutation resulting in misfolded protein. Using standard techniques known in the art, sense and anti-sense oligonucleotides containing the mutated residues can be designed based on criteria provided by Stratagene Quickchange\n®\n II protocol kit (Stratagene/ Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Mutagenesis of the wild-type (WT) FGFRlc and/or β- \n\n Klotho sequences can be performed using a Quickchange II kit (Stratagene). Chimeric constructs can be engineered to encode a FLAG-histidine tag (six histidines (SEQ ID NO: 382)) on the carboxy terminus of the extracellular domain to facilitate purification via the poly-His tag. \n\n\n Multiplex analysis using the Bio-Plex Workstation and software (BioRad, Hercules, CA) can be performed to determine neutralizing determinants on human FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho by analyzing exemplary human FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho mAbs differential binding to arginine mutants versus wild-type FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho proteins. Any number of bead codes of pentaHis-coated beads (\"penta-His\" disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 383) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA; see wwwl .qiagen.com) can be used to capture histidine-tagged protein. The bead codes can allow the multiplexing of FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho arginine mutants and wild-type human FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho. \n\n\n To prepare the beads, lOOul of wild-type FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho and FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho arginine mutant supernatants from transient expression culture are bound to penta-His- coated beads (\"penta-His\" disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 383) overnight at 4°C or 2 hours at room temperature with vigorous shaking. The beads are then washed as per the manufacturer's protocol and the bead set pooled and aliquoted into 2 or 3 columns of a 96-well filter plate (Millipore, Bellerica, MA, product #MSBVN1250) for duplicate or triplicate assay points, respectively. ΙΟΟμΙ anti-FGFRlc and/or anti^-Klotho antibodies in 4-fold dilutions are added to the wells, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and washed. ΙΟΟμΙ of a 1 :100 dilution of PE-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc (Jackson Labs., Bar Harbor, ME, product #109-116-170) is added to each well, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and washed. Beads are resuspended in 1% BSA, shaken for 3 minutes, and read on the Bio-Plex workstation. Antibody binding to FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho arginine mutant protein is compared to antibody binding to the human FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho wild-type from the same pool. A titration of antibody over approximately a 5 log scale can be performed. Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho arginine mutant proteins can be graphed as a percent of maximum wild-type human FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho signal. Those mutants for which signal from all the antibodies are below a cut-off value, e.g., 30% of wild-type FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho can be deemed to be either of too low a protein concentration on the bead due to poor expression in the transient culture or possibly misfolded and can be excluded from analysis. Mutations {i.e., arginine \n\n substitutions) that increase the EC50 for the FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho mAb by a cut-off value, e.g., 3-fold or greater (as calculated by, e.g., GraphPad Prism\n®\n) can be considered to have negatively affected FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho mAb binding. Through these methods, neutralizing determinants and epitopes for various FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho antibodies are elucidated. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 11 \n\n\n CONSTRUCTION OF CHIMERIC RECEPTORS \n\n\n In another method of determining the activation determinants on human FGFRlc and/or β-Klotho that these various antigen binding proteins bind, specific chimeric FGFRlc and/or β- Klotho proteins between human and mouse species can be constructed, expressed in transient or stable 293 or CHO cells as described before and tested. For example, a chimeric FGF21 receptor can be constructed comprising native human FGFRlc, FGFR2C, FGFR3c or FGFR4, in one example FGFRlc, paired with chimeric human/mouse β-Klotho in which selected regions or sequences on the human β-Klotho are systematically replaced by the corresponding mouse- specific residues (see, e.g., Figure 2A-2C). Similarly, native human β-Klotho paired with chimeric human/mouse FGFRlc, FGFR2c, FGFR3c or FGFR4, in one example FGFRlc in which selected regions or sequences on the human FGFRlc are systematically replaced by the corresponding mouse-specific residues (see, e.g., the alignments of Figures 1 A- IB). The critical sequences involved in the binding and/or activity of the antigen binding proteins can be derived through binding assay or activity measurements described in previous Examples 4, 5, 6 and 7 based on the chimeric FGF21 receptors. \n\n\nExample 11.1 Construction of Specific Chimeras \n\n\n Human-mouse β-Klotho chimeras were constructed using the methodology described in\n\n\nExample 14. A schematic of the chimeras constructed is presented in Figure 29; summarily, the chimeras generated comprised (from N to C terminus) a fusion of a human β-Klotho sequence fused to a murine β-Klotho sequence fused to a human β-Klotho sequence. Human β-Klotho (SEQ ID NO: 8) was used as a framework into which regions of murine β-Klotho (full length \n\n sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:468) were inserted. The regions of murine β-Klotho that were inserted were as follows: \n\n\nMurine Residues 82P-520P \n\n\n PK FSWGVGTGAFQVEGSWKTDGRGPSIWDRYVYSHLRGVNGTDRSTDSYIFLEKDLL

SIQF YNKVIS SRGFPFENS S SRCSQTQENTECT VCLFL VQKKPLIFL\n\n\nGCCFFSTLVLLLSIAIFQRQKRRKFWKAKNLQHIPLKKGKRVVS (SEQ ID NO:467) \n\n\nVarious antigen binding proteins provided herein, as well as human FGF21, were tested for the ability to activate the chimeras in L6 cells. Figure 30 correlates the observed results with each tested molecule. \n\n\n These data indicate that while human FGF21 was able to activate FGFRlc combined with all of the human/mouse β-Klotho chimeras (\"+\" sign indicate activity on the receptor), the substitutions of mouse sequences into human β-Klotho affected the activities of 16H7, 37D3, \n\n and 39F7. See Figure 30. These results suggest that β-Klotho sequences 1-81, 302-522, and 849-1044 are important for the activities of agonistic antigen binding proteins and may represent an important epitope for their function. EXAMPLE 12 \n\n\n PROTEASE PROTECTION ANALYSIS \n\n\n Regions of the human FGF21 receptor bound by the antigen binding proteins that bind human FGF21 receptor, e.g., FGFRlc, β-Klotho or FGFRlc and β-Klotho complex can be identified by fragmenting human FGF21 receptor into peptides with specific proteases, e.g., AspN, Lys-C, chymotrypsin or trypsin. The sequence of the resulting human FGF21 receptor peptides (i.e., both disulfide- and non-disulfide-containing peptide fragments from FGFRlc and β-Klotho portions) can then be determined. In one example, soluble forms of a human FGF21 receptor, e.g., a complex comprising the FGFRlc ECD-Fc and β-Klotho ECD-Fc heterodimer described herein can be digested with AspN (which cleaves after aspartic acid and some glutamic acid residues at the amino end) by incubating about 100 μg of soluble FGF21 receptor at 1.0 mg/ml in 0.1M sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) for 20 hrs at 37°C with 2 μg of AspN. \n\n\n A peptide profile of the AspN digests can then be generated on HPLC chromatography while a control digestion with a similar amount of antibody is expected to be essentially resistant to AspN endoprotease. A protease protection assay can then be performed to determine the proteolytic digestion of human FGF21 receptor in the presence of the antigen binding proteins. The general principle of this assay is that binding of an antigen binding protein to the FGF21 receptor can result in protection of certain specific protease cleavage sites and this information can be used to determine the region or portion of FGF21 receptor where the antigen binding protein binds. \n\n\n Briefly, the peptide digests can be subjected to HPLC peptide mapping; the individual peaks are collected, and the peptides are identified and mapped by on-line electrospray ionization LC-MS (ESI-LC-MS) analyses and/or by N-terminal sequencing. HPLC analyses for these studies can be performed using a narrow bore reverse-phase CI 8 column (Agilent Technologies) for off-line analysis and using a capillary reverse phase CI 8 column (The Separation Group) for LC-MS. HPLC peptide mapping can be performed with a linear gradient from 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (mobile phase A) to 90% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Columns \n\n can be developed at desirable flow rate for narrow bore HPLC for off-line or on-line LC-MS analyses, and for capillary HPLC for on-line LC-MS analyses. \n\n\n Sequence analyses can be conducted by on-line LC-MS/MS and by Edman sequencing on the peptide peaks recovered from HPLC. On-line ESI LC-MS analyses of the peptide digest can be performed to determine the precise mass and sequence of the peptides that are separated by HPLC. The identities of selected peptides present in the peptide peaks from the protease digestion can thus be determined. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 13 \n\n\n CYNOMOLGOUS MONKEY STUDY \n\n\n A construct encoding the antigen binding protein designated herein as 16H7 was generated using the methodology disclosed in Examples 1-3. 16H7 was expressed, purified and characterized as described in Examples 1-5 and was studied in vivo in obese cynomolgus monkeys. 16H7 is a fully human IgGl antibody and is described by the sequences provided in Tables 1-4, supra. \n\n\nExample 13.1 \n\n\n Study Design \n\n\n The study was conducted in obese cynomolgus monkeys. The monkeys were 8-19 years old. Their body weights ranged from 7-14 kg and BMI ranged from 36-74 kg/m\n2\n. Monkeys were acclimated for 6 weeks prior to the initiation of compound administration. During the acclimation period, the monkeys were familiarized with study-related procedures, including chair-restraint, subcutaneous injection (PBS, 0.1 ml/kg), gavage (water, 10 ml/kg), and blood drawn for non-OGTT and OGTT samples. After 4 weeks of training, baseline OGTT and plasma metabolic parameters were measured. 20 monkeys were selected and randomized into two treatment groups to achieve similar baseline levels of body weight, glucose OGTT profiles, and plasma glucose and triglyceride levels. \n\n\n The study was conducted in a blinded fashion. Vehicle (n=10), 16H7 (n=10). Compound was given every other week (5 mg/kg). On the week when animals were not injected with 16H7, they received vehicle injection instead. After 2 injections of 16H7, animals were monitored during an additional 6 weeks for compound washout and recovery from treatments. \n\n Food intake, body weight, clinical chemistry and OGTT were monitored throughout the study. Food intake was measured every meal. Body weight was measured weekly. Blood samples were collected on different days in fasted or fed state to measure glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels. OGTTs were conducted every two weeks after the initiation of the study. The day starting the treatment is designated as 0 and the detailed study plan is shown in Figure 14. \n\n\n The results presented in this Example represent data collected throughout the 68 days of the study. \n\n\nExample 13.2 \n\n\n Effect of 16H7 on Food Intake \n\n\n Animals were fed twice a day, with each animal receiving 120 g of formulated food established during the acclimation period. The remaining food was removed and weighed after each meal to calculate food intake. The feeding times were from 8:00 AM to 8:30 AM (±30 minutes) and then from 4:30PM to 5:00PM (±30 minutes). Fruit (150 g) was supplied to each animal at 11 :30 to 12:30 PM (±30 minutes) every day. \n\n\n Compared with vehicle, 16H7 reduced food intake in the monkeys. The effect diminished and the food intake returned to close to baseline or control levels after about 21 days of treatment. 16H7 did not have a significant effect on AM food intake (Figure 15) and only modestly reduced food intake on PM meal during the treatment (Figure 16). An increase in AM food intake was seen after day 49 (Figure 15). Throughout the study (and even during the acclimation period), fruit intake seemed lower in the 16H7 group compared to the vehicle group. Overall, 16H7 showed a significant effect on inhibiting food intake. \n\n\nExample 13.3 \n\n\n Effect of 16H7 on Body Weight \n\n\n Body weight was monitored weekly throughout the study. Over the course of the 4 week treatments, the body weight of animals treated with vehicle remained constant while body weight of animals treated with 16H7 progressively decreased. Body weight did not return to baseline by the end of the 6 weeks wash out period (Figure 17). \n\n Example 13.4 \n\n\n Effect of 16H7 on Body Mass Index (BMP, \n\n\n Abdominal Circumference (AC) and Skin Fold Thickness (SFT)\n\n\nBMI, AC and SFT were monitored weekly throughout the study, both pre- and post- administration of test compound when the body weight was taken. BMI is defined as the individual's body weight divided by the square of his or her height. SFT is the thickness of a double layer of skin and the fat beneath it as measured with a caliper. BMI, SFT and AC are relatively accurate, simple, and inexpensive measurements of body composition, particularly indicative of subcutaneous fat. Animals treated with vehicle showed relatively stable BMI, SFT and AC throughout the study. Animals treated with 16H7 showed decreased levels of BMI, AC and SFT over the course of the 4 week study, suggesting that 16H7 compound resulted in reduction of fat mass. Results are shown in Figures 18-20, respectively. These measured parameters did not come back to baseline values at the end of the 6 weeks wash out period. \n\n\nExample 13.5 \n\n\n Effect of 16H7 on Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) \n\n\n OGTTs were conducted before and after initiation of treatments. Before 16H7 injections baseline values for glucose and insulin levels were measured throughout the OGTT (Figures 21 and 22, respectively) and were not statistically significantly different between the vehicle and 16H7 groups. Post-dose OGTTs were performed every two weeks during the treatment period and after 3 weeks of wash out period. 16H7 slightly improved glucose tolerance after 4 weeks of treatment and 3 weeks of wash out period. The animal model used is not glucose intolerant explaining the modest effects observed (Figure 21). Insulin levels were statistically significantly decreased in animals treated with 16H7 (significance observed at time 0 during the OGTT performed after 2 weeks of treatment, at time 0 and 15 minutes during the OGTT performed after 4 weeks of treatment and at time 0 and 60 minutes during the OGTT performed after 2 weeks of treatment) (Figure 22). \n\n Example 13.6 \n\n\n Effect of 16H7 on Fasting and Fed Blood Glucose and Insulin Levels\n\n\nBlood was collected from overnight fasted animals or in fed conditions after the AM feeding. In the fasted conditions, blood drawn was conducted weekly 5 days post each injection. In the fed conditions, blood drawn was conducted on days 2, 11, 16, 25 and 46 post first injection. 16H7 did not reduce fasting or fed blood glucose levels (Figures 23 and 25). No hypoglycemia was observed in any of the monkeys treated with 16H7. 16H7 did, however, result in a statistically significant decrease in fasting and fed plasma insulin levels (Figures 24 and 26). \n\n\nExample 13.7 \n\n\n Effect of 16H7 on Triglyceride Levels \n\n\n Measurements were made from the same samples collected for glucose and insulin measurements. Triglyceride levels were significantly reduced in animals treated with 16H7 when measured in fasted or fed conditions (Figures 27 and 28). \n\n\nExample 13.8 \n\n\n Conclusions \n\n\n In a study conducted in male obese cynomolgus monkeys, animals treated with 16H7 showed improved metabolic parameters. Body weight was reduced and body composition was improved. Short-term reduction of food intake was observed and the effect diminished and the food intake recovered to baseline or control levels at 21 days into the study. Fasting insulin and triglyceride levels were also reduced by 16H7. Insulin levels measured during OGTT were also improved. \n\n\n EXAMPLE 14 \n\n\n VARIANT FORMS OF ANTIGEN BINDING PROTEINS 16H7 AND 22H5 \n\n\n Antigen binding proteins 16H7 and 22H5, which are described herein in Tables 1-4, were mutated to impart different properties to the molecule, such as changes in solubility, pi, overall charge, immunogenicity in humans and in animal models, stability, etc. The mutations comprised additions, deletions or substitutions in either the light chain (designated \"LC\", SEQ \n\n ID NO: 14) or heavy chain (designated \"HC\", SEQ ID NO:32) of the molecule. The disclosed single point mutations were made individually or two or more mutations were combined. \n\n\n Examples of mutations and combinations of mutations that were introduced into the 16H7 heavy and light chain sequences include the following: \n\n\n I83K (in 16H7 heavy chain) (SEQ ID NO:396) \n\n\n E16Q (in 16H7 heavy chain) + V24F (in 16H7 heavy chain) + I83T (in 16H7 heavy chain)+ S100I

Conditions for the ELISA were as follows. \n\n\n Streptavidin coated Maxisorp plates were incubated with 2μg/ml β-Klotho overnight at 4 degrees. Antibodies were added in 3 -fold serial dilutions starting at ΙμΜ for 1 hour at room temp. HRP conjugated anti-human Fc was used as the detector antibody. Signal was developed with Lumiglo and read on Envision. \n\n\n Results of the ELISA assay are shown in Figure 32A-32C and indicate that most variants of 16H7 bound to human β-Klotho except for a mutant carrying insertion of tyrosine at position 107. \n\n Example 14.2 \n\n\n Engineered Variants of 16H7 and 22H5 Bind to Native Receptor Structure, \n\n\n as Shown by FACS \n\n\n A FACS binding assay was performed with several of the engineered forms of 16H7 and 22H5. The experiments were performed as follows. \n\n\n CHO cells stably expressing FGF21 receptor were treated with parent antibody 16H7 and 22H5 and also with engineered variants of them (^g per lxlO\n6\n cells in ΙΟΟμΙ PBS/0.5% BSA). Cells were incubated with the antibodies at 4°C followed by two washes with PBS/BSA. Cells were then treated with FITC-labeled secondary antibodies at 4°C followed by two washes. The cells were resuspended in 1ml PBS/BSA and antibody binding was analyzed using a FACS Calibur instrument. \n\n\n Consistent with ELISA results, most of engineered variants of FGF21 receptor agonistic antibodies tested bind well to cell surface FGF21 receptor in FACS. This observation further confirmed that the guided engineering of FGF21 receptor agonistic antibodies maintain binding to the native structure. In one mutant, in which CDR3 was engineered to include a tyrosine at position Y107, a complete loss of binding to cell surface receptor was observed, which is similar to the ELISA results. This observation points to the role of CDR3 loop in binding to native conformation. Example 14.3 \n\n\n Activity of 16H7 and 22H5 Variants in Primary Human Adipocytes\n\n\nFGF21 stimulates glucose uptake and lipolysis in cultured adipocytes and, therefore, adipocytes are often considered to be a physiologically relevant assay. A panel of the engineered variants of 16H7 and 22H5 was shown to exhibit Erk-phosphorylation activity similar to FGF21 in the human adipocyte assay with an estimated EC50 less than 10 nM, as shown in Table 7. \n\n\nTable 7 \n\n\n Activity of Variants in Human Adipocyte Assay \n\n\n \n\n Core Sequence SEQ ID NO of Variant EC50 (nM) \n\n\n Variant Chain \n\n\n 16H7 Heavy Chain 393 E16Q+V24F+I83T 0.38 \n\n\n 16H7 Heavy Chain 398 D88R+P89A+V90E 0.35 \n\n\n 16H7 Heavy Chain 394 E16Q+V24F+I83T+T119L 0.36 \n\n\n 16H7 (WT) 0.53 \n\n\n 22H5 Light Chain 403 S94A 1.98 \n\n\n 22H5 Light Chain 402 N92Q 3.33 \n\n\n 16H7 Heavy Chain 400 Deletion of Y107 1.04 \n\n\n 16H7 Heavy Chain 396 I83K 0.39 \n\n\n 16H7 Heavy Chain 397 SI 001 0.17 \n\n\n 16H7 Heavy Chain 401 D109S 0.31 \n\n\n 16H7 Heavy Chain 399 D88R+P89A+V90E+S 1001 0.14 \n\n\n 16H7 Heavy Chain 395 E 16Q+V24F+I83T+S 100I+T 119L 0.24 \n\n\n 22H5 Heavy Chain 405 Insertion of Y107 0.51 \n\n\n 16H7 Heavy Chain 390 V24F 0.75 \n\n\n 16H7 Heavy Chain 392 V24F+I83T 0.37 \n\n\n 16H7 Light Chain 386 D49Y 0.60 \n\n\n 16H7 Light Chain 387 D49A 0.63 \n\n\n 16H7 Light Chain 389 D49A, D91A 1.4 \n\n\n 16H7 Light Chain 388 D91A 1.3 \n\n\n 16H7 Light Chain 385 Q16K 0.11 \n\n\n 22H5 (WT) 2.27 \n\n\nExample 14.4 \n\n\n Biacore Binding Experiments and Off-rate Measurement \n\n\n Binding of 16H7 and 22H5 variants to human β-Klotho was tested using Biacore assays.\n\n\nBriefly, mouse anti-His antibody (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was immobilized on a CM5 chip using amine coupling reagents (General Electronics, Piscataway, NJ). His-tagged human recombinant \n\n β-Klotho was captured on the second flow cell to -100RU. The first flow cell was used as a background control. lOOnM mAbs were diluted in PBS plus O.lmg/ml BSA, 0.005% P20 and injected over the β-Klotho captured on anti-His antibody surface. For kinetic measurement, 0.78~100nM mAbs diluted in PBS plus O.lmg/ml BSA, 0.005% P20 were injected over the β- Klotho surface. \n\n\n The variants tested are summarized in Table 8: \n\n\nTable 8 \n\n\n Variants Studied in Binding and Off-rate Experiments \n\n\n \n\n Core Light Chain Heavy Light \n\n\n Heavy Chain \n\n\n Construct Antigen Identifier /V aria- Chain Chain \n\n\n Identifier /V aria- Number Binding tion SEQ ID SEQ ID tion \n\n\n Protein NO NO \n\n\n E16Q+V24F+I83T+ 395 14\n\n\n16H7 \n\n\n #14, P60891.3 S100I+T119L L3 \n\n\n #15, P60889.3 16H7 Insertion of Y 107 L3 405 14\n\n\n#16, P60888.3 16H7 V24F L3 390 14\n\n\n#17, P60887.3 16H7 V24F+I83T L3 392 14\n\n\n#18, P60894.3 16H7 H3 D49Y 32 386\n\n\n#19, P60895.3 16H7 H3 D49A 32 387\n\n\n#20, P60893.3 16H7 H3 D49A+D91A 32 389\n\n\n#21, P60892.3 16H7 H3 D91A 32 388\n\n\n#22, P60896.3 16H7 H3 Q16K 32 385\n\n\n#23, P60899.2 22H5 C109S L2 404 13 \n\n\nAmong the engineered mAbs tested, the majority of them showed tight binding to human β-Klotho, except #15 which showed no binding.

Assays were run as follows. \n\n\n On day one, AM-l/D FGFRlc+ -Klotho Luc clone was seeded in a 96-well plate at 20K cells/well in DMEM + 10% FBS medium. The plate was incubated overnight. The following day, the medium was replaced with assay medium (DMEM + 0.2% FBS) and incubated overnight. From an antibody working stock (1 mg/mL in PBS), each antibody under study was prepared at a dilution of 2 μg/ml in assay medium. 100 of each antibody to be tested was combined in a U-bottom plate. The assay medium was removed from the cells, and 50 μί of the antibody mixtures was transferred to the cells. The antibody mixtures were incubated on the cells for 5 hrs. Lastly, each sample was read-out with SteadyGlo Luciferase reagent (50 μ1Λνε11),ρεΓ the manufacturer's specifications. \n\n\n Table 10 below is a summary of the activity (% of FGF21 activity from the reporter assay) observed from the study; Table 11 expresses the observed activities with respect to bins. \n\n\nTable 10 \n\n\n Antibody Combination Activity (%) \n\n\n \n\n Table 11 \n\n\n Antibody Combinations Expressed in Terms of Bins \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, several pairs of molecules showed an additive effect. As shown in Figures 34 and 35, respectively, 39F11 and FGF21 showed an additive effect when measured in the reporter assay of Example 5, as did 16H7 and 39H11. \n\n\n Summarizing the data from this set of experiments, it was observed that antigen binding proteins from the same binding bin, e.g., 16H7 when paired with 20D4 (both from Group A), the summed activity was not additive. This was also observed when 12E4 was paired with 26H11 (both from Group B). Additionally, paired antigen binding proteins from non-overlapping bins showed additive activities, e.g., 16H7 (Group A) paired with 26H11 or 12E4 (Group B), or paired with 39F7 (Group C). Further, antigen binding proteins 26H11 and 12E4 (Group B) showed additive effect when combined with Abs from Group A but not Group C, suggesting there may be some overlap between the binding sites of Group B and Group C and/or that the activation conformations induced by the antigen binding proteins from Group B and Group C are not mutually compatible. Finally, as expected, when a functional antigen binding protein is paired with a non- functional antigen binding protein (e.g., 2G10) which binds to a distinct and non-overlapping binding site from Group A, B or C, there is no effect upon the activity from the functional antigen binding protein from Group A, B or C. \n\n\n Collectively, this data suggests that the disclosed antigen binding proteins can be coadministered to enhance the effect that a given antigen binding protein may provide on its own. \n\n\nEach reference cited herein is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all that it teaches and for all purposes. \n\n The present disclosure is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein, which are intended as illustrations of individual aspects of the disclosure, and functionally equivalent methods and components form aspects of the disclosure.
