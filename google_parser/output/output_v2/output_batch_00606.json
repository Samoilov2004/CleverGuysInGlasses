While these studies were unsuccessful, our understanding of the opioid system has increased tremendously. A significant breakthrough in our understanding of this system came about as a realization that the pharmacology of opioids is receptor based. From this vantage point, the focus of research turned to identifying receptor subtypes with the ultimate goal of assigning specific physiological function to individual receptors. Today, the receptor system is known to be composed of the three distinct subtypes OP\n1\n, OP\n2,\nand OP\n3\n (delta, kappa and mu), as each of these have been cloned and been shown to derive from three different chromosomes. For a discussion of opioid receptors, see \nKirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, \n. There is however less however as to the number of subtypes within each of the main branches and while much has been learned along these lines, the process of assigning function to subtypes is still an area of active investigation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe opioid receptor system has been extensively studied over the past eight decades driven primarily by a search for analgesics that do not possess the abuse potential associated with morphine. While this effort has been unsuccessful to date, recent studies have highlighted the delta opioid receptor system as holding the greatest potential for success. Principally, agonists acting through the delta opioid receptor have been shown to modulate pain while minimizing many of the side-effects associated with morphine which acts primarily at the mu opioid receptor. These unwanted side-effects include physical dependence, respiratory depression, and gastrointestinal motility problems. These findings have led to a dramatic increase in the research efforts directed toward the production of potent, highly delta receptor selective agonists. The bulk of this effort has been in discovering small molecules as opposed to peptides due to their enhanced stability \nin vivo\n and their ability to penetrate the central nervous system.\n\n\n \nI.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe discovery of potent, highly receptor-selective opioid pure antagonists has been a goal of medicinal chemists for many years.\n1,2\n As molecular probes, antagonists have served as useful tools in the study of both the structure as well as the physiological functions of the highly complex opioid receptor system. Much has been accomplished as evidenced by the elegant work of Portoghese and coworkers over the past decade which ultimately has led to the discovery of the naltrexone-based kappa and delta receptor subtype-selective antagonists norbinaltorphimine\n3\n (1, nor-BNI) and naltrindole\n4\n (2, NTI), respectively. Following Portoghese's lead, workers at SmithKline Beecham recently reported that the octahydroisoquinoline (3, SB 205588) was a second-generation, highly potent and selective delta antagonist formally derived from naltrindole fragmentation.\n5\n One specific research aim has been the discovery of opioid receptor selective reversibly binding ligands from the N-substituted (+)-(3R,4R)-dimethyl -4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (4a) class of compounds that display pure antagonist activity.\n6\n These compounds will be useful as molecular probes for the opioid receptor as well as potential drug candidates for the treatment of substance abuse and other CNS disorders.\n7\n While mu antagonists have for years been used in drug abuse therapy, recent findings suggest that kappa antagonists could provide a more effective, long-tasting treatment strategy.\n8\n A great variety of N-substituted derivatives of 4a has been prepared, but until the recent demonstration of mu selectivity for 5a, \n9\n none had shown selectivity between the opioid receptor subtypes. Since the pure antagonist activity of these compounds is not dependent on the N-substituent, multiple changes to this part of the molecule would be expected to affect binding affinity and possibly receptor selectivity but not alter its fundamental antagonist character. This feature distinguishes this class of antagonist from the morphone-based compounds, which display pure antagonist behavior only with N-substituents such as allyl or cyclopropylmethyl but not methyl, ethyl, or phenethyl.\n10\n It is currently believed that the N-substituent in 4a interacts with a lipophilic binding domain which has been described as either very large or quite malleable since a multitude of different types of N-substituent changes provided ligands displaying high binding affinity.\n11\n It has also been determined that maximum potency and selectivity for the mu opioid receptor is achieved when the N-substituent incorporates a lipophilic entity (phenyl or cyclohexyl ring) separated from the piperidine nitrogen by three atoms as illustrated by \ncompounds\n 5a-d.\n9,11\n The synthesis of κ-selective compounds remains an important goal. \ncompounds\n 5a-d.\n9,11\n \n\n\n \nII.\n\n\n \n \n \nDerivatives of N-substituted (±)-trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine, such as 6 and 7, are known to posses nonselective potent opioid pure antagonist activity. \n12-16\n Early investigations of the phenylpiperidine class of opioid antagonists identified the 3-methyl substituent and its trans relative relationship to the 4-substituent as being both necessary and sufficient to impart antagonist activity to the agonist 4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine. \n12\n This feature distinguished the phenylpiperidines from the oxymorphones which rely on particular N-substituents (i.e. allyl, cyclopropylmethyl) for expression of opioid antagonist activity. \n17\n Further studies demonstrated that the N-substituent in the phenylpiperidine antagonists controls their potency and efficacy.\n15\n Accordingly, there remains a need for compounds which have similar therapeutic effects as the trans-3 ,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines, but are based on different structural element.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \nIII.\n\n\n \n \n \nNumerous structural types of opioid agonists have been discovered, and several such as methadone, meperidine, fentanyl, and pentazocine as well as others have become important drugs for the treatment of pain.\n10\n However, there are only a few structural types that show potent, opioid pure antagonist activity.\n10,7\n A resurgence in heroin use in recent years coupled with the demonstrated effectiveness of opioid antagonists for the treatment of other substances of abuse has spurred new interest in the development of novel antagonists for opioid receptors.\n16\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oxymorphone-related compounds such as naloxone (\n8a\n) and naltrexone (\n8b\n), where the antagonist activity is dependent upon the N-substituent, have received considerable attention over the past few decades.\n10\n For example, pioneering studies by Portoghese and coworkers lead to the development of the prototypical kappa and delta opioid receptor antagonists, norbinaltorphimine (\n1\n, nor-BNI) and naltrindole (2, NTI). In contrast, the N-substituted trans-3,4-dimethyl-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (\n9a-d\n) class of pure antagonist has received relatively little attention. Studies with the N-methyl analog 9a as well as many other N-substituted analogs such as \n9b, 9c\n (LY255582), and \n9d\n showed that the pure antagonist activity was dependent on the 3-methyl substituent and its trans relative relationship to the 4-methyl substituent on the piperidine ring and, unlike the oxymorphone class, was independent of the nature of the N-substituent.\n7,16,17,6,13,14\n. Interestingly, the 3,4-dimethyl cis isomer \n9e\n was found to be a mixed agonist-antagonist. May and coworkers\n18\n reported that 2,9α-dimethyl-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan (\n10a\n), which has the 9-methyl group in a configuration comparable to the cis-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (\n9e\n) with the 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl) group locked in an equatorial conformation relative to the piperidine ring in the morphan structure, was a weak but pure antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeither 2,9β-dimethyl-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan (\n10b\n) nor 2,4β-dimethyl-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan (\n10g\n) have not been reported, due to a lack of synthetic accessibility to these structural isomers. Accordingly, the successful synthetic preparation of 2,9β-morphans and 2,4β-morphans remains an important goal of in the field opioid receptor-binding compounds.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \nIV.\n\n\n \n \n \nIn search of analgesics possessing a reduced side-effect profile relative to morphine, much effort has been expended towards finding opioids which operate via δ or κ opioid receptors as opposed to the µ opioid receptor which meditates the actions of morphine and its congeners.\n10\n *BW373U86 (11)\n19\n and SNC-80 (\n12\n)\n20\n represent one class of opioid agonists discovered to be selective for the δ opioid receptor. Due to the lack of a clear opioid message substructure (i.e., a tyramine component similar to the enkephalins), \n \ncompounds\n \n \n11\n and \n12\n have been referred to as non-classical opioid ligands.\n5\n The piperazine subunit of \n11\n and \n12\n is not commonly found in compounds showing activity at the opioid receptors. In contrast, piperidine ring compounds are found in many different classes of opioids.\n27\n If the internal nitrogen atom in \n \ncompounds\n \n \n11\n or \n12\n is transposed with the benzylic carbon, piperidine ring analogs such as \n13\n would be obtained. Even though there are common structural elements between \n \n \nstructures\n \n \n \n11\n or \n12\n and \n13,\n the expected difference between in basicity between the piperidinyl amino group of \n11\n or \n12\n and the di-phenyl substituted amine of \n13\n is sufficient such that it cannot be predicted whether similarity to suggest that \n13\n would interact with opioid receptors similar to \n11\n or \n12.\n It is also interesting to note that \ncompound\n \n13\n has some structural elements in common with cis-3-methylfentanyl (\n14\n),\n21,22\n a non-classical opioid ligand selective for the mu opioid receptor. Accordingly, the preparation of \ncompound\n \n13\n and related structures remains an important goal.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n(1) \nDhawan, B.N.; Cesselin, F.; Raghubir, R.; Reisine, T.; Bradley, P.B.; Portoghese, P.S.; Hamon, M.

The \npara\n position is preferred, especially when X is -OH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe absolute configuration of the carbon atom to which R, is bonded may be (R) or (S). The (S) configuration is preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) are preferably opiates with preferential affinity for the µ/κ opioid receptors and comparably less affinity for δ receptors. In a preferred embodiment, these compounds are pure antagonists. The ratio of affinity for the δ receptor to the κ receptor (δ/κ) may be at least 1.5, preferably at least 2.0, more preferably at least 20, still more preferably at least 100, even still more preferably at least 750 and most preferably at least 800. The µ/κ ratio may be 0.002 to 500.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) may be prepared using well-known synthetic techniques by condensing an acid of the formula R\n3\n-CO\n2\nH with an amine represented by the formula:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe acid is preferably converted into an activated ester in order to couple with the amine. A BOP ester is preferred. In a particularly preferred embodiment, a variety of compounds within the scope of formula (I) may be simultaneously synthesized and evaluated using well-established combinatorial synthesis techniques, for example, as described in Example 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds (I) and compounds of \nclaim\n 6 may be in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt via protonation of the amine with a suitable acid. The acid may be an inorganic acid or an organic acid. Suitable acids include, for example, hydrochloric, hydroiodic, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, citric, acetic and formic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe receptor selectivities discussed above are determined based on the binding affinities at the receptors indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be used to bind opioid receptors. Such binding may be accomplished by contacting the receptor with an effective amount of the inventive compound. Of course, such contacting is preferably conducted in a aqueous medium, preferably at physiologically relevant ionic strength, pH, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventive compounds may also be used to treat patients having disease states which are ameliorated by binding opioid receptors. Such diseases states include heroin addition, pain, i.e., the compounds are used as analgesics. The compounds of the inventive may also be used to reverse mu-induced respiratory depression, as cytostatica agents, as antimigraine agents, as immunomodulators, as immunosuppressives, as antiarthritic agents, as antiallergic agents, as virucides, to treat diarrhea, as antidepressants, as uropathic agents, as antitussives, as antiadditive agents, as anti-smoking agents, to treat alcoholism, as hypotensive agents, or to treat obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds may be administered in an effective amount by any of the conventional techniques well-established in the medical field. For example, the compounds may be administered orally, intraveneously, or intramuscularly. When so administered, the inventive compounds may be combined with any of the well-known pharmaceutical carriers and additives that are customarily used in such pharmaceutical compositions.

The patient is preferably a mammal, with human patients especially preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHaving generally described this invention, a further understanding can be obtained by reference to certain specific examples which are provided herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified. In each of the Examples, the numbering of compounds and references cited are specific to each Example.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\nIdentification of Opiates selective for the Opioid Receptors\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA three-component library of confounds was prepared in parallel using multiple simultaneous solution phase synthetic methodology. The compounds incorporated a (+)-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxphenyl)piperidine group as one of the monomers. The other two monomers, which included N-substittuted or unsubstitued Boc protected amino acids and a range of substituted aryl carboxylic acids, were selected to add chemical diversity. Screening of these compounds in competitive binding experiments with the kappa opioid receptor selective ligand [\n3\nH]U69,593 led to the identification of a κ opioid receptor selective ligand, N-{(2'S)-[3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanamido]-3'-methylbutyl}-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (8, RTI-5989-29). Additional SAR studies suggested that 8 possesses lipophilic and hydrogen bonding sites that are important to its opioid receptor potency and selectivity. The sites appear to exist predominantly within the kappa receptor since the selectivity arises from a 530-fold loss of affinity of 8 for the mu receptor and an 18-ford increase in affinity for the kappa receptor relative to the mu selective ligand, (+)-N--[trans-4-phenyl-2-butenyl]-(3R,4R)-dimethyk-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (5a). THis degree of selectivity observed in the radioligand binding experiments was not observed in the functional assay. According to its ability to inhibit agonist stimulated binding of \n[35\nS]GTPγS at all three opioid receptors, \ncompound\n 8 behaves as a mu/kappa opioid receptor pure antagonist with negligible affinity for the delta receptor.\n\n\n \n\n\nChemistry\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCoupling of (+)-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (4b) (\nFigure 3\n) with an appropriate tert-butoxycarbonyl-protected amino acid (Boc-protected) followed by removal of the Boc-protecting group with trifuoroacetic acid (IFA) in methylene chloride followed by reduction using a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of borane-dimethyl sulfide complex gave the intermediate amines (6a-k) in 15-78% yields (\nFigure 3\n): These \nintermediates\n \n6\n were subjected to column chromatography or crystallization as necessary to obtain pure compounds. The final products (7) were prepared in scintillation vials via amide bond formation by coupling with a wide variety of commercially available carboxylic acids. A representative list of such carboxylic acids follows the Experimental section of this Example. Benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP reagent) in THF was employed as the coupling reagent which provided very clean products after aqueous work-up. These compounds were used directly in screening without additional purification. Pure compounds for further SAR analysis were obtained by purification of library samples or by single compound synthesis by conventional synthetic methodology and characterized by MS, \n1\nH NMR, and elemental analyses.\n\n\n \n\n\nResults and Discussion\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe results from the screening of the 288-compound library in competitive binding against the kappa opioid receptor selective ligand [\n3\nH]U69,593 are illustrated graphically in Figure 6. Several compounds showed significant inhibition of radioligand binding at 100 nM with \n8\n (\nplate\n 4, well 20, 71%) being the best (Figure 6). The data for % inhibition of [\n3\nH]U69,593 binding by selected library compounds \n8-23\n at 100 nM are listed in Table 1.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nA comparative analysis of the structures related to compounds \n9-23\n, which have less binding affinity relative to \n8\n, readily illustrates the importance for kappa receptor binding of each structural subunit of group R\n3\n (Table 1). \nCompound\n \n9\n, a diastereomer of \n8\n, where the carbon to which the R\n1\n isopropyl group is connected has the opposite stereochemistry, shows less binding affinity (11%) for the opioid kappa receptor. The sensitivity to orientation (R or S) at this stereogenic center suggests that the isopropyl group may be working in tandem with another structural feature of the R\n3\n unit to both increase binding in \n8\n and decrease binding in \n9\n. The difference in affinity of compounds \n8\n (71%) and \n10\n (28%) suggests that the 4-hydroxyl substituent in \n8\n is more effective for high kappa binding affinity. Furthermore, the weaker inhibition displayed by compounds \n11\n (20%) and 12 (25%) possessing meta and ortho hydroxyl substituents respectively, pinpoints the para placement of the para-hydroxyl group as the optimum position. The fact that compound \n19\n, which lacks the isopropyl group but has the para-hydroxyphenylpropionic substituent, shows less affinity (11% vs. 71 %) relative to \n8\n, adds additional support to the importance of the R\n1\n isopropyl and 4-hydroxyphenyl groups to the kappa-selective binding. The low affinity of compound \n20\n (20%) which has a methyl substituent in position (R\n1\n) shows that a methyl group may be less effective than the isopropyl group. This strengthens the notion that both the isopropyl group (R\n1\n) and the 4-hydroxyphenyl group for R\n3\n are working together to elicit high affinity binding at the kappa opioid receptor in \ncompound\n \n8\n. The results for compound \n13\n (6%) suggests that two methylene groups are more effective between the phenyl ring and the amide carboxyl in diversity element R\n3\n, presumably because the para-hydroxyl group cannot reach its site of interaction in the truncated derivative. Furthermore, the lower inhibition of binding for compound \n14\n (15%) which incorporates a \ntrans\n double bond in the connecting chain shows that the length of the chain is not optimal to impart high binding affinity, implying that flexibility is also preferred in this carbon chain to provide proper ligand and receptor alignment. The lower affinity of the 4-fluoro derivative \n15\n (26%) and the 4-methoxy derivative \n18\n (16%) supports the suggestion that a hydrogen bond exists between \nligand\n \n8\n and the receptor with \ncompound\n \n8\n donating the hydrogen. This is further supported by the lower affinity of the 3,4-dihydroxyl derivative \n16\n (31 %) which can hydrogen bond internally and the 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy derivative \n17\n (42%) whose hydrogen bond could be sterically encumbered by interference from an adjacent methoxy group. Interestingly, all compounds having methyl and not hydrogen as the second diversity element R\n2\n, \n21\n (0%), \n22\n (1%), and \n23\n (7%) displayed very low binding affinity usually at baseline (DMSO blank) levels. Apparently, position R\n2\n is preferably unsubstituted. These results suggest that the amide group may be part of a separate hydrogen-bonding interaction to place the key R\n1\n isopropyl and R\n3\n p-hydroxyphenyl rings in their correct positions for strong interaction with the receptor. Alternatively, the N-methyl substituent may be decrease ligand affinity through repulsive steric interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, the data suggests that the high binding affinity displayed by 8 results from a combination of several structural features present in its N-substituent. These include a 4-hydroxyl group in the pendant phenyl ring of group R\n3\n, the length and flexibility of the carbon chain connecting this ring to the amide carbonyl and the presence of a beta (position R\n1\n) isopropyl group with an S configuration at the adjacent stereogenic center. The data analysis suggests that the principle stabilizing interactions could be related to binding of the hydroxyl and isopropyl substituents with the other atoms of the N-substituent substructure acting to hold these two binding elements in optimum overlapping positions within the receptor site. Alternatively, the isopropyl group could be acting to bias the conformation of molecule to provide the best alignment of the 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid side-chain with its binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to gain additional SAR information, a pure sample of \n8\n along with compounds \n24-27\n which vary at the R\n1\n position alone was prepared for study. Table 2 lists the K\ni\n values for these derivatives at the mu and kappa opioid receptors along with the K\ni\n values for the mu-\nselective reference compound\n \n5a\n, naltrexone, and the kappa-selective antagonist nor-BNI. The delta receptor assay was not performed for compounds \n24-27\n as all previous derivatives of \n8\n had shown no affinity for this receptor subtype. This study revealed that \n8\n not only actively binds the kappa receptor (K\ni\n = 6.9 nM) but also possessed a 57-fold selectivity for the kappa vs. the mu receptor (K\ni\n = 393 nM) and >870-fold selectivity for the kappa vs. the delta receptor (K\ni\n >5700 nM). \nCompound\n \n8\n thus displays a high degree of opioid kappa receptor subtype selectivity.\n1,2\n Nor-BNI (\n1\n) has a higher affinity for the kappa receptor than \n8\n and has a greater kappa selectivity relative to the mu receptor. However, \n8\n is more selective for the kappa receptor relative to the delta receptor. A part of these differences could be due to the use of different tissues and radioligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data for the beta \nisobutyl substituent compound\n \n24\n, which results formally from insertion of a methylene between the isopropyl group and its adjacent stereogenic center of \ncompound\n \n8\n, displays a loss of affinity for the kappa receptor while maintaining the same affinity for the mu receptor as \ncompound\n \n8\n. The net effect is a loss of selectivity between the mu and kappa receptor subtypes. Compound \n26\n (R\n1\n=cyclohexyl) shows a similar loss of affinity for the kappa receptor with a gain in affinity for the mu receptor resulting in a similar loss of selectivity. Compound 25 with an R\n1\n sec-butyl group shows a slight decrease in both kappa and mu potency but retains selectivity, though its magnitude is lower relative to \n8\n. Compound \n27\n (R\n1\n=benzyl) displayed a binding profile completely different from that seen in \n8\n with a tremendous increase in mu potency and concomitant loss of kappa potency. This was not unexpected since compound \n27\n, prepared from the amino acid phenylalanine, possesses an N-substituent with a phenyl ring separated from the piperidine ring by three methylene groups which are known to favor mu binding.\n1,2\n It was for this reason that phenylalanine was excluded from use in the library synthesis. Overall, the behaviors of the various R\n1\n derivatives of \n8\n indicate that the size of the lipophilic group in position R\n1\n is important to both the potency and receptor subtype selectivity of the ligand. Furthermore, the data supports the hypothesis that the isopropyl group in \n8\n is not simply biasing the conformation of side-chain but is instead interacting with the receptor directly in a ligand stabilizing interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe agonist/antagonist activity of \ncompound\n \n8\n was measured by determining its ability to either stimulate or reverse opioid agonist stimulated binding of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, [\n35\nS]GTPγS, in all three opioid receptor assays (Table 3). Table 3 includes data obtained for naltrexone, the standard nonselective opioid pure antagonist, nor-BNI, the prototypical kappa-selective antagonist, and the potent, mu-favoririg opioid antagonist (\n5a\n). The kappa selectivity displayed by \ncompound\n \n8\n in the inhibition of radioligand binding assay was not observed in the [\n35\nS]GTPγS functional assay. This is not an atypical situation; radioligand binding results often differ substantially from those seen in functional assays but this typically involves agonists. The antagonists, naltrexone, normally display K\ni\n (radioligand)/K\ni\n (GTPγS) binding ratios near unity whereas ratios greater than unity have been observed for antagonists of the N-substituted \ntrans\n-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine series.\n1\n This phenomenon is illustrated graphically in \nFigure 5\n. The \ntrans\n-\ncinnamyl derivatives\n 5a-c and \ncompound\n 5d display k\n1\n (radioligand) K\n1\n(GTRγS) binding ratios greater than unity in the mu and kappa receptor assays which is distinctly different from the response demonstrated by nalttrexone. In the \npresent case compound\n 8 is found to behave like naltrexone in the kappa receptor assays with a ratio near unity which is far different from the behavior seen for 5a-c and 5d, which show ratios of 118, 228, 63, and 85, respectively. In the mu receptor assay on the other hand, \ncompound\n 8 with a ratio of 54 behaves like 5a-c and 5d which give ratios of 19,66,43, and 15. This differential response of 8 in the [\n35\nS]GTPγS assay is sufficiently large so as to erode the kappa receptor selectivity observed for 8 in the radioligand binding assays. Note that the K\ni\n (radioligand)/k\ni\n (GTP) binding ratios for nor-BNI at the mn and kappa receptor are 2.8 and 7.36, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nConclusions\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe identification of \ncompound\n 8, which displays a highly selective kappa vs. mu receptor inhibition of radioligand binding profile and a potent mu/kappa opioid antagonist profile, demonstrates the effectiveness of the biased library approach to lead compound generation. Since both the mu and kappa receptors may be important in heroin abuse, \ncompound\n 8 should be useful as a treatment medication for heroin abuse.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental section\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMelting points were determined on a Thomas-Hoover capillary tube apparatus and are not connected. Elemental analyses were obtained by Atlantic Microlabs, Inc. and are within ±0.4% of the calculated values. All optical rotations were determined at the sodium D line using a Rudolph Research Autopol III polarimeter (1-dm cell). \n1\nH NMR spectra were determined on a Bruker WM-250 spectrometer using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) was used for all column chromatography. Mass spectral data was obtained using a Finnegan LCQ electrospray mass spectrometer in positive ion mode at atmospheric pressure. All reactions were followed by thin-layer chromatography using \nWhatman silica gel\n 60 TLC plates and were visualized by UV, charring using 5% phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol and/or exposure to iodine vapor. All solvents were reagent grade. Tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether were dried over sodium benzophenone ketyl and distilled prior to use. Methylene chloride was distilled from calcium hydride prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nGeneral Method for the Introduction of Diversity Elements R\n1\n and R\n2\n \n into \n \nStructure\n 6\n. (+)-(3R,4R)-Dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (\n4b\n) (11.5 mmol), the appropriate Boc-protected amino acid (11.5 mmol) and BOP reagent (11.5 mmol) were combined in THF (150 mL) at room temperature, and to this was immediately added triethylamine (TEA) or diisopropylethylamine (25.3 mmol). After stirring for 1 h, the reaction mixture was poured into ethyl ether (500 mL) and water (150 mL) in a separatory funnel. The mixture was shaken and the aqueous layer removed. This procedure was repeated using 150 mL saturated NaHCO\n3\n and 150 mL brine. The organic layer was diluted with hexane until 1 cloudy and dried (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n), concentrated under reduced pressure, then dissolved in 100 mL chloroform (stored over K\n2\nCO\n3\n), and concentrated again. This was placed on a high vacuum system to remove residual solvent yielding a foamy yellow/white solid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter remaining under vacuum on the pump overnight, this unpurified material was dissolved in methylene chloride 45 mL and cooled to -20°C (methanol/ice). To this was added neat trifluoroacetic acid in 10-mL portions over 2 min to give a total addition of 30 mL. The entire mixture was stirred for exactly 30 min and then the cooling bath was removed for exactly 30 min. At this point, the reaction mixture was poured into a 1 L beaker containing a large stir bar and a rapidly agitated mixture of saturated bicarbonate solution (400 mL) and chloroform (150 mL). After completed addition, the pH of the mixture was verified to be 10 and adjusted with solid sodium bicarbonate if necessary. This mixture was poured into a separatory funnel. Any precipitated organic compounds were rinsed into the separatory funnel using a small amount of methanol. The beaker was then rinsed with a small amount of water which was added to the separatory funnel. The layers were agitated, separated, and the aqueous layer extracted five additional times using 3:1 methylene chloride:THF. It was observed that compounds with small groups R\n1\n required additional extractions and/or sodium chloride saturation of the aqueous layer. The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent removed at reduced pressure. The material was then placed on a high vacuum pump to yield a yellow foamy solid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnpurified material from the deprotection step was dissolved in THF (150 mL) and cooled to -20°C (methanol/ice). To this stirred mixture was added a solution of borane dimethylsulfide complex, 2M in THF (110 mmol) dropwise. The solution was then heated to reflux and held for 3 h after which time, the solution was cooled to -20°C, and to this was carefully added methanol (72 mL) dropwise. This mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature, 16.4 mL of 1M HCl in ethyl ether was added, the solution was allowed to stir for 30 min, and the solvents removed on a rotary evaporator. The resulting residue was partitioned between 3:1 methylene chloride:etrahydofuran and water, the pH was adjusted to 10 with saturated sodium bicarbonate, and the aqueous layer was saturated with sodium chloride and extracted several times with 3:1 methylene chloride:tetrahydofuran. The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent removed. This material was purified by flash chromatography on a silica gel column which was prepared by slurry packing with chloroform. The impure compounds were loaded on the column as a chloroform solution. Elution proceeded with neat chloroform followed by 3% methanol up to 10% methanol in chloroform as needed to elute the desired compounds. Product fractions were combined and the solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator. This material was dissolved in a minimum of hot ethyl acetate and allowed to crystallize. Crystalline material was isolated by filtration followed by washing with a small amount of ice-cold ethyl acetate and used directly in the next step after drying overnight in a vacuum oven.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIntroduction of Diversity Element R\n3\n into \nStructure\n 7\n. The appropriate \npure diamine\n 6, produced in the previous step (0.05 mmol x the number of derivatives being prepared), was dissolved in THF (2 mL x the number of derivatives being prepared) and to this was added TEA (0.1 mmol x the number of derivatives being prepared). Then, into prelabeled, 20-mL scintillation vials containing a stir bar was added one of the chosen carboxylic acids (0.05 mmol). To this was added the appropriate fraction of the diamine/TEA/THF mixture followed by 50 µL of a 1M solution of BOP reagent in dimethylformamide (DMF). The vial was then capped with a telfon-lined lid and stirred for 1 h at room temperature. After this time, 4 mL of ethyl ether and 2 mL of water were added to the vial. After shaking and allowing the layers to settle, the aqueous layer was withdrawn with a pipette. Next, 2 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution was added and the procedure repeated. This was followed by a similar wash with saturated sodium chloride solution. Sodium sulfate was added to the vial, and after drying, the mixture was pipetted into a preweighed, prelabeled 20-mL scintillation vial via a 6-in Pasteur pipette containing a small cotton plug. Following this, 2 mL of chloroform was added to the drying agent and the vial shaken after which the chloroform rinse was filtered as above. The collecting vials were placed under a nitrogen outlet and allowed to evaporate. Once the solvent was removed, the vials were placed in a high vacuum desiccator and allowed to remain overnight. The vials were reweighed, and the crude yield determined by difference. Since pilot studies showed that the BOP-coupling reaction produced very clean samples, the products were used without further purification, and the purity was taken to be 100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to screening, all compounds were diluted to a concentration of 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Dilution was accomplished by determining the mean mmol/vial for each batch of 20 reactions using an Excel 3.0 spreadsheet. Weights deviating from the mean by >±10% were grouped into a second and third set above and below the mean. These were also averaged within the same parameters. Any compounds not falling within the above sets were diluted individually according to their weight This procedure permitted sample dilution to be accomplished using a minimum number of different volume deliveries of DMSO. Once diluted to 10 mM, 1-mL samples from each vial were withdrawn and placed in rows A and E (one compound/well) of a 1 mL x 96-well polypropylene microtiter plate. Serial dilution was then performed using Matrix multichannel pipettors which provided a 1-mM solution in rows B and F and a 0.1-mM solution in rows C and G. Once all of the compounds were transferred to plates and diluted to the proper concentration, the plates were placed in the refrigerator prior to assay.\n\n\n \n\n\nN-(2'-Aminoethyl)-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (6a).\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPrepared from N-(tert-butoxy)-glycine and (+)-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine according to the general procedure in 15% yield:\n1\n H NMR (MeOH-d4) δ 7.13-7.062 (t, 1H, \nJ\n=8.1 Hz), 6.77-6.74 (m, 2H), 6.59-6.55 (m, 1H), 3.31-3.29 (m, 1H), 2.83-2.70 (m, 3H), 2.5 (d, 2H, \nJ\n = 3.1 Hz), 2.46-2.27 (m, 3H), 2.00 (s, 1H), 1.6(d, 2H, \nJ\n = 3.1 Hz), 1.68 (d, 1H, \nJ\n =13.7 Hz), 1.29 (s, 3H), 0.89 (d, 3H, \nJ\n = 7.0 Hz); \n13\nC NMR (MeOH-d4) δ 158.5, 152.9, 130.0, 117.9, 113.9, 113.3, 61.6, 57.1, 51.5, 40.2, 39.5, 39.1, 32.0, 28.2, 16.7.

The reaction was initiated by the addition of membranes and terminated after 4 h by addition of 3 mL ice-cold (4°C) purified water (Milli-Q uv-Plus, Millipore) followed by rapid vacuum filtration through Whatman GF/B filters presoaked in purified water. The filters were then washed once with 5 mL ice-cold water. Bound radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectroscopy using a Taurus (Micromedic) liquid scintillation counter at 98% efficiency after an overnight extraction in 5 mL Cytoscint scintillation fluid. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 µM GTP-γ-S. Assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was performed at least 3x.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData Analysis. The data of the two separate experiments (opioid binding assays) or three experiments ([\n35\nS]-GTP-γ-S assay) were pooled and fit, using the nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting language MLAB-PC (Civilized Software, Bethesda, MD), to the two-parameter logistic equation\n6\n for the best-fit estimates of the IC\n50\n and slope factor. The K\ni\n values were then determined using the equation: IC\n50\n/1 + \n(\n[L]/K\nd\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n% Inhibition Data for Compounds of Formula (I) in a Kappa Receptor Assay\n\n \n \n \n \n
