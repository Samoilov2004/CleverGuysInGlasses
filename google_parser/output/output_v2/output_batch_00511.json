No. 10/858,969, filed Jun. 2, 2004, now pending; which claims the benefit of European Application No. 03012200.6, filed Jun. 5, 2003. The entire contents of the above-identified applications are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to imidazole derivatives of formula I,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare described hereinbelow. These compounds can be used in the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders. These compounds are useful, inter alia, in the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer' disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as chronic and acute pain.\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.\n\n\nGlutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays a unique role in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group, namely the ionotropic receptors, forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) belong to the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors.\n\n\nAt present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. According to their sequence homology, signal transduction mechanisms and agonist selectivity, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups:\n\n\nmGluR1 and mGluR5 belong to group I; mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II; and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8 belong to group III.\n\n\nLigands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the first group can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as chronic and acute pain.\n\n\nOther treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycemia. Further treatable indications are ischemia, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.\n\n\nDisorders mediated full or in part by mGluR5 are for example acute, traumatic and chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and anxiety, depression, pain and drug dependency (\nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents \n(2002), 12, (12)).\n\n\nSelective mGluR5 antagonists are especially useful for the treatment of anxiety and pain.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention relates to a compound of formula I,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n\nR\n1 \nis halogen or cyano;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis lower alkyl;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \n \naryl,\n \naryl substituted by one, two or three substituents, selected from the group consisting of:\n        \n \nhalogen,\n \nlower alkyl,\n \ncycloalkyl,\n \nlower alkyl-halogen,\n \ncyano,\n \nlower alkoxy,\n \n—NR′R″,\n \n1-morpholinyl,\n \n1-pyrrolidinyl,\n \n1-pyrrolidinyl substituted by —OR or —CH\n2\nOR,\n \npiperidinyl,\n \npiperidinyl substituted by —OR or —CH\n2\nOR,\n \n1,1-dioxo-thiomorpholinyl,\n \npiperazinyl, and\n \npiperazinyl substituted by a substituent selected from lower alkyl, cycloalkyl and —CH\n2\n-cycloalkyl,\n \n\n\n \nheteroaryl, and\n \nheteroaryl substituted by one, two or three substituents, selected from the group consisting of\n        \n \nhalogen,\n \nlower alkyl,\n \ncycloalkyl,\n \nlower alkyl-halogen,\n \ncyano,\n \nlower alkoxy,\n \n—NR′R″,\n \n1-morpholinyl,\n \n1-pyrrolidinyl,\n \n1-pyrrolidinyl substituted by —OR or —CH\n2\nOR,\n \npiperidinyl,\n \npiperidinyl substituted by —OR or —CH\n2\nOR,\n \n1,1-dioxo-thiomorpholinyl,\n \npiperazinyl, and\n \npiperazinyl substituted by a substituent selected from lower alkyl, cycloalkyl and —CH\n2\n-cycloalkyl;\n\n\nR is selected from the group consisting hydrogen, lower alkyl, cycloalkyl and —CH\n2\n-cycloalkyl;\n\n\nR′ and R″ are each independently selected from the group hydrogen, lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, —CH\n2\n-cycloalkyl, and —(CH\n2\n)\nn\nOR, wherein n is 1 or 2; and\n\n\nR\n4 \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, —C(O)H, and —CH\n2\nR\n5 \nwherein R\n5 \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, —OH, lower alkyl and C\n3-12 \ncycloalkyl; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nAnother embodiment of this invention is related to a process for preparing a compound according to general formula I following the general procedures as outlined above for compounds of formula I.

Inorganic or organic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I. Compounds which contain the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, for example sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or the like, basic amines or basic amino acids are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic compounds.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, as already mentioned above, metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and can be used for the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders, such as acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as acute and chronic pain. Treatable neurological disorders are for instance epilepsy, schizophrenia, anxiety, acute, traumatic or chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Huntington's chorea, ALS, multiple sclerosis, dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficient functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, ethanol addiction, nicotine addiction, psychoses, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depression. Other treatable indications are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycemia.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are especially useful as analgesics. Treatable kinds of pain include inflammatory pain such as arthritis and rheumatoid disease, vasculitis, neuropathic pain such as trigeminal or herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy pain, causalgia, hyperalgesia, severe chronic pain, post-operative pain and pain associated with various conditions like cancer, angina, renal or billiay colic, menstruation, migraine and gout.\n\n\nThe pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:\n\n\nFor binding experiments, cDNA encoding human mGlu 5a receptor was transiently transfected into EBNA cells using a procedure described by Schlaeger and Christensen [Cyto-technology 15:1-13 (1998)]. Cell membrane homogenates were stored at −80° C. until the day of assay where upon they were thawed and resuspended and polytronised in 15 mM Tris-HCl, 120 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 25 mM CaCl\n2\n, 25 mM MgCl\n2 \nbinding buffer at pH 7.4 to a final assay concentration of 20 μg protein/well.\n\n\nSaturation isotherms were determined by addition of twelve [\n3\nH]MPEP concentrations (0.04-100 nM) to these membranes (in a total volume of 200 μl) for 1 h at 4° C. Competition experiments were performed with a fixed concentration of [\n3\nH]MPEP (2 nM) and IC\n50 \nvalues of test compounds evaluated using 11 concentrations (0.3-10,000 nM). Incubations were performed for 1 h at 4° C.\n\n\nAt the end of the incubation, membranes were filtered onto unifilter (96-well white microplate with bonded GF/C filter preincubated 1 h in 0.1% PEI in wash buffer, Packard BioScience, Meriden, Conn.) with a Filtermate 96 harvester (Packard BioScience) and washed 3 times with cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 buffer. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μM MPEP. The radioactivity on the filter was counted (3 min) on a Packard Top-count microplate scintillation counter with quenching correction after addition of 45 μl of microscint 40 (Can berra Packard S. A., Zürich, Switzerland) and shaking for 20 min. For functional assays, [Ca\n2+\n]i measurements were performed as described previously by Porter et al. [Br. J. Pharmacol. 128:13-20 (1999)] on recombinant human mGlu 5a receptors in HEK-293 cells. The cells were dye loaded using Fluo 4-AM (obtainable by FLUKA, 0.2 μM final concentration). [Ca\n2+\n]i measurements were performed using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices Corporation, La Jolla, Calif., USA). Antagonist evaluation was performed following a 5 min preincubation with the test compounds followed by the addition of a submaximal addition of agonist.\n\n\nThe inhibition (antagonists) curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation giving IC\n50\n, and Hill coefficient using an iterative non linear curve fitting software (Xcel fit).\n\n\nFor binding experiments the Ki values of the compounds tested are given. The Ki value is defined by the following formula:\n\n\n\nK\n \ni\n \n=IC\n \n50\n/[1\n+L/K\n \nd\n]\n\n\nin which the IC\n50 \nvalues are those concentrations of the compounds tested which cause 50% inhibition of the competing radioligand ([\n3\nH]MPEP). L is the concentration of radioligand used in the binding experiment and the K\nd \nvalue of the radioligand is empirically determined for each batch of membranes prepared.\n\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are mGluR 5a receptor antagonists. The activities of compounds of formula I as measured in the assay described above are in the range of K\ni\n<70 nM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n26\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n31\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragées, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such as carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragées and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.\n\n\nIn addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.\n\n\nThe dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.\n\n\nThe following examples are provided to further elucidate the invention:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\n2-Chloro-4-[1-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-2-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-ylethynyl]-pyridine\n\n\n2-Chloro-4-iodopyridine (1.39 g, 5.8 mmol) was dissolved in 50 mL dry THF.

Furthermore, the present invention relates to a sulfonamide compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof useful as an EP1 receptor antagonist.\n\n\nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\nOveractive bladder that is one of the diseases leading to a lower urinary tract symptom refers to a clinical condition showing an urinary urgency regardless of the presence or absence of incontinence, which is usually accompanied by a urinary frequency and nocturnal urinary frequency (Non-Patent Document 1). For a treatment of the disease, currently an anticholinergic agent is mainly used, and constant treatment results are given. However, it has been reported that the anticholinergic agent is difficult to be used for patients with prostatic hypertrophy or elderly patients because it is known to cause side-effects such as dry mouth, constipation and blurred vision, as well as a risk of urinary retention. In addition, there are patients showing no improvement with the anticholinergic agent. From the above facts, there is a great expectation about a drug with a new mechanism of action for overactive bladder.\n\n\nProstaglandin E\n2 \n(PGE\n2\n) is a bioactive substance, a precursor of which is arachidonic acid, and is known to participate in regulating functions of the body through 4 subtypes of G-protein coupled receptors, i.e., EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4.\n\n\nIt has been known that intravesical instillation of PGE\n2 \nresults in strong urinary urgency and reduction in the bladder capacity in humans (Non-Patent Document 2), and that it results in reduction in the bladder capacity of a rat (Non-Patent Document 3). Accordingly, it has been suggested that there is a possibility that PGE\n2 \ninfluences the function of lower urinary tract. Recently, there has been reported that administration of an EP1 receptor antagonist to a model rat with spinal cord injury is useful in improving the urination function (Non-Patent Document 4), and suggested that the abnormal urination function of a model mouse with urethral stricture is lost in EP1 receptor knock-out mice, and that intravesical instillation of PGE\n2 \nshows hyperactivity of the abnormal urination function (Patent Document 1). From these, it is believed that the EP1 receptor antagonist is useful as a remedy for a lower urinary tract symptom.\n\n\nMoreover, the EP1 receptor antagonist has such a mechanism that particular side effects caused by an anticholinergic agent are expected to be avoided, and an effect on patients whom showed no improvement with the anticholinergic agent is also expected. In addition, this agent is expected to improve certain symptoms further by acting on sensory nerves. Furthermore, this agent has been reported to exhibit an effect of improving clinical condition without lowering the urination efficiency in a model rat with spinal cord injury (Non-Patent Document 5), and thus it is expected to be administered safely to patients with prostatic hypertrophy or elderly patients.\n\n\nIn addition, it has been widely known that PGE\n2 \nis produced locally due to inflammation or tissue damage, and enhances the inflammation reaction as well as participating in giving pain or fever. Recently, it has been known that an EP1 receptor antagonist shows efficacy in the model animals with pains of various types such as inflammatory pain (Non-Patent Document 6), postoperative pain (Non-Patent Document 7), and neuropathic pain (Non-Patent Document 8). There is also a report on the clinical effect of administering an EP1 receptor antagonist on visceral pain caused by hydrochloric acid (Non-Patent Document 9). From these, it is believed that the EP1 receptor antagonist is also useful as a remedy for various pains.\n\n\nMoreover, it has been known that the EP1 receptor antagonist has an inhibitory effect on aberrant crypt foci of the colonic mucosa and on intestinal polyp formation (Patent Document 2), thus it is believed to be useful as a remedy for colon cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, or the like.\n\n\nAs a sulfonamide compound having an EP1 receptor antagonistic activity, for example, compounds mentioned in Patent Documents 3 and 4 have been reported.\n\n\nPatent Document 3 discloses a compound represented by the formula (A):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(wherein A and B each independently represents a C5 to 15 carbon ring or a 5- to 7-membered heterocycle, Z\n3 \nrepresents a single bond or C1 to 4 alkylene, Z\n4 \nrepresents SO\n2 \nor CO, R\n2 \nrepresents an amide bond, —O—Cl to 4 alkylene, or the like, R\n4 \nrepresents (1) hydrogen, (2) C1 to 8 alkyl, C2 to 8 alkenyl, or C2 to 8 alkynyl, (3) C1 to 6 alkyl substituted with 1 or 2 substituents selected from the group consisting of COOZ\n8\n, CONZ\n9\nZ\n10\n, OZ\n8\n, and C1 to 4 alkoxy, (4) C3 to 7 cycloalkyl, or (5) C1 to 4 alkyl, C2 to 4 alkenyl, or C2 to 4 alkynyl, each of which substituted with phenyl or C3 to 7 cycloalkyl, and further, Z\n8\n, Z\n9\n, and Z\n10 \neach independently represents hydrogen or C1 to 4 alkyl.

The “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug” is a compound having a group which is converted into NH\n2\n, OH, CO\n2\nH, or the like of the present invention by solvolysis or under a physiological condition.

Further, depending on the kind of the functional groups, it is sometimes effective from the viewpoint of the preparation techniques to protect the functional group with an appropriate protecting group, or to replace it by a group which may be easily converted into the functional group, during the steps of from starting materials to intermediates. Examples of such a functional group include an amino group, a hydroxyl group, and a carboxyl group, and examples of such a protecting group include those as described in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, edited by T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, (USA), 3\nrd \nedition, John Wiley & Sons, 1999, which may be optionally selected and used in response to the reaction conditions. By such a method, a desired compound can be obtained by introducing the protecting group to carry out the reaction, and then, if desired, removing the protecting group or converting it into a desired group.\n\n\nIn addition, a prodrug of the compound of the present invention can be prepared by introducing a specific group during the steps for from starting materials to intermediates, in a similar way to the aforementioned protecting groups, or by carrying out the reaction with the obtained compound of the present invention. The reaction may be carried out by employing a method known to a skilled person in the art, such as common esterification, amidation, and dehydration.\n\n\nHereinbelow, the representative production processes of the compounds of the present invention are described. Further, the production processes of the present invention are not limited to the examples as shown below.\n\n\n(Production Process 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is a process for preparing the compound (I) of the present invention by reacting a compound (IV) with a compound (III) or a reactive derivative thereof. Examples of the reactive derivative include an acid halide (acid chloride, acid bromide or the like), an acid anhydride (mixed acid anhydrides obtained by the reaction with ethyl chlorocarbonate, benzyl chlorocarbonate, phenyl chlorocarbonate, p-toluenesulfonic acid, isovaleric acid or the like, or symmetric acid anhydrides), an active ester (an ester which may be prepared using a phenol which may be substituted with an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., a nitro group, a fluorine atom or the like), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), N-hydroxysuccinimide (HONSu) or the like), a lower alkyl ester, and an acid azide. These reactive derivatives can be produced by conventional methods. The reaction can be carried out using equimolar of the carboxylic acid compound (III) or a reactive derivative thereof and the compound (IV), or one of them in excess amount, from under cooling to heating in a reaction-inert solvent such as aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), ethyl acetate, and acetonitrile. Depending on the kind of the reactive derivatives, it is sometimes advantageous in advancing the reaction smoothly to carry out the reaction in the presence of a base (preferably, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, pyridine, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine, or the like). Pyridine can also serve as a solvent.\n\n\nWhen a free carboxylic acid is used, it is desirable to use a condensing agent (N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide (WSC), 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), N,N′-disuccinimidyl carbonate, a Bop reagent (manufactured by Aldrich, USA), 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), diphenylphosphoric acid azide (DPPA), phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus trichloride, triphenylphosphine/N-bromosuccinimide or the like), and if desired, an additive (for example, HONSu and HOBt).\n\n\n(Production Process 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(wherein Lv\n2 \nrepresents a leaving group. The same shall apply hereinafter.)\n\n\nThis step is a process for preparing the compound (I) of the present invention by alkylating a compound (VI) to a compound (V) with a leaving group. The leaving group represented by Lv\n2 \nmay be any leaving group which is generally used in the nucleophilic substitution reaction, and, as for this, halogen such as chloro and bromo; sulfonyloxy such as methanesulfonyloxy, p-toluenesulfonyloxy, and trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy; sulfonyl such as lower alkylsulfonyl and arylsulfonyl; and the like may be suitably used. As the alkylation reaction of this step, the alkylation generally used by those skilled in the art may be employed. For example, this may be carried out from at room temperature to heat under reflux without solvent or in a reaction-inert solvent such as the aforementioned aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, esters such as ethyl acetate, ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dioxane, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and chloroform, DMF, DMA, NMP, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and acetonitrile, or in a solvent such as alcohols or the like. Depending on the compounds, it is sometimes advantageous for smoothly advancing the reaction to carry out the reaction in the presence of an organic base (triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, pyridine, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine or the like is suitably used), or a metal salt base (potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydride, potassium tert-butoxide or the like is suitably used).\n\n\n(Production Process 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(wherein Lv\n1 \nrepresents a leaving group. The same shall apply hereinafter.)\n\n\nThis step is a process for preparing the compound (I) of the present invention by sulfonylating the compound (VII) by a compound (VIII). As the leaving group of Lv\n1\n, halogen such as chloro and bromo is suitably used. The reaction can be carried out, for example, by employing the sulfonylation condition described in the aforementioned “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”. Specifically, the reaction can be carried out without a solvent, or in a solvent such as THF, methylene chloride, and acetonitrile, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine and pyridine if necessary, from under cooling to heat under reflux.\n\n\n(Production Process 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(wherein ALK represents lower alkyl. The same shall apply hereinafter.)\n\n\nThis step is a process for preparing the compound (II-b) of the present invention in which Z is carboxyl, by hydrolysis of the compound (II-a) of the present invention in which Z is an ester. The hydrolysis reaction of this step can be carried out, for example, in accordance with the deprotection reaction described in the aforementioned “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”.\n\n\nIn addition, some compounds represented by the formulae (I) and (II) can be prepared from the compounds of the present invention obtained by the aforementioned methods and variations thereof, or by any combination of well-known processes that can be usually employed by a skilled person in the art, such as alkylation, acylation, substitution reaction, oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and deprotection.\n\n\nThe starting material compounds used in the preparation of the compounds of the present invention can be prepared, for example, by using the methods as described below, well-known methods, or variations thereof.\n\n\n(Starting Material Synthesis 1)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFirst Step\n\n\n\nThis step is a process for preparing a compound (VI) by sulfonylating the compound (IX) by a compound (VIII). The sulfonylation of this step can be carried out in the same manner as the sulfonylation in Production Process 3.\n\n\nSecond Step\n\n\nThis step is a process for preparing a compound (XI) by alkylating the compound (VI) by a compound (X) containing a leaving group. The alkylation of this step can be carried out in the same manner as the alkylation in Production Process 2.\n\n\nThird Step\n\n\nThis step is a process for preparing a compound (III) from a compound (XI) by hydrolysis. The hydrolysis reaction of this step can be carried out in the same manner as the hydrolysis reaction in Production Process 4.\n\n\n(Starting Material Synthesis 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(wherein Lv\n3 \nrepresents a leaving group. The same shall apply hereinafter.)\n\n\nThis step is a process for preparing a compound (V) by acylating the compound (IV) by a compound (XII) containing a leaving group. As the leaving group of Lv\n3\n, halogen such as chloro and bromo is suitably used. For example, the reaction can be carried out by employing the acylation condition described in the aforementioned “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”. Specifically, it can be carried out without a solvent, or in a solvent such as THF, methylene chloride, and acetonitrile, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine and pyridine if necessary, from under cooling to heat under reflux.\n\n\n(Starting Material Synthesis 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is a process for preparing a compound (VII) by alkylating the compound (IX) by the compound (V) containing a leaving group. The alkylation of this step can be carried out in the same manner as the alkylation in Production Process 2.\n\n\nThe reaction products obtained by each of Production Processes can be isolated and purified as their free compounds, or salts or various solvates thereof, such as hydrates. The salts can be prepared after carrying out a conventional salt formation treatment.\n\n\nThe isolation and purification can be carried out by employing common chemical operations such as extraction, concentration, removal by distillation, crystallization, filtration, recrystallization, and various chromatography techniques.\n\n\nVarious isomers can be isolated by conventional method making use of the differences in physicochemical properties among the isomers. For example, the optical isomers can be separated by general optical resolutions, for example, by fractional crystallization, chromatography, or the like. In addition, the optical isomers can also be prepared from appropriate starting material compounds that are optically active.\n\n\nThe effects of the compounds of the present invention were confirmed by the following tests.\n\n\n1.

Nonspecific bindings were determined as bindings in the presence of an excessive amount (2.5 μM) of label-free PGE\n2\n. The assessment of inhibitory effect on \n3\nH-PGE\n2 \nbinding by the compound was carried out by adding 2.5 nM \n3\nH-PGE\n2 \nand the compound.\n\n\nThe inhibition constant Ki(nM) for each compound was obtained using the following formula:\n\n\n\nKi=IC\n \n50\n/(1+([\nC]/Kd\n))\n\n\n\nwherein [C] represents the concentration of \n3\nH-PGE\n2 \nemployed in a reaction system.\n\n\nThe results are shown in Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCompound\n \nKi (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPre1\n \n0.68\n \n \n \n \n \nEx7\n \n0.57\n \n \n \n \n \nEx16\n \n1.00\n \n \n \n \n \nEx20\n \n0.74\n \n \n \n \n \nEx38\n \n0.48\n \n \n \n \n \nEx40\n \n0.33\n \n \n \n \n \nEx74\n \n0.35\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(3) Effects on Rats with Acetic Acid-Induced Urinary Frequency\n\n\n\nThe anti-pollakiuria action of the compound was assessed using a pathological model. It has been reported that applying acetic acid to rat urinary bladder damages the bladder mucosa, thereby activating the nociceptive stimulus transmittance afferent (The Journal of Neuroscience, US, 12 (12): p. 4878-89). Since urinary frequency is induced by treating intra-bladder with acetic acid, it is possible to assess remedial effects of the compound against the symptoms.\n\n\nFor the experiment, male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories) weighing between 200 and 450 g were used. The urinary bladder was exteriorized by median abdominal incision under pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg, i.p.), and residual urine in the urinary bladder was removed with a syringe equipped with a 27G needle. Thereafter, 0.5 to 0.7 mL of a 1% acetic acid solution was injected into the bladder and the wound was closed. 2 days after, further experiment was carried out. Rats were placed in metabolic cages for acclimation for 1 hour, and then the test drug was injected. Immediately thereafter, change in the amount of urine output was sequentially measured for 6 hours. Total urine output was divided by total urination incidents to calculate the effective bladder capacity. As a result, it was noted that the effective bladder capacity of the group the bladder of which had been treated with acetic acid was decreased as compared to that of the sham-operated group, and thus showed symptoms of urinary frequency. On the other hand, the compound of the invention highly improved the urinary frequency symptom.\n\n\nFrom the test results (1) to (3), it was confirmed that the compound of the present invention has a potent EP1 receptor antagonistic activity, and that it greatly improves the urinary frequency symptom.\n\n\nThus, the compound of the present invention is effective as a remedy for EP1 receptor-related diseases, especially for a lower urinary tract symptom.\n\n\nExamples of diseases that cause ‘a lower urinary tract symptom’ in the present invention include overactive bladder, BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia), bladder neck contracture, cystitis, prostatitis and the like.\n\n\nThe ‘a lower urinary tract symptom’ in the present invention include urinary storage symptoms such as diurnal urinary frequency, nocturnal urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and urinary urge incontinence; voiding symptoms such as weak urination, interrupted urine flow, and delayed urination; post-urination symptoms such as residual urine sensation; and genital/lower abdominal pain such as bladder pain, urethral pain, perineal pain, scrotal pain, and pelvic pain. Furthermore, urinary storage symptoms, voiding symptoms and post-urination symptoms include urinary storage symptoms, voiding symptoms and post-urination symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. In addition, urinary storage symptoms include urinary storage symptoms associated with overactive bladder, cystitis and prostatitis.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical composition containing at least one or more kinds of the compound or a salt thereof of the present invention as an active ingredient is prepared by using pharmaceutical carriers, excipients, other additives and the like, usually used in the field according to a usual method.\n\n\nTherapeutic administration may be made in any one form for either oral administration via tablets, pills, capsules, granules, powders, liquids, etc., or for parenteral administration via injections for intravenous injection and intramuscular injection, suppositories, transdermal preparations, transnasal preparations, inhalers, or the like.

Such a composition may further contain tonicity agents, antiseptics, moistening agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, stabilizing agents, and solubilization assisting agents. These are sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, blending of germicides or irradiation. In addition, these can also be used by producing a sterile solid composition, and dissolving or suspending it in sterile water or a sterile solvent for injection prior to their use.\n\n\nThe drug for external use may include ointments, plasters, creams, jellies, patches, sprays, lotions, eye-drops, eye ointments, and the like. The drug contains generally used ointment bases, lotion bases, aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, and the like Examples of the ointment bases or lotion bases include polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, white vaseline, bleached bee wax, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil, glyceryl monostearate, stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, lauromacrogol, and sorbitan sesquioleate.\n\n\nRegarding transmucosal agents such as inhalers and transnasal agents, those in the form of solid, liquid or semi-solid state are used, and may be produced in accordance with a conventionally known method. For example, excipients such as lactose and starch, and also pH adjusting agents, antiseptics, surfactants, lubricants, stabilizers, thickeners, and the like may be optionally added thereto, if necessary. For their administration, appropriate devices for inhalation or insufflation may be used. For example, a compound may be administered alone or as a powder of formulated mixture, or as solutions or suspensions by combining it with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, using conventionally known devices or sprayers, such as measured-dose inhalers. The dry powder inhalers or the like may be for single or multiple administration use, and dry powders or powder-containing capsules may be used. Alternatively, these may be in the form such as a high pressure aerosol spray or the like which uses an appropriate propellant, for example, a suitable gas such as chlorofluoroalkane, hydrofluoroalkane, and carbon dioxide.\n\n\nPREPARATIVE EXAMPLES AND EXAMPLES\n\n\nHereinbelow, the methods for preparing the compound of the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to Preparative Examples and Examples of the compound of the present invention, but the present invention is not limited to these Preparative Examples and Examples.
