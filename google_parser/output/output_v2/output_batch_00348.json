Description\n\n\n\n\n Melanocortin-1 Receptor-Specific Linear Peptides \n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION \n\n\n This application claims priority to and the benefit of the filing of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/263,486 entitled \"Melanocortin-1 Receptor-Specific Linear Peptides\", filed on November 23, 2009, and the specification and claims thereof of are incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n Field of the Invention (Technical Field): \n\n\n The present invention relates to melanocortin receptor-specific linear peptides, particularly linear peptides selective and specific for the melanocortin-1 receptor, which may be used in the treatment of melanocortin-1 receptor-mediated or responsive diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. \n\n\n Description of Related Art: \n\n\n The following discussion refers to a number of publications by author(s) and year of publication, and that due to recent publication dates certain publications are not to be considered as prior art vis-a-vis the present invention. Discussion of such publications herein is given for more complete background and is not to be construed as an admission that such publications are prior art for patentability determination purposes. \n\n\n A family of melanocortin receptor types and subtypes has been identified. Receptor types include melanocortin-1 (MC-1 ) receptor (MCR-1 ), commonly known to be expressed in normal human melanocytes and on melanoma cells, but which is also reported to be expressed in various other cells, including those involved in immune responses, such as monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells and endothelial cells. See generally, Kang, L., et al., \"A selective small molecule agonist of melanocortin-1 receptor inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine accumulation and leukocyte infiltration in mice,\" J. Leuk. Biol. 80:897-904 (2006), and references cited therein. A variety of human MCR-1 subtypes and variants are known, including those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,693, 184 and 7, 1 15,393. In addition to MCR-1 , other melanocortin receptor types include melanocortin-2 receptor (MCR-2) for ACTH (adrenocorticotropin), expressed in cells of the adrenal gland, melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 (MC-4) receptors (MCR-3 and MCR-4), expressed primarily in cells in the hypothalamus, mid-brain and brainstem, and melanocortin-5 receptor (MCR-5), expressed in a wide distribution of peripheral tissues. \n\n\n The primary endogenous melanocortin agonist is the cyclic a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\"a-MSH\") peptide. Melanocortin receptor-specific peptides generally contain the central tetrapeptide sequence of native a-MSH, His\n6\n-Phe\n7\n-Arg\n8\n-Trp\n9\n (SEQ ID NO: 1 ), or a mimetic or variation thereof, including various substitutions at one or more positions (see, e.g., Hruby, V.

Thus, \"Nle\" is norleucine, \"Asp\" is aspartic acid, \"His\" is histidine, \"Phe\" is phenylalanine, \"Arg\" is arginine, \"Trp\" is tryptophan, and \"Lys\" is lysine, and so on. It is to be understood that \"D\" isomers are designated by a \"D-\" before the three letter code or amino acid name, such that for example D-Phe is D-phenylalanine. Amino acid residues not encompassed by the foregoing have the following definitions: \n\n\n Abbreviation Common Name Side Chain or Amino Acid Structure \n\n\n Aib alpha-aminoisobutyric acid \n\n\nCit citrulline \n\n\n \n\n Abbreviation Common Name Side Chain or Amino Acid Structure\n\n\nDab diaminobutyric acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dap diaminoproprionic acid \n\n\n \n'\nNHL hGlu homoglutamic acid \n\n\nHyp hydroxyproline \n\n\nHyp(Bzl) O-benzyl-hydroxyproline \n\n\nNal 1 3-(1 -naphthyl)alanine \n\n\nNal 2 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine \n\n\nNIe norleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Orn ornithine \n\n Abbreviation Common Name Side Chain or Amino Acid Structure \n\n\n Pro(4-Bzl) 4-benzyl-proline \n\n\nPro(4-NH\n2\n) 4-amino-proline \n\n\nSar sarcosine \n\n\n\n\n\n An \"a, a-disubstituted amino acid\" means any a-amino acid having a further substituent in the oposition, which substituent may be the same as or different from the side chain moiety of the o amino acid . Suitable substituents, in addition to the side chain moiety of the a-amino acid , include Ci to C\n6\n linear or branched alkyl. Aib is an example of an a, a-disubstituted amino acid . While a, a- disubstituted amino acids can be referred to using conventional L- and D-isomeric references, it is to be understood that such references are for convenience, and that where the substituents at the a- position are different, such amino acid can interchangeably be referred to as an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from the L- or D-isomer, as appropriate, of a residue with the designated amino acid side chain moiety. Thus (S)-2-Amino-2-methyl-hexanoic acid can be referred to as either an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from L-Nle or as an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from D-Ala. Similarly, Aib can be referred to as an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from Ala. \n\n\nWhenever an a, a-disubstituted amino acid is provided, it is to be understood as including all (R) and (S) configurations thereof. Whenever a claim or description herein refers to an \"amino acid\", such designation includes, but is not limited to, an \"a, a-disubstituted amino acid.\" \n\n\n An \"N-substituted amino acid\" means any amino acid wherein an amino acid side chain moiety is covalently bonded to the backbone amino group, including optionally where there are no substituents other than H in the a-carbon position. Sarcosine is an example of an N-substituted amino acid . By way of example, sarcosine can be referred to as an N-substituted amino acid derivative of Ala, in that the amino acid side chain moiety of sarcosine and Ala is the same, methyl. Whenever a claim or description herein refers to an \"amino acid\", such designation includes, but is not limited to, an \"\"N-substituted amino acid.\" \n\n\n The term \"alkane\" includes linear or branched saturated hydrocarbons. Examples of linear alkane groups include methane, ethane, propane, and the like. Examples of branched or substituted \n\n alkane groups include methylbutane or dimethylbutane, methylpentane, dimethylpentane or trimethylpentane, and the like. In general, any alkyl group may be a substitutent of an alkane. \n\n\n The term \"alkene\" includes unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain one or more double carbon- carbon bonds. Examples of such alkene groups include ethylene, propene, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"alkenyl\" includes a linear monovalent hydrocarbon radical of two to six carbon atoms or a branched monovalent hydrocarbon radical of three to six carbon atoms containing at least one double bond; examples thereof include ethenyl, 2-propenyl, and the like. \n\n\n The \"alkyl\" groups specified herein include those alkyl radicals of the designated length in either a straight or branched configuration. Examples of such alkyl radicals include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"alkyne\" includes a linear monovalent hydrocarbon radical of two to six carbon atoms or a branched monovalent hydrocarbon radical of three to six carbon atoms containing at least one triple bond; examples thereof include ethyne, propyne, butyne, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"aryl\" includes a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon radical of 6 to 12 ring atoms, and optionally substituted independently with one or more substituents selected from alkyl, haloalkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, alkythio, halo, nitro, acyl, cyano, amino, monosubstituted amino, disubstituted amino, hydroxy, carboxy, or alkoxy-carbonyl. Examples of an aryl group include phenyl, biphenyl, naphthyl, 1-naphthyl, and 2-naphthyl, derivatives thereof, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"aralkyl\" includes a radical - R\na\nR\nb\n where R\na\n is an alkylene (a bivalent alkyl) group and R\nb\n is an aryl group as defined above. Examples of aralkyl groups include benzyl, phenylethyl, 3- (3-chlorophenyl)-2-methylpentyl, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"aliphatic\" includes compounds with hydrocarbon chains, such as for example alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and derivatives thereof. \n\n\n The term \"acyl\" includes a group R(C=0)-, where R is an organic group. An example is the acetyl group CH\n3\n-C(=0)-, referred to herein as \"Ac\". \n\n\n A peptide or aliphatic moiety is \"acylated\" when an alkyl or substituted alkyl group as defined above is bonded through one or more carbonyl {-(C=0)-} groups. A peptide is most usually acylated at the N-terminus. \n\n\n An \"omega amino aliphatic chain\" includes an aliphatic moiety with a terminal amino group. Examples of omega amino aliphatic chains include aminoheptanoyl and the amino acid side chain moieties of ornithine and lysine. \n\n\n The term \"heteroaryl\" includes mono- and bicyclic aromatic rings containing from 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl are monocyclic heteroaromatic rings; examples thereof include thiazole, oxazole, thiophene, furan, pyrrole, imidazole, isoxazole, pyrazole, triazole, thiadiazole, tetrazole, oxadiazole, pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, and the like. Bicyclic heteroaromatic rings include, but are not limited to, benzothiadiazole, indole, benzothiophene, benzofuran, benzimidazole, benzisoxazole, benzothiazole, quinoline, benzotriazole, benzoxazole, isoquinoline, purine, furopyridine and thienopyridine. \n\n\n An \"amide\" includes compounds that have a trivalent nitrogen attached to a carbonyl group (-C(=0)-NH\n2\n), such as for example methylamide, ethylamide, propylamide, and the like. \n\n\n An \"imide\" includes compounds containing an imido group (-C(=0)-NH-C(=0)-). \n\n An \"amine\" includes compounds that contain an amino group (-NH\n2\n). \n\n\n A \"nitrile\" includes compounds that contain a (-CN) group bound to an organic group. \n\n\n The term \"halogen\" includes the halogen atoms fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, and groups including one or more halogen atoms, such as -CF\n3\n and the like. \n\n\n The term \"composition\", as in pharmaceutical composition, encompasses a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions utilized in the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing an active ingredient and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. \n\n\n By a melanocortin receptor \"agonist\" is meant an endogenous substance, drug substance or compound, including a compound such as the peptides of the present invention, which can interact with a melanocortin receptor and initiate a pharmacological response, including but not limited to adenyl cyclase activation, characteristic of the melanocortin receptor. For the present invention, a melanocortin receptor agonist which is an agonist at MCR-1 is preferred. \n\n\n By \"a-MSH\" is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val- NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:2) and analogs and homologs thereof, including without limitation NDP-a-MSH. \n\n\n By \"NDP-a-MSH\" is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Nle-Glu-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys- Pro-Val-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:3) and analogs and homologs thereof. \n\n\n By \"EC\n50\n\" is meant the molar concentration of an agonist, including a partial agonist, which produced 50% of the maximum possible response for that agonist. By way of example, a test compound which, at a concentration of 72 nM, produces 50% of the maximum possible response for that compound as determined in a cAMP assay in an MCR-1 cell expression system has an EC\n50\n of 72 nM. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with an EC\n50\n determination is in nanomoles per liter (nM). \n\n\n By \"Ki (nM)\" is meant the equilibrium inhibitor dissociation constant representing the molar concentration of a competing compound that binds to half the binding sites of a receptor at equilibrium in the absence of radioligand or other competitors. In general, the numeric value of the Ki is inversely correlated to the affinity of the compound for the receptor, such that if the Ki is low, the affinity is high. Ki may be determined using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22: 3099-3108, 1973): \n\n\n ^ _ EC50 \n\n\n ' \n\"\n \n|\n [ligand]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \"ligand\" is the concentration of radioligand and K\nD\n is an inverse measure of receptor affinity for the radioligand which produces 50% receptor occupancy by the radioligand. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with a Ki determination is in nM. Ki may be expressed in terms of specific receptors (e.g., MCR-1 , MCR-3, MCR-4 or MCR-5), specific species (e.g., human or murine), and specific ligands (e.g., a-MSH or NDP-a-MSH). \n\n By \"inhibition\" is meant the percent attenuation, or decrease in receptor binding, in a competitive inhibition assay compared to a known standard. Thus, by \"inhibition at 1 μΜ (NDP-α- MSH)\" is meant the percent decrease in binding of NDP-a-MSH by addition of a determined amount of the compound to be tested, such as 1 μΜ of a test compound, such as under the assay conditions hereafter described. By way of example, a test compound that does not inhibit binding of NDP-a- MSH has a 0% inhibition, and a test compound that completely inhibits binding of NDP-a-MSH has a 100% inhibition. Typically, as described hereafter, a radio assay is used for competitive inhibition testing, such as with l \n25\n-labeled NDP-a-MSH, or a lanthanide chelate fluorescent assay, such as with Eu-NDP-a-MSH. However, other methods of testing competitive inhibition are known, including use of label or tag systems other than radioisotopes, and in general any method known in the art for testing competitive inhibition may be employed in this invention. It may thus be seen that \"inhibition\" is one measure to determine whether a test compound attenuates binding of a-MSH to melanocortin receptors. \n\n\n By \"binding affinity\" is meant the ability of a compound or drug to bind to its biological target, expressed herein as Ki (nM). \n\n\n In general, \"functional activity\" is a measure of the signaling of a receptor, or measure of a change in receptor-associated signaling, such as a melanocortin receptor, and in particular MCR-1 or hMCR-1 , upon activation by a compound. Melanocortin receptors initiate signal transduction through activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. In one aspect, melanocortin receptors signal through Ga\ns\n, which catalyzes production of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase. Thus determination of stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, such as determination of maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, is one measure of functional activity, and is the primary measure exemplified herein. However, it is to be understood that alternative measures of functional activity may be employed in the practice of this invention, and are specifically contemplated and included within the scope of this invention. Thus, in one example intracellular free calcium may be measured, such as reported by and using the methods disclosed in Mountjoy, K. G., et al., \"Melanocortin receptor-medicated mobilization of intracellular free calcium in HEK293 cells,\" Physiol. Genomics 5:1 1-19 (2001 ), or Kassack, M. U., et al., \"Functional screening of G protein-coupled receptors by measuring intracellular calcium with a fluorescence microplate reader,\" Biomol. Screening 7:233-246 (2002). It is also possible to measure activation by \n\n\nmeasurement of the production of inositol triphosphate or diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5- biphosphate, such as by use of radioassays. Yet another measure of functional activity is receptor internalization, resulting from activation of regulatory pathways, such as using the methods disclosed in Nickolls, S. A., et al., \"Functional selectivity of melanocortin 4 receptor peptide and nonpeptide agonists: evidence for ligand specific conformational states,\" J. Pharm. Exper. Therapeutics \n\n\n313:1281-1288 (2005). Yet another measure of functional activity is the exchange, and exchange rate, of nucleotides associated with activation of a G protein receptor, such as the exchange of GDP (guanosine diphosphate) for GTP (guanosine triphosphase) on the G protein a subunit, which may be measured by any number of means, including a radioassay using guanosine 5'-(y-[\n35\nS]thio)- triphosphate, as disclosed in Manning, D. R., \"Measures of efficacy using G proteins as endpoints: differential engagement of G proteins through single receptors,\" Mol. Pharmacol. 62:451-452 (2002). Various gene-based assays have been developed for measuring activation of G-coupled proteins, \n\n such as those disclosed in Chen, W., et al., \"A colorimetric assay from measuring activation of Gs- and Gq-coupled signaling pathways,\" Anal. Biochem. 226:349-354 (1995); Kent, T. C, et al., \"Development of a generic dual-reporter gene assay for screening G-protein-coupled receptors,\" Biomol Screening 5:437-446 (2005); or Kotarsky, K., et al., \"Improved receptor gene assays used to identify ligands acting on orphan seven-transmembrane receptors,\" Pharmacology & Toxicology 93:249-258 (2003). The colorimetric assay of Chen et al. has been adapted for use in measuring melanocortin receptor activation, as disclosed in Hruby, V. J., et al., \"Cyclic lactam omelanocortin analogues of Ac-Nle\n4\n-cyclo[Asp\n5\n,D-Phe\n7\n,Lys\n101\n omelanocyte-stimulating hormone-(4-10)-NH\n2\n with bulky aromatic amino acids at position 7 shows high antagonist potency and selectivity at specific melanocortin receptors,\" J. Med. Chem. , 38:3454-3461 (1995). In general, functional activity may be measured by any method, including methods of determining activation and/or signaling of a G- coupled receptor, and further including methods which may be hereafter developed or reported. Each of the foregoing articles, and the methods disclosed therein, is incorporated here by reference as if set forth in full. \n\n\n The terms \"treat,\" \"treating\" and \"treatment,\" as used herein, contemplate an action that occurs while a patient is suffering from the specified disease or disorder, which reduces the severity of the disease or disorder. \n\n\n As used herein, the term \"therapeutically effective amount\" means the amount of a compound including a peptide of the invention that will elicit a biological or medical response in the mammal that is being treated by a medical doctor or other clinician. \n\n\n As used herein, the term \"prophylactically effective\" or \"preventive\" means the amount of a compound including a peptide of the invention that will prevent or inhibit affliction or mitigate affliction of a mammal with a medical condition that a medical doctor or other clinician is trying to prevent, inhibit, or mitigate before a patient begins to suffer from the specified disease or disorder. \n\n\n By \"circulatory shock\" is meant the general medical condition in which organs and/or tissues of the body of the subject, which subject may be human or animal, are not receiving an adequate flow of blood. Circulatory shock includes conditions such as hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, vasodilatory shock and the like. These conditions or dysfunctions in circulation can in turn have different causes, such as bacterial blood infection (septic shock or infectious), severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock), trauma (traumatic shock), severe bleeding or loss of blood (hemorrhagic shock), neurologic dysfunction causing abnormal opening of blood vessels (neurogenic shock) or endocrine related (endocrine shock). Circulatory shock can further result in ischemia and ischemic damage to bodily organs, tissues, cells or parts. Upon reperfusion, or restoration of blood flow, ischemia- reperfusion injury can occur, also resulting in damage to bodily organs, tissues, or cells. \n\n\n By \"inflammatory disease,\" also sometimes called an \"inflammatory condition,\" is meant a disease or condition characterized in part by inflammatory mechanisms, such as specific T lymphocyte reactions or antibody-antigen interactions causing the recruitment of inflammatory cells and endogenous mediator chemicals, including but not limited to cytokines, which mediator chemicals include but are not limited to one or more of increased NF-κΒ activity, increased TNF-a production, increased IL-1 production and increased IL-6 production. \n\n\n 2.0 Clinical Indications and Utility. \n\n The compositions and methods disclosed herein can be used for both medical applications and animal husbandry or veterinary applications. Typically, the methods are used in humans, but may also be used in other mammals. The term \"patient\" denotes a mammalian individual, and is so used throughout the specification and in the claims. The primary applications of the present invention involve human patients, but the present invention may be applied to laboratory, farm, zoo, wildlife, pet, sport or other animals. Clinical indications and specific utilities include the following: \n\n\n 2.1 Inflammatory Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n Peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention are directed towards the treatment of inflammatory diseases and inflammatory conditions in a subject. There are a number of inflammatory diseases and inflammatory conditions which may be so treated. In one aspect, the inflammatory condition results from a disease including a form of arthritis, including but not limited to osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, gout and pseudogout, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Still's disease and ankylosing spondylitis, as well as arthritis secondary to other diseases, such as arthritis secondary to lupus erythematosus, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, haemochromatosis, hepatitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, vasculitis syndromes, Lyme disease, familial Mediterranean fever, hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with recurrent fever, TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In another aspect, the inflammatory condition results from a disease including a form of inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, collagenous colitis, lymphocytic colitis, ischemic colitis, diversion colitis, Behget's syndrome, infective colitis and indeterminate colitis. In another aspect, the inflammatory condition results from an autoimmune disease, including but not limited to systemic syndromes such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis and polymyositis, or a syndrome affecting only a local body system, such as the endocrine system (diabetes mellitus type 1 , Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Addison's disease, etc.), dermatologic system (pemphigus vulgaris), hematologic system \n\n\n (autoimmune hemolytic anemia), or neural system (multiple sclerosis). Thus autoimmune diseases include, in addition to the general syndromes discussed above, such diseases and conditions as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Addison's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, aplastic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune oophoritis, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, gestational pemphigoid, Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Hashimoto's disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Kawasaki disease, lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, optic neuritis, Ord's thyroiditis, pemphigus, pernicious anaemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, Reiter's syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, Takayasu's arteritis, temporal arteritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and Wegener's granulomatosis. \n\n\n In another aspect, the inflammatory condition results from or is related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also known as chronic obstructive airway diseases, including but not limited to diseases characterized by the pathological limitation of airflow in the airway that is not fully reversible, such as for example chronic bronchitis, emphysema, pneumoconiosis, pulmonary neoplasms and other lung disorders. Other inflammatory conditions include upper or lower airway diseases and disorders, such as allergic asthma, non-allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, vasomotor \n\n rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, non-allergic conjunctivitis, and the like, as well as airway diseases related to external toxins or substances, such as various forms of pneumoconiosis (coalworker's pneumoconiosis, asbestosis, silicosis, bauxite fibrosis, berylliosis, or siderosis), byssinosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis (farmer's lung or bird fancier's lung). Other lung diseases involving an inflammatory condition include acute respiratory distress syndrome. The peptides and compositions of the present invention are of particular utility tor treatment of conditions wherein glucocorticoids are either ineffectual or inadequate to bring about the desired pharmacological response, such as COPD, asthma in individuals who smoke, and other conditions characterized, in whole or in part, by eosinophil accumulation in the lung, neutrophil infiltration and activation, alveolar macrophage recruitment and activation, epithelial cell expression of IL-8 or increased expression of TNF-a. For airway or lung disorders, in one aspect the peptides of the present invention are delivered systemically; in another aspect the peptides of the present invention are delivered locally, such as by inhalation administration. \n\n\n In yet another aspect, the inflammatory condition results from or is related to some form of transplant-related condition or syndrome, such as graft-versus-host disease, hyperacute rejection, acute rejection, or chronic rejection. Graft-versus-host disease is a common complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, but can occur with other transplantations, and particularly those with T cells present in the graft, either as contaminants or intentionally introduced. Hyperacute, acute or chronic rejection can occur with bodily organs such as kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen, uterus, heart or lungs, as well as transplantation of bone, cornea, face, hand, penis or skin. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of the peptides of the present invention is given prophylactically to limit or prevent a transplant-related condition or syndrome, such as immediately before, during or after transplantation of a bodily fluid, organ or part. In another embodiment, the bodily fluid, organ or part being transplanted is perfused with a solution of a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of the peptides of the present invention. In yet another embodiment, one or more of the peptides of the present invention are administered in conjunction with, combination with or series with one or more other agents for transplant rejection, such as calcineurin inhibitors including cyclosporin or tacrolimus, mTOR inhibitors including sirolimus or everolimus, anti-proliferatives including azathioprine or mycophenolic acid, corticosteroids including prednisolone or hydrocortisone, antibodies such as monoclonal anti-IL-2Ra receptor antibodies, basiliximab or daclizumab, or polyclonal anti-T-cell antibodies such as anti-thymocyte globulin or anti- lymphocyte globulin. \n\n\n 2.2 Fibrotic and Sclerotic Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n Peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention are directed towards the treatment of fibrotic and sclerotic diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes in a subject. There are a number of fibrotic and sclerotic diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes which may be so treated. Fibrotic and sclerotic diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes frequently include an inflammatory component, and thus many may similarly be categorized as an inflammatory disease or condition, and are listed in section 2.1 above. Fibrotic and sclerotic diseases and conditions, in addition to including an inflammatory component, may also be idiopathic, toxic, hereditary and/or pharmacologically-induced disorders. In general, fibrotic disorders are characterized by excessive \n\n production of extracellular matrix, primarily type I collagen, which may result in loss of organ function. It is believed, without wishing to be bound by theory, that agonism of MCR-1 can result in suppression of transforming growth factors-induced collagen synthesis by human dermal fibroblasts, thereby providing therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit for fibrotic and sclerotic diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. Representative fibrotic and sclerotic diseases and conditions that can be so treated include, but are not limited to, localized scleroderma, systemic sclerosis, sclerodermic graft-versus-host disease of the skin, idiopathic lung fibrosis, bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, cyclosporine-induced nephropathy, cirrhosis of the liver, hypertrophic scars, keloids and the like. \n\n\n 2.3 Diseases Related to Increased Cytokine Expression and Related Diseases, \n\n\nIndications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n Expression of various cytokines is increased during an inflammatory process, including an inflammatory process secondary to circulatory shock, ischemia, reperfusion injury and the like. TNF-a is a pleiotropic cytokine produced mainly by macrophages, and also by other types of cells. Other cytokines which increase during an inflammatory process, including an inflammatory process secondary to circulatory shock, ischemia, reperfusion injury and the like, include IL-1 and IL-6. While cytokines such as TNF-a have beneficial effects in many instances, significantly increased levels, such as secondary to circulatory shock, ischemia, reperfusion injury and the like, can have pathological effects. In one aspect, reperfusion of hypoxic or ischemic tissues, such as secondary to circulatory shock, results in inflammatory responses, including increased cytokine expression. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression, including decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression secondary to circulatory shock, ischemia, reperfusion injury and the like. The decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression, including without limitation one or more of TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6, occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1-20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1-10 minutes. \n\n\n In a related embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to increase anti-inflammatory cytokine production and expression. The increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine production and expression, including without limitation IL- 10, occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1 -20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1-10 minutes. \n\n\n 2.4 Dermatologic Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n Peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention are further directed towards the treatment of dermatologic and cosmetic diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. In one aspect, peptides and compositions of the present invention are MCR-1 agonists which stimulate melanocytes and related cells to increase the level of melanin in the skin. By increasing the level of \n\n melanin in the skin, protection against ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and sunlight is afforded, including protection against phototoxicity and photosensitivity of the skin caused by UVR, sun and light. \n\n\n In one aspect, peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be utilized for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of dermal diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes such as acne vulgaris (commonly referred to as acne), atopic dermatitis (commonly referred to as atopic eczema or eczema), polymorphous light eruption, psoriasis, rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, vitiligo, porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, solar urticaria, urticaria pigmentosa or xeroderma pigmentosum. In another aspect, peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be utilized to prevent, limit or treat photosensitive or photoresponsive viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus (commonly referred to as cold sores and genital herpes depending on the site of infection), human papilloma virus and varicella zoster virus. In another aspect, peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be utilized to prevent, limit or treat cancers of the skin, including use in pre-cancerous conditions, and including use in actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. In another aspect, peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be utilized to prevent or limit adverse effects of various therapies, including phototherapies, such as photodynamic therapy. In yet another aspect, peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be utilized to induce a tan, to decrease hair graying or for similar and related purposes relating to increased melanin production. \n\n\n Peptides of the present invention may be administered by any of a variety of means, including application directly to the skin such as by means of oils, ointments, creams, gels, salves and the like, or by systemic administration, including by means of implants, such as subcutaneous dissolving implants. \n\n\n 2.5 Cytokine and/or Growth Factor Responsive Cancers. \n\n\n Certain cancers, such as mesothelioma, are reported to be very sensitive to growth-promoting influences of cytokines and growth factors, and may be treatable by means of peptides selective for MCR-1. Canania, A., et al., \"Autocrine inhibitory influences of omelanocyte-stimulating hormone in malignant pleural mesothelioma,\" J. Leukoc. Biol. 75:253-259 (2004). Cancers that may be so treated include pleural mesothelioma, known to express mRHA for MCR-1 and the receptor protein, as well as other tumors that express MCR-1 , including but not limited to adenocarcinoma, such as pulmonary adenocarcinoma. \n\n\n 2.6 Ocular Disease, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n There are a number of ocular diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes characterized by inflammation, including but not limited to increased cytokine production. One example is dry eye disease, an ocular disease affecting approximately 10-20% of the population. This disease progressively affects larger percentages of the population as it ages, with the majority of these patients being women. In addition, almost everyone experiences ocular irritation, or the symptoms and/or signs of dry eye as a condition, from time to time under certain circumstances, such as prolonged visual tasking (e.g., working on a computer), being in a dry environment, using medications that result in ocular drying and so on. In individuals suffering from dry eye, the protective layer of tears that normally protects the ocular surface is compromised, a result of insufficient or unhealthy production of one or more tear components. This can lead to exposure of the surface of the eye, \n\n ultimately promoting desiccation and damage of surface cells. Signs and symptoms of dry eye include but are not limited to keratitis, conjunctival and corneal staining, redness, blurry vision, decreased tear film break-up time, decreased tear production, tear volume, and tear flow, increased conjunctival redness, excess debris in the tear film, ocular dryness, ocular grittiness, ocular burning, foreign body sensation in the eye, excess tearing, photophobia, ocular stinging, refractive impairment, ocular sensitivity, and ocular irritation. Patients may experience one or more of these symptoms. The excess tearing response may seem counterintuitive, but it is a natural reflex response to the irritation and foreign body sensation caused by the dry eye. Some patients may also experience ocular itching due to a combination of ocular allergy and dry eye symptoms. \n\n\n There are many possible variables that can influence a patient's signs or symptoms of dry eye including levels of circulating hormones, various autoimmune diseases (e.g., Sjogren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus), ocular surgeries including PRK or LASIK, many medications, environmental conditions, visual tasking such as computer use, ocular fatigue, contact lens wear, and mechanical influences such as corneal sensitivity, partial lid closure, surface irregularities (e.g., pterygium), and lid irregularities (e.g., ptosis, entropion/ectropion, Pinguecula). Environments with low humidity, such as those that cause dehydration, can exacerbate or cause dry eye symptoms, such as sitting in a car with the defroster on or living in a dry climate zone. In addition, visual tasking can exacerbate symptoms. Tasks that can greatly influence symptoms include watching TV or using a computer for long periods of time where the blink rate is decreased. \n\n\n Uveitis is an ocular disease involving inflammation of the middle layer or uvea of the eye, and may also be understood to include any inflammatory process involving the interior of the eye. Uveitis includes anterior, intermediate, posterior and panuveitic forms, with the majority of uveitis cases anterior in location, involving inflammation of the iris and anterior chamber. This condition can occur as a single episode and subside with proper treatment or may take on a recurrent or chronic nature. Symptoms include red eye, injected conjunctiva, pain and decreased vision. Signs include dilated ciliary vessels, presence of cells and flare in the anterior chamber, and keratic precipitates on the posterior surface of the cornea. Intermediate uveitis includes inflammation and the presence of inflammatory cells in the vitreous cavity, and posterior uveitis include the inflammation of the retina and choroid. Uveitis may be secondary to any of a number of diseases and disorders, including acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, ankylosing spondylitis, Behget's disease, birdshot retinochoroidopathy, brucellosis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, Kawasaki disease, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, sarcoidosis, syphilis, systemic lupus erythematosus, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, Whipple disease or polyarteritis nodosa. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention for treatment of any of the foregoing ocular diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. Such treatment may include treatment by means of eye drops, ointments, gels, washes, implants, plugs or other means and methods for delivering one or more of the peptides of the present invention to an ocular surface. \n\n\n 2.7 Ischemia and Related Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n Ischemia refers to any decrease or stoppage in the blood supply to any bodily organ, tissue, cell, or part, particularly where that decrease or stoppage leads to or would likely lead to ischemic damage to the bodily organ, tissue, cell, or part. An \"ischemic episode\" refers to any transient or permanent period of ischemia. Ischemia may result from any constriction or obstruction of the vasculature, or may result from circulatory shock, such as hemorrhagic shock, hypovolemic shock, or the like. The decrease or lack of blood flow results in a decrease or lack of oxygen to the affected part of the body, and may also result in an increase of inflammatory disease mediator chemicals such as various cytokines and other substances. During certain surgical procedures such as cardiac surgery and organ transplantation, the flow of blood is stopped temporarily and then resumed (reperfusion), resulting in ischemia-reperfusion injury. During a heart attack, the blood that supplies the heart is stopped, also resulting in ischemia that can evolve into infarction. Current treatment to relieve heart attacks requires reperfusion of the ischemic area of the heart, such as by using thrombolytic drugs or coronary angioplasty. \n\n\n The invention has particular application in prevention of injury due to renal ischemia, including lung injury secondary to renal ischemia, preventing or limiting ischemic heart injuries subsequent to a myocardial infarction, preventing or limiting ischemic brain injuries subsequent to a cardiovascular injury, including without limitation myocardial infarction, stroke or the like. Neuroprotection is provided by administration of a composition of the invention to a patient with cerebral ischemia or stroke, particularly patients who are concurrently hypotensive. The invention has further particular application in preventing or limiting ischemic organ damage in organ transplant, including transplant of the heart, kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas or small intestine. In one aspect, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be utilized for perfusion of a transplant organ, which perfusion may be prior to, during or subsequent to transplant of the organ. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the heart, brain or other organs of a patient against injury caused by ischemia. The protective effect against ischemia occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1-20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1 -10 minutes. \n\n\n Ischemia may also results from any of a variety of diseases or conditions, and in one embodiment the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the organs of a patient against injury resulting from ischemia, which ischemia is caused by a disease or condition. Such disease or condition may include, by way of example and not limitation, atherosclerotic diseases such as atheromata with thrombosis, embolism from the heart or from blood vessel from any organ, vasospasm, hypotension due to heart disease, hypotension due to systemic disease including infection or allergic reactions, or hypotension resulting from administration, ingestion or other exposure to one or more toxic compounds or drugs. Ischemia may also be secondary ischemia, and in another embodiment the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the organs of a patient against injury resulting from secondary ischemia. Such secondary ischemia may be secondary to a disease or condition such diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, dyslipidemia Buerger's disease, also \n\n called thromboangiitis obliterans, Takayasu's arteritis, arteritis temporalis, Kawasaki disease, also called lymph node syndrome, mucocutaneous node disease, infantile polyarteritis, cardiovascular syphilis, and various connective tissue diseases and disorders. \n\n\n 2.8 Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury and Related Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n Ischemia-reperfusion is the interruption of blood flow to bodily tissue and the subsequent and often abrupt restoration of blood flow to the tissue. While restoration of blood flow following ischemia is essential to preserve functional tissue, the reperfusion itself is known to be harmful to the tissue. Both ischemia and reperfusion are known to be important contributors to tissue necrosis. Several mechanisms appear to play a causative role in the generation of tissue damage associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury. \n\n\n Various methods of limiting reperfusion injury have been described, such as induced hypothermia, controlled reperfusion, and ischemic preconditioning. Induced hypothermia is the induction of moderate hypothermia, thought to suppress many of the chemical reactions associated with reperfusion injury. Controlled reperfusion refers to controlling the initial period of reperfusion by reperfusing the tissue at a low pressure using blood that has been modified to be hyperosmolar, alkalotic, and substrate-enriched. Ischemic preconditioning is the purposeful causing of short ischemic events to have protective effect by slowing cell metabolism during a longer ischemic event. Although these treatments may be useful in surgical settings (e.g., before or after planned heart surgery), they are not possible in emergency settings. \n\n\n The invention has particular application in preventing or limiting the severity of renal reperfusion injury, including lung injury secondary to renal reperfusion, preventing or limiting reperfusion heart injuries subsequent to a myocardial infarction, preventing or limiting reperfusion brain injuries subsequent to a cardiovascular injury, including without limitation myocardial infarction, stroke or the like. The invention has further particular application in preventing or limiting reperfusion organ damage in organ transplant, including transplant of the heart, kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas or small intestine. In one aspect, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be utilized for perfusion of a transplant organ, which perfusion may be prior to, during or subsequent to transplant of the organ. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the heart, brain or other organs of a patient against injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury, including injury caused by or during reperfusion. The protective effect against ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1 -20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1-10 minutes. \n\n\n 2.9 Circulatory Shock and Related Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. Peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be employed for the treatment of circulatory shock in a subject. The compositions and methods provided herein may be employed to treat Stage I shock, Stage II shock or Stage III shock. In one particular embodiment, the methods of the present invention are used to treat the initial stage of shock, which initial stage of \n\n shock is characterized by cardiac output insufficient to meet the body's metabolic needs, but not otherwise low enough to produce significant symptoms. The patient may be anxious and alert, with increased respiration. \n\n\n By \"Stage I shock,\" also sometimes called \"compensated shock\" or \"non-progressive shock,\" is meant a condition which occurs when the body detects decreased blood flow or perfusion and begins to activate one or more of several reactive mechanisms to restore perfusion or direct blood flow to the most vital body organs. Stage I shock can be asymptomatic, but may also include, but is not limited to, symptoms such as low blood flow or perfusion, rapid or increased heart rate, shallow or irregular breathing, hypotension, hypertension, pallor and cyanosis. \n\n\n By \"Stage II shock,\" also sometimes called \"decompensated shock\" or \"progressive shock,\" is mean a condition which occurs when the compensatory mechanisms of the body begin to fail and organ perfusion cannot be restored to normal or maintained. Symptoms of Stage II shock include, but are not limited to, confusion, anxiety, disorientation and other mental disturbances indicating a lack of oxygen to the brain, chest pains, increased heart rate, oliguria, multiple organ dysfunction, falling blood pressure (hypotension), rapid breathing, weakness and pupil dilation. \n\n\n By \"Stage III shock,\" also sometimes called \"irreversible shock,\" is meant a condition which occurs after the state of decreased perfusion or blood flow has existed to such an extent that the organs and tissues of the body are permanently affected. Such symptoms include, but are not limited to, multiple organ failure, kidney failure, coma, blood pooling in the extremities and death. \n\n\n The invention provides compositions for use and methods of treating or preventing hemorrhagic shock in a patient, which include administering a composition including one or more of the peptides of the present invention to a patient diagnosed as suffering from blood loss. The blood loss may, but need not, be measured as a percentage of the subject's blood volume, such as, for example, a blood loss of greater than about 15% total blood volume, or greater than 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, or 50% of the subject's total volume. Alternatively, the blood loss may, but need not, be measured in terms of a drop in blood volume in any amount sufficient to cause hemorrhagic shock in a particular subject, such as, for example, a loss of about 750 mL, 1000 mL, of about 1500 mL, or of about 2000 mL or more in a human subject. The blood loss may also be measured in terms of a drop in systolic blood pressure, such as, for example, a drop in systolic blood pressure that is about 20 mm Hg, 30 mm Hg, 40 mm Hg, 50 mm Hg, 60 mm Hg, 70 mm Hg, 80 mm Hg, 90 mm Hg or 100 mm Hg or more than 100 mm Hg lower than the subject's normal systolic blood pressure. In particular embodiments, the subject is undergoing or has undergone a medical procedure, such as, but not limited to, surgery, a transfusion or child birth. In other particular embodiments, the subject has suffered a traumatic injury, such as, but not limited to, resulting from a motor vehicle accident, from an industrial injury, or from a gunshot wound. \n\n\n In additional embodiments of the present invention, the compositions and methods are used to treat cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic shock and vasodilatory shock, each of which can be in any of the aforementioned stages of shock. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to treat cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is, generally speaking, low blood flow or perfusion that is caused by heart malfunction where the heart does not pump adequate blood. Causes can include any condition that interferes with ventricular filling or emptying, such as, but not \n\n limited to, embolism, ischemia, regurgitation and valve malfunction. In another particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to treat vasodilatory shock. Vasodilatory shock is caused by severe venous or arteriolar dilation, which results in inadequate blood flow. Several known causes contribute to vasodilatory shock including, but not limited to, cerebral trauma, drug or poison toxicity, anaphylaxis, liver failure, bacteremia and sepsis. In another more particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to treat shock resulting from sepsis or bacteremia. In an even more particular embodiment, the compositions and methods are used to treat septic shock or bacteremic shock in Stage I, II or III. In yet another embodiment, the compositions and methods of the present invention are used to treat hypovolemic shock. Hypovolemic shock is, generally speaking, decreased intravascular volume, which decrease in intravascular volume can be relative or absolute. Hemorrhage from conditions such as, but not limited to, ulcers, gastrointestinal injury, trauma, accidents, surgery, and aneurysm may cause hypovolemic shock; but loss of other body fluids may also cause hypovolemic shock. For instance, renal fluid loss, intravascular fluid loss, water or other peritoneal fluid loss may contribute to hypovolemic shock. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, the compositions and methods, including administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention, are used to treat hypovolemic shock. In an even more particular embodiment, the compositions and methods are used to treat hypovolemic shock in Stage I, Stage II or Stage III. \n\n\n Circulatory shock, including hemorrhagic shock, may also result from partially controlled or uncontrolled bleeding within one or more internal organs or vessels of a patient. Bleeding may result from any cause, including by way of example from a ruptured aneurysm, dissected aorta, an ulcer, trauma or other gastrointestinal bleeding. In some instances the patient exhibits signs of circulatory shock or hypovolemia, which may include hypotension, but the source of internal bleeding is unknown. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the heart, brain or other organs of a patient against injury caused by circulatory shock. The protective effect against circulatory shock occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1-20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1-10 minutes. \n\n\n 2.10 Targeted Imaging and Cytotoxic Therapy for Melanoma and Other Indications. \n\n\n Peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be employed for imaging melanoma and other cancers or diseases or conditions characterized, in part, by relatively high expression of MCR-1 , such as by diagnostic imaging using a radionuclide in combination with a peptide of the present invention. For diagnostic imaging, typically a peptide of the present invention is conjugated to radionuclide by use of a linker, such as a cross-linking agent that couples the peptide of the present invention to a radionuclide. The radionuclide is preferably a gamma emitter that may be imaged using a gamma detector or camera, such as single photon emission computed tomography, or is a positron emitter that may be imaged using positron emission tomography. Gamma emitters \n\n that may be so employed include \n99m\nTc, In, \n23\nl and \n67\nGa, among others. Positron emitters that may be so employed include C, \n3\nN, \n5\n0 and \n8\nF. \n\n\n In a related aspect, peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be employed for cytotoxic therapy of melanoma, other cancers or diseases or conditions characterized, in part, by relatively high expression of MCR-1 , such as by utilizing a chemotherapeutic agent, including toxins, or radiation therapeutic agent, in combination with a peptide of the present invention. Chemotherapeutic agents include any antineoplastic drug or chemical, such as for example alkylating agents, antimetabolites, anthracyclines, plant alkaloids, topoisomerase inhibitors, and other antitumor agents. Non-limiting examples of alkylating agents include cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil and ifosfamide; examples of antimetabolites include azathioprine and mercaptopurine; examples of anthracyclines include daunorubicin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, valrubicin and mitoxantrone; examples of plant alkaloids include vinca alkaloids such as vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine and vindesine and taxanes such as paclitaxel and docetaxel; examples of topoisomerase inhibitors include camptothecins such as irinotecan and topotecan and type II topoisomerases such as amsacrine, etoposide, etoposide phosphate and teniposide. However, any agent suitable for use in targeted cytotoxic therapy may be so employed. Non-limiting examples of radiation therapeutic agents that may be so employed include \n131\n l, \n125\nl, \n211\nAt, \n186\nRe, \n188\nRe, \n90\nY, \n153\nSm, \n212\nBi and \n32\nP, among others. \n\n\n Diagnostic imaging or cytotoxic therapy agents may be incorporated into a peptide of the present invention, for example such as by use of C, \n3\nN, \n5\n0, among others, in place of \n\n\nnonradioactive isotopes; may be linked directly to a peptide of the present invention, such as for example by halogenation or other direct complexation methods; or may be linked indirectly to a peptide of the present invention, such as conjugation by means of a linker or chelation unit. Linker units are well known in the art, and include, but are not limited to, chemically-linked conjugates including at least one disulfide bond, thioether bond or covalent bond between free reactive groups. Representative cross-linking and conjugating reagents are disclosed in US Patent Nos. 7, 169,603, 7,820, 164 and 5,443,816 and US Publication No. 2009/0297444, among others, incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n 3.0 Combination Therapy for Certain Indications. \n\n\n The peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be used for treatment of any of the foregoing diseases, indications, conditions or syndromes, or any disease, indication, condition or syndrome which is MCR-1 mediated or responsive, by administration in combination with one or more other pharmaceutically active compounds. Such combination administration may be by means of a single dosage form which includes both a peptide of the present invention and one more other pharmaceutically active compounds, such single dosage form including a tablet, capsule, spray, inhalation powder, injectable liquid or the like. Alternatively, combination administration may be by means of administration of two different dosage forms, with one dosage form containing a peptide of the present invention, and the other dosage form including another pharmaceutically active compound. In this instance, the dosage forms may be the same or different. The term \"coadminister\" indicates that each of at least two compounds in the combination therapy are administered during a time frame wherein the respective periods of biological activity or effects overlap. Thus the term \n\n includes sequential as well as concurrent administration of compounds where one compound is one or more of the peptides of the present invention. If more than one compound is coadministered, the routes of administration of the two or more compounds need not be the same. Without meaning to limit combination therapies, the following exemplifies certain combination therapies which may be employed. \n\n\n 3.1 Combination Therapy with Anti-Inflammatory Agents. \n\n\n For the treatment of inflammation-related diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes, peptides of the present invention may be used in combination therapy, including by means of coadministration, with one or more anti-inflammatory agents. One class of anti-inflammatory agent is glucocorticoids, including but not limited to cortisone, including cortisone acetate, hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, triamcinolone, beclometasone, prednisone, fludrocortisone acetate, deoxycorticosterone acetate and aldosterone. Other anti-inflammatory agents that may be used in combination therapy, including by means of coadministration, include aspirin, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (such as ibuprofen and naproxin), TNF-a inhibitors (such as tenidap and rapamycin or derivatives thereof), or TNF-a antagonists (e.g., infliximab, OR1384), cyclooxygenase inhibitors (i.e., COX-1 and/or COX-2 inhibitors such as Naproxen® or Celebrex®), CTLA4-lg agonists/antagonists, CD40 ligand antagonists, IMPDH inhibitors, such as mycophenolate (CellCept®), integrin antagonists, alpha-4 beta-7 integrin antagonists, cell adhesion inhibitors, interferon gamma antagonists, ICAM-1 , prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, budesonide, clofazimine, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors, IKK inhibitors, therapies for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (e.g., Zelmac® and Maxi-K® openers such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6, 184,231 ), or other NF-KB inhibitors, such as corticosteroids, calphostin, CSAIDs, 4-substituted imidazo [1 ,2-A]quinoxalines as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,200,750; lnterleukin-10, salicylates, nitric oxide, and other \n\n\nimmunosuppressants; and nuclear translocation inhibitors, such as deoxyspergualin (DSG). \n\n\n 3.2 Combination Therapy with Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors. \n\n\n For certain applications and indications, it is desirable to increase production of and maintain levels of cyclic adenoise 3', 5' monophosphate (cAMP), a nucleotide messenger associated with inflammatory cell activity. Peptides of the present invention increase intracellular levels of cAMP, and can be coadministered with compounds or substances that inhibit the degradation of cAMP. cAMP is hydrolyzed to an inactive form by phosphodiesterase (PDE); compounds or substances that inhibit PDE may thereby result in maintenance of and/or an increase in available cAMP. A class of compounds known as PDE inhibitors has been extensively studied for use in treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, COPD and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Preferred are inhibitors of PDE type 1 , 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 or 1 1 ; in one aspect this includes cAMP-PDE inhibitors that are selective PDE type 4 inhibitors or inhibitors having selectivity for one particular type of PDE 4 isoenzyme, such as, by way of example, rolipram, cilomilast, ibudilast, and piclamilast. In general, the methods and compositions of this invention may comprise use of one or more cAMP-PDE inhibitors described in one or more of the following U.S. patents or patent applications, each of which is incorporated herein by reference: U.S. Pat.

Thus a subject may be administered one or more of the peptides of the present invention by one of the methods of the invention after suffering an injury likely to induce circulatory shock but prior to the manifestation of overt symptoms of cardiovascular shock, including prior to manifestation of circulatory shock in Stage I, Stage II or Stage III. \n\n\n When administration is for the purpose of treatment, one or more of the peptides of the present invention are provided at, or after the onset of, a symptom of shock. The therapeutic administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention may further serve to attenuate any symptom, or prevent additional symptoms from arising. When administration is for the purposes of preventing shock (\"prophylactic administration\"), one or more of the peptides of the present invention are provided in advance of any visible or detectable symptom. The prophylactic administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention serve to attenuate subsequently arising symptoms or prevent symptoms from arising altogether. The route of administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention include, but are not limited to, topical, transdermal, intranasal, pulmonary, vaginal, rectal, oral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraosseous, intraperitoneal, epidural and intrathecal. \n\n\n 4.4 Methods of Administration and Use for Prophylactic Therapy. \n\n\n The invention also relates to methods of preventing undesired cytokine expression by administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the peptides of the present invention to the subject, prior to or immediately at the onset of the first symptoms. As used herein, the term \"prevent,\" as it relates to shock, indicates that a substance of the present invention is administered to a subject to prohibit one or more symptoms of shock from detectably appearing or to attenuate the effects of one or more symptoms of shock. The term \"prevent\" also encompasses prohibiting or limiting excessive or undesired cytokine expression, such as with a \"cytokine storm\". Thus a subject may be \"pretreated,\" such as a subject in a surgical setting, by using the substances of the present invention to prevent undesired cytokine expression or shock from arising. The phrase \"preventing the progression,\" as it relates to shock, is used to mean a procedure designed to prohibit \n\n the detectable appearance of one or more additional symptoms of shock in a patient already exhibiting one or more symptoms of shock, and is also used to mean prohibiting the already-present symptoms of shock from worsening in the subject. The symptoms of shock that are included in preventative methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to, such symptoms of shock as highlighted herein, such as tachycardia, shallow or erratic breathing and death. A subject that is at risk of shock may be recognized based upon the specific circumstances surrounding a subject. \n\n\nSimilarly, a patient with a bacterial or viral infection and exhibiting a fever or low blood pressure may also be at risk of excessive cytokine expression, shock or an inflammatory disease or condition. \n\n\n In additional embodiments of the present invention, the methods are used to prevent cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic shock and vasodilatory shock, each of which can be in any of the three aforementioned stages of shock. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to prevent cardiogenic shock.

In an even more particular embodiment, the methods are used to prevent septic shock or bacteremic shock in Stage I, II or III shock. In yet another embodiment, the methods of the present invention are used to prevent hypovolemic shock. \n\n\n Similar to the methods of treating shock described herein, one embodiment of the methods of preventing shock of the present invention comprises coadministering another substance with one or more of the peptides of the present invention or a derivative thereof. The scope of the invention is not limited by the identity of the substance which may be coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention to prevent shock. For example, one or more of the peptides of the present invention may be coadministered with androstenetriol, androstenediol or derivatives thereof, various vasopressin agonists, or other pharmaceutically active substances, such as catecholamines or other a adrenergic agonists, a\n2\n adrenergic agonists, β adrenergic agonists or β\n2\n adrenergic agonists, including but not limited to epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, isoproterenol, vasopressin and dobutamine, to prevent shock. \n\n\n Alternatively, one or more of the peptides of the present invention may be coadministered with fluids or other substances that are capable of preventing or removing symptoms in a subject at risk of suffering from hypovolemic shock, vasodilatory shock or cardiogenic shock. The types of fluid that can be coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention to prevent shock should be specific to the circumstances surrounding the particular subject that is at risk of suffering from shock. For example, fluids that may be coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention include, but are not limited to, salt solutions— such as sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate— as well as whole blood, synthetic blood substitutes, plasma, serum, serum albumin and colloid solutions. Colloid solutions include, but are not limited to, solutions containing hetastarch, albumin or plasma. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, fluids including one or more of salt solutions, colloidal solutions, whole blood, synthetic blood substitutes, plasma or serum are coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention or a derivative thereof in subjects at risk of suffering a hypovolemic shock, such as hemorrhagic shock. \n\n 4.5 Methods of Administration and Use for Inflammation Related Applications, Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n In yet another aspect, the invention includes methods which optionally include monitoring the subject for signs or symptoms of inflammation, inflammatory diseases or inflammatory conditions both before and after administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention. Thus a subject may be administered one or more of the peptides of the present invention by one of the methods of the invention after being diagnosed with a condition, disease or syndrome likely to induce an inflammatory response, but prior to the manifestation of overt symptoms of inflammation, inflammatory disease or inflammatory condition. Methods of treating or preventing inflammation, inflammatory diseases or inflammatory conditions described herein comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the peptides of the present invention to a subject. As used herein, the term \"administer\" and \"administering\" are used to mean introducing at least one compound into a subject. When administration is for the purpose of treatment, the substance is provided at, or after the onset of, a sign or symptom of inflammation, inflammatory disease or inflammatory condition. The therapeutic administration of this substance serves to attenuate any symptom, or prevent additional symptoms from arising. When administration is prophylactic administration for the purposes of preventing or limiting inflammation, inflammatory disease or an inflammatory condition, a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of the peptides of the present invention is provided in advance of any visible or detectable symptom. The prophylactic administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention serves to attenuate \n\n\nsubsequently arising symptoms or prevent symptoms from arising altogether.

Emulsions, ointments, gels, ocular inserts, biodegradable ocular inserts, liposomes, microparticles, nanoparticles, nanospheres or ion pairing formulations may also be employed, which may, in some instances, result in increasing the ocular residence times of a peptide of the present invention. In one embodiment, the ophthalmic formulation is a solution that includes between about 0.0000001 % and about 5% (w/v) of a peptide of the present invention or a salt thereof, alternatively between about 0.000001 % and about 0.2% (w/v) of a peptide of the present invention or a salt thereof, or alternatively between about 0.00001 % and about 0.2% (w/v) of a peptide of the present invention or a salt thereof. \n\n\n 5.0 Methods of Making. \n\n\n In general, the peptides of the present invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptides of the present invention. \n\n The linear peptides of the present invention may be readily synthesized by known \n\n\nconventional procedures for the formation of a peptide linkage between amino acids. Such conventional procedures include, for example, any solution phase procedure permitting a \n\n\ncondensation between the free alpha amino group of an amino acid or residue thereof having its carboxyl group and other reactive groups protected and the free primary carboxyl group of another amino acid or residue thereof having its amino group or other reactive groups protected. In a preferred conventional procedure, the linear peptides of the present invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. Any of a number of well- known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptides of the present invention. \n\n\n The process for synthesizing the linear peptides may be carried out by a procedure whereby each amino acid in the desired sequence is added one at a time in succession to another amino acid or residue thereof or by a procedure whereby peptide fragments with the desired amino acid sequence are first synthesized conventionally and then condensed to provide the desired peptide. \n\n\n Solid phase peptide synthesis methods are well known and practiced in the art. In such methods the synthesis of peptides of the invention can be carried out by sequentially incorporating the desired amino acid residues one at a time into the growing peptide chain according to the general principles of solid phase methods. These methods are disclosed in numerous references, including Merrifield, R.B., \"Solid phase synthesis (Nobel lecture),\" Angew Chem 24:799-810 (1985) and Barany et al., The Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis and Biology, Vol. 2, Gross, E. and Meienhofer, J., Eds. Academic Press 1-284 (1980). \n\n\n In chemical syntheses of peptides, reactive side chain groups of the various amino acid residues are protected with suitable protecting groups, which prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the protecting group is removed. Also common is the protection of the alpha amino group of an amino acid residue or fragment while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow a subsequent reaction to take place at that site. Specific protecting groups have been disclosed and are known in solid phase synthesis methods and solution phase synthesis methods. \n\n\n Alpha amino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, including a urethane- type protecting group, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such as p- chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-biphenyl- isopropoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz) and aliphatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), \n\n\ndiisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc). Fmoc is preferred for alpha amino protection. \n\n\n Guanidino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, such as nitro, p- toluenesulfonyl (Tos), Z, pentamethylchromanesulfonyl (Pmc), adamantyloxycarbonyl, \n\n\npentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf) and Boc. Pbf and Pmc are preferred protecting groups for Arg. \n\n\n The peptides of the invention described herein were prepared using solid phase synthesis, such as by means of a Symphony Multiplex Peptide Synthesizer (Rainin Instrument Company) \n\n automated peptide synthesizer, using programming modules as provided by the manufacturer and following the protocols set forth in the manufacturer's manual. \n\n\n Solid phase synthesis was commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such starting material may be prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid by means of an amide linkage to 9-Fmoc-aminoxanthen-3- yloxy-Merrifield resin fSieber Amide resin) or to 4-(2',4'-Dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)phenoxy resin (Rink Amide resin), or by means of an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin, a 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin or an oxime resin, or by other means well known in the art. \n\n\n Following removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids were coupled stepwise through repetitive cycles to add amino acids in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. Typically, alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine, diethylamine, or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in N,N- dimethylformamide (DMF) may be used for this purpose. \n\n\n The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. After the peptide is synthesized, if desired, the orthogonally protected side chain protecting groups may be removed using methods well known in the art for further derivatization of the peptide. \n\n\n Reactive groups in a peptide can be selectively modified, either during solid phase synthesis or after removal from the resin. For example, peptides can be modified to obtain N-terminus modifications, such as acetylation, while on resin, or may be removed from the resin by use of a cleaving reagent and then modified. Similarly, methods for modifying side chains of amino acids are well known to those skilled in the art of peptide synthesis. The choice of modifications made to reactive groups present on the peptide will be determined, in part, by the characteristics that are desired in the peptide. \n\n\n In the peptides of the present invention, in one embodiment the N-terminus group is modified by introduction of an N-acetyl group. In one aspect, a method is employed wherein after removal of the protecting group at the N-terminal, the resin-bound peptide is reacted with acetic anhydride in DMF in the presence of an organic base, such as pyridine. Other methods of N-terminus acetylation are known in the art, including solution phase acetylation, and may be employed. \n\n\n The peptides can be cleaved from solid phase using any suitable reagent, such as ethylamine in DCM or various combinations of agents, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), tri-isopropylsilane (TIS), dimethoxybenezene (DMB), water and the like. The resulting crude peptide is dried and remaining amino acid side chain protecting groups, if any, are cleaved using any suitable reagent, such as (TFA) in the presence of water, TIS, 2-mercaptopethane (ME), and/or 1 ,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). The final product is precipitated by adding cold ether and collected by filtration. Final purification is by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), using a suitable column, such as a d\n8\n column, or other methods of separation or purification, such as methods based on the size or charge of the peptide, can also be employed. Once purified, the peptide can be characterized by any number of methods, such as high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and the like. \n\n For peptides of the present invention which have a C-terminus substituted amide derivative or N-alkyl group, synthesis may proceed by solid phase synthesis commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such methods for preparing substituted amide derivatives on solid-phase have been described in the art. See, for example, Barn, D. R., et al., \"Synthesis of an array of amides by aluminum chloride assisted cleavage on resin bound esters,\" Tetrahedron Letters, 37:3213-3216 (1996); DeGrado, W. F. and Kaiser E. T., \"Solid-phase synthesis of protected peptides on a polymer bound oxime: Preparation of segments comprising the sequences of a cytotoxic 26-peptide analogue,\" J. Org. Chem. , 47:3258-3261 (1982). Such a starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin or an oxime resin by well known means. The peptide chain is grown with the desired sequence of amino acids and the peptide-resin treated with a solution of appropriate amine (such as methyl amine, dimethyl amine, ethylamine, and so on). Peptides employing a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin may be cleaved from resin by aluminum chloride in DCM, and peptides employing an oxime resin may be cleaved by DCM. Another method to prepare a peptide with a C-terminus substituted amide is to attach an alkyl amine by reductive amination to formyl resins, such as 4-(4-Formyl-3-methoxyphenoxy)butyryl-AM resin (FMPB AM resin), following which the desired amino acid residues are incorporated into the desired peptide chain utilizing general principles of solid phase methods. \n\n\n While synthesis has been described primarily with reference to solid phase Fmoc chemistry, it is to be understood that other chemistries and synthetic methods may be employed to make the linear peptides of the invention, such as by way of example and not limitation, methods employing Boc chemistry, solution chemistry, and other chemistries and synthetic methods. \n\n\n 6.0 Formulations. \n\n\n Depending on the desired route of administration, the formulation of a composition including one or more linear peptides of the present invention may be varied. Thus the formulation may be suitable for subcutaneous injection, or intravenous injection, for topical applications, for ocular applications, for nasal spray applications, for inhalation applications, for other transdermal applications and the like. \n\n\n 6.1 Salt Form of Linear Peptides of the Present Invention. \n\n\n The linear peptides of the present invention may be in the form of any pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, Ν,Ν'-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethyl-morpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, \n\n polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine, and the like. \n\n\n When the linear peptide of the present invention is basic, acid addition salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids, including inorganic and organic acids. Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, carboxylic, citric, ethanesulfonic, formic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, malonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, propionic, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p-toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, and the like.

The acetate, ammonium acetate and trifluoracetic acid salt forms are especially useful. Where the peptides of the present invention include an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts may include alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts, or alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium or magnesium salts. \n\n\n 6.2 Pharmaceutical Compositions. \n\n\n The invention provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes a linear peptide of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier may be a liquid formulation, and is preferably a buffered, isotonic, aqueous solution. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers also include excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as hereafter described. \n\n\n The linear peptide compositions of the present invention may be formulated or compounded into pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one linear peptide of the present invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, including excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as may be desired. Formulation excipients may include polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxy cellulose, acacia, polyethylene glycol, manniton, sodium chloride and sodium citrate. For injection or other liquid administration formulations, water containing at least one or more buffering constituents is preferred, and stabilizing agents, preservatives and solubilizing agents may also be employed. For solid administration formulations, any of a variety of thickening, filler, bulking and carrier additives may be employed, such as starches, sugars, fatty acids and the like. For topical administration formulations, any of a variety of creams, ointments, gels, lotions and the like may be employed. For most pharmaceutical formulations, non-active ingredients will constitute the greater part, by weight or volume, of the preparation. For pharmaceutical formulations, it is also contemplated that any of a variety of measured-release, slow-release or sustained-release formulations and additives may be employed, so that the dosage may be formulated so as to effect delivery of a peptide of the present invention over a period of time. \n\n\n In general, the actual quantity of linear peptides of the present invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending on the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired. \n\n\n In practical use, the linear peptides of the invention can be combined as the active ingredient in an admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding \n\n techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, for example, oral, parenteral (including intravenous), urethral, vaginal, nasal, buccal, sublingual, or the like. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets. \n\n\n Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent an advantageous oral dosage unit form. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. The amount of active peptide in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. In another advantageous dosage unit form, sublingual constructs may be employed, such as sheets, wafers, tablets or the like. \n\n\n The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch or alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as fatty oil. \n\n\n Various other materials may be utilized as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and \n\n\npropylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. \n\n\n Linear peptides may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active peptides can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxy- propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. These preparations may optionally contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. \n\n\n The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that it may be administered by syringe. The form must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol, for example glycerol, propylene glycol or liquid polyethylene glycol, suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. \n\n\n The linear peptides of the present invention may be therapeutically applied by means of nasal administration. By \"nasal administration\" is meant any form of intranasal administration of any of the linear peptides of the present invention. The peptides may be in an aqueous solution, such as a solution including saline, citrate or other common excipients or preservatives. The peptides may also be in a dry or powder formulation. \n\n The linear peptides of the present invention may be formulated with any of a variety of agents that increase effective nasal absorption of drugs, including peptide drugs. These agents should increase nasal absorption without unacceptable damage to the mucosal membrane. U.S. Patents No. 5,693,608, 5,977,070 and 5,908,825, among others, teach a number of pharmaceutical compositions that may be employed, including absorption enhancers, and the teachings of each of the foregoing, and all references and patents cited therein, are incorporated by reference. \n\n\n If in an aqueous solution, the linear peptides may be appropriately buffered by means of saline, acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate or other buffering agents, which may be at any \n\n\nphysiologically acceptable pH, generally from about pH 4 to about pH 7. A combination of buffering agents may also be employed, such as phosphate buffered saline, a saline and acetate buffer, and the like. In the case of saline, a 0.9% saline solution may be employed. In the case of acetate, phosphate, citrate, and the like, a 50 mM solution may be employed. In addition to buffering agents, a suitable preservative may be employed, to prevent or limit bacteria and other microbial growth. One such preservative that may be employed is 0.05% benzalkonium chloride. \n\n\n In an alternative embodiment, linear peptides of the present invention may be administered directly into the lung. Intrapulmonary administration may be performed by means of a metered dose inhaler, a device allowing self-administration of a metered bolus of a peptide of the present invention when actuated by a patient during inspiration. In one aspect of this embodiment, the linear peptide may be in a dried and particulate form, for example particles between about 0.5 and 6.0 μιη, such that the particles have sufficient mass to settle on the lung surface, and not be exhaled, but are small enough that they are not deposited on surfaces of the air passages prior to reaching the lung. Any of a variety of different techniques may be used to make dry powder microparticles, including but not limited to micro-milling, spray drying and a quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization. With micro- particles, the peptides may be deposited to the deep lung, thereby providing quick and efficient absorption into the bloodstream. Further, with such approach penetration enhancers are not required, as is sometimes the case in transdermal, nasal or oral mucosal delivery routes. Any of a variety of inhalers can be employed, including propellant-based aerosols, nebulizers, single dose dry powder inhalers and multidose dry powder inhalers. Common devices in current use include metered dose inhalers, which are used to deliver medications for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the like. Preferred devices include dry powder inhalers, designed to form a cloud or aerosol of fine powder with a particle size that is always less than about 6.0 μιη. \n\n\n Microparticle size, including mean size distribution, may be controlled by means of the method of making. For micro-milling, the size of the milling head, speed of the rotor, time of processing and the like control the microparticle size. For spray drying, the nozzle size, flow rate, dryer heat and the like control the microparticle size. For making by means of quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization, the nozzle size, flow rate, concentration of aerosoled solution and the like control the microparticle size. These parameters and others may be employed to control the microparticle size. \n\n\n The linear peptides of the present invention may be therapeutically administered by means of an injection of a sustained release formulation. In one embodiment, a linear peptide of the present invention is formulated for a deep intramuscular injection, such as in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, of a formulation with a polyethylene glycol, such as polyethylene glycol 3350, and optionally one or more \n\n additional excipients and preservatives, including but not limited to excipients such as salts, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to adjust pH, and the like. In another embodiment a linear peptide of the present invention is formulated with a poly(ortho ester), which may be an auto-catalyzed poly(ortho ester) with any of a variable percentage of lactic acid in the polymeric backbone, and optionally one or more additional excipients. In one embodiment poly (D,L-lactide-co- glycolide) polymer is employed. In general, any of a number of injectable and bioerodible polymers, which are preferably also adhesive polymers, may be employed in a sustained release injectable formulation. Alternatively other sustained release formulations may be employed, including formulations permitting subcutaneous injection, which other formulations may include one or more of nano/microspheres (such as compositions including PLGA polymers), liposomes, emulsions (such as water-in-oil emulsions), gels, insoluble salts or suspensions in oil. The formulation may be such that an injection is required on a daily, weekly, monthly or other periodic basis, depending on the concentration and amount of linear peptide, the sustained release rate of the materials employed, and other factors known to those of skill in the art. \n\n\n 6.3 Oral Formulations of Peptides of the Present Invention. \n\n\n In one aspect, the peptides of the present invention are formulated for oral delivery. The peptide is preferably formulated and made such that it is encased in an enteric protectant, more preferably such that it is not released until the tablet or capsule has transited the stomach, and optionally has further transited a portion of the small intestine. In the context of this application it will be understood that the term enteric coating or material refers to a coating or material that will pass through the stomach essentially intact but will rapidly disintegrate in the small intestine to release the active drug substance. One enteric coating solution that may be used includes cellulose acetate phthalate, and optionally other ingredients such as ammonium hydroxide, triacetin, ethyl alcohol, methylene blue, and purified water. Cellulose acetate phthalate is a polymer that has been used in the pharmaceutical industry for enterically coating individual dosage forms such as tablets and capsules, and is not soluble in water at a pH of less than about 5.8. Enteric coatings including cellulose acetate phthalate provide protection against the acidic environment of the stomach, but begin to dissolve in environment of the duodenum (pH of about 6-6.5), and are completely dissolved by the time the dosage form reaches the ileum (pH of about 7-8). In addition to cellulose acetate phthalate, other enteric coating materials are known and may be used with peptides of the present invention, including without limitation hydroxypropylmethylethylcellulose succinate, \n\n\nhydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, and methacrylic acid-methyl methacrylate copolymer. The enteric coating employed promotes dissolution of the dosage form primarily at a site outside the stomach, and may be selected such that the enteric coating dissolves at a pH of approximately at least 6.0, more preferable at a pH of from about 6.0 to about 8.0. In one preferred aspect, the enteric coating dissolves and breaks down in the proximity of the ileum. \n\n\n Any of a variety of permeation enhancers may be employed, to increase uptake in the intestines upon dissolution of the enteric coating. In one aspect, permeation enhancers increase either paracellular or transcellular transport systems. An increase in paracellular transport can be achieved by opening the tight junctions of the cells; an increase in transcellular transport can be achieved by increasing the fluidity of the cell membrane. Representative, non-limiting examples of \n\n such permeation enhancers include calcium chelators, bile salts (such as sodium cholate), and fatty acids. The peptides of the present invention may be in an enteric-coated individual dosage form that includes a fatty acid, such as for example oleate, palmitate, stearate, sodium caprate, or conjugated linoleic acid, in an enteric-coated capsule, to increase paracellular transport. \n\n\n In one aspect, the individual dosage form, such as a tablet or capsule, optionally further includes common pharmaceutical binders such as povidone, diluents, glidants, fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose, lubricants such as magnesium stearate, disintegrants such as \n\n\ncroscarmellose sodium, preservatives, colorants and the like in their usual known sizes and amounts. In some embodiments, peptides or polypeptides that act as substrates for intestinal proteases are further added. \n\n\n 6.4 Ophthalmic Formulations. \n\n\n In one embodiment, ocular diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes, such as for example either dry eye disease or uveitis, may be treated with an ophthalmic dosage form including one or more of the peptides of the present invention. The ophthalmic dosage form may include one or more active ingredients in addition to one or more of the peptides of the present invention, such as for example artificial tear components, topical corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine-A (Restasis® - Allergan). In a related embodiment, one or additional compounds may be given separately from one or more of the peptides of the present invention, such as separate administration of an ophthalmic dosage form including an artificial tear component, a topical corticosteroid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, a calcineurin inhibitor such a cyclosporine-A, or a combination of any of the foregoing. \n\n\n Ophthalmic solutions are preferably maintained in a pH range between about pH 3.5 to 9.0, and preferably about pH 6.5 and pH 7.2, with a suitable buffer. The pH may be adjusted by any known means, such as by use of HCI or NaOH. Buffers may include acetate, boric acid, sodium borate, potassium citrate, citric acid, sodium bicarbonate, TRIS, various mixed phosphate buffers\n\n\n(such as combinations of Na\n2\nHP0\n4\n, NaH\n2\nP0\n4\n and KH\n2\nP0\n4\n) and mixtures thereof. Generally, buffers will be used in amounts ranging from about 0.05% to 2.5% (w/v), and preferably from about 0.1 % to 1.5% percent; buffers should be as close to physiological ion concentrations as possible to minimize potential irritation but still maintain drug product pH over the shelf life of the product. \n\n\n The ophthalmic solutions employed in the present invention may be made from purified water, and in one aspect preferably from a physiological saline solution. Additional tonicity enhancing agents may be employed, including either ionic or non-ionic tonicity enhancing agents, or both. Ionic tonicity enhancing agents include alkali metal or earth metal halides, such as CaCI\n2\n, KBr, KCI, LiCI, Nal, NaBr, NaCI, Na\n2\nS0\n4\n or boric acid. Non-ionic tonicity enhancing agents include urea, glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol, propylene glycol, or dextrose. The aqueous solutions of the present invention are typically adjusted with tonicity agents to approximate an osmotic pressure equivalent to a 0.9% (w/v) solution of sodium chloride or a 2.5% solution of glycerol. However, tonicity ranges equivalent to between 0.7% and 1.5% NaCI are generally considered to be acceptable. \n\n\n The solutions can also contain conventional, pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives, stabilizers, cosolvents and/or penetration enhancers as well as viscoelastic substances included in artificial tear preparations. Pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives include quaternary ammonium \n\n compounds such as benzalkonium chloride, benzoxonium chloride or the like; alkyl-mercury salts of thiosalicylic acid such as thiomersal, phenylmercuric nitrate, phenylmercuric acetate or \n\n\nphenylmercuric borate; sodium perborate; sodium chlorite; parabens, such asmethylparaben or propylparaben; alcohols such as chlorobutanol, benzyl alcohol or phenyl ethanol; guanidine derivatives such as chlorohexidine or polyhexamethylene biguanide; sorbic acid; boric acid; or peroxide forming preservatives, or combinations of two or more of the foregoing. Pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants and chelating agents may be used including various sulphites (such as sodium metabisulphite, sodium thiosulphate, sodium bisulfite, or sodium sulfite), otocopherol, ascorbic acid, acetylcysteine, 8-hydroxyquinolome, antipyrine, butylated hydroxyanisole or butylated hydroxytoluene, EDTA, and others. Cosolvents such as alcohols and others may also be used. Various substances can also be used to enhance formulation stability, such as cyclodextrins. \n\n\n Penetration enhancers may be employed in ophthalmic solutions, including compounds such as surfactants, certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulphoxide and other sulphoxides, dimethylacetamide and pyrrolidine, certain amides of heterocyclic amines, glycols (e.g. propylene glycol), propylene carbonate, oleic acid, alkylamines and derivatives, various cationic, anionic and nonionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants and the like. Additional penetration enhancers that may be employed include cetylpyridinium chloride, ionophores such as lasalocid, benzalkonium chloride, polysorbates such as polysorbate 20 (Tween® 20), parabens, saponins, various polyoxyethylene ether compounds such as Brij® 35, Brij® 78 or Brij® 98, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), bile salts, and bile acids (such as sodium cholate, sodium taurocholate, sodium glycodeoxycholate, sodium taurodeoxycholate, taurocholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid), capric acid, azone, fucidic acid, hexamethylene lauramide, saponins, hexamethylene octanamide, and decylmethyl sulfoxide. Ion pairing formulations utilizing charged excipients or counter ions to shield/neutralize charged groups on drug molecules may also be employed to lower the lipophilicity of the compound to increase corneal penetration. These formulations include but are not limited to ions such as sorbic acid, boric acid and maleic acid, among other charged ion pairing agents. \n\n\n Viscosity enhancers or lubricants may be employed as necessary or appropriate. In one aspect, the viscosity enhancer includes a water soluble polymer, such as polyols, including polyvinyl alcohol, a polyethylene glycol, or combinations of water soluble polymers. In one aspect, polyethylene glycol 300 or 400 is employed. The contents of water soluble polymer may be between about 0.25% and about 4.0% (w/v). Thus an ophthalmic solution can include, by way of example, 1 % of polyvinyl alcohol, 1 % of polyethylene glycol 300 or 400, or both. Other polyols may be employed, including glycerol, glycerin, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, povidone, and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Other lubricants, sometimes also called tear substitutes, may also be employed, including cellulose derivatives such hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and methyl cellulose; dextrans such as dextran 70; water soluble proteins such as gelatin; carbomers such as carbomer 934P, carbomer 941 , carbomer 940 and carbomer 974P; and gums such as HP-guar, xanthan gum or combinations thereof. Other viscosity enhancers that can be employed include polysaccharide compounds, such as sulfated or non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan compounds. In one aspect, the polysaccharide compound is a non- sulfated glycosaminoglycan such as hyaluronic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, \n\n such as sodium hyaluronate. Any commercially available molecular weight range of hyaluronic acid or salts thereof may be employed. From about 0.05% to about 0.4% (w/v) of hyaluronic acid or a salt thereof may be employed in an ophthalmic solution. In another aspect, the polysaccharide compound is a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan such as dextran. In yet another aspect, the polysaccharide is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan such as chondroitin sulfate. \n\n\n Semi-solid formulations may be employed for ophthalmic delivery to increase corneal residence times of drug molecules. Ointments containing polyethylene glycols, lanolin alcohols, ozokerite, ceresin, microcrystalline wax, surfactants, preservatives, sorbitan monolaurate, white petrolatum and light liquid petrolatum (mineral oil) or other petrolatum like bases may be used. \n\n\nAqueous or non-aqueous suspensions may also be used. For hydrophilic peptides, suspensions using pharmaceutically acceptable oils or petrolatum may be used. Suspensions may contain microspheres or microparticulates, nanoparticulates, mucoadhesive particles, viscosity increasing agents, surfactants and other agents. Mucoadhesive compounds include synthetic polymers, such as polyacrylic acid and polycarbophil; biopolymers such as hyaluronic acid or sodium carboxy methylcellulose (CMC); polyanionic polymers such as polyacrylic acid (PAA); polyacrylic acids such as Carbopol® 934P, polycarbophil, and CMC or PAA with Pluronic® polyoxalkylene ethers; or polycationic polymers such as chitosan. Emulsions (oil in water or water in oil), including \n\n\nmicroemulsions, may also be employed that are composed of pharmaceutically acceptable oils together with one or more of viscosity increasing agents, preservatives, cosolvents, surfactants and other agents. Pharmaceutically acceptable oils include mineral oils and organic oils, including oils comprising medium chain or long chain saturated or unsaturated fatty acids or esters thereof. \n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable oils thus include any of a range of medium chain triglycerides, as well as oils such as almond oil, castor oil, cottonseed oil, glycerin (glycerol), peanut oil, mineral oil, polyethylene glycol, poppyseed oil, propylene glycol, saff lower oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, olive oil and vegetable oil. A surfactant such as a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, polyoxyl castor oil, tyloxapol, alkyl aryl ether sulfonate, lecithin, sorbitan esters, glyceryl monostearate, cetyl alcohol, octoxynol-9, nonoxynol-9, polyoxyethylene stearates, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters such as polysorbate 20, 60 and 80 or others may also be employed. Aqueous gels, often comprised of polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyacrylamide, poloxamer, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), carbomer, polymethylvinylether maleic anhydride, and hydroxypropyl ethylcellulose may also be used. Hydrogels containing swellable, water insoluble polymers may be utilized containing polymers such as poly(acrylic acid), poly(acrylic acids), poly(acrylamide), and ethylene maleic anhydride, and chemically or thermally-treated gelatins. Ocular inserts, liposomes, discomes, niosomes, dedrimers, nanosuspensions, nanoparticles and microparticles may also be used to provide a controlled release of the drug. Liposomes and other controlled release agents may be positively charged to increase residence times through ionic interactions with the negatively charged corneal surface. Nanoparticles may be composed of biodegradable polymers such as polyactides (PLAs), polycyano acrylates, poly (D,L-lactides), and natural polymers such as chitosan, gelatin, sodium alginate, albumin and others. \n\n\n 6.5 Routes of Administration of Formulations. \n\n If a formulation including one or more peptides of the present invention is administered by injection, the injection may be intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or other means known in the art. The peptides of the present invention may be formulated by any means known in the art, including but not limited to formulation as tablets, capsules, caplets, suspensions, powders, lyophilized preparations, suppositories, ocular drops, skin patches, oral soluble formulations, sprays, aerosols and the like, and may be mixed and formulated with buffers, binders, excipients, stabilizers, anti-oxidants and other agents known in the art. In general, any route of administration by which the peptides of invention are introduced across an epidermal layer of cells may be employed. Administration means may thus include formulations for administration through mucous membranes, buccal administration, oral administration, dermal administration, inhalation administration, nasal administration, urethral administration, vaginal administration, and the like. \n\n\n 6.6 Therapeutically Effective Amount. \n\n\n In general, the actual quantity of linear peptide of the present invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending upon the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired. The dosage for treatment is administration, by any of the foregoing means or any other means known in the art, of an amount sufficient to bring about the desired therapeutic effect. Thus a therapeutically effective amount includes an amount of a peptide or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention that is sufficient to therapeutically alleviate sexual dysfunction in a patient, or to prevent or delay onset or recurrence of the sexual dysfunction. \n\n\n In general, the linear peptides of the present invention are highly active. For example, the linear peptide can be systemically administered at about 0.1 , 0.5, 1 , 5, 50, 100, 500, 1000 or 5000 μg/kg body weight, depending on the specific peptide selected, the desired therapeutic response, the route of administration, the formulation and other factors known to those of skill in the art. \n\n\n 7.0 Peptides of the Present Invention. \n\n\n In one aspect, the invention provides a linear peptide which contains a core sequence derived\n\n\nPhe-Arg-Xaa\n5\n-Trp or His-Phe-Arg-Xaa\n5\n-Trp. The core sequence derived from (His)-Phe-Arg-Xaa\n5\n-Trp may include a number of substitutions. The His position, if present, may be His, or may be a substituted or unsubstituted Pro or an amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alcohol, ether, sulfide, sulfone, sufoxide, carbomyl or carboxyl. Substituted Pro includes, but is not limited to, amino acids such as Hyp, Hyp(Bzl), Pro(4R-Bzl) or Pro(4R-NH\n2\n). The Phe position may be Phe, but is most typically substituted or unsubstituted D-Phe, D-Nal 1 , D-Nal 2 or an amino acid with a side chain including pyridyl. The Arg position may be Arg, Lys, Orn, Dab or Dap, or a substituted or \n\n\nunsubstituted Pro, or Cit, or may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, guanidine, urea, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, or ether. Xaa\n5\n may be Gly, Sar, an L- or D- isomer of Pro or an amino acid with a side chain consisting of linear or branched alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkylcycloalkyl, aryl, or alkylaryl. The Trp position may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl, such as Trp, Nal 1 or Nal 2. \n\n\n The invention thus provides a linear peptide of formula (VI): \n\n\n Z-Xaa -Xaa\n2\n-Xaa\n3\n-Xaa\n4\n-Xaa\n5\n-Xaa\n6\n-Y (VI) \n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein: \n\n\n Z is H or an N-terminal group; \n\n\n Xaa\n1\n is optionally present, and if present is from one to three amino acid residues; \n\n\n Xaa\n2\n is L- or D-Pro, optionally substituted with hydroxyl, halogen, sulfonamide, alkyl, -O-alkyl, aryl, alkyl-aryl, alkyl-O-aryl, alkyl-O-alkyl-aryl, or -O-aryl, or Xaa\n2\n is an L- or D-isomer amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, alkyl, cycloalkyi, cycloheteroalkyi, aryl, heteroaryl, ether, sulfide, or carboxyl; \n\n\n Xaa\n3\n is an L- or D-isomer amino acid with a side chain including phenyl or naphthyl, optionally substituted with one or more substituents independently selected from halo, (Ci-Cio)alkyl-halo, (d- Cio)alkyl, (Ci-Cio)alkoxy, (Ci-Cio)alkylthio, aryl, aryloxy, nitro, nitrile, sulfonamide, amino, \n\n\nmonosubstituted amino, disubstituted amino, hydroxy, carboxy, and alkoxy-carbonyl; \n\n\n Xaa\n4\n is L- or D-Pro or Xaa\n4\n is an L- or D-isomer amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, guanidine, urea, alkyl, cycloalkyi, cycloheteroalkyi, aryl, heteroaryl, or ether; \n\n\n Xaa\n5\n is Gly, Sar, an L- or D- isomer of Pro or an amino acid with a side chain consisting of linear or branched alkyl, cycloalkyi, alkylcycloalkyl, aryl, or alkylaryl, \n\n\n Xaa\n6\n is an L- or D-amino acid with a side chain including at least one aryl or heteroaryl; and Y is a C-terminal group. \n\n\n In another aspect, Xaa\n1\n may be an amino acid with a side chain including a linear or branched alkyl, cycloalkyi, cycloheteroalkyi, aryl or heteroaryl. \n\n\n In another aspect, the N-terminal group may be a Ci to C\n7\n acyl group, a linear or branched Ci to C-I7 alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkene, alkenyl, or aralkyl chain or an N-acylated linear or branched C-i to Ci\n/\n alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkene, alkenyl, or aralkyl chain. \n\n\n In another aspect, Y may be a hydroxyl, an amide, or an amide substituted with one or two linear or branched Ci to d\n7\n alkyl, cycloalkyi, aryl, alkyl cycloalkyi, aralkyl, heteroaryl, alkene, alkenyl, or aralkyl chains. \n\n\n In the foregoing and in formula (I), substituted Pro, where provided, may be, for example, Hyp, Hyp(Bzl), Pro(4-Bzl), and Pro(4-NH\n2\n). \n\n\n The peptides encompassed within formulas (I) through (VI) contain one or more asymmetric elements such as stereogenic centers, stereogenic axes and the like, so that the peptides \n\n\nencompassed within formula (I) can exist in different stereoisomeric forms. For both specific and generically described peptides, including the peptides encompassed within formulas (I) through (VI), all forms of isomers at all chiral or other isomeric centers, including enantiomers and diastereomers, are intended to be covered herein. The peptides of the invention each include multiple chiral centers, and may be used as a racemic mixture or an enantiomerically enriched mixture, in addition to use of the peptides of the invention in enantiopure preparations. Typically, the peptides of the invention will be synthesized with the use of chirally pure reagents, such as specified L- or D-amino acids, using reagents, conditions and methods such that enantiomeric purity is maintained, but it is possible and contemplated that racemic mixtures may be made. Such racemic mixtures may optionally be separated using well-known techniques and an individual enantiomer may be used alone. In cases and under specific conditions of temperature, solvents and pH wherein peptides may exist in \n\n tautomeric forms, each tautomeric form is contemplated as being included within this invention whether existing in equilibrium or predominantly in one form. Thus a single enantiomer of a peptide of formula (I), which is an optically active form, can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis, synthesis from optically pure precursors, or by resolution of the racemates. \n\n\n The invention is further intended to include prodrugs of the present peptides, which on administration undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming active pharmacological peptides. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the present peptides, which are readily convertible in vivo into a peptide of formula (I) through (VI). Prodrugs are any covalently bonded compounds, which release the active parent peptide drug of formula (I) through (VI) in vivo. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in \"Design of Prodrugs\", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985. Typical examples of prodrugs have biologically labile protecting groups on a functional moiety, such as for example by esterification of hydroxyl, carboxyl or amino functions. Thus by way of example and not limitation, a prodrug includes peptides of formula (I) wherein an ester prodrug form is employed, such as, for example, lower alkyl esters of an R group of formula (I), such as where R is -OH, which lower alkyl esters may include from 1-8 carbons in an alkyl radical or aralkyl esters which have 6-12 carbons in an aralkyl radical. Broadly speaking, prodrugs include compounds that can be oxidized, reduced, aminated, deaminated, hydroxylated, dehydroxylated, hydrolyzed, dehydrolyzed, alkylated, dealkylated, acylated, deacylated, phosphorylated or dephosphorylated to produce an active parent peptide drug of formula (I) in vivo. \n\n\n The subject invention also includes peptides which are identical to those recited in formula (I) through (III), but for the fact that one or more atoms depicted in formula (I) through (III) are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n3\nC, \n4\nC, \n5\nN, 80 and \n7\n0, respectively. Peptides of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates of said compounds which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as \n3\nH and \n4\nC are incorporated, may have use in a variety of assays, such as in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. \n\n\nSubstitution with heavier isotopes, such as substitution of one or more hydrogen atoms with deuterium (\n2\nH), can provide pharmacological advantages in some instances, including increased metabolic stability. Isotopically labeled peptides of formula (I) through (VI) can generally be prepared by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. \n\n 8.0 Tests and Assays Employed in Evaluation of the Peptides of the Present Invention.\n\n\nThe melanocortin receptor-specific peptides of the present invention of this invention may be tested by a variety of assay systems and animal models to determine binding, functional status and efficacy. \n\n\n 8.1 Competitive Inhibition Assay using [l \n25\n]-NDP-a-MSH. \n\n\n A competitive inhibition binding assay was performed using membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMCR-1 a or hMCR-4 (in each instance where the h prefix refers to human), or alternatively membrane homogenates from B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells containing endogenous murine MCR-1. In the examples that follow, all MCR-1 and MCR-4 values are for human recombinant receptors, unless otherwise noted. Assays were performed in 96 well polypropylene round-bottom plates (VWR catalog number 12777-030). \n\n\nMembrane homogenates were incubated with 0.1 nM [l \n25\n]-NDP-a-MSH (Perkin Elmer) and increasing concentrations of test peptides of the present invention in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) with 100 mM NaCI, 2 mM CaCI\n2\n, 2 mM MgCI\n2\n, 0.3 mM 1 ,10-phenanthroline, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 90 minutes at 37°C, the assay mixture was filtered onto GF/B Unifilter plates (Perkin-Elmer catalog number 6005177) and washed with 3 mL of ice-cold buffer per well. Filters were air dried and 35 [it of scintillation cocktail added to each well. Plates were counted in a Microbeta counter for bound radioactivity. Non-specific binding was measured by inhibition of binding of [l \n25\n]-NDP-a-MSH in the presence of 1 μΜ NDP-a-MSH. Maximal specific binding (100%) was defined as the difference in radioactivity (cpm) bound to cell membranes in the absence and presence of 1 μΜ NDP-a-MSH. Each assay was conducted in duplicate and the actual mean values are described, with results less than 0% reported as 0%. Ki values for peptides of the present invention were determined using Graph-Pad Prism® curve-fitting software. \n\n\n 8.2 Assay for Agonist Activity. \n\n\n Accumulation of intracellular cAMP was examined as a measure of the ability of the peptides of the present invention to elicit a functional response in a human melanoma cell line, HBL, that express hMCR-1 (see Kang, L, et al., \"A selective small molecule agonist of melanocortin-1 receptor inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine accumulation and leukocyte infiltration in mice,\" J. Leuk. Biol. 80:897-904 (2006)) or HEK-293 cells that express hMCR-4. Confluent HBL cells that express hMCR-1 or HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMCR-4 were detached from culture plates by incubation in enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer. Dispersed cells were suspended in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCI\n2\n, 1 mM glutamine, 0.5% albumin and 0.3 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 0.4 x 10\n5\n cells per well for HBL cells and 0.5 x 10\n5\n cells per well for HEK-293 cells and pre-incubated for 10 minutes. Cells were exposed for 15 minutes at 37° C to peptides of the present invention dissolved in DMSO (final DMSO concentration of 1 %) at a concentration range of 0.05 - 5000 nM in a total assay volume of 200 [it. NDP-a-MSH was used as the reference agonist. cAMP levels were determined by an HTRF® cAMP cell-based assay system from Cisbio Bioassays utilizing cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP, with plates read on a Perkin-Elmer Victor plate reader at 665 and 620nM. Data analysis was performed by nonlinear regression analysis with Graph-Pad Prism\n®\n software. Maximum efficacy (E\nmax\n) values were \n\n determined for each test peptide of the present invention, compared to that achieved by the reference melanocortin agonist NDP-a-MSH. \n\n\n 9.0 Examples. \n\n\n Peptides of the following structures were synthesized and purified as described in Section 5 above, with the resulting peptide having the structure depicted. After synthesis and purification, the foregoing peptide was tested as described in Section 8 above, and average MCR-1 and MCR-4 Ki values determined as indicated. All Ki values were determined using [l \n25\n]-NDP-a-MSH. All results are expressed in nM except for E\nmax\n values, which are percentage values. \n\n\n 9.1 Ac-Nle- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result \n\n\n MC-4 Ki (average) 1735\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 0.2\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 0.02\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 96% \n\n\nAc-Nle- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result \n\n\n MC-4 Ki (average) 20\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 185\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 9\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 78% \n\n Ac-Nle-His-D-Phe-Arg-Ala-Trp-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:6) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) \n\n\nAc-Nle-Ala-His-D-Phe-Arg-Sar-Trp-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID N0:7) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result\n\n\nMC-4 Ki (average) 870\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 2\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 0.17\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 77% \n\n Ac-Nle-Ala-His-D-Phe-Arg-Gly-Trp-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:8) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) \n\n\n Ac-Nle-Ala-His-Phe-Arg-Ala-Trp-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:9) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) \n\n Ac-Nle- 10) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result\n\n\nMC-4 Ki (average) 10000\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 340\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 21\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 75% \n\n\nAc-Nle-His-Phe-Arg-Ala-Trp-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO: 1 1 ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result\n\n\nMC-4 Ki (average) 10000\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 5925\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) NA\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 55% \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result\n\n\nMC-4 Ki (average) 215\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 7\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 0.6\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 70% \n\n\nAc-Nle-Ala-D-Phe-Arg-Ala-Trp-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO: 13) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) \n\n Ac-Nle-Ala-His-D-Phe-Arg-D-Pro-Trp-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO: 14) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result\n\n\nMC-4 Ki (average) 6200\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 14\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 1\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 70% \n\n\nAc- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssay Result\n\n\nMC-4 Ki (average) 10000\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 20\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 2\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 72% \n\n Ac-Nle-Ala-His-D-Phe-Arg-Pro-D-Trp-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO: 16) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result\n\n\nMC-4 Ki (average) 650\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 2\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 0.17\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 90% \n\n\nAc-Nle-Ala-His-D-Phe-Arg-Ala-Trp-OH (SEQ ID NO: 17) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result\n\n\nMC-4 Ki (average) 7425\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 6\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 0.4\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 73% \n\n Ac-N le-D-Phe-Arg-Ala-Trp-N H\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:18) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result\n\n\nMC-4 Ki (average) 7125\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 1290\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 402\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 67% Ac-Nle-Ala-His-D-Phe-Ala-Ala-Trp-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:19) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result\n\n\nMC-4 Ki (average) 10000\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 43\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 4\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 99 \n\n Ac-Nle-Al \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssay Result\n\n\nMC-4 Ki (average) 10000\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 195\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 8\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 94% \n\n\nAc-Nl ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) \n\n Ac-Nle-Ala-Phe-D-Phe-Arg-Ala-Trp-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:22) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result\n\n\nMC-4 Ki (average) 1625\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 20\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 6\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 99% \n\n\nAc-N le-Ala-Lys-D-Phe-Arg-Ala-Trp-N H\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:23) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result\n\n\nMC-4 Ki (average) 10000\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 4\n\n\nMC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 0.1\n\n\nMC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 107% \n\n Ac-Nle- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result \n\n\n MC-4 Ki (average) 7583 \n\n\n MC-1 Ki (average) 0.3 \n\n\n MC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 0.045 \n\n\n MC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 107% \n\n\nAc-Nle-Al \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result \n\n\n MC-4 Ki (average) 7850 \n\n\n MC-1 Ki (average) 2 \n\n\n MC-1 EC\n50\n (average; cAMP HBL) 0.165 \n\n\n MC-1 E\nmax\n (average; cAMP HBL) 101 % \n\n\nAlthough the invention has been described in detail with particular reference to these preferred embodiments, other embodiments can achieve the same results.

Description\n\n\n\n\n Melanocortin-1 Receptor-Specific Cyclic Peptides \n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION \n\n\n This application claims priority to and the benefit of the filing of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/263,490 entitled \"Melanocortin-1 Receptor-Specific Cyclic Peptides\", filed on November 23, 2009, and the specification and claims thereof of are incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n Field of the Invention (Technical Field): \n\n\n The present invention relates to melanocortin receptor-specific cyclic peptides, particularly cyclic peptides selective and specific for the melanocortin-1 receptor, which may be used in the treatment of melanocortin-1 receptor-mediated or responsive diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. \n\n\n Description of Related Art: \n\n\n The following discussion refers to a number of publications by author(s) and year of publication, and that due to recent publication dates certain publications are not to be considered as prior art vis-a-vis the present invention. Discussion of such publications herein is given for more complete background and is not to be construed as an admission that such publications are prior art for patentability determination purposes. \n\n\n A family of melanocortin receptor types and subtypes has been identified. Receptor types include melanocortin-1 (MC-1 ) receptor (MCR-1 ), commonly known to be expressed in normal human melanocytes and on melanoma cells, but which is also reported to be expressed in various other cells, including those involved in immune responses, such as monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells and endothelial cells. See generally, Kang, L., et al., \"A selective small molecule agonist of melanocortin-1 receptor inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine accumulation and leukocyte infiltration in mice,\" J. Leuk. Biol. 80:897-904 (2006), and references cited therein. A variety of human MCR-1 subtypes and variants are known, including those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,693, 184 and 7, 1 15,393. In addition to MCR-1 , other melanocortin receptor types include melanocortin-2 receptor (MCR-2) for ACTH (adrenocorticotropin), expressed in cells of the adrenal gland, melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 (MC-4) receptors (MCR-3 and MCR-4), expressed primarily in cells in the hypothalamus, mid-brain and brainstem, and melanocortin-5 receptor (MCR-5), expressed in a wide distribution of peripheral tissues. \n\n\n The primary endogenous melanocortin agonist is the cyclic a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\"a-MSH\") peptide. Melanocortin receptor-specific peptides generally contain the central tetrapeptide sequence of native a-MSH, His\n6\n-Phe\n7\n-Arg\n8\n-Trp\n9\n (SEQ ID NO: 1 ), or a mimetic or variation thereof, including various substitutions at one or more positions (see, e.g., Hruby, V.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n 1.0 Definitions. \n\n\n Before proceeding with the description of the invention, certain terms are defined as set forth herein. \n\n\n In the sequences given for the peptides according to the present invention, the amino acid residues have their conventional meaning as given in Chapter 2400 of the Manual of Patent \n\n\n Examining Procedure, 8\nth\n Ed. Thus, \"Nle\" is norleucine, \"Asp\" is aspartic acid, \"His\" is histidine, \"Phe\" is phenylalanine, \"Arg\" is arginine, \"Trp\" is tryptophan, and \"Lys\" is lysine, and so on. It is to be understood that \"D\" isomers are designated by a \"D-\" before the three letter code or amino acid name, such that for example D-Phe is D-phenylalanine. Amino acid residues not encompassed by the foregoing have the following definitions: \n\n\n Abbreviation Common Name Side Chain or Amino Acid Structure \n\n\n Aib alpha-aminoisobutyric acid \n\n\n \n\n Abbreviation Common Name Side Chain or Amino Acid Structure\n\n\nCit citrulline \n\n\n\n\n\n diaminobutyric acid \n\n\n diaminoproprionic acid \n\n\n homoglutamic acid hydroxyproline \n\n\nHyp(Bzl) O-benzyl-hydroxyproline \n\n\n3-(1 -naphthyl)alanine \n\n\n3-(2-naphthyl)alanine norleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ornithine \n\n Abbreviation Common Name Side Chain or Amino Acid Structure \n\n\n Pro(4-Bzl) 4-benzyl-proline \n\n\nPro(4-NH\n2\n) 4-amino-proline \n\n\nSar sarcosine \n\n\n\n\n\n An \"a, a-disubstituted amino acid\" means any a-amino acid having a further substituent in the oposition, which substituent may be the same as or different from the side chain moiety of the o amino acid . Suitable substituents, in addition to the side chain moiety of the a-amino acid , include Ci to C\n6\n linear or branched alkyl. Aib is an example of an a, a-disubstituted amino acid . While a, a- disubstituted amino acids can be referred to using conventional L- and D-isomeric references, it is to be understood that such references are for convenience, and that where the substituents at the a- position are different, such amino acid can interchangeably be referred to as an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from the L- or D-isomer, as appropriate, of a residue with the designated amino acid side chain moiety. Thus (S)-2-Amino-2-methyl-hexanoic acid can be referred to as either an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from L-Nle or as an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from D-Ala. Similarly, Aib can be referred to as an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from Ala. \n\n\nWhenever an a, a-disubstituted amino acid is provided, it is to be understood as including all (R) and (S) configurations thereof. Whenever a claim or description herein refers to an \"amino acid\", such designation includes, but is not limited to, an \"a, a-disubstituted amino acid.\" \n\n\n An \"N-substituted amino acid\" means any amino acid wherein an amino acid side chain moiety is covalently bonded to the backbone amino group, including optionally where there are no substituents other than H in the a-carbon position. Sarcosine is an example of an N-substituted amino acid . By way of example, sarcosine can be referred to as an N-substituted amino acid derivative of Ala, in that the amino acid side chain moiety of sarcosine and Ala is the same, methyl. Whenever a claim or description herein refers to an \"amino acid\", such designation includes, but is not limited to, an \"\"N-substituted amino acid.\" \n\n In certain instances groups may be substituted for an amino acid, such as particularly use of a dicarboxylic acid in place of an amino acid. One particular dicarboxylic acid utilized herein is succinic acid, abbreviated as \"Sue\", which has the structural formula o o \n\n\n The term \"alkane\" includes linear or branched saturated hydrocarbons. Examples of linear alkane groups include methane, ethane, propane, and the like. Examples of branched or substituted alkane groups include methylbutane or dimethylbutane, methylpentane, dimethylpentane or trimethylpentane, and the like. In general, any alkyl group may be a substitutent of an alkane. \n\n\n The term \"alkene\" includes unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain one or more double carbon- carbon bonds. Examples of such alkene groups include ethylene, propene, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"alkenyl\" includes a linear monovalent hydrocarbon radical of two to six carbon atoms or a branched monovalent hydrocarbon radical of three to six carbon atoms containing at least one double bond; examples thereof include ethenyl, 2-propenyl, and the like. \n\n\n The \"alkyl\" groups specified herein include those alkyl radicals of the designated length in either a straight or branched configuration. Examples of such alkyl radicals include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"alkyne\" includes a linear monovalent hydrocarbon radical of two to six carbon atoms or a branched monovalent hydrocarbon radical of three to six carbon atoms containing at least one triple bond; examples thereof include ethyne, propyne, butyne, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"aryl\" includes a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon radical of 6 to 12 ring atoms, and optionally substituted independently with one or more substituents selected from alkyl, haloalkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, alkythio, halo, nitro, acyl, cyano, amino, monosubstituted amino, disubstituted amino, hydroxy, carboxy, or alkoxy-carbonyl. Examples of an aryl group include phenyl, biphenyl, naphthyl, 1-naphthyl, and 2-naphthyl, derivatives thereof, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"aralkyl\" includes a radical - R\na\nR\nb\n where R\na\n is an alkylene (a bivalent alkyl) group and R\nb\n is an aryl group as defined above. Examples of aralkyl groups include benzyl, phenylethyl, 3- (3-chlorophenyl)-2-methylpentyl, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"aliphatic\" includes compounds with hydrocarbon chains, such as for example alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and derivatives thereof. \n\n\n The term \"acyl\" includes a group R(C=0)-, where R is an organic group. An example is the acetyl group CH\n3\n-C(=0)-, referred to herein as \"Ac\". As used herein, R may comprise a Ci to d\n7\n linear or branched alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkylcycloalkyl, aryl or alkylaryl. \n\n\n A peptide or aliphatic moiety is \"acylated\" when an alkyl or substituted alkyl group as defined above is bonded through one or more carbonyl {-(C=0)-} groups. A peptide is most usually acylated at the N-terminus. \n\n\n An \"omega amino aliphatic chain\" includes an aliphatic moiety with a terminal amino group.\n\n\nExamples of omega amino aliphatic chains include aminoheptanoyl and the amino acid side chain moieties of ornithine and lysine. \n\n\n The term \"heteroaryl\" includes mono- and bicyclic aromatic rings containing from 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl are monocyclic \n\n heteroaromatic rings; examples thereof include thiazole, oxazole, thiophene, furan, pyrrole, imidazole, isoxazole, pyrazole, triazole, thiadiazole, tetrazole, oxadiazole, pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, and the like.

Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions utilized in the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing an active ingredient and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. \n\n\n By a melanocortin receptor \"agonist\" is meant an endogenous substance, drug substance or compound, including a compound such as the peptides of the present invention, which can interact with a melanocortin receptor and initiate a pharmacological response, including but not limited to adenyl cyclase activation, characteristic of the melanocortin receptor. For the present invention, a melanocortin receptor agonist which is an agonist at MCR-1 is preferred. \n\n\n By \"a-MSH\" is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-\n\n\nNH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:2) and analogs and homologs thereof, including without limitation NDP-a-MSH. \n\n\n By \"NDP-a-MSH\" is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Nle-Glu-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys- Pro-Val-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:3) and analogs and homologs thereof. \n\n\n By \"EC\n50\n\" is meant the molar concentration of an agonist, including a partial agonist, which produced 50% of the maximum possible response for that agonist. By way of example, a test compound which, at a concentration of 72 nM, produces 50% of the maximum possible response for that compound as determined in a cAMP assay in an MCR-1 cell expression system has an EC\n50\n of 72 nM. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with an EC\n50\n determination is in nanomoles per liter (nM). \n\n\n By \"Ki (nM)\" is meant the equilibrium inhibitor dissociation constant representing the molar concentration of a competing compound that binds to half the binding sites of a receptor at equilibrium in the absence of radioligand or other competitors. In general, the numeric value of the Ki is inversely correlated to the affinity of the compound for the receptor, such that if the Ki is low, the affinity is high. Ki may be determined using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22: 3099-3108, 1973): \n\n \n1 |\n [ligand]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \"ligand\" is the concentration of radioligand and K\nD\n is an inverse measure of receptor affinity for the radioligand which produces 50% receptor occupancy by the radioligand. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with a Ki determination is in nM. Ki may be expressed in terms of specific receptors (e.g., MCR-1 , MCR-3, MCR-4 or MCR-5), specific species (e.g., human or murine), and specific ligands (e.g., a-MSH or NDP-a-MSH). \n\n\n By \"inhibition\" is meant the percent attenuation, or decrease in receptor binding, in a competitive inhibition assay compared to a known standard. Thus, by \"inhibition at 1 μΜ (NDP-a- MSH)\" is meant the percent decrease in binding of NDP-a-MSH by addition of a determined amount of the compound to be tested, such as 1 μΜ of a test compound, such as under the assay conditions hereafter described. By way of example, a test compound that does not inhibit binding of NDP-a- MSH has a 0% inhibition, and a test compound that completely inhibits binding of NDP-a-MSH has a 100% inhibition. Typically, as described hereafter, a radio assay is used for competitive inhibition testing, such as with l \n25\n-labeled NDP-a-MSH, or a lanthanide chelate fluorescent assay, such as with Eu-NDP-a-MSH. However, other methods of testing competitive inhibition are known, including use of label or tag systems other than radioisotopes, and in general any method known in the art for testing competitive inhibition may be employed in this invention. It may thus be seen that \"inhibition\" is one measure to determine whether a test compound attenuates binding of a-MSH to melanocortin receptors. \n\n\n By \"binding affinity\" is meant the ability of a compound or drug to bind to its biological target, expressed herein as Ki (nM). \n\n\n In general, \"functional activity\" is a measure of the signaling of a receptor, or measure of a change in receptor-associated signaling, such as a melanocortin receptor, and in particular MCR-1 or hMCR-1 , upon activation by a compound. Melanocortin receptors initiate signal transduction through activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. In one aspect, melanocortin receptors signal through Ga\ns\n, which catalyzes production of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase. Thus determination of stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, such as determination of maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, is one measure of functional activity, and is the primary measure exemplified herein. However, it is to be understood that alternative measures of functional activity may be employed in the practice of this invention, and are specifically contemplated and included within the scope of this invention. Thus, in one example intracellular free calcium may be measured, such as reported by and using the methods disclosed in Mountjoy, K. G., et al., \"Melanocortin receptor-medicated mobilization of intracellular free calcium in HEK293 cells,\" Physiol. Genomics 5:1 1-19 (2001 ), or Kassack, M. U., et al., \"Functional screening of G protein-coupled receptors by measuring intracellular calcium with a fluorescence microplate reader,\" Biomol. Screening 7:233-246 (2002). It is also possible to measure activation by \n\n\nmeasurement of the production of inositol triphosphate or diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5- biphosphate, such as by use of radioassays. Yet another measure of functional activity is receptor internalization, resulting from activation of regulatory pathways, such as using the methods disclosed in Nickolls, S. A., et al., \"Functional selectivity of melanocortin 4 receptor peptide and nonpeptide \n\n agonists: evidence for ligand specific conformational states,\" J. Pharm. Exper. Therapeutics \n\n\n313:1281-1288 (2005). Yet another measure of functional activity is the exchange, and exchange rate, of nucleotides associated with activation of a G protein receptor, such as the exchange of GDP (guanosine diphosphate) for GTP (guanosine triphosphase) on the G protein a subunit, which may be measured by any number of means, including a radioassay using guanosine 5'-(y-[\n35\nS]thio)- triphosphate, as disclosed in Manning, D. R., \"Measures of efficacy using G proteins as endpoints: differential engagement of G proteins through single receptors,\" Mol. Pharmacol. 62:451-452 (2002). Various gene-based assays have been developed for measuring activation of G-coupled proteins, such as those disclosed in Chen, W., et al., \"A colorimetric assay from measuring activation of Gs- and Gq-coupled signaling pathways,\" Anal. Biochem. 226:349-354 (1995); Kent, T. C, et al.,\n\n\n\"Development of a generic dual-reporter gene assay for screening G-protein-coupled receptors,\" Biomol Screening 5:437-446 (2005); or Kotarsky, K., et al., \"Improved receptor gene assays used to identify ligands acting on orphan seven-transmembrane receptors,\" Pharmacology & Toxicology 93:249-258 (2003). The colorimetric assay of Chen et al. has been adapted for use in measuring melanocortin receptor activation, as disclosed in Hruby, V. J., et al., \"Cyclic lactam omelanocortin analogues of Ac-Nle\n4\n-cyclo[Asp\n5\n,D-Phe\n7\n,Lys\n101\n omelanocyte-stimulating hormone-(4-10)-NH\n2\n with bulky aromatic amino acids at position 7 shows high antagonist potency and selectivity at specific melanocortin receptors,\" J. Med. Chem. , 38:3454-3461 (1995). In general, functional activity may be measured by any method, including methods of determining activation and/or signaling of a G- coupled receptor, and further including methods which may be hereafter developed or reported. Each of the foregoing articles, and the methods disclosed therein, is incorporated here by reference as if set forth in full. \n\n\n The terms \"treat,\" \"treating\" and \"treatment,\" as used herein, contemplate an action that occurs while a patient is suffering from the specified disease or disorder, which reduces the severity of the disease or disorder. \n\n\n As used herein, the term \"therapeutically effective amount\" means the amount of a compound including a peptide of the invention that will elicit a biological or medical response in the mammal that is being treated by a medical doctor or other clinician. \n\n\n As used herein, the term \"prophylactically effective\" or \"preventive\" means the amount of a compound including a peptide of the invention that will prevent or inhibit affliction or mitigate affliction of a mammal with a medical condition that a medical doctor or other clinician is trying to prevent, inhibit, or mitigate before a patient begins to suffer from the specified disease or disorder. \n\n\n By \"circulatory shock\" is meant the general medical condition in which organs and/or tissues of the body of the subject, which subject may be human or animal, are not receiving an adequate flow of blood. Circulatory shock includes conditions such as hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, vasodilatory shock and the like. These conditions or dysfunctions in circulation can in turn have different causes, such as bacterial blood infection (septic shock or infectious), severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock), trauma (traumatic shock), severe bleeding or loss of blood (hemorrhagic shock), neurologic dysfunction causing abnormal opening of blood vessels (neurogenic shock) or endocrine related (endocrine shock). Circulatory shock can further result in ischemia and ischemic damage to \n\n bodily organs, tissues, cells or parts. Upon reperfusion, or restoration of blood flow, ischemia- reperfusion injury can occur, also resulting in damage to bodily organs, tissues, or cells. \n\n\n By \"inflammatory disease,\" also sometimes called an \"inflammatory condition,\" is meant a disease or condition characterized in part by inflammatory mechanisms, such as specific T lymphocyte reactions or antibody-antigen interactions causing the recruitment of inflammatory cells and endogenous mediator chemicals, including but not limited to cytokines, which mediator chemicals include but are not limited to one or more of increased NF-κΒ activity, increased TNF-a production, increased IL-1 production and increased IL-6 production. \n\n\n 2.0 Clinical Indications and Utility. \n\n\n The compositions and methods disclosed herein can be used for both medical applications and animal husbandry or veterinary applications. Typically, the methods are used in humans, but may also be used in other mammals. The term \"patient\" denotes a mammalian individual, and is so used throughout the specification and in the claims. The primary applications of the present invention involve human patients, but the present invention may be applied to laboratory, farm, zoo, wildlife, pet, sport or other animals. Clinical indications and specific utilities include the following: \n\n\n 2.1 Inflammatory Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n Peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention are directed towards the treatment of inflammatory diseases and inflammatory conditions in a subject. There are a number of inflammatory diseases and inflammatory conditions which may be so treated. In one aspect, the inflammatory condition results from a disease including a form of arthritis, including but not limited to osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, gout and pseudogout, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Still's disease and ankylosing spondylitis, as well as arthritis secondary to other diseases, such as arthritis secondary to lupus erythematosus, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, haemochromatosis, hepatitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, vasculitis syndromes, Lyme disease, familial Mediterranean fever, hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with recurrent fever, TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In another aspect, the inflammatory condition results from a disease including a form of inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, collagenous colitis, lymphocytic colitis, ischemic colitis, diversion colitis, Behget's syndrome, infective colitis and indeterminate colitis. In another aspect, the inflammatory condition results from an autoimmune disease, including but not limited to systemic syndromes such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis and polymyositis, or a syndrome affecting only a local body system, such as the endocrine system (diabetes mellitus type 1 , Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Addison's disease, etc.), dermatologic system (pemphigus vulgaris), hematologic system \n\n\n(autoimmune hemolytic anemia), or neural system (multiple sclerosis). Thus autoimmune diseases include, in addition to the general syndromes discussed above, such diseases and conditions as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Addison's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, aplastic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune oophoritis, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, gestational pemphigoid, Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Hashimoto's disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Kawasaki disease, lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, opsoclonus \n\n myoclonus syndrome, optic neuritis, Ord's thyroiditis, pemphigus, pernicious anaemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, Reiter's syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, Takayasu's arteritis, temporal arteritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and Wegener's granulomatosis. \n\n\n In another aspect, the inflammatory condition results from or is related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also known as chronic obstructive airway diseases, including but not limited to diseases characterized by the pathological limitation of airflow in the airway that is not fully reversible, such as for example chronic bronchitis, emphysema, pneumoconiosis, pulmonary neoplasms and other lung disorders. Other inflammatory conditions include upper or lower airway diseases and disorders, such as allergic asthma, non-allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, non-allergic conjunctivitis, and the like, as well as airway diseases related to external toxins or substances, such as various forms of pneumoconiosis (coalworker's pneumoconiosis, asbestosis, silicosis, bauxite fibrosis, berylliosis, or siderosis), byssinosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis (farmer's lung or bird fancier's lung). Other lung diseases involving an inflammatory condition include acute respiratory distress syndrome. The peptides and compositions of the present invention are of particular utility tor treatment of conditions wherein glucocorticoids are either ineffectual or inadequate to bring about the desired pharmacological response, such as COPD, asthma in individuals who smoke, and other conditions characterized, in whole or in part, by eosinophil accumulation in the lung, neutrophil infiltration and activation, alveolar macrophage recruitment and activation, epithelial cell expression of IL-8 or increased expression of TNF-a. For airway or lung disorders, in one aspect the peptides of the present invention are delivered systemically; in another aspect the peptides of the present invention are delivered locally, such as by inhalation administration. \n\n\n In yet another aspect, the inflammatory condition results from or is related to some form of transplant-related condition or syndrome, such as graft-versus-host disease, hyperacute rejection, acute rejection, or chronic rejection. Graft-versus-host disease is a common complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, but can occur with other transplantations, and particularly those with T cells present in the graft, either as contaminants or intentionally introduced. Hyperacute, acute or chronic rejection can occur with bodily organs such as kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen, uterus, heart or lungs, as well as transplantation of bone, cornea, face, hand, penis or skin. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of the peptides of the present invention is given prophylactically to limit or prevent a transplant-related condition or syndrome, such as immediately before, during or after transplantation of a bodily fluid, organ or part. In another embodiment, the bodily fluid, organ or part being transplanted is perfused with a solution of a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of the peptides of the present invention. In yet another embodiment, one or more of the peptides of the present invention are administered in conjunction with, combination with or series with one or more other agents for transplant rejection, such as calcineurin inhibitors including cyclosporin or tacrolimus, mTOR inhibitors including sirolimus or everolimus, anti-proliferatives including azathioprine or mycophenolic acid, corticosteroids including prednisolone or hydrocortisone, antibodies such as monoclonal anti-IL-2Ra receptor antibodies, basiliximab or daclizumab, or polyclonal anti-T-cell antibodies such as anti-thymocyte globulin or anti- lymphocyte globulin. \n\n 2.2 Fibrotic and Sclerotic Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. Peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention are directed towards the treatment of fibrotic and sclerotic diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes in a subject. There are a number of fibrotic and sclerotic diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes which may be so treated. Fibrotic and sclerotic diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes frequently include an inflammatory component, and thus many may similarly be categorized as an inflammatory disease or condition, and are listed in section 2.1 above. Fibrotic and sclerotic diseases and conditions, in addition to including an inflammatory component, may also be idiopathic, toxic, hereditary and/or pharmacologically-induced disorders. In general, fibrotic disorders are characterized by excessive production of extracellular matrix, primarily type I collagen, which may result in loss of organ function. It is believed, without wishing to be bound by theory, that agonism of MCR-1 can result in suppression of transforming growth factors-induced collagen synthesis by human dermal fibroblasts, thereby providing therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit for fibrotic and sclerotic diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. Representative fibrotic and sclerotic diseases and conditions that can be so treated include, but are not limited to, localized scleroderma, systemic sclerosis, sclerodermic graft-versus-host disease of the skin, idiopathic lung fibrosis, bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, cyclosporine-induced nephropathy, cirrhosis of the liver, hypertrophic scars, keloids and the like. \n\n\n 2.3 Diseases Related to Increased Cytokine Expression and Related Diseases, \n\n\nIndications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n Expression of various cytokines is increased during an inflammatory process, including an inflammatory process secondary to circulatory shock, ischemia, reperfusion injury and the like. TNF-a is a pleiotropic cytokine produced mainly by macrophages, and also by other types of cells. Other cytokines which increase during an inflammatory process, including an inflammatory process secondary to circulatory shock, ischemia, reperfusion injury and the like, include IL-1 and IL-6. While cytokines such as TNF-a have beneficial effects in many instances, significantly increased levels, such as secondary to circulatory shock, ischemia, reperfusion injury and the like, can have pathological effects. In one aspect, reperfusion of hypoxic or ischemic tissues, such as secondary to circulatory shock, results in inflammatory responses, including increased cytokine expression. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression, including decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression secondary to circulatory shock, ischemia, reperfusion injury and the like. The decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression, including without limitation one or more of TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6, occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1-20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1-10 minutes. \n\n\n In a related embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to increase anti-inflammatory cytokine production and expression. The increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine production and expression, including without limitation IL- 10, occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition \n\n comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1 -20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1-10 minutes. \n\n\n 2.4 Dermatologic Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n Peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention are further directed towards the treatment of dermatologic and cosmetic diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. In one aspect, peptides and compositions of the present invention are MCR-1 agonists which stimulate melanocytes and related cells to increase the level of melanin in the skin. By increasing the level of melanin in the skin, protection against ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and sunlight is afforded, including protection against phototoxicity and photosensitivity of the skin caused by UVR, sun and light. \n\n\n In one aspect, peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be utilized for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of dermal diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes such as acne vulgaris (commonly referred to as acne), atopic dermatitis (commonly referred to as atopic eczema or eczema), polymorphous light eruption, psoriasis, rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, vitiligo, porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, solar urticaria, urticaria pigmentosa or xeroderma pigmentosum. In another aspect, peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be utilized to prevent, limit or treat photosensitive or photoresponsive viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus (commonly referred to as cold sores and genital herpes depending on the site of infection), human papilloma virus and varicella zoster virus. In another aspect, peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be utilized to prevent, limit or treat cancers of the skin, including use in pre-cancerous conditions, and including use in actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. In another aspect, peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be utilized to prevent or limit adverse effects of various therapies, including phototherapies, such as photodynamic therapy. In yet another aspect, peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be utilized to induce a tan, to decrease hair graying or for similar and related purposes relating to increased melanin production. \n\n\n Peptides of the present invention may be administered by any of a variety of means, including application directly to the skin such as by means of oils, ointments, creams, gels, salves and the like, or by systemic administration, including by means of implants, such as subcutaneous dissolving implants. \n\n\n 2.5 Cytokine and/or Growth Factor Responsive Cancers. \n\n\n Certain cancers, such as mesothelioma, are reported to be very sensitive to growth-promoting influences of cytokines and growth factors, and may be treatable by means of peptides selective for MCR-1. Canania, A., et al., \"Autocrine inhibitory influences of omelanocyte-stimulating hormone in malignant pleural mesothelioma,\" J. Leukoc. Biol. 75:253-259 (2004). Cancers that may be so treated include pleural mesothelioma, known to express mRHA for MCR-1 and the receptor protein, as well as other tumors that express MCR-1 , including but not limited to adenocarcinoma, such as pulmonary adenocarcinoma. \n\n\n 2.6 Ocular Disease, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n There are a number of ocular diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes characterized by inflammation, including but not limited to increased cytokine production. One example is dry eye \n\n disease, an ocular disease affecting approximately 10-20% of the population. This disease progressively affects larger percentages of the population as it ages, with the majority of these patients being women. In addition, almost everyone experiences ocular irritation, or the symptoms and/or signs of dry eye as a condition, from time to time under certain circumstances, such as prolonged visual tasking (e.g., working on a computer), being in a dry environment, using medications that result in ocular drying and so on. In individuals suffering from dry eye, the protective layer of tears that normally protects the ocular surface is compromised, a result of insufficient or unhealthy production of one or more tear components. This can lead to exposure of the surface of the eye, ultimately promoting desiccation and damage of surface cells. Signs and symptoms of dry eye include but are not limited to keratitis, conjunctival and corneal staining, redness, blurry vision, decreased tear film break-up time, decreased tear production, tear volume, and tear flow, increased conjunctival redness, excess debris in the tear film, ocular dryness, ocular grittiness, ocular burning, foreign body sensation in the eye, excess tearing, photophobia, ocular stinging, refractive impairment, ocular sensitivity, and ocular irritation. Patients may experience one or more of these symptoms. The excess tearing response may seem counterintuitive, but it is a natural reflex response to the irritation and foreign body sensation caused by the dry eye. Some patients may also experience ocular itching due to a combination of ocular allergy and dry eye symptoms. \n\n\n There are many possible variables that can influence a patient's signs or symptoms of dry eye including levels of circulating hormones, various autoimmune diseases (e.g., Sjogren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus), ocular surgeries including PRK or LASIK, many medications, environmental conditions, visual tasking such as computer use, ocular fatigue, contact lens wear, and mechanical influences such as corneal sensitivity, partial lid closure, surface irregularities (e.g., pterygium), and lid irregularities (e.g., ptosis, entropion/ectropion, Pinguecula). Environments with low humidity, such as those that cause dehydration, can exacerbate or cause dry eye symptoms, such as sitting in a car with the defroster on or living in a dry climate zone. In addition, visual tasking can exacerbate symptoms. Tasks that can greatly influence symptoms include watching TV or using a computer for long periods of time where the blink rate is decreased. \n\n\n Uveitis is an ocular disease involving inflammation of the middle layer or uvea of the eye, and may also be understood to include any inflammatory process involving the interior of the eye. Uveitis includes anterior, intermediate, posterior and panuveitic forms, with the majority of uveitis cases anterior in location, involving inflammation of the iris and anterior chamber. This condition can occur as a single episode and subside with proper treatment or may take on a recurrent or chronic nature. Symptoms include red eye, injected conjunctiva, pain and decreased vision. Signs include dilated ciliary vessels, presence of cells and flare in the anterior chamber, and keratic precipitates on the posterior surface of the cornea. Intermediate uveitis includes inflammation and the presence of inflammatory cells in the vitreous cavity, and posterior uveitis include the inflammation of the retina and choroid. Uveitis may be secondary to any of a number of diseases and disorders, including acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, ankylosing spondylitis, Behget's disease, birdshot retinochoroidopathy, brucellosis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, Kawasaki disease, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, sarcoidosis, syphilis, systemic lupus erythematosus, toxocariasis, \n\n toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, Whipple disease or polyarteritis nodosa. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention for treatment of any of the foregoing ocular diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. Such treatment may include treatment by means of eye drops, ointments, gels, washes, implants, plugs or other means and methods for delivering one or more of the peptides of the present invention to an ocular surface. \n\n\n 2.7 Ischemia and Related Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n Ischemia refers to any decrease or stoppage in the blood supply to any bodily organ, tissue, cell, or part, particularly where that decrease or stoppage leads to or would likely lead to ischemic damage to the bodily organ, tissue, cell, or part. An \"ischemic episode\" refers to any transient or permanent period of ischemia. Ischemia may result from any constriction or obstruction of the vasculature, or may result from circulatory shock, such as hemorrhagic shock, hypovolemic shock, or the like. The decrease or lack of blood flow results in a decrease or lack of oxygen to the affected part of the body, and may also result in an increase of inflammatory disease mediator chemicals such as various cytokines and other substances. During certain surgical procedures such as cardiac surgery and organ transplantation, the flow of blood is stopped temporarily and then resumed (reperfusion), resulting in ischemia-reperfusion injury. During a heart attack, the blood that supplies the heart is stopped, also resulting in ischemia that can evolve into infarction. Current treatment to relieve heart attacks requires reperfusion of the ischemic area of the heart, such as by using thrombolytic drugs or coronary angioplasty. \n\n\n The invention has particular application in prevention of injury due to renal ischemia, including lung injury secondary to renal ischemia, preventing or limiting ischemic heart injuries subsequent to a myocardial infarction, preventing or limiting ischemic brain injuries subsequent to a cardiovascular injury, including without limitation myocardial infarction, stroke or the like. Neuroprotection is provided by administration of a composition of the invention to a patient with cerebral ischemia or stroke, particularly patients who are concurrently hypotensive. The invention has further particular application in preventing or limiting ischemic organ damage in organ transplant, including transplant of the heart, kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas or small intestine. In one aspect, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be utilized for perfusion of a transplant organ, which perfusion may be prior to, during or subsequent to transplant of the organ. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the heart, brain or other organs of a patient against injury caused by ischemia. The protective effect against ischemia occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1-20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1 -10 minutes. \n\n\n Ischemia may also results from any of a variety of diseases or conditions, and in one embodiment the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the organs of a patient against injury resulting from ischemia, which ischemia is caused by a disease or condition. Such disease or condition may include, by way of example and not \n\n limitation, atherosclerotic diseases such as atheromata with thrombosis, embolism from the heart or from blood vessel from any organ, vasospasm, hypotension due to heart disease, hypotension due to systemic disease including infection or allergic reactions, or hypotension resulting from administration, ingestion or other exposure to one or more toxic compounds or drugs. Ischemia may also be secondary ischemia, and in another embodiment the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the organs of a patient against injury resulting from secondary ischemia. Such secondary ischemia may be secondary to a disease or condition such diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, dyslipidemia Buerger's disease, also called thromboangiitis obliterans, Takayasu's arteritis, arteritis temporalis, Kawasaki disease, also called lymph node syndrome, mucocutaneous node disease, infantile polyarteritis, cardiovascular syphilis, and various connective tissue diseases and disorders. \n\n\n 2.8 Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury and Related Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n Ischemia-reperfusion is the interruption of blood flow to bodily tissue and the subsequent and often abrupt restoration of blood flow to the tissue. While restoration of blood flow following ischemia is essential to preserve functional tissue, the reperfusion itself is known to be harmful to the tissue. Both ischemia and reperfusion are known to be important contributors to tissue necrosis. Several mechanisms appear to play a causative role in the generation of tissue damage associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury. \n\n\n Various methods of limiting reperfusion injury have been described, such as induced hypothermia, controlled reperfusion, and ischemic preconditioning. Induced hypothermia is the induction of moderate hypothermia, thought to suppress many of the chemical reactions associated with reperfusion injury. Controlled reperfusion refers to controlling the initial period of reperfusion by reperfusing the tissue at a low pressure using blood that has been modified to be hyperosmolar, alkalotic, and substrate-enriched. Ischemic preconditioning is the purposeful causing of short ischemic events to have protective effect by slowing cell metabolism during a longer ischemic event. Although these treatments may be useful in surgical settings (e.g., before or after planned heart surgery), they are not possible in emergency settings. \n\n\n The invention has particular application in preventing or limiting the severity of renal reperfusion injury, including lung injury secondary to renal reperfusion, preventing or limiting reperfusion heart injuries subsequent to a myocardial infarction, preventing or limiting reperfusion brain injuries subsequent to a cardiovascular injury, including without limitation myocardial infarction, stroke or the like. The invention has further particular application in preventing or limiting reperfusion organ damage in organ transplant, including transplant of the heart, kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas or small intestine. In one aspect, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be utilized for perfusion of a transplant organ, which perfusion may be prior to, during or subsequent to transplant of the organ. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the heart, brain or other organs of a patient against injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury, including injury caused by or during reperfusion. The protective effect against ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following \n\n administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1 -20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1-10 minutes. \n\n\n 2.9 Circulatory Shock and Related Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. Peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be employed for the treatment of circulatory shock in a subject. The compositions and methods provided herein may be employed to treat Stage I shock, Stage II shock or Stage III shock. In one particular embodiment, the methods of the present invention are used to treat the initial stage of shock, which initial stage of shock is characterized by cardiac output insufficient to meet the body's metabolic needs, but not otherwise low enough to produce significant symptoms. The patient may be anxious and alert, with increased respiration. \n\n\n By \"Stage I shock,\" also sometimes called \"compensated shock\" or \"non-progressive shock,\" is meant a condition which occurs when the body detects decreased blood flow or perfusion and begins to activate one or more of several reactive mechanisms to restore perfusion or direct blood flow to the most vital body organs. Stage I shock can be asymptomatic, but may also include, but is not limited to, symptoms such as low blood flow or perfusion, rapid or increased heart rate, shallow or irregular breathing, hypotension, hypertension, pallor and cyanosis. \n\n\n By \"Stage II shock,\" also sometimes called \"decompensated shock\" or \"progressive shock,\" is mean a condition which occurs when the compensatory mechanisms of the body begin to fail and organ perfusion cannot be restored to normal or maintained. Symptoms of Stage II shock include, but are not limited to, confusion, anxiety, disorientation and other mental disturbances indicating a lack of oxygen to the brain, chest pains, increased heart rate, oliguria, multiple organ dysfunction, falling blood pressure (hypotension), rapid breathing, weakness and pupil dilation. \n\n\n By \"Stage III shock,\" also sometimes called \"irreversible shock,\" is meant a condition which occurs after the state of decreased perfusion or blood flow has existed to such an extent that the organs and tissues of the body are permanently affected. Such symptoms include, but are not limited to, multiple organ failure, kidney failure, coma, blood pooling in the extremities and death. \n\n\n The invention provides compositions for use and methods of treating or preventing hemorrhagic shock in a patient, which include administering a composition including one or more of the peptides of the present invention to a patient diagnosed as suffering from blood loss. The blood loss may, but need not, be measured as a percentage of the subject's blood volume, such as, for example, a blood loss of greater than about 15% total blood volume, or greater than 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, or 50% of the subject's total volume. Alternatively, the blood loss may, but need not, be measured in terms of a drop in blood volume in any amount sufficient to cause hemorrhagic shock in a particular subject, such as, for example, a loss of about 750 mL, 1000 mL, of about 1500 mL, or of about 2000 mL or more in a human subject. The blood loss may also be measured in terms of a drop in systolic blood pressure, such as, for example, a drop in systolic blood pressure that is about 20 mm Hg, 30 mm Hg, 40 mm Hg, 50 mm Hg, 60 mm Hg, 70 mm Hg, 80 mm Hg, 90 mm Hg or 100 mm Hg or more than 100 mm Hg lower than the subject's normal systolic blood pressure. In particular embodiments, the subject is undergoing or has undergone a medical procedure, such as, but not limited to, surgery, a transfusion or child birth. In other particular embodiments, the subject has \n\n suffered a traumatic injury, such as, but not limited to, resulting from a motor vehicle accident, from an industrial injury, or from a gunshot wound. \n\n\n In additional embodiments of the present invention, the compositions and methods are used to treat cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic shock and vasodilatory shock, each of which can be in any of the aforementioned stages of shock. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to treat cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is, generally speaking, low blood flow or perfusion that is caused by heart malfunction where the heart does not pump adequate blood. Causes can include any condition that interferes with ventricular filling or emptying, such as, but not limited to, embolism, ischemia, regurgitation and valve malfunction. In another particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to treat vasodilatory shock. Vasodilatory shock is caused by severe venous or arteriolar dilation, which results in inadequate blood flow. Several known causes contribute to vasodilatory shock including, but not limited to, cerebral trauma, drug or poison toxicity, anaphylaxis, liver failure, bacteremia and sepsis. In another more particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to treat shock resulting from sepsis or bacteremia. In an even more particular embodiment, the compositions and methods are used to treat septic shock or bacteremic shock in Stage I, II or III. In yet another embodiment, the compositions and methods of the present invention are used to treat hypovolemic shock. Hypovolemic shock is, generally speaking, decreased intravascular volume, which decrease in intravascular volume can be relative or absolute. Hemorrhage from conditions such as, but not limited to, ulcers, gastrointestinal injury, trauma, accidents, surgery, and aneurysm may cause hypovolemic shock; but loss of other body fluids may also cause hypovolemic shock. For instance, renal fluid loss, intravascular fluid loss, water or other peritoneal fluid loss may contribute to hypovolemic shock. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, the compositions and methods, including administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention, are used to treat hypovolemic shock. In an even more particular embodiment, the compositions and methods are used to treat hypovolemic shock in Stage I, Stage II or Stage III. \n\n\n Circulatory shock, including hemorrhagic shock, may also result from partially controlled or uncontrolled bleeding within one or more internal organs or vessels of a patient. Bleeding may result from any cause, including by way of example from a ruptured aneurysm, dissected aorta, an ulcer, trauma or other gastrointestinal bleeding. In some instances the patient exhibits signs of circulatory shock or hypovolemia, which may include hypotension, but the source of internal bleeding is unknown. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the heart, brain or other organs of a patient against injury caused by circulatory shock. The protective effect against circulatory shock occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1-20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1-10 minutes. \n\n\n 2.10 Targeted Imaging and Cytotoxic Therapy for Melanoma and Other Indications. \n\n Peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be employed for imaging melanoma and other cancers or diseases or conditions characterized, in part, by relatively high expression of MCR-1 , such as by diagnostic imaging using a radionuclide in combination with a peptide of the present invention. For diagnostic imaging, typically a peptide of the present invention is conjugated to radionuclide by use of a linker, such as a cross-linking agent that couples the peptide of the present invention to a radionuclide. The radionuclide is preferably a gamma emitter that may be imaged using a gamma detector or camera, such as single photon emission computed tomography, or is a positron emitter that may be imaged using positron emission tomography. Gamma emitters that may be so employed include \n99m\nTc, In, \n23\nl and \n67\nGa, among others. Positron emitters that may be so employed include C, \n3\nN, \n5\n0 and \n8\nF. \n\n\n In a related aspect, peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be employed for cytotoxic therapy of melanoma, other cancers or diseases or conditions characterized, in part, by relatively high expression of MCR-1 , such as by utilizing a chemotherapeutic agent, including toxins, or radiation therapeutic agent, in combination with a peptide of the present invention. Chemotherapeutic agents include any antineoplastic drug or chemical, such as for example alkylating agents, antimetabolites, anthracyclines, plant alkaloids, topoisomerase inhibitors, and other antitumor agents. Non-limiting examples of alkylating agents include cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil and ifosfamide; examples of antimetabolites include azathioprine and mercaptopurine; examples of anthracyclines include daunorubicin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, valrubicin and mitoxantrone; examples of plant alkaloids include vinca alkaloids such as vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine and vindesine and taxanes such as paclitaxel and docetaxel; examples of topoisomerase inhibitors include camptothecins such as irinotecan and topotecan and type II topoisomerases such as amsacrine, etoposide, etoposide phosphate and teniposide. However, any agent suitable for use in targeted cytotoxic therapy may be so employed. Non-limiting examples of radiation therapeutic agents that may be so employed include \n131\n l, \n125\nl, \n211\nAt, \n186\nRe, \n188\nRe, \n90\nY, \n153\nSm, \n212\nBi and \n32\nP, among others. \n\n\n Diagnostic imaging or cytotoxic therapy agents may be incorporated into a peptide of the present invention, for example such as by use of C, \n3\nN, \n5\n0, among others, in place of \n\n\nnonradioactive isotopes; may be linked directly to a peptide of the present invention, such as for example by halogenation or other direct complexation methods; or may be linked indirectly to a peptide of the present invention, such as conjugation by means of a linker or chelation unit. Linker units are well known in the art, and include, but are not limited to, chemically-linked conjugates including at least one disulfide bond, thioether bond or covalent bond between free reactive groups. Representative cross-linking and conjugating reagents are disclosed in US Patent Nos. 7, 169,603, 7,820, 164 and 5,443,816 and US Publication No. 2009/0297444, among others, incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n 3.0 Combination Therapy for Certain Indications. \n\n\n The peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be used for treatment of any of the foregoing diseases, indications, conditions or syndromes, or any disease, indication, condition or syndrome which is MCR-1 mediated or responsive, by administration in combination with one or more other pharmaceutically active compounds. Such combination administration may be by \n\n means of a single dosage form which includes both a peptide of the present invention and one more other pharmaceutically active compounds, such single dosage form including a tablet, capsule, spray, inhalation powder, injectable liquid or the like. Alternatively, combination administration may be by means of administration of two different dosage forms, with one dosage form containing a peptide of the present invention, and the other dosage form including another pharmaceutically active compound. In this instance, the dosage forms may be the same or different. The term \"coadminister\" indicates that each of at least two compounds in the combination therapy are administered during a time frame wherein the respective periods of biological activity or effects overlap. Thus the term includes sequential as well as concurrent administration of compounds where one compound is one or more of the peptides of the present invention. If more than one compound is coadministered, the routes of administration of the two or more compounds need not be the same. Without meaning to limit combination therapies, the following exemplifies certain combination therapies which may be employed. \n\n\n 3.1 Combination Therapy with Anti-Inflammatory Agents. \n\n\n For the treatment of inflammation-related diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes, peptides of the present invention may be used in combination therapy, including by means of coadministration, with one or more anti-inflammatory agents. One class of anti-inflammatory agent is glucocorticoids, including but not limited to cortisone, including cortisone acetate, hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, triamcinolone, beclometasone, prednisone, fludrocortisone acetate, deoxycorticosterone acetate and aldosterone. Other anti-inflammatory agents that may be used in combination therapy, including by means of coadministration, include aspirin, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (such as ibuprofen and naproxin), TNF-a inhibitors (such as tenidap and rapamycin or derivatives thereof), or TNF-a antagonists (e.g., infliximab, OR1384), cyclooxygenase inhibitors (i.e., COX-1 and/or COX-2 inhibitors such as Naproxen® or Celebrex®), CTLA4-lg agonists/antagonists, CD40 ligand antagonists, IMPDH inhibitors, such as mycophenolate (CellCept®), integrin antagonists, alpha-4 beta-7 integrin antagonists, cell adhesion inhibitors, interferon gamma antagonists, ICAM-1 , prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, budesonide, clofazimine, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors, IKK inhibitors, therapies for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (e.g., Zelmac® and Maxi-K® openers such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6, 184,231 ), or other NF-KB inhibitors, such as corticosteroids, calphostin, CSAIDs, 4-substituted imidazo [1 ,2-A]quinoxalines as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,200,750; lnterleukin-10, salicylates, nitric oxide, and other \n\n\nimmunosuppressants; and nuclear translocation inhibitors, such as deoxyspergualin (DSG). \n\n\n 3.2 Combination Therapy with Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors. \n\n\nFor certain applications and indications, it is desirable to increase production of and maintain levels of cyclic adenoise 3', 5' monophosphate (cAMP), a nucleotide messenger associated with inflammatory cell activity. Peptides of the present invention increase intracellular levels of cAMP, and can be coadministered with compounds or substances that inhibit the degradation of cAMP. cAMP is hydrolyzed to an inactive form by phosphodiesterase (PDE); compounds or substances that inhibit PDE may thereby result in maintenance of and/or an increase in available cAMP. A class of compounds known as PDE inhibitors has been extensively studied for use in treatment of \n\n inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, COPD and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Preferred are inhibitors of PDE type 1 , 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 or 1 1 ; in one aspect this includes cAMP-PDE inhibitors that are selective PDE type 4 inhibitors or inhibitors having selectivity for one particular type of PDE 4 isoenzyme, such as, by way of example, rolipram, cilomilast, ibudilast, and piclamilast. In general, the methods and compositions of this invention may comprise use of one or more cAMP-PDE inhibitors described in one or more of the following U.S. patents or patent applications, each of which is incorporated herein by reference: U.S. Pat.

Thus a subject may be administered one or more of the peptides of the present invention by one of the methods of the invention after suffering an injury likely to induce circulatory shock but prior to the manifestation of overt symptoms of cardiovascular shock, including prior to manifestation of circulatory shock in Stage I, Stage II or Stage III. \n\n\n When administration is for the purpose of treatment, one or more of the peptides of the present invention are provided at, or after the onset of, a symptom of shock. The therapeutic administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention may further serve to attenuate any symptom, or prevent additional symptoms from arising. When administration is for the purposes of preventing shock (\"prophylactic administration\"), one or more of the peptides of the present invention are provided in advance of any visible or detectable symptom. The prophylactic administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention serve to attenuate subsequently arising symptoms or prevent symptoms from arising altogether. The route of administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention include, but are not limited to, topical, transdermal, intranasal, pulmonary, vaginal, rectal, oral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraosseous, intraperitoneal, epidural and intrathecal. \n\n\n 4.4 Methods of Administration and Use for Prophylactic Therapy. \n\n\n The invention also relates to methods of preventing undesired cytokine expression by administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the peptides of the present \n\n invention to the subject, prior to or immediately at the onset of the first symptoms. As used herein, the term \"prevent,\" as it relates to shock, indicates that a substance of the present invention is administered to a subject to prohibit one or more symptoms of shock from detectably appearing or to attenuate the effects of one or more symptoms of shock. The term \"prevent\" also encompasses prohibiting or limiting excessive or undesired cytokine expression, such as with a \"cytokine storm\". Thus a subject may be \"pretreated,\" such as a subject in a surgical setting, by using the substances of the present invention to prevent undesired cytokine expression or shock from arising. The phrase \"preventing the progression,\" as it relates to shock, is used to mean a procedure designed to prohibit the detectable appearance of one or more additional symptoms of shock in a patient already exhibiting one or more symptoms of shock, and is also used to mean prohibiting the already-present symptoms of shock from worsening in the subject. The symptoms of shock that are included in preventative methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to, such symptoms of shock as highlighted herein, such as tachycardia, shallow or erratic breathing and death. A subject that is at risk of shock may be recognized based upon the specific circumstances surrounding a subject. \n\n\nSimilarly, a patient with a bacterial or viral infection and exhibiting a fever or low blood pressure may also be at risk of excessive cytokine expression, shock or an inflammatory disease or condition. \n\n\n In additional embodiments of the present invention, the methods are used to prevent cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic shock and vasodilatory shock, each of which can be in any of the three aforementioned stages of shock. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to prevent cardiogenic shock. In another particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to prevent vasodilatory shock. In another more particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to prevent shock resulting from sepsis or bacteremia. In an even more particular embodiment, the methods are used to prevent septic shock or bacteremic shock in Stage I, II or III shock. In yet another embodiment, the methods of the present invention are used to prevent hypovolemic shock. \n\n\n Similar to the methods of treating shock described herein, one embodiment of the methods of preventing shock of the present invention comprises coadministering another substance with one or more of the peptides of the present invention or a derivative thereof. The scope of the invention is not limited by the identity of the substance which may be coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention to prevent shock. For example, one or more of the peptides of the present invention may be coadministered with androstenetriol, androstenediol or derivatives thereof, various vasopressin agonists, or other pharmaceutically active substances, such as catecholamines or other a adrenergic agonists, a\n2\n adrenergic agonists, β adrenergic agonists or β\n2\n adrenergic agonists, including but not limited to epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, isoproterenol, vasopressin and dobutamine, to prevent shock. \n\n\n Alternatively, one or more of the peptides of the present invention may be coadministered with fluids or other substances that are capable of preventing or removing symptoms in a subject at risk of suffering from hypovolemic shock, vasodilatory shock or cardiogenic shock. The types of fluid that can be coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention to prevent shock should be specific to the circumstances surrounding the particular subject that is at risk of suffering from shock. For example, fluids that may be coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the \n\n present invention include, but are not limited to, salt solutions— such as sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate— as well as whole blood, synthetic blood substitutes, plasma, serum, serum albumin and colloid solutions. Colloid solutions include, but are not limited to, solutions containing hetastarch, albumin or plasma. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, fluids including one or more of salt solutions, colloidal solutions, whole blood, synthetic blood substitutes, plasma or serum are coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention or a derivative thereof in subjects at risk of suffering a hypovolemic shock, such as hemorrhagic shock. \n\n\n 4.5 Methods of Administration and Use for Inflammation Related Applications, Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n In yet another aspect, the invention includes methods which optionally include monitoring the subject for signs or symptoms of inflammation, inflammatory diseases or inflammatory conditions both before and after administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention. Thus a subject may be administered one or more of the peptides of the present invention by one of the methods of the invention after being diagnosed with a condition, disease or syndrome likely to induce an inflammatory response, but prior to the manifestation of overt symptoms of inflammation, inflammatory disease or inflammatory condition. Methods of treating or preventing inflammation, inflammatory diseases or inflammatory conditions described herein comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the peptides of the present invention to a subject. As used herein, the term \"administer\" and \"administering\" are used to mean introducing at least one compound into a subject. When administration is for the purpose of treatment, the substance is provided at, or after the onset of, a sign or symptom of inflammation, inflammatory disease or inflammatory condition. The therapeutic administration of this substance serves to attenuate any symptom, or prevent additional symptoms from arising. When administration is prophylactic administration for the purposes of preventing or limiting inflammation, inflammatory disease or an inflammatory condition, a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of the peptides of the present invention is provided in advance of any visible or detectable symptom. The prophylactic administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention serves to attenuate subsequently arising symptoms or prevent symptoms from arising altogether. The route of administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention include, but are not limited to, topical, transdermal, intranasal, pulmonary, vaginal, rectal, oral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraosseous, intraperitoneal, epidural and intrathecal. \n\n\n 4.6 Methods of Administration and Use for Ocular Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n\n For ocular applications, in one aspect one or more of the peptides of the present invention are formulated in an ophthalmic dosage form and administered in the form of eye drops, eye washes or by means of other ocular delivery systems. Emulsions, ointments, gels, ocular inserts, biodegradable ocular inserts, liposomes, microparticles, nanoparticles, nanospheres or ion pairing formulations may also be employed, which may, in some instances, result in increasing the ocular residence times of a peptide of the present invention. In one embodiment, the ophthalmic formulation is a solution that includes between about 0.0000001 % and about 5% (w/v) of a peptide of the present invention or a salt thereof, alternatively between about 0.000001 % and about 0.2% (w/v) of a peptide of the present \n\n invention or a salt thereof, or alternatively between about 0.00001 % and about 0.2% (w/v) of a peptide of the present invention or a salt thereof. \n\n\n 5.0 Methods of Making. \n\n\n In general, the peptides of the present invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptides of the present invention. \n\n\n The cyclic peptides of the present invention may be readily synthesized by known \n\n\nconventional procedures for the formation of a peptide linkage between amino acids. Such conventional procedures include, for example, any solution phase procedure permitting a \n\n\ncondensation between the free alpha amino group of an amino acid or residue thereof having its carboxyl group and other reactive groups protected and the free primary carboxyl group of another amino acid or residue thereof having its amino group or other reactive groups protected. In a preferred conventional procedure, the cyclic peptides of the present invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. Any of a number of well- known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptides of the present invention. \n\n\n The process for synthesizing the cyclic peptides may be carried out by a procedure whereby each amino acid in the desired sequence is added one at a time in succession to another amino acid or residue thereof or by a procedure whereby peptide fragments with the desired amino acid sequence are first synthesized conventionally and then condensed to provide the desired peptide. The resulting peptide is then cyclized to yield a cyclic peptide of the invention. \n\n\n Solid phase peptide synthesis methods are well known and practiced in the art. In such methods the synthesis of peptides of the invention can be carried out by sequentially incorporating the desired amino acid residues one at a time into the growing peptide chain according to the general principles of solid phase methods. These methods are disclosed in numerous references, including Merrifield, R.B., \"Solid phase synthesis (Nobel lecture),\" Angew Chem 24:799-810 (1985) and Barany et al., The Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis and Biology, Vol. 2, Gross, E. and Meienhofer, J., Eds. Academic Press 1-284 (1980). \n\n\n In chemical syntheses of peptides, reactive side chain groups of the various amino acid residues are protected with suitable protecting groups, which prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the protecting group is removed. Also common is the protection of the alpha amino group of an amino acid residue or fragment while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow a subsequent reaction to take place at that site. Specific protecting groups have been disclosed and are known in solid phase synthesis methods and solution phase synthesis methods. \n\n\n Alpha amino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, including a urethane- type protecting group, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such as p- chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-biphenyl- isopropoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz) and aliphatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), \n\n diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc). Fmoc is preferred for alpha amino protection. \n\n\n Guanidino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, such as nitro, p- toluenesulfonyl (Tos), Z, pentamethylchromanesulfonyl (Pmc), adamantyloxycarbonyl, \n\n\npentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf) and Boc. Pbf and Pmc are preferred protecting groups for Arg. \n\n\n The peptides of the invention described herein were prepared using solid phase synthesis, such as by means of a Symphony Multiplex Peptide Synthesizer (Rainin Instrument Company) automated peptide synthesizer, using programming modules as provided by the manufacturer and following the protocols set forth in the manufacturer's manual. \n\n\n Solid phase synthesis is commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such starting material is prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid by an amide linkage to 9-Fmoc-aminoxanthen-3-yloxy-Merrifield resin fSieber Amide resin) or to 4-(2',4'-Dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)phenoxy resin (Rink Amide resin), by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin, a 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin or an oxime resin, or by other means well known in the art. The resins are carried through repetitive cycles as necessary to add amino acids sequentially. The alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine, diethylamine, or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in Ν,Ν-dimethylformamide (DMF) may be used for this purpose. \n\n\n Following removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. After the peptide is synthesized, if desired, the orthogonally protected side chain protecting groups may be removed using methods well known in the art for further derivatization of the peptide. \n\n\n Typically, orthogonal protecting groups are used as appropriate. For example, the peptides of the invention contain multiple amino acids with an amino group-containing side chain. In one aspect, an Allyl-Alloc protection scheme is employed with the amino acids forming a lactam bridge through their side chains, and orthogonal protecting groups, cleavable under different reactive conditions, use for other amino acids with amino group-containing side chains. Thus, for example, Fmoc-Lys(Alloc)- OH, Fmoc-Orn(Alloc)-OH, Fmoc-Dap(Alloc)-OH, Fmoc-Dab(Alloc)-OH, Fmoc-Asp(OAII)-OH or Fmoc- Glu(OAII)-OH amino acids can be employed for the positions forming a lactam bridge upon cyclization, while other amino acids with amino group-containing side chains have a different and orthogonal protecting group, such as with Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Dab(Boc)- OH or the like. Other protecting groups may be similarly employed; by way of example and not limitation, Mtt/OPp (4-methyltrityl/ 2-phenylisopropyl) can be employed with the side chains forming a lactam bridge upon cyclization, with orthogonal protecting groups being utilized for other positions that are not cleavable using conditions suitable for cleavage of Mtt/OPp. \n\n\n Reactive groups in a peptide can be selectively modified, either during solid phase synthesis or after removal from the resin. For example, peptides can be modified to obtain N-terminus modifications, such as acetylation, while on resin, or may be removed from the resin by use of a \n\n cleaving reagent and then modified. Similarly, methods for modifying side chains of amino acids are well known to those skilled in the art of peptide synthesis. The choice of modifications made to reactive groups present on the peptide will be determined, in part, by the characteristics that are desired in the peptide. \n\n\n In the peptides of the present invention, in one embodiment the N-terminus group is modified by introduction of an N-acetyl group. In one aspect, a method is employed wherein after removal of the protecting group at the N-terminal, the resin-bound peptide is reacted with acetic anhydride in Ν,Ν-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the presence of an organic base, such as pyridine. Other methods of N-terminus acetylation are known in the art, including solution phase acetylation, and may be employed. \n\n\n The peptide can, in one embodiment, be cyclized prior to cleavage from the peptide resin. For cyclization through reactive side chain moieties, the desired side chains are deprotected, and the peptide suspended in a suitable solvent and a cyclic coupling agent added. Suitable solvents include, for example DMF, dichloromethane (DCM) or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Suitable cyclic coupling reagents include, for example, 2-(1 H-benzotriazol-1 -yl)-1 , 1 ,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 2-(1 H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1 , 1 ,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazole-1- yl-oxy-tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 2-(7-aza-1 H-benzotriazol-1 -yl)- 1 , 1 ,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TATU), 2-(2-oxo-1 (2H)-pyridyl)-1 , 1 ,3,3- tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TPTU) or N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (DCCI/HOBt). Coupling is conventionally initiated by use of a suitable base, such as N,N- diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), sym-collidine or N-methylmorpholine (NMM). \n\n\n For peptides with a non-lactam cyclic bridge, such as peptides containing the bridge: \n\n\n -(CH\n2\n)\nx\n-NH-C(=0)-(CH\n2\n)\nz\n-C(=0)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\ny\n-, \n\n\nwhere x, y and z are each independently 1 to 5, the peptides may be made using solid phase synthesis employing a side-chain protected diamine amino acid for the positions to be cyclized. \n\n\nParticularly preferred in such positions are Dap, Dab or Lys, preferably with an amine protecting group such as Alloc, Mtt, Mmt (methoxytrityl), Dde (1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene))ethyl), ivDde (1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene)-3-methylbutyl) or any other orthogonally cleavable protecting group. Typically, one side chain protecting group is removed first, such as removal of Mtt using 2% TFA in dichloromethane. Following washing of the resin, the resulting resin- bound unprotected amine is acylated, such as with a 0.5 M solution of a cyclic anhydride such as succinic anhydride or glutaric anhydride in dichloromethane/pyridine 1 : 1. Following additional wash steps, the orthogonally cleavable protecting group of the second diamino amino acid is cleaved, such as removal of Alloc using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and phenyl silane in \n\n\ndichloromethane. After washing with dichloromethane and DMF the resin-bound peptide is cyclized using standard coupling reagents such as TBTU and a base. Alternatively, an ivDde protected resin- bound diamino amino acid can be deprotected using a solution of 5% of hydrazine in DMF, and after washing with DMF the resulting resin bound amine can either be acylated with a cyclic anhydride or can be cyclized with a resin bound carboxylic acid. \n\n The cyclized peptides can then be cleaved from solid phase, using any suitable reagent, such as ethylamine in DCM or various combinations of agents, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), tri- isopropylsilane (TIS), dimethoxybenezene (DMB), water and the like. The resulting crude peptide is dried and remaining amino acid side chain protecting groups, if any, are cleaved using any suitable reagent, such as (TFA) in the presence of water, TIS, 2-mercaptopethane (ME), and/or 1 ,2- ethanedithiol (EDT). The final product is precipitated by adding cold ether and collected by filtration. Final purification is by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), using a suitable column, such as a d\n8\n column, or other methods of separation or purification, such as methods based on the size or charge of the peptide, can also be employed. Once purified, the peptide can be characterized by any number of methods, such as high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and the like. \n\n\n For peptides of the present invention which have a C-terminus substituted amide derivative or N-alkyl group, synthesis may proceed by solid phase synthesis commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such methods for preparing substituted amide derivatives on solid-phase have been described in the art. See, for example, Barn, D. R., et al., \"Synthesis of an array of amides by aluminum chloride assisted cleavage on resin bound esters,\" Tetrahedron Letters, 37:3213-3216 (1996); DeGrado, W. F. and Kaiser E. T., \"Solid-phase synthesis of protected peptides on a polymer bound oxime: Preparation of segments comprising the sequences of a cytotoxic 26-peptide analogue,\" J. Org. Chem. , 47:3258-3261 (1982). Such a starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin or an oxime resin by well known means. The peptide chain is grown with the desired sequence of amino acids, the peptide cyclized and the peptide-resin treated with a solution of appropriate amine (such as methyl amine, dimethyl amine, ethylamine, and so on). Peptides employing a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin may be cleaved from resin by aluminum chloride in DCM, and peptides employing an oxime resin may be cleaved by DCM. Another method to prepare a peptide with a C-terminus substituted amide is to attach an alkyl amine by reductive amination to a formyl resin, such as 4-(4-Formyl-3- methoxyphenoxy)butyryl-AM resin (FMPB AM resin), and then sequentially incorporate desired amino acid residues utilizing general principles of solid phase synthesis. \n\n\n While synthesis has been described primarily with reference to solid phase Fmoc chemistry, it is to be understood that other chemistries and synthetic methods may be employed to make the cyclic peptides of the invention, such as by way of example and not limitation, methods employing Boc chemistry, solution chemistry, and other chemistries and synthetic methods. \n\n\n 6.0 Formulations. \n\n\n Depending on the desired route of administration, the formulation of a composition including one or more cyclic peptides of the present invention may be varied. Thus the formulation may be suitable for subcutaneous injection, or intravenous injection, for topical applications, for ocular applications, for nasal spray applications, for inhalation applications, for other transdermal applications and the like. \n\n\n 6.1 Salt Form of Cyclic Peptides of the Present Invention. \n\n The cyclic peptides of the present invention may be in the form of any pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, Ν,Ν'-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethyl-morpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine, and the like. \n\n\n When the cyclic peptide of the present invention is basic, acid addition salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids, including inorganic and organic acids. Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, carboxylic, citric, ethanesulfonic, formic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, malonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, propionic, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p-toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, and the like. Acid addition salts of the peptides of the present invention are prepared in a suitable solvent from the peptide and an excess of an acid, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, trifluoroacetic, citric, tartaric, maleic, succinic or methanesulfonic acid. The acetate, ammonium acetate and trifluoracetic acid salt forms are especially useful. Where the peptides of the present invention include an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts may include alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts, or alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium or magnesium salts. \n\n\n 6.2 Pharmaceutical Compositions. \n\n\n The invention provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes a cyclic peptide of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier may be a liquid formulation, and is preferably a buffered, isotonic, aqueous solution. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers also include excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as hereafter described. \n\n\n The cyclic peptide compositions of the present invention may be formulated or compounded into pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one cyclic peptide of the present invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, including excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as may be desired. Formulation excipients may include polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxy cellulose, acacia, polyethylene glycol, manniton, sodium chloride and sodium citrate. For injection or other liquid administration formulations, water containing at least one or more buffering constituents is preferred, and stabilizing agents, preservatives and solubilizing agents may also be employed. For solid administration formulations, any of a variety of thickening, filler, bulking \n\n and carrier additives may be employed, such as starches, sugars, fatty acids and the like. For topical administration formulations, any of a variety of creams, ointments, gels, lotions and the like may be employed. For most pharmaceutical formulations, non-active ingredients will constitute the greater part, by weight or volume, of the preparation. For pharmaceutical formulations, it is also contemplated that any of a variety of measured-release, slow-release or sustained-release formulations and additives may be employed, so that the dosage may be formulated so as to effect delivery of a peptide of the present invention over a period of time. \n\n\n In general, the actual quantity of cyclic peptides of the present invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending on the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired. \n\n\n In practical use, the cyclic peptides of the invention can be combined as the active ingredient in an admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, for example, oral, parenteral (including intravenous), urethral, vaginal, nasal, buccal, sublingual, or the like. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets. \n\n\n Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent an advantageous oral dosage unit form. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. The amount of active peptide in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. In another advantageous dosage unit form, sublingual constructs may be employed, such as sheets, wafers, tablets or the like. \n\n\n The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch or alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as fatty oil. \n\n\n Various other materials may be utilized as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and \n\n\npropylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. \n\n\n Cyclic peptides may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active peptides can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxy- propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. These preparations may optionally contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. \n\n The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that it may be administered by syringe. The form must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol, for example glycerol, propylene glycol or liquid polyethylene glycol, suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. \n\n\n The cyclic peptides of the present invention may be therapeutically applied by means of nasal administration. By \"nasal administration\" is meant any form of intranasal administration of any of the cyclic peptides of the present invention. The peptides may be in an aqueous solution, such as a solution including saline, citrate or other common excipients or preservatives. The peptides may also be in a dry or powder formulation. \n\n\n The cyclic peptides of the present invention may be formulated with any of a variety of agents that increase effective nasal absorption of drugs, including peptide drugs. These agents should increase nasal absorption without unacceptable damage to the mucosal membrane. U.S. Patents No. 5,693,608, 5,977,070 and 5,908,825, among others, teach a number of pharmaceutical compositions that may be employed, including absorption enhancers, and the teachings of each of the foregoing, and all references and patents cited therein, are incorporated by reference. \n\n\n If in an aqueous solution, the cyclic peptides may be appropriately buffered by means of saline, acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate or other buffering agents, which may be at any \n\n\nphysiologically acceptable pH, generally from about pH 4 to about pH 7. A combination of buffering agents may also be employed, such as phosphate buffered saline, a saline and acetate buffer, and the like. In the case of saline, a 0.9% saline solution may be employed. In the case of acetate, phosphate, citrate, and the like, a 50 mM solution may be employed. In addition to buffering agents, a suitable preservative may be employed, to prevent or limit bacteria and other microbial growth. One such preservative that may be employed is 0.05% benzalkonium chloride. \n\n\n In an alternative embodiment, cyclic peptides of the present invention may be administered directly into the lung. Intrapulmonary administration may be performed by means of a metered dose inhaler, a device allowing self-administration of a metered bolus of a peptide of the present invention when actuated by a patient during inspiration. In one aspect of this embodiment, the cyclic peptide may be in a dried and particulate form, for example particles between about 0.5 and 6.0 μιη, such that the particles have sufficient mass to settle on the lung surface, and not be exhaled, but are small enough that they are not deposited on surfaces of the air passages prior to reaching the lung. Any of a variety of different techniques may be used to make dry powder microparticles, including but not limited to micro-milling, spray drying and a quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization. With micro- particles, the peptides may be deposited to the deep lung, thereby providing quick and efficient absorption into the bloodstream. Further, with such approach penetration enhancers are not required, as is sometimes the case in transdermal, nasal or oral mucosal delivery routes. Any of a variety of inhalers can be employed, including propellant-based aerosols, nebulizers, single dose dry powder inhalers and multidose dry powder inhalers. Common devices in current use include metered dose \n\n inhalers, which are used to deliver medications for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the like. Preferred devices include dry powder inhalers, designed to form a cloud or aerosol of fine powder with a particle size that is always less than about 6.0 μιη. \n\n\n Microparticle size, including mean size distribution, may be controlled by means of the method of making. For micro-milling, the size of the milling head, speed of the rotor, time of processing and the like control the microparticle size. For spray drying, the nozzle size, flow rate, dryer heat and the like control the microparticle size. For making by means of quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization, the nozzle size, flow rate, concentration of aerosoled solution and the like control the microparticle size. These parameters and others may be employed to control the microparticle size. \n\n\n The cyclic peptides of the present invention may be therapeutically administered by means of an injection of a sustained release formulation. In one embodiment, a cyclic peptide of the present invention is formulated for a deep intramuscular injection, such as in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, of a formulation with a polyethylene glycol, such as polyethylene glycol 3350, and optionally one or more additional excipients and preservatives, including but not limited to excipients such as salts, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to adjust pH, and the like. In another embodiment a cyclic peptide of the present invention is formulated with a poly(ortho ester), which may be an auto-catalyzed poly(ortho ester) with any of a variable percentage of lactic acid in the polymeric backbone, and optionally one or more additional excipients. In one embodiment poly (D,L-lactide-co- glycolide) polymer is employed. In general, any of a number of injectable and bioerodible polymers, which are preferably also adhesive polymers, may be employed in a sustained release injectable formulation. Alternatively other sustained release formulations may be employed, including formulations permitting subcutaneous injection, which other formulations may include one or more of nano/microspheres (such as compositions including PLGA polymers), liposomes, emulsions (such as water-in-oil emulsions), gels, insoluble salts or suspensions in oil. The formulation may be such that an injection is required on a daily, weekly, monthly or other periodic basis, depending on the concentration and amount of cyclic peptide, the sustained release rate of the materials employed, and other factors known to those of skill in the art. \n\n\n 6.3 Oral Formulations of Peptides of the Present Invention. \n\n\n In one aspect, the peptides of the present invention are formulated for oral delivery. The peptide is preferably formulated and made such that it is encased in an enteric protectant, more preferably such that it is not released until the tablet or capsule has transited the stomach, and optionally has further transited a portion of the small intestine. In the context of this application it will be understood that the term enteric coating or material refers to a coating or material that will pass through the stomach essentially intact but will rapidly disintegrate in the small intestine to release the active drug substance. One enteric coating solution that may be used includes cellulose acetate phthalate, and optionally other ingredients such as ammonium hydroxide, triacetin, ethyl alcohol, methylene blue, and purified water. Cellulose acetate phthalate is a polymer that has been used in the pharmaceutical industry for enterically coating individual dosage forms such as tablets and capsules, and is not soluble in water at a pH of less than about 5.8. Enteric coatings including cellulose acetate phthalate provide protection against the acidic environment of the stomach, but begin to dissolve in environment of the duodenum (pH of about 6-6.5), and are completely dissolved \n\n by the time the dosage form reaches the ileum (pH of about 7-8). In addition to cellulose acetate phthalate, other enteric coating materials are known and may be used with peptides of the present invention, including without limitation hydroxypropylmethylethylcellulose succinate, \n\n\nhydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, and methacrylic acid-methyl methacrylate copolymer. The enteric coating employed promotes dissolution of the dosage form primarily at a site outside the stomach, and may be selected such that the enteric coating dissolves at a pH of approximately at least 6.0, more preferable at a pH of from about 6.0 to about 8.0. In one preferred aspect, the enteric coating dissolves and breaks down in the proximity of the ileum. \n\n\n Any of a variety of permeation enhancers may be employed, to increase uptake in the intestines upon dissolution of the enteric coating. In one aspect, permeation enhancers increase either paracellular or transcellular transport systems. An increase in paracellular transport can be achieved by opening the tight junctions of the cells; an increase in transcellular transport can be achieved by increasing the fluidity of the cell membrane. Representative, non-limiting examples of such permeation enhancers include calcium chelators, bile salts (such as sodium cholate), and fatty acids. The peptides of the present invention may be in an enteric-coated individual dosage form that includes a fatty acid, such as for example oleate, palmitate, stearate, sodium caprate, or conjugated linoleic acid, in an enteric-coated capsule, to increase paracellular transport. \n\n\n In one aspect, the individual dosage form, such as a tablet or capsule, optionally further includes common pharmaceutical binders such as povidone, diluents, glidants, fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose, lubricants such as magnesium stearate, disintegrants such as \n\n\ncroscarmellose sodium, preservatives, colorants and the like in their usual known sizes and amounts. In some embodiments, peptides or polypeptides that act as substrates for intestinal proteases are further added. \n\n\n 6.4 Ophthalmic Formulations. \n\n\n In one embodiment, ocular diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes, such as for example either dry eye disease or uveitis, may be treated with an ophthalmic dosage form including one or more of the peptides of the present invention. The ophthalmic dosage form may include one or more active ingredients in addition to one or more of the peptides of the present invention, such as for example artificial tear components, topical corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine-A (Restasis® - Allergan). In a related embodiment, one or additional compounds may be given separately from one or more of the peptides of the present invention, such as separate administration of an ophthalmic dosage form including an artificial tear component, a topical corticosteroid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, a calcineurin inhibitor such a cyclosporine-A, or a combination of any of the foregoing. \n\n\n Ophthalmic solutions are preferably maintained in a pH range between about pH 3.5 to 9.0, and preferably about pH 6.5 and pH 7.2, with a suitable buffer. The pH may be adjusted by any known means, such as by use of HCI or NaOH. Buffers may include acetate, boric acid, sodium borate, potassium citrate, citric acid, sodium bicarbonate, TRIS, various mixed phosphate buffers (such as combinations of Na\n2\nHP0\n4\n, NaH\n2\nP0\n4\n and KH\n2\nP0\n4\n) and mixtures thereof. Generally, buffers will be used in amounts ranging from about 0.05% to 2.5% (w/v), and preferably from about 0.1 % to \n\n 1.5% percent; buffers should be as close to physiological ion concentrations as possible to minimize potential irritation but still maintain drug product pH over the shelf life of the product. \n\n\n The ophthalmic solutions employed in the present invention may be made from purified water, and in one aspect preferably from a physiological saline solution. Additional tonicity enhancing agents may be employed, including either ionic or non-ionic tonicity enhancing agents, or both. Ionic tonicity enhancing agents include alkali metal or earth metal halides, such as CaCI\n2\n, KBr, KCI, LiCI, Nal, NaBr, NaCI, Na\n2\nS0\n4\n or boric acid. Non-ionic tonicity enhancing agents include urea, glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol, propylene glycol, or dextrose. The aqueous solutions of the present invention are typically adjusted with tonicity agents to approximate an osmotic pressure equivalent to a 0.9% (w/v) solution of sodium chloride or a 2.5% solution of glycerol. However, tonicity ranges equivalent to between 0.7% and 1.5% NaCI are generally considered to be acceptable. \n\n\n The solutions can also contain conventional, pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives, stabilizers, cosolvents and/or penetration enhancers as well as viscoelastic substances included in artificial tear preparations. Pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives include quaternary ammonium compounds such as benzalkonium chloride, benzoxonium chloride or the like; alkyl-mercury salts of thiosalicylic acid such as thiomersal, phenylmercuric nitrate, phenylmercuric acetate or \n\n\nphenylmercuric borate; sodium perborate; sodium chlorite; parabens, such asmethylparaben or propylparaben; alcohols such as chlorobutanol, benzyl alcohol or phenyl ethanol; guanidine derivatives such as chlorohexidine or polyhexamethylene biguanide; sorbic acid; boric acid; or peroxide forming preservatives, or combinations of two or more of the foregoing. Pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants and chelating agents may be used including various sulphites (such as sodium metabisulphite, sodium thiosulphate, sodium bisulfite, or sodium sulfite), otocopherol, ascorbic acid, acetylcysteine, 8-hydroxyquinolome, antipyrine, butylated hydroxyanisole or butylated hydroxytoluene, EDTA, and others. Cosolvents such as alcohols and others may also be used. Various substances can also be used to enhance formulation stability, such as cyclodextrins. \n\n\n Penetration enhancers may be employed in ophthalmic solutions, including compounds such as surfactants, certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulphoxide and other sulphoxides, dimethylacetamide and pyrrolidine, certain amides of heterocyclic amines, glycols (e.g. propylene glycol), propylene carbonate, oleic acid, alkylamines and derivatives, various cationic, anionic and nonionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants and the like. Additional penetration enhancers that may be employed include cetylpyridinium chloride, ionophores such as lasalocid, benzalkonium chloride, polysorbates such as polysorbate 20 (Tween® 20), parabens, saponins, various polyoxyethylene ether compounds such as Brij® 35, Brij® 78 or Brij® 98, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), bile salts, and bile acids (such as sodium cholate, sodium taurocholate, sodium glycodeoxycholate, sodium taurodeoxycholate, taurocholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid), capric acid, azone, fucidic acid, hexamethylene lauramide, saponins, hexamethylene octanamide, and decylmethyl sulfoxide. Ion pairing formulations utilizing charged excipients or counter ions to shield/neutralize charged groups on drug molecules may also be employed to lower the lipophilicity of the compound to increase corneal penetration. These formulations include but are not limited to ions such as sorbic acid, boric acid and maleic acid, among other charged ion pairing agents. \n\n Viscosity enhancers or lubricants may be employed as necessary or appropriate. In one aspect, the viscosity enhancer includes a water soluble polymer, such as polyols, including polyvinyl alcohol, a polyethylene glycol, or combinations of water soluble polymers. In one aspect, polyethylene glycol 300 or 400 is employed. The contents of water soluble polymer may be between about 0.25% and about 4.0% (w/v). Thus an ophthalmic solution can include, by way of example, 1 % of polyvinyl alcohol, 1 % of polyethylene glycol 300 or 400, or both. Other polyols may be employed, including glycerol, glycerin, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, povidone, and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Other lubricants, sometimes also called tear substitutes, may also be employed, including cellulose derivatives such hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and methyl cellulose; dextrans such as dextran 70; water soluble proteins such as gelatin; carbomers such as carbomer 934P, carbomer 941 , carbomer 940 and carbomer 974P; and gums such as HP-guar, xanthan gum or combinations thereof. Other viscosity enhancers that can be employed include polysaccharide compounds, such as sulfated or non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan compounds. In one aspect, the polysaccharide compound is a non- sulfated glycosaminoglycan such as hyaluronic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, such as sodium hyaluronate. Any commercially available molecular weight range of hyaluronic acid or salts thereof may be employed. From about 0.05% to about 0.4% (w/v) of hyaluronic acid or a salt thereof may be employed in an ophthalmic solution. In another aspect, the polysaccharide compound is a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan such as dextran. In yet another aspect, the polysaccharide is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan such as chondroitin sulfate. \n\n\n Semi-solid formulations may be employed for ophthalmic delivery to increase corneal residence times of drug molecules. Ointments containing polyethylene glycols, lanolin alcohols, ozokerite, ceresin, microcrystalline wax, surfactants, preservatives, sorbitan monolaurate, white petrolatum and light liquid petrolatum (mineral oil) or other petrolatum like bases may be used. \n\n\nAqueous or non-aqueous suspensions may also be used. For hydrophilic peptides, suspensions using pharmaceutically acceptable oils or petrolatum may be used. Suspensions may contain microspheres or microparticulates, nanoparticulates, mucoadhesive particles, viscosity increasing agents, surfactants and other agents. Mucoadhesive compounds include synthetic polymers, such as polyacrylic acid and polycarbophil; biopolymers such as hyaluronic acid or sodium carboxy methylcellulose (CMC); polyanionic polymers such as polyacrylic acid (PAA); polyacrylic acids such as Carbopol® 934P, polycarbophil, and CMC or PAA with Pluronic® polyoxalkylene ethers; or polycationic polymers such as chitosan. Emulsions (oil in water or water in oil), including \n\n\nmicroemulsions, may also be employed that are composed of pharmaceutically acceptable oils together with one or more of viscosity increasing agents, preservatives, cosolvents, surfactants and other agents. Pharmaceutically acceptable oils include mineral oils and organic oils, including oils comprising medium chain or long chain saturated or unsaturated fatty acids or esters thereof. \n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable oils thus include any of a range of medium chain triglycerides, as well as oils such as almond oil, castor oil, cottonseed oil, glycerin (glycerol), peanut oil, mineral oil, polyethylene glycol, poppyseed oil, propylene glycol, saff lower oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, olive oil and vegetable oil. A surfactant such as a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, polyoxyl castor oil, tyloxapol, alkyl aryl ether sulfonate, lecithin, sorbitan esters, glyceryl monostearate, cetyl alcohol, octoxynol-9, \n\n nonoxynol-9, polyoxyethylene stearates, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters such as polysorbate 20, 60 and 80 or others may also be employed. Aqueous gels, often comprised of polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyacrylamide, poloxamer, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), carbomer, polymethylvinylether maleic anhydride, and hydroxypropyl ethylcellulose may also be used. Hydrogels containing swellable, water insoluble polymers may be utilized containing polymers such as poly(acrylic acid), poly(acrylic acids), poly(acrylamide), and ethylene maleic anhydride, and chemically or thermally-treated gelatins. Ocular inserts, liposomes, discomes, niosomes, dedrimers, nanosuspensions, nanoparticles and microparticles may also be used to provide a controlled release of the drug. Liposomes and other controlled release agents may be positively charged to increase residence times through ionic interactions with the negatively charged corneal surface. Nanoparticles may be composed of biodegradable polymers such as polyactides (PLAs), polycyano acrylates, poly (D,L-lactides), and natural polymers such as chitosan, gelatin, sodium alginate, albumin and others. \n\n\n 6.5 Routes of Administration of Formulations. \n\n\n If a formulation including one or more peptides of the present invention is administered by injection, the injection may be intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or other means known in the art. The peptides of the present invention may be formulated by any means known in the art, including but not limited to formulation as tablets, capsules, caplets, suspensions, powders, lyophilized preparations, suppositories, ocular drops, skin patches, oral soluble formulations, sprays, aerosols and the like, and may be mixed and formulated with buffers, binders, excipients, stabilizers, anti-oxidants and other agents known in the art. In general, any route of administration by which the peptides of invention are introduced across an epidermal layer of cells may be employed. Administration means may thus include formulations for administration through mucous membranes, buccal administration, oral administration, dermal administration, inhalation administration, nasal administration, urethral administration, vaginal administration, and the like. \n\n\n 6.6 Therapeutically Effective Amount. \n\n\n In general, the actual quantity of cyclic peptide of the present invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending upon the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired. The dosage for treatment is administration, by any of the foregoing means or any other means known in the art, of an amount sufficient to bring about the desired therapeutic effect. Thus a therapeutically effective amount includes an amount of a peptide or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention that is sufficient to therapeutically alleviate sexual dysfunction in a patient, or to prevent or delay onset or recurrence of the sexual dysfunction. \n\n\n In general, the cyclic peptides of the present invention are highly active. For example, the cyclic peptide can be systemically administered at about 0.1 , 0.5, 1 , 5, 50, 100, 500, 1000 or 5000 μg/kg body weight, depending on the specific peptide selected, the desired therapeutic response, the route of administration, the formulation and other factors known to those of skill in the art. \n\n\n 7.0 Peptides of the Present Invention. \n\n\n In one aspect, the invention provides a cyclic peptide which contains a core sequence derived from His-Phe-Arg within the cyclic portion, but not including Trp within the core portion, and where\n\n\nTrp, or a derivative or mimetic thereof (defined as an amino acid residue with a side chain including at \n\n least one aryl or heteroaryl, including but not limited to Nal 1 or Nal 2), is the amino acid residue immediately outside the cyclic portion on the C-terminus side. Thus the sequence is derived from His- Phe-Arg-Xaa\n6\n-Trp, where Xaa\n6\n is an amino acid wherein the side chain thereof forms a cyclic bridge with either the side chain of another amino acid or the N-terminus group of the peptide. \n\n\n The core sequence derived from His-Phe-Arg-Xaa\n6\n-Trp may include a number of \n\n\nsubstitutions. The His position may be His, or may be a substituted or unsubstituted Pro or an amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alcohol, ether, sulfide, sulfone, sufoxide, carbomyl or carboxyl. Substituted Pro includes, but is not limited to, amino acids such as Hyp, Hyp(Bzl), Pro(4R-Bzl) or Pro(4R-NH\n2\n). The Phe position may be Phe, but is most typically substituted or unsubstituted D-Phe, D-Nal 1 , D-Nal 2 or an amino acid with a side chain including pyridyl. The Arg position may be Arg, Lys, Orn, Dab or Dap, or a substituted or unsubstituted Pro, or Cit, or may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, guanidine, urea, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, or ether. Xaa\n6\n may be an amino acid with a side chain include a primary amine, such as Lys, Orn, Dab, Dap, an amino acid with a carboxyl group, such as Asp, Glu or hGlu, or an amino acid with a disulfide group, such as Cys or Pen, all depending on the nature of the cyclic bridge. The Trp position may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl, such as Trp, Nal 1 or Nal 2. \n\n\n The invention thus provides a cyclic peptide of formula (VII): \n\n\n Z-Xaa -Xaa\n2\n-Xaa\n3\n-Xaa\n4\n-Xaa\n5\n-Xaa\n6\n-Xaa\n7\n-Y (VII) \n\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein: \n\n\n Z is H or an N-terminal group; \n\n\n Xaa\n1\n is optionally present, and if present is from one to three L- or D-isomer amino acid residues; \n\n\n Xaa\n2\n and Xaa\n6\n are L- or D-isomer amino acids wherein the side chains thereof comprise a cyclic bridge; \n\n\n Xaa\n3\n is L- or D-Pro, optionally substituted with hydroxyl, halogen, sulfonamide, alkyl, -O-alkyl, aryl, alkyl-aryl, alkyl-O-aryl, alkyl-O-alkyl-aryl, or -O-aryl, or Xaa\n3\n is an L- or D-isomer of an amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, ether, sulfide, or carboxyl; \n\n\n Xaa\n4\n is an L- or D-isomer amino acid with a side chain including phenyl, naphthyl or pyridyl, optionally wherein the ring is substituted with one or more substituents independently selected from halo, (Ci-Cio)alkyl-halo, (C-rCio)alkyl, (C-rCio)alkoxy, (C-rCio)alkylthio, aryl, aryloxy, nitro, nitrile, sulfonamide, amino, monosubstituted amino, disubstituted amino, hydroxy, carboxy, and alkoxy- carbonyl; \n\n\n Xaa\n5\n is L- or D-Pro or Xaa\n5\n is an L- or D-isomer amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, guanidine, urea, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, or ether; \n\n\n Xaa\n7\n is optionally present, and if present is from one to three L- or D-isomer amino acid residues; and \n\n\n Y is a C-terminal group. \n\n In one aspect, Xaa\n4\n may be D-Phe, optionally substituted with one or more substituents independently selected from halo, (C-rCio)alkyl-halo, (C-rCio)alkyl, (Ci-Cio)alkoxy, (Ci-Cio)alkylthio, aryl, aryloxy, nitro, nitrile, sulfonamide, amino, monosubstituted amino, disubstituted amino, hydroxy, carboxy, and alkoxy-carbonyl. \n\n\n In another aspect, one of Xaa\n2\n and Xaa\n6\n may be an L- or D-isomer of Asp, hGlu or Glu and the other of Xaa\n2\n and Xaa\n6\n is an L- or D-isomer of Lys, Orn, Dab or Dap. In an alternative aspect, each of Xaa\n2\n and Xaa\n6\n may be Cys, D-Cys, Pen or D-Pen. \n\n\n In another aspect, Xaa\n1\n may be an amino acid with a side chain including a linear or branched alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl. \n\n\n In another aspect, Xaa\n7\n may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one aryl or heteroaryl, optionally substituted with one or more ring substituents, and when one or more substituents are present, are the same or different and independently hydroxyl, halogen, sulfonamide, alkyl, -O-alkyl, aryl, or -O-aryl. \n\n\n In another aspect, the N-terminal group may be a C-i to C\n17\n acyl group, wherein the C-i to C\n17\n comprises a linear or branched alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkylcycloalkyl, aryl or alkylaryl, a linear or branched Ci to C-i\n/\n alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkene, alkenyl, or aralkyl chain or an N-acylated linear or branched Ci to C-i\n/\n alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkene, alkenyl, or aralkyl chain. \n\n\n In another aspect, Y may be a hydroxyl, an amide, or an amide substituted with one or two linear or branched Ci to d\n7\n alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkyl cycloalkyl, aralkyl, heteroaryl, alkene, alkenyl, or aralkyl chains. \n\n\n The invention thus provides in another aspect a cyclic peptide of formula (VII) defined as above, but wherein \n\n\n Xaa\n4\n is D-Phe, optionally substituted with one or more substituents independently selected from halo, (Ci-Cio)alkyl-halo, (Ci-Cio)alkyl, (Ci-Cio)alkoxy, (Ci-Cio)alkylthio, aryl, aryloxy, nitro, nitrile, sulfonamide, amino, monosubstituted amino, disubstituted amino, hydroxy, carboxy, and alkoxy- carbonyl; \n\n\n Xaa\n5\n is an L- or D-isomer of Arg, Lys, Orn, Dab or Dap; and \n\n\n Xaa\n7\n is an L- or D-isomer of Trp, Nal 1 or Nal 2. \n\n\n In the foregoing, in one aspect Xaa\n3\n may be an L- or D-isomer of His, and in another aspect Z may be a C-i to C\n17\n acyl group and Xaa\n1\n may be an L- or D-isomer of Nle. \n\n\n In the foregoing, and in formula (I), substituted Pro may be, for example, Hyp, Hyp(Bzl), Pro(4-Bzl), and Pro(4-NH\n2\n). \n\n\n The peptides encompassed within formulas (I) through (VII) contain one or more asymmetric elements such as stereogenic centers, stereogenic axes and the like, so that the peptides \n\n\nencompassed within formula (I) can exist in different stereoisomeric forms. For both specific and generically described peptides, including the peptides encompassed within formulas (I) through (VI), all forms of isomers at all chiral or other isomeric centers, including enantiomers and diastereomers, are intended to be covered herein. The peptides of the invention each include multiple chiral centers, and may be used as a racemic mixture or an enantiomerically enriched mixture, in addition to use of the peptides of the invention in enantiopure preparations. Typically, the peptides of the invention will be synthesized with the use of chirally pure reagents, such as specified L- or D-amino acids, using \n\n reagents, conditions and methods such that enantiomeric purity is maintained, but it is possible and contemplated that racemic mixtures may be made. Such racemic mixtures may optionally be separated using well-known techniques and an individual enantiomer may be used alone. In cases and under specific conditions of temperature, solvents and pH wherein peptides may exist in tautomeric forms, each tautomeric form is contemplated as being included within this invention whether existing in equilibrium or predominantly in one form. Thus a single enantiomer of a peptide of formula (I), which is an optically active form, can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis, synthesis from optically pure precursors, or by resolution of the racemates. \n\n\n The invention is further intended to include prodrugs of the present peptides, which on administration undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming active pharmacological peptides. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the present peptides, which are readily convertible in vivo into a peptide of formula (I) through (VII). Prodrugs are any covalently bonded compounds, which release the active parent peptide drug of formula (I) through (VII) in vivo. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in \"Design of Prodrugs\", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985. Typical examples of prodrugs have biologically labile protecting groups on a functional moiety, such as for example by esterification of hydroxyl, carboxyl or amino functions. Thus by way of example and not limitation, a prodrug includes peptides of formula (I) wherein an ester prodrug form is employed, such as, for example, lower alkyl esters of an R group of formula (I), such as where R is -OH, which lower alkyl esters may include from 1-8 carbons in an alkyl radical or aralkyl esters which have 6-12 carbons in an aralkyl radical. Broadly speaking, prodrugs include compounds that can be oxidized, reduced, aminated, deaminated, hydroxylated, dehydroxylated, hydrolyzed, dehydrolyzed, alkylated, dealkylated, acylated, deacylated, phosphorylated or dephosphorylated to produce an active parent peptide drug of formula (I) in vivo. \n\n\n The subject invention also includes peptides which are identical to those recited in formula (I) through (VI), but for the fact that one or more atoms depicted in formula (I) through (VI) are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n3\nC, \n4\nC, \n5\nN, 80 and \n7\n0, respectively. Peptides of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates of said compounds which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as \n3\nH and \n4\nC are incorporated, may have use in a variety of assays, such as in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. \n\n\nSubstitution with heavier isotopes, such as substitution of one or more hydrogen atoms with deuterium (\n2\nH), can provide pharmacological advantages in some instances, including increased metabolic stability. Isotopically labeled peptides of formula (I) through (VI) can generally be prepared by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. \n\n\n 8.0 Tests and Assays Employed in Evaluation of the Peptides of the Present Invention. \n\n The melanocortin receptor-specific peptides of the present invention of this invention may be tested by a variety of assay systems and animal models to determine binding, functional status and efficacy. \n\n\n 8.1 Competitive Inhibition Assay using [l \n25\n]-NDP-a-MSH. \n\n\n A competitive inhibition binding assay was performed using membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMCR-1 a or hMCR-4 (in each instance where the h prefix refers to human), or alternatively membrane homogenates from B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells containing endogenous murine MCR-1. In the examples that follow, all MCR-1 and MCR-4 values are for human recombinant receptors, unless otherwise noted. Assays were performed in 96 well polypropylene round-bottom plates (VWR catalog number 12777-030). \n\n\n Membrane homogenates were incubated with 0.1 nM [l \n25\n]-NDP-a-MSH (Perkin Elmer) and increasing concentrations of test peptides of the present invention in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) with 100 mM NaCI, 2 mM CaCI\n2\n, 2 mM MgCI\n2\n, 0.3 mM 1 ,10-phenanthroline, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 90 minutes at 37°C, the assay mixture was filtered onto GF/B Unifilter plates (Perkin-Elmer catalog number 6005177) and washed with 3 mL of ice-cold buffer per well. Filters were air dried and 35 [it of scintillation cocktail added to each well. Plates were counted in a Microbeta counter for bound radioactivity. Non-specific binding was measured by inhibition of binding of [l \n25\n]-NDP-a-MSH in the presence of 1 μΜ NDP-a-MSH. Maximal specific binding (100%) was defined as the difference in radioactivity (cpm) bound to cell membranes in the absence and presence of 1 μΜ NDP-a-MSH. Each assay was conducted in duplicate and the actual mean values are described, with results less than 0% reported as 0%. Ki values for peptides of the present invention were determined using Graph-Pad Prism® curve-fitting software. \n\n\n 8.2 Assay for Agonist Activity. \n\n\n Accumulation of intracellular cAMP was examined as a measure of the ability of the peptides of the present invention to elicit a functional response in a human melanoma cell line, HBL, that express hMCR-1 (see Kang, L, et al., \"A selective small molecule agonist of melanocortin-1 receptor inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine accumulation and leukocyte infiltration in mice,\" J. Leuk. Biol. 80:897-904 (2006)) or HEK-293 cells that express hMCR-4. Confluent HBL cells that express hMCR-1 or HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMCR-4 were detached from culture plates by incubation in enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer. Dispersed cells were suspended in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCI\n2\n, 1 mM glutamine, 0.5% albumin and 0.3 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 0.4 x 10\n5\n cells per well for HBL cells and 0.5 x 10\n5\n cells per well for HEK-293 cells and pre-incubated for 10 minutes. Cells were exposed for 15 minutes at 37° C to peptides of the present invention dissolved in DMSO (final DMSO concentration of 1 %) at a concentration range of 0.05 - 5000 nM in a total assay volume of 200 [it. NDP-a-MSH was used as the reference agonist. cAMP levels were determined by an HTRF® cAMP cell-based assay system from Cisbio Bioassays utilizing cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP, with plates read on a Perkin-Elmer Victor plate reader at 665 and 620nM. Data analysis was performed by nonlinear regression analysis with Graph-Pad Prism\n®\n software. Maximum efficacy (E\nmax\n) values were \n\n determined for each test peptide of the present invention, compared to that achieved by the reference melanocortin agonist NDP-a-MSH. \n\n\n 9.0 Examples. \n\n\n Peptides of the following structures were synthesized and averaged MCR-1 and MCR-4 Ki values were determined as indicated. All Ki values were determined using [l \n25\n]-NDP-a-MSH. All results are expressed in nM except for E\nmax\n values, which are percentage values. Peptides with the captioned primary sequence were synthesized and purified as described in Section 5 above, with the resulting peptide having the structure depicted. After synthesis and purification, each peptide was tested as described in Section 8 above, with the results as shown. \n\n\n9.1 Ac-Nle-cyc/ ID NO:4) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assay Result \n\n\n MC-4 Ki (average) 45\n\n\nMC-1 Ki (average) 0.01\n\n\nMC-1 (average;

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/248,529, filed Oct. 5, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to epiminocycloalkyl[b]indole derivatives as serotonin sub-type 6 (5-HT\n6\n) modulators and uses thereof.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nVarious central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as anxiety, depression, motor disorders, etc., are believed to involve a disturbance of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin. Serotonin is localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is known to affect many types of conditions including psychiatric disorders, motor activity, feeding behavior, sexual activity, and neuroendocrine regulation among others. The effects of serotonin are regulated by the various 5-HT receptor subtypes. Known 5-HT receptors include the 5-HT\n1 \nfamily (e.g. 5-HT\n1A\n), the 5-HT\n2 \nfamily (e.g. 5-HT\n2A\n), 5-HT\n3\n, 5-HT\n4\n, 5-HT\n5\n, 5-HT\n6 \nand 5-HT\n7 \nsubtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biogenic amine serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is a brain neurotransmitter that has been strongly implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. It exerts its effects through a diverse family of serotonin receptor subtypes. Of the 14 different mammalian serotonin receptors to have been cloned, all but one are members of the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily. Several of these, including the serotonin 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor, stimulate adenylyl cyclase via G coupling. 5-HT\n6 \nhas a high affinity for several therapeutically important antidepressant, antianxiety, hallucinogenic, and antipsychotic drugs, particularly the atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine. The relevance of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor to psychotherapeutics is indicated both through its unique anatomical distribution and pharmacological properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recently identified human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor subtype has been cloned, and the extensive distribution of its mRNA has been reported. Highest levels of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA have been observed in the olfactory tubercle, the striatum, nucleus accumbens, dentate gyms, and CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Lower levels of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA are seen in the granular layer of the cerebellum, several diencephalic nuclei, amygdalae, and in the cortex. Northern blots have revealed that 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA appears to be exclusively present in the brain, with little evidence for its presence in peripheral tissues. The high affinity of a number of antipsychotic agents for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor, in addition to its mRNA localization in striatum, olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens suggests that some of the clinical actions of these compounds may be mediated through this receptor. Therefore, 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands are believed to be of potential use in the treatment of certain CNS disorders such as anxiety, depression, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit disorder, migraine, cognitive memory enhancement (e.g. for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease), sleep disorders, feeding disorders (e.g. anorexia, obesity, or bulimia), neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. stroke or head trauma), panic attacks, withdrawal from drug abuse (e.g. cocaine, ethanol, nicotine or benzodiazepines), schizophrenia, or the like; or in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe high affinity of a number of antipsychotic agents for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor, in addition to its mRNA localization in striatum, olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens suggests that some of the clinical actions of these compounds may be mediated through this receptor. Compounds which interact with, stimulate, or inhibit the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor are commonly referred to as 5-HT\n6 \nligands. In particular, 5-HT\n6 \nselective ligands have been identified as potentially useful in the treatment of certain CNS disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, anxiety, depression, manic depression, psychoses, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorders, migraine, Alzheimer's disease (enhancement of cognitive memory), sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia, obesity, and bulimia, panic attacks, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus. Such compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder and irritable bowel syndrome (See for examples. Roth et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n268:1403-14120 (1994), Sibley et al., \nMol. Pharmacol. \n43:320-327 (1993), Sleight et al., \nNeurotransmission \n11:1-5 (1995), and Sleight et al., \nSerotonin ID Research Alert \n2(3):115-8 (1997)). Furthermore, the effect of 5-HT\n6 \nantagonist and 5-HT\n6 \nantisense oligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported (Bentley et al., \nBr. J. Pharmacol. Suppl. \n126:66 (1999) and Bentley et al., \nJ. Psychopharmacol. Suppl. A\n64:255 (1997)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScientific research has revealed a potential therapeutic use for modulators of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor, especially with regard to various CNS disorders. Blocking 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor function has been shown to enhance cholinergic transmission (Bentley et al., \nBr. J. Pharmacol. \n126:1537-1542 (1999) and Riemer et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n46:1273-1276 (2003)). 5-HT\n6 \nantagonist have also been shown to reverse cognitive deficits in in vivo cognition models induced by the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (Woolley et al., \nPsychopharmacology \n170:358-367 (2003) and Foley et al., \nNeuropsychopharmacology \n29:93-100 (2004)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies have shown that 5-HT\n6 \nantagonists increase levels of glutamate and aspartate in the frontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus as well as acetylcholine in the frontal cortex. These neurochemicals are known to be involved in memory and cognition (Dawson et al., \nNeuropsychopharmacology \n25(5):662-668 (2001); Gerard et al., \nBrain Res. \n746:207-219 (1997); and Riemer et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n46(7):1273-1276 (2003)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies have also shown that 5-HT\n6 \nantagonist increases the level of dopamine and noradrenaline in the medial prefrontal cortex (Lacroix et al., \nSynapse \n51:158-164 (2004)). In addition, 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonists have been shown to improve performance in the attentional set shifting task (Hatcher et al., \nPsychopharmacology \n181(2):253-9 (2005)). Therefore, 5-HT\n6 \nligands are expected to be useful in the treatment of disorders where cognitive deficits are a feature, such as schizophrenia. Several antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics bind to the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor and this may be a factor in their profile of activities (Roth et al., \nJ. Pharm. Exp. Therapeut. \n268:1402-1420 (1994); Sleight et al., \nExp. Opin. Ther. Patents \n8:1217-1224 (1998); Kohen et al., \nJ. Neurochem. \n66(1):47-56 (1996); Sleight et al., \nBrit. J. Pharmacol. \n124:556-562 (1998); and Bourson et al., \nBrit. J. Pharmacol. \n125:1562-1566 (1998)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStean et al., \nBrit. J. Pharmacol. \n127 Proc. Supplement 131P (1999), have described the potential use of 5-HT\n6 \nmodulators in the treatment of epilepsy. 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors have also been linked to generalized stress and anxiety states (Yoshioka et al., \nLife Sciences \n62(17/18):1473-1477 (1998)). 5-HT\n6 \nagonists have been shown to elevate levels of GABA in brain regions associated with anxiety and shown positive effects in models predictive of obsessive-compulsive disorder (Schechter et al., \nNeuroRx. \n2(4):590-611 (2005)). The use of modulators for this receptor is therefore expected for a wide range of CNS disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, a reduction in food intake in rats has been reported using 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor modulators (Bentley et al., \nBr. J. Pharmacol. Suppl. \n126:66 (1999); Bentley et al. \nJ. Psychopharmacol. Suppl. A\n64:255 (1997); Pendharkar et al., \nSociety for Neuroscience \n(2005); Heal et al. \nPharmacol. Ther. \n117, 207-231 (2008)). 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor modulators may therefore also be useful in the treatment of feeding disorders like anorexia, obesity, bulimia and similar disorders and also type 2 diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe importance of psychoactive drugs in present treatment of mental illness, and the presence of serious and undesirable side-effects with their use, makes the development of improved drugs of great interest.

For example, 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in rat brain can be localized in areas such as striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and hippocampal formation (Ward et al., \nNeuroscience \n64:1105-1111 (1995), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). This receptor may also be mutated or modified. For purposes of modulating the 5HT\n6 \nreceptor, the compounds of formula (I) may be 5HT\n6 \nreceptor-agonists, antagonists, or partial agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe central nervous system disorder according to the present invention is a condition associated or related to a brain and spinal cord ailment. Preferred central nervous system disorder treated according to the method of the present invention include obesity, metabolic syndrome, cognition, and schizophrenia. The method of the present invention may also be extended, without limitation, to other central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, depression, convulsive disorders such as epilepsy, personality disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, migraine, cognitive disorders such as memory dysfunction, sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, panic attacks, withdrawal from drug abuse, attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), dementia, memory loss, disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury, stroke, diabetes type 2, binge disorders, bipolar disorders, psychoses, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, neurodegenerative disorders characterized by impaired neuronal growth, and pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional aspects of the present invention include pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, optionally, one or more additional active agent(s) as discussed below. Further aspects include methods of treating a disease state related to or modulated by the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor, in a patient, such as humans or animals (e.g. rat, mice, pigs, horses, monkeys, cows, sheep, guinea pigs, dogs, and cats).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier suitable for preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs may be employed in the composition of the invention. Compounds of formula I may be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic solvent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable oil or fat, or a mixture thereof. The liquid composition may contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, coloring agents, viscosity regulators, stabilizers, osmo-regulators, or the like. Examples of liquid carriers suitable for oral and parenteral administration include water (particularly containing additives as above, e.g., cellulose derivatives, preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, e.g., glycols) or their derivatives, or oils (e.g., fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration, the carrier may also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate or isopropyl myristate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, amine salts, such as but not limited to N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, ammonia, diethanolamine and other hydroxyalkylamines, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, procaine, N-benzylphenethylamine, 1-para-chlorobenzyl-2-pyrrolidin-1′-ylmethyl-benzimidazole, diethylamine and other alkylamines, piperazine, and tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane; alkali metal salts, such as but not limited to lithium, potassium, and sodium; alkali earth metal salts, such as but not limited to barium, calcium, and magnesium; transition metal salts, such as but not limited to zinc; and other metal salts, such as but not limited to sodium hydrogen phosphate and disodium phosphate; and also including, but not limited to, salts of mineral acids, such as but not limited to hydrochlorides and sulfates; and salts of organic acids, such as but not limited to acetates, lactates, malates, tartrates, citrates, ascorbates, succinates, butyrates, valerates and fumarates. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters include, but are not limited to, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl and heterocyclyl esters of acidic groups, including, but not limited to, carboxylic acids, phosphoric acids, phosphinic acids, sulfonic acids, sulfinic acids, and boronic acids. Pharmaceutical acceptable enol ethers include, but are not limited to, derivatives of formula C═C(OR) where R is hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, or heterocyclyl.

Pharmaceutical acceptable solvates and hydrates are complexes of a compound with one or more solvent or water molecules, or 1 to about 100, or 1 to about 10, or one to about 2, 3 or 4, solvent or water molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “treatment” or “treating” means any manner in which one or more of the symptoms of a disease or disorder are ameliorated or otherwise beneficially altered. Treatment also encompasses any pharmaceutical use of the compositions herein, such as use for treating central nervous system diseases or disorders, or diseases or disorders in which central nervous system receptor activity, including 5HT\n6 \nreceptor activity, is implicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll methods comprise administering to the patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of one or more compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA subject or patient in whom administration of the therapeutic compound is an effective therapeutic regimen for a disease or disorder is preferably a human, but can be any animal, including a laboratory animal in the context of a clinical trial or screening or activity experiment. Thus, as can be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the methods, compounds and compositions of the present invention are particularly suited to administration to any animal, particularly a mammal, and including, but by no means limited to, humans, domestic animals, such as feline or canine subjects, farm animals, such as but not limited to bovine, equine, caprine, ovine, and porcine subjects, wild animals (whether in the wild or in a zoological garden), research animals, such as mice, rats, rabbits, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs, cats, etc., avian species, such as chickens, turkeys, songbirds, etc., i.e., for veterinary medical use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can be administered alone or as an active ingredient of a formulation. Thus, the present invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions of one or more compounds of Formula I containing, for example, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The compounds of the invention can be administered in a form where the active ingredient is substantially pure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous standard references are available that describe procedures for preparing various formulations suitable for administering the compounds according to the invention. Examples of potential formulations and preparations are contained, for example, in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, American Pharmaceutical Association (current edition); Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets (Lieberman, Lachman and Schwartz, editors) current edition, published by Marcel Dekker, Inc., as well as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Arthur Osol, editor), 1553-1593 (current edition), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds can be administered as the sole active agent or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents such as other agents used in the treatment of CNS disorders, such as psychoses, especially schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Parkinson's disease, cognitive impairment and/or memory loss, (e.g., nicotinic α-7 agonists, PDF4 inhibitors, PDE10 inhibitors, other 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands), calcium channel blockers, muscarinic M1 and M2 modulators, adenosine receptor modulators, ampakines, NMDA-R modulators, mGluR modulators, dopamine modulators, serotonin modulators, canabinoid modulators, and cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, rivastigimine, and galanthanamine). In such combinations, each active ingredient can be administered either in accordance with their usual dosage range or in accordance with a dose below their usual dosage range.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds can be administered in combination with other pharmaceutical agents used in the treatment of schizophrenia, e.g., Clozaril, Zyprexa, Risperidone, and Seroquel.

As a result, the invention also includes compositions comprising a compound according to Formula I and one or more additional pharmaceutical agents used in the treatment of schizophrenia, e.g., Clozaril, Zyprexa, Risperidone, and Seroquel. Similarly, the invention also includes kits containing a composition comprising a compound according to Formula I and another composition comprising one or more additional pharmaceutical agents used in the treatment of schizophrenia, e.g., Clozaril, Zyprexa, Risperidone, and Seroquel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid carriers suitable for use in the composition of the invention include one or more substances which may also act as flavoring agents, lubricants, solubilizers, suspending agents, fillers, glidants, compression aides, binders, tablet-disintegrating agents, or encapsulating materials. In powders, the carrier may be a finely divided solid which is in admixture with a finely divided compound of formula I. In tablets, the formula I compound may be mixed with a carrier having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. Said powders and tablets may contain up to 99% by weight of the formula I compound. Solid carriers suitable for use in the composition of the invention include calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes, and ion exchange resins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention is directed to the process for preparation of a product compound of formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\n \n \n \n \nn is an integer from 1 to 2;

Treatment with iron and ammonium chloride in an ethanol/water solution at reflux can be used to prepare compounds of formula 4. Subsequent treatment with sodium nitrite in aqueous HCl at 0° C. followed by tin(II)chloride in aqueous HCl at 0° C. can be used to prepare compounds of formula 5. Compounds of formula 5 can be subjected to Fisher indole forming conditions (conc. HCl, Ethanol, reflux) to directly prepare compounds of formula 7. Alternatively, the intermediate hydrazone of formula 6 can be isolated and converted to compounds of formula 7 using 10% sulfuric acid in acetic acid under refluxing conditions. Compounds of formula 7 can generally be transformed into compounds of formula 8 without purification via treatment with Boc anhydride, triethylamine and catalytic N,N-dimethylaminopyridine in methylene chloride at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula 10 can be prepared via a 2 step procedure starting from compounds of formula 8. Treatment with sodium hydride in DMF (or THF) at room temperature followed by quenching with a suitable electrophile (where Z=Cl, Br, I, OSO\n2\nMe, OSO\n2\nCF\n3\n, OTs) can be used to prepare compounds of formula 9. Alternatively, compound 9 can be prepared from the aforementioned electrophiles using a different base (potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate) in DMF at room temperature. Compounds of formula 9 can be converted to compounds of formula 10 via a palladium-catalyzed procedure using Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3 \nand xantphos with cesium carbonate and tetrabutylammonium chloride in toluene at reflux.

Conversion of compounds of formula 11 to compounds of formula 10 is achieved via reaction with an aryl halide (Z=Cl, Br, I) using the same palladium-catalyzed coupling conditions highlighted in scheme 3.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, compounds of formula 10 (where R\n7\n=heteroatom-linked aromatic substituents such as indoles) can be prepared via a 2 step procedure starting from compounds of formula 11. Treatment with N-chlorosuccinimide in methylene chloride at 0° C. provides compounds of formula 12. Subsequent treatment with the sodium salt of an aromatic substituent bearing a heteroatom (such as indoles, prepared from sodium hydride in THF at room temperature) provides compounds of formula 10.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula 13 can be prepared from compounds of formula 10 via removal of the protecting group using HCl in a variety of different solvents. Alternatively, compounds of formula 13 can also be prepared using trifluoroacetic acid in methylene chloride. Compounds of formula 13 can also be elaborated to compounds of formula 14 via reaction with a suitable electrophile (Z=Cl, Br, I, OSO\n2\nMe, OSO\n2\nCF\n3\n, OTs) in acetonitrile using triethylamine as a base under refluxing conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to a process for enantiomeric resolution. In this process, a mixture of diastereomers of the compound of formula (II) is provided\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere:\n\n\nR\n3 \nand R\n6 \nare independently H, halogen, CF\n3\n, CHF\n2\n, CH\n2\nF, OH, OR\n8\n, —C(O)R\n8\n, —C(O)OR\n8\n, —C(O)NR\n8\nR\n9\n, —NHR\n8\n, —NR\n8\nR\n9\n, —SR\n8\n, —S(O)R\n8\n, —S(O)\n2\nR\n8\n, NH\n2\n, CN, NO\n2\n, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n6 \nalkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n6 \nalkynyl, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl, C\n4\n-C\n7 \ncycloalkylalkyl, mono or polycyclic aryl; and X is independently chloro, bromo, iodo, or triflyl. The mixture is subjected to a resolution procedure under conditions effective to separate the diastereomers of the compound of formula (II) from one another.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the present invention contemplates the synthesis, isolation, and purification of enantiomerically pure stereoisomers of the compounds of the formula (I) and their synthetic intermediates (as outlined in scheme 7).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChiral resolution of intermediate 8 (where X=Br, R\n3\n═H and R\n6\n═H) can be achieved via synthesis of the chiral adduct 16. This can be dissolved in hexane and cooled to −5° C. leading to preferential precipitation of diastereomer 16a. The chiral auxiliary can then be removed providing the (−) enantiomer of intermediate 8 in >99% ee. The Boc protecting group can be removed from the material remaining in the supernatant, and this can be purified by chiral chromatography providing pure diastereomer 17. The Boc group can then be re-introduced, and the chiral auxiliary removed to provide the (+) enantiomer of intermediate 8 in >99% ee. Alternatively, where preferential precipitation of one diastereomer does not occur, diastereomeric mixture 16 can be purified by chiral chromatography and the separated products can have the Boc group re-introduced and the chiral auxiliary removed to provide the (+) and (−) enantiomers of intermediate 8 in >99% ee.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Examples set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit, in any way, the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nAnalytical Methods and Materials\n\n\n \n \n \nUnless otherwise noted, reagents and solvents were used as received from commercial suppliers. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained on Bruker spectrometers at 300, 400 or 500 MHz. Spectra are given in ppm (δ) and coupling constants, J, are reported in Hertz. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as an internal standard. Mass spectra were collected using either a Finnigan LCQ Duo LCMS ion trap electrospray ionization (ESI) or a mass Varian 1200L single quadrapole mass spectrometer (ESI). High performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) analyses were obtained using a Luna C18(2) column (250×4.6 mm, Phenomenex) with UV detection at 254 nm or 223 nm using a standard solvent gradient program (Method A or Method B).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod A:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTime\n\n\nFlow\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(min)\n\n\n(mL/min)\n\n\n% A\n\n\n% B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.0\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n90.0\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n90.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n90.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA = Water with 0.05% Trifluoroacetic Acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nB = Acetonitrile with 0.05% Trifluoroacetic Acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod B:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTime\n\n\nFlow\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(min)\n\n\n(mL/min)\n\n\n% A\n\n\n% B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.0\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n98.0\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n90.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n90.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA = Water with 0.025% Trifluoroacetic Acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nB = Acetonitrile with 0.025% Trifluoroacetic Acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nIntermediate 1—Preparation of Sodium 3-chloro-benzenesulfinate\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA solution of sodium sulphite (627 mg, 4.98 mmol) and sodium bicarbonate (418 mg, 4.98 mmol) in water (13 mL) was stirred vigorously with 3-chlorobenzenesulfonyl chloride (500 mg, 2.36 mmol) at 0° C. for 30 min then heated at 65° C. for 3 h.

248\n\n\nBinding Assay Procedures\n\n\n \n \n \nThe relative affinities of the various compounds for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor were measured in a radioligand binding assay, using a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) format. Test compounds were dissolved to 10 mM in 100% DMSO, then serially diluted at 4× assay concentrations into assay buffer containing 16% DMSO in 96-well poly-propylene plates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor binding analysis vs. the human receptor, samples were incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EDTA (4% DMSO final) with 10 nM [N-methyl-\n3\nH]-LSD (Perkin Elmer), 2.5 μg of human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor membranes (Millipore) and 50 μg SPA beads (PVT-PEI-WGA, GE Healthcare) per well in a final volume of 0.2 mL. For binding analysis vs. the rat receptor, samples were incubated in the same buffer with 3.5 nM [N-methyl-\n3\nH]-LSD, 50 μg of rat 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor membranes (Perkin Elmer) and 0.4 mg SPA beads (PVT-PEI-WGA Type B, GE Healthcare) per well also in a final volume of 0.2 mL. Binding reactions were performed in PicoPlate96 microtiter plates (Perkin Elmer) by consecutively adding 50 μL of each competing compound or buffer, SPA beads, radioligand, and 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor membranes. After an overnight incubation at room temperature on a Nutator mixer, plates were centrifuged for 15 min at 1,500 rpm, followed by incubation in the dark for 10 min. Radioactivity was counted in either a TopCountNXT microplate counter (Perkin Elmer) or a Wallac Trilux 1450 Microbeta microplate reader (Perkin Elmer) for 5 min per well. Total binding control contained compound dilution buffer only; nonspecific binding is determined in the presence of 100 μM 5-hydroxytryptamine. Specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll experiments were performed in duplicate using ten concentrations of competing ligand. IC\n50 \nvalues were determined from specific binding data using XLfit4.1 curve fitting software from IDBS Ltd. The inhibition constant (K\ni\n) was calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation: (K\ni\n=IC\n50\n/(1+(L/K\nD\n)), where L=concentration of radioligand in the assay, and K\nD\n=affinity of the radioligand for the receptor.\n\n\n \nExample 249\n\n\nCell-Based Functional Assay Procedures\n\n\n \n \n \nThe functional activities of the various compounds on the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor were determined in a cell-based functional assay by measuring the production of cAMP using HTRF™ assay technology (CisBio International). Test compounds were dissolved to 10 mM in 100% DMSO, then serially diluted at 1000× assay concentrations into 100% DMSO in 96-well polypropylene plates. Compounds were further diluted to 4× assay concentrations with serum free media containing IBMX. For functional analysis vs. the human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor expressing cell lines, samples were incubated in serum free DMEM with 1 mM IBMX (0.25% DMSO final) with 60,000 cells/well in a final volume of 100 μL for a total of 30 minutes at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntagonist activity was determined after a 20 minute incubation by the addition of a 5-hydroxytryptamine challenge at the EC\n80 \n(30 nM 5-HT) and an additional incubation of 10 minutes. Cells were lysed by addition of HTRF™ reagents (CisBio International) and after another 30 minute incubation, the plates were read on an AnalystGT (MDS) or SynergyHT (BioTek) microplate reader. Basal cAMP accumulation levels were measured in the presence of 0.25% DMSO only. Antagonist activity was expressed as the ratio of cAMP produced in a test well to the average cAMP produced in the EC\n80 \nchallenge control wells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgonist activity was determined after a full 30 minutes of incubation at room temperature, using 10 μM 5-HT as the E\nmax \ncontrol. Cells were lysed by addition of HTRF™ reagents (CisBio International) and after another 30 minute incubation, the plates were read on an AnalystGT (MDS) or SynergyHT (BioTek) microplate reader. Basal cAMP accumulation levels were measured in the presence of 0.25% DMSO only. Agonist activity was expressed as the ratio of cAMP produced in a test well to the average cAMP produced in the E\nmax \ncontrol wells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll cell-based experiments were performed in duplicate using ten concentrations of test compound with 5-HT (agonist mode) or a known antagonist (antagonist mode) included as additional controls in every run. IC\n50\n/EC\n50 \nvalues were determined using XLfit4.1 curve fitting software from IDBS Ltd. For antagonists, the apparent dissociation constant (K\nb\n) was calculated using a modified Cheng-Prusoff equation: K\nb\n=IC\n50\n/(1+(A/EC\n50A\n)), where A=concentration of reference agonist in the assay and EC\n50\nA=EC\n50 \nvalue of the reference agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBiological activity of the compounds of the present invention.\n \n \n \n

Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. Generally, nomenclatures used in connection with, and techniques of, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, immunology, microbiology, genetics and protein and nucleic acid chemistry and hybridization described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. The methods and techniques of the present invention are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification unless otherwise indicated. See, \ne.g\n., \nSambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989\n) and \nAusubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates (1992\n), and \nHarlow and Lane Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1990\n), which are incorporated herein by reference. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The terminology used in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:\n\n \n \n \nThe term \"isolated molecule\" (where the molecule is, for example, a polypeptide, a polynucleotide, or an antibody) is a molecule that by virtue of its origin or source of derivation (1) is not associated with naturally associated components that accompany it in its native state, (2) is substantially free of other molecules from the same species (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature. Thus, a molecule that is chemically synthesized, or synthesized in a cellular system different from the cell from which it naturally originates, will be \"isolated\" from its naturally associated components. A molecule also may be rendered substantially free of naturally associated components by isolation, using purification techniques well known in the art. Molecule purity or homogeneity may be assayed by a number of means well known in the art. For example, the purity of a polypeptide sample may be assayed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining of the gel to visualize the polypeptide using techniques well known in the art. For certain purposes, higher resolution may be provided by using HPLC or other means well known in the art for purification.\n \nThe terms \"IGF-1R inhibitor\" and \"IGF-1R antagonist\" are used interchangeably. Each is a molecule that detectably inhibits at least one function of IGF-1R. Conversely, an \"IGF-1R agonist\" is a molecule that detectably increases at least one function of IGF-1R. The inhibition caused by an IGF-1R inhibitor need not be complete so long as it is detectable using an assay. Any assay of a function of IGF-1R can be used, examples of which are provided herein. Examples of functions of IGF-1R that can be inhibited by an IGF-1R inhibitor, or increased by an IGF-1R agonist, include binding to IGF-1, IGF-12, and/or another IGF-1R-activating molecule, kinase activity, downstream signaling, and so on. Examples of types of IGF-1R inhibitors and IGF-1R agonists include, but are not limited to, IGF-1R binding polypeptides such as antigen binding proteins (e.g., IGF-1R inhibiting antigen binding proteins), antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody derivatives.\n \nThe terms \"peptide,\" \"polypeptide\" and \"protein\" each refers to a molecule comprising two or more amino acid residues joined to each other by peptide bonds. These terms encompass, \ne.g\n., native and artificial proteins, protein fragments and polypeptide analogs (such as muteins, variants, and fusion proteins) of a protein sequence as well as post-translationally, or otherwise covalently or non-covalently, modified proteins. A peptide, polypeptide, or protein may be monomeric or polymeric.\n \nThe term \"polypeptide fragment\" as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion as compared to a corresponding full-length protein. Fragments can be, for example, at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 50, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150 or 200 amino acids in length. Fragments can also be, for example, at most 1,000, 750, 500, 250, 200, 175, 150, 125, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50,40, 30,20,15,14,13,12,11, or 10 amino acids in length. A fragment can further comprise, at either or both of its ends, one or more additional amino acids, for example, a sequence of amino acids from a different naturally-occurring protein (\ne.g\n., an Fc or leucine zipper domain) or an artificial amino acid sequence (\ne.g\n., an artificial linker sequence).\n \nPolypeptides of the invention include polypeptides that have been modified in any way and for any reason, for example, to: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties. Analogs include muteins of a polypeptide. For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (\ne.g\n., conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally occurring sequence (\ne.g.\n, in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts. A \"conservative amino acid substitution\" is one that does not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (\ne.g\n., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterize the parent sequence or are necessary for its functionality). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in \nProteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984\n)); \nIntroduction to Protein Structure (C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991\n)); and \nThornton et at. Nature 354:105 (1991\n), which are each incorporated herein by reference.\n \nThe present invention also provides non-peptide analogs of IGF-1R binding polypeptides. Non-peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed \"peptide mimetics\" or \"peptidomimetics\". \nFauchere, J. Adv. Drug Res. 15:29 (1986\n); \nVeber and Freidinger TINS p.392 (1985\n); and \nEvans et al. J. Med. Chem. 30:1229 (1987\n), which are incorporated herein by reference. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (\ni.e.\n, a polypeptide that has a desired biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as a human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: --CH\n2\nNH--, --CH\n2\nS--, --CH\n2\n--CH\n2\n--, --CH=CH-(\ncis\n and \ntrans\n),-COCH\n2\n--, --CH(OH)CH\n2\n--, and --CH\n2\nSO--, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (\ne.g\n., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may also be used to generate more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art (\nRizo and Gierasch Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61:387 (1992\n), incorporated herein by reference), for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.\n \nA \"variant\" of a polypeptide (\ne.g\n., an antibody) comprises an amino acid sequence wherein one or more amino acid residues are inserted into, deleted from and/or substituted into the amino acid sequence relative to another polypeptide sequence. Variants of the invention include fusion proteins.\n \nA \"derivative\" of a polypeptide is a polypeptide (\ne.g.\n, an antibody) that has been chemically modified, \ne.g\n., via conjugation to another chemical moiety such as, for example, polyethylene glycol, albumin (\ne.g\n., human serum albumin), phosphorylation, and glycosylation. Unless otherwise indicated, the term \"antibody\" includes, in addition to antibodies comprising two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light chains, derivatives, variants, fragments, and muteins thereof, examples of which are described below.\n \nAn \"antigen binding protein\" is a protein comprising a portion that binds to an antigen and, optionally, a scaffold or framework portion that allows the antigen binding portion to adopt a conformation that promotes binding of the antigen binding protein to the antigen. Examples of antigen binding proteins include antibodies, antibody fragments (e.g., an antigen binding portion of an antibody), antibody derivatives, and antibody analogs. The antigen binding protein can comprise, for example, an alternative protein scaffold or artificial scaffold with grafted CDRs or CDR derivatives. Such scaffolds include, but are not limited to, antibody-derived scaffolds comprising mutations introduced to, for example, stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the antigen binding protein as well as wholly synthetic scaffolds comprising, for example, a biocompatible polymer. See, for example, \nKorndorfer et al., 2003, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, \n; \nRoque et al., 2004, Biotechnol. Prog. 20:639-654\n. In addition, peptide antibody mimetics (\"PAMs\") can be used, as well as scaffolds based on antibody mimetics utilizing fibronection components as a scaffold.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAn antigen binding protein can have, for example, the structure of a naturally occurring immunoglobulin. An \"immunoglobulin\" is a tetrameric molecule. In a naturally occurring immunoglobulin, each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \"light\" (about 25 kDa) and one \"heavy\" chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a \"J\" region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a \"D\" region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, \nFundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989\n)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site such that an intact immunoglobulin has two binding sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNaturally occurring immunoglobulin chains exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. From N-terminus to C-terminus, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of \nKabat et al. in Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., US Dept. of Health and Human Services, PHS, NIH, NIH Publication no. 91-3242, 1991\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"antibody\" refers to an intact immunoglobulin or to an antigen binding portion thereof that competes with the intact antibody for specific binding, unless otherwise specified. Antigen binding portions may be produced by recombinant DNA techniques or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Antigen binding portions include, \ninter alia,\n Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n, Fv, domain antibodies (dAbs), and complementarity determining region (CDR) fragments, single-chain antibodies (scFv), chimeric antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, and polypeptides that contain at least a portion of an immunoglobulin that is sufficient to confer specific antigen binding to the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Fab fragment is a monovalent fragment having the V\nL\n, V\nH\n, C\nL\n and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domains; a F(ab')\n2\n fragment is a bivalent fragment having two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; a Fd fragment has the V\nH\n and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domains; an Fv fragment has the V\nL\n and V\nH\n domains of a single arm of an antibody; and a dAb fragment has a V\nH\n domain, a V\nL\n domain, or an antigen-binding fragment of a V\nH\n or V\nL\n domain (\n \nUS Pat. No. 6,846,634\n \n, \n \n6,696,245\n \n, \n \nUS App. Pub. No. 05/0202512\n \n, \n \n04/0202995\n \n, \n \n04/0038291\n \n, \n \n04/0009507\n \n, \n \n03/0039958\n \n, \nWard et al., Nature 341:544-546, 1989\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA single-chain antibody (scFv) is an antibody in which a V\nL\n and a V\nH\n region are joined via a linker (\ne.g\n., a synthetic sequence of amino acid residues) to form a continuous protein chain wherein the linker is long enough to allow the protein chain to fold back on itself and form a monovalent antigen binding site (see, \ne.g.\n, \nBird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-26\n and \nHuston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-83\n). Diabodies are bivalent antibodies comprising two polypeptide chains, wherein each polypeptide chain comprises V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains joined by a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between two domains on the same chain, thus allowing each domain to pair with a complementary domain on another polypeptide chain (see, \ne.g\n., \nHolliger et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-48\n, and \nPoljak et al., 1994, Structure 2:1121-23\n). If the two polypeptide chains of a diabody are identical, then a diabody resulting from their pairing will have two identical antigen binding sites. Polypeptide chains having different sequences can be used to make a diabody with two different antigen binding sites. Similarly, tribodies and tetrabodies are antibodies comprising three and four polypeptide chains, respectively, and forming three and four antigen binding sites, respectively, which can be the same or different.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComplementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FR) of a given antibody may be identified using the system described by \nKabat et al. in Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., US Dept. of Health and Human Services, PHS, NIH, NIH Publication no: 91-3242, 1991\n. One or more CDRs may be incorporated into a molecule either covalently or noncovalently to make it an antigen binding protein. An antigen binding protein may incorporate the CDR(s) as part of a larger polypeptide chain, may covalently link the CDR(s) to another polypeptide chain, or may incorporate the CDR(s) noncovalently. The CDRs permit the antigen binding protein to specifically bind to a particular antigen of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antigen binding protein may have one or more binding sites. If there is more than one binding site, the binding sites may be identical to one another or may be different. For example, a naturally occurring human immunoglobulin typically has two identical binding sites, while a \"bispecific\" or \"bifunctional\" antibody has two different binding sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"human antibody\" includes all antibodies that have one or more variable and constant regions derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. In one embodiment, all of the variable and constant domains are derived from human immunoglobulin sequences (a fully human antibody). These antibodies may be prepared in a variety of ways, examples of which are described below, including through the immunization with an antigen of interest of a mouse that is genetically modified to express antibodies derived from human heavy and/or light chain-encoding genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA humanized antibody has a sequence that differs from the sequence of an antibody derived from a non-human species by one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or additions, such that the humanized antibody is less likely to induce an immune response, and/or induces a less severe immune response, as compared to the non-human species antibody, when it is administered to a human subject. In one embodiment, certain amino acids in the framework and constant domains of the heavy and/or light chains of the non-human species antibody are mutated to produce the humanized antibody. In another embodiment, the constant domain(s) from a human antibody are fused to the variable domain(s) of a non-human species. In another embodiment, one or more amino acid residues in one or more CDR sequences of a non-human antibody are changed to reduce the likely immunogenicity of the non-human antibody when it is administered to a human subject, wherein the changed amino acid residues either are not critical for immunospecific binding of the antibody to its antigen, or the changes to the amino acid sequence that are made are conservative changes, such that the binding of the humanized antibody to the antigen is not significantly worse than the binding of the non-human antibody to the antigen. Examples of how to make humanized antibodies may be found in \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 6,054,297\n \n, \n \n5,886,152 \n \nand \n \n5,877,293\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"chimeric antibody\" refers to an antibody that contains one or more regions from one antibody and one or more regions from one or more other antibodies. In one embodiment, one or more of the CDRs are derived from a human anti-IGF-1R antibody. In another embodiment, all of the CDRs are derived from a human anti-IGF-1R antibody. In another embodiment, the CDRs from more than one human anti-IGF-1R antibodies are mixed and matched in a chimeric antibody. For instance, a chimeric antibody may comprise a CDR1 from the light chain of a first human anti-IGF-1R antibody, a CDR2 and a CDR3 from the light chain of a second human anti-IGF-1R antibody, and the CDRs from the heavy chain from a third anti-IGF-1R antibody. Further, the framework regions may be derived from one of the same anti-IGF-1R antibodies, from one or more different antibodies, such as a human antibody, or from a humanized antibody. In one example of a chimeric antibody, a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with, homologous to, or derived from an antibody from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with, homologous to, or derived from an antibody (-ies) from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. Also included are fragments of such antibodies that exhibit the desired biological activity (\ni.e\n., the ability to specifically bind IGF-1R). See, \ne.g\n., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n and \nMorrison, 1985, Science 229:1202-07\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"neutralizing antibody\" or \"an inhibitory antibody\" is an antibody that inhibits the binding of IGF-1R to IGF-I and/or IGF-2 when an excess of the anti-IGF-1R antibody reduces the amount of IGF-I and/or IGF-2 bound to IGF-1R by at least about 20% using the assay described in Example 9. In various embodiments, the antibody reduces the amount of IGF-I and/or IGF-2 bound to IGF-1R by at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 99%, and 99.9%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"activating antibody\" is an antibody that activates IGF-1R by at least about 20% when added to a cell, tissue or organism expressing IGF-1R, where \"100% activation\" is the level of activation achieved under physiological conditions by the same molar amount of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2. In various embodiments, the antibody activates IGF-1R activity by at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, 400%, 450%, 500%, 750%, or 1000%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFragments or analogs of antibodies can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art following the teachings of this specification and using techniques well-known in the art. Preferred amino- and carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains. Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Computerized comparison methods can be used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and/or function. Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. See, \ne.g.\n, \nBowie et al., 1991, Science 253:164\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"CDR grafted antibody\" is an antibody comprising one or more CDRs derived from an antibody of a particular species or isotype and the framework of another antibody of the same or different species or isotype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"multi-specific antibody\" is an antibody that recognizes more than one epitope on one or more antigens. A subclass of this type of antibody is a \"bi-specific antibody\" which recognizes two distinct epitopes on the same or different antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antigen binding protein \"specifically binds\" to an antigen (\ne.g\n., human IGF-1R) if it binds to the antigen with a dissociation constant of 1 nanomolar or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"antigen binding domain,\" \"antigen binding region,\" or \"antigen binding site\" is a portion of an antigen binding protein that contains amino acid residues (or other moieties) that interact with an antigen and contribute to the antigen binding protein's specificity and affinity for the antigen. For an antibody that specifically binds to its antigen, this will include at least part of at least one of its CDR domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"epitope\" is the portion of a molecule that is bound by an antigen binding protein (e.g., by an antibody). An epitope can comprise non-contiguous portions of the molecule (\ne.g\n., in a polypeptide, amino acid residues that are not contiguous in the polypeptide's primary sequence but that, in the context of the polypeptide's tertiary and quaternary structure, are near enough to each other to be bound by an antigen binding protein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \"percent identity\" of two polynucleotide or two polypeptide sequences is determined by comparing the sequences using the GAP computer program (a part of the GCG Wisconsin Package, version 10.3 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA)) using its default parameters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"polynucleotide,\" \"oligonucleotide\" and \"nucleic acid\" are used interchangeably throughout and include DNA molecules (\ne.g.\n, cDNA or genomic DNA), RNA molecules (\ne.g\n., mRNA), analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs (\ne.g\n., peptide nucleic acids and non-naturally occurring nucleotide analogs), and hybrids thereof. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules of the invention comprise a contiguous open reading frame encoding an antibody, or a fragment, derivative, mutein, or variant thereof, of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo single-stranded polynucleotides are \"the complement\" of each other if their sequences can be aligned in an anti-parallel orientiation such that every nucleotide in one polynucleotide is opposite its complementary nucleotide in the other polynucleotide, without the introduction of gaps, and without unpaired nucleotides at the 5' or the 3' end of either sequence. A polynucleotide is \"complementary\" to another polynucleotide if the two polynucleotides can hybridize to one another under moderately stringent conditions. Thus, a polynucleotide can be complementary to another polynucleotide without being its complement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"vector\" is a nucleic acid that can be used to introduce another nucleic acid linked to it into a cell. One type of vector is a \"plasmid,\" which refers to a linear or circular double stranded DNA molecule into which additional nucleic acid segments can be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector (\ne.g.\n, replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), wherein additional DNA segments can be introduced into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (\ne.g\n., bacterial vectors comprising a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (\ne.g\n., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. An \"expression vector\" is a type of vector that can direct the expression of a chosen polynucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleotide sequence is \"operably linked\" to a regulatory sequence if the regulatory sequence affects the expression (\ne.g\n., the level, timing, or location of expression) of the nucleotide sequence. A \"regulatory sequence\" is a nucleic acid that affects the expression (\ne.g\n., the level, timing, or location of expression) of a nucleic acid to which it is operably linked. The regulatory sequence can, for example, exert its effects directly on the regulated nucleic acid, or through the action of one or more other molecules (\ne.g\n., polypeptides that bind to the regulatory sequence and/or the nucleic acid). Examples of regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements (\ne.g\n., polyadenylation signals). Further examples of regulatory sequences are described in, for example, \nGoeddel, 1990, Gene Expression Technology: Methods in \n and \nBaron et al., 1995, Nucleic Acids Res. 23:3605-06\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"host cell\" is a cell that can be used to express a nucleic acid, \ne.g.\n, a nucleic acid of the invention. A host cell can be a prokaryote, for example, \nE. coli\n, or it can be a eukaryote, for example, a single-celled eukaryote (\ne.g\n., a yeast or other fungus), a plant cell \n(e.g.,\n a tobacco or tomato plant cell), an animal cell (\ne.g\n., a human cell, a monkey cell, a hamster cell, a rat cell, a mouse cell, or an insect cell) or a hybridoma. Examples of host cells include the COS-7 line of monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL 1651) (see \nGluzman et al., 1981, Cell 23:175\n), L cells, C127 cells, 3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 163), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or their derivatives such as Veggie CHO and related cell lines which grow in serum-free media (see \nRasmussen et al., 1998, Cytotechnology 28:31\n) or CHO strain DX-\nB\n 11, which is deficient in DHFR (see \nUrlaub et al., 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-20\n), HeLa cells, BHK (ATCC CRL 10) cell lines, the CV1/EBNA cell line derived from the African green monkey kidney cell line CV1 (ATCC CCL 70) (see \nMcMahan et al., 1991, EMBO J. 10:2821\n), human embryonic kidney cells such as 293, 293 EBNA or MSR 293, human epidermal A431 cells, human Colo205 cells, other transformed primate cell lines, normal diploid cells, cell strains derived from in vitro culture of primary tissue, primary explants, HL-60, U937, HaK or Jurkat cells. Typically, a host cell is a cultured cell that can be transformed or transfected with a polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid, which can then be expressed in the host cell. The phrase \"recombinant host cell\" can be used to denote a host cell that has been transformed or transfected with a nucleic acid to be expressed. A host cell also can be a cell that comprises the nucleic acid but does not express it at a desired level unless a regulatory sequence is introduced into the host cell such that it becomes operably linked with the nucleic acid. It is understood that the term host cell refers not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to, \ne.g\n., mutation or environmental influence, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein.\n\n\n \n\n\nIGF-1R\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIGF-1R is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (\nBlume-Jensen et al., 2001, Nature 411:355-65\n). The human IGF-1R is synthesized as a 1367 amino acid precursor polypeptide that includes a 30 amino acid signal peptide removed during translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (Swiss-Prot: P08069). The IGF-1R proreceptor is glycosylated and cleaved by a protease at positions 708-711 (counting from the first amino acid following the signal peptide sequence) during maturation in the ER-golgi resulting in the formation of an α-chain (1-707) and a β-chain (712-1337) that remain linked by disulfide bonds (\nBhaumick et al., 1981, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 78:4279-83\n, \nChernausek et al., 1981, Biochemistry 20:7345-50\n, \nJacobs et al., 1983, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 80:1228-31\n, \nLeBon et al., 1986, J Biol Chem 261:7685-89\n, \nElleman, et al., 2000, Biochem J 347:771-79\n). The predominant form of the IGF-1R (and INSR) that exists on the cell-surface is a proteolytically processed and glycosylated (αβ)\n2\n dimer joined covalently by one or more disulfide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe extracellular portion of the IGF-1R consists of the α-chain and 191 amino acids of the β-chain (712-905). The receptor contains a single transmembrane spanning sequence (906-929) and a 408-residue cytoplasmic domain that includes a functional tyrosine kinase (\nRubin et al., 1983, Nature 305:438-440\n). Comparative sequence analysis has revealed that the IGF-1R is composed of 11 distinct structural motifs (reviewed by \nAdams et al., 2000, Cell Mol Life Sci 57:1050-93\n, \nMarino-Buslje et al., 1998, FEBS Ltrs 441:331-36\n, \nWard et al., 2001, BMC Bioinformatics 2:4\n). The N-terminal half of the extracellular domain contains two homologous domains referred to as L1 (1-151) and L2 (299-461) (Ward \net al.,\n 2001, \nsupra\n) separated by a cysteine-rich (CR) region (152-298) consisting of several structural modules with disulfide linkages that align with repeating units present in the TNF receptor and laminin (\nWard et al., 1995, Proteins 22:141-53\n). The crystal structure of the L1-CR-L2 domain has been solved (\nGarrett et al., 1998, Nature 394:395-99\n). The L2 domain is followed by three fibronectin type III domains (Marino-Buslje \net al.,\n 1998, \nsupra,\n \nMulhern et al., 1998, Trends Biochem Sci 23:465-66\n, \nWard et al., 1999, Growth Factors 16:315-22\n). The first FnIII domain (FnIII-1, 461-579) is 118 amino acids in length. The second FnIII domain (FnIII-2, 580-798) is disrupted by a major insert sequence (ID) of about 120 amino acids in length. The ID domain includes a furin protease cleavage site that separates the α and β chains of the mature receptor. The third FnIII domain (FnIII-3) is located entirely in the β-chain (799-901) terminating several residues before the transmembrane sequence. The catalytic domain of the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase is located between amino acids positions 973-1229, and its structure has been solved (\nFavelyukis et al., 2001, Nature Structural Biol 8:1058-63\n, \nPautsch et al., 2001, Structure 9:955-65\n). The kinase is flanked by two regulatory regions, the juxtamembrane region (930-972) and a 108 amino acid C-terminal tail (1220-1337) (\nSurmacz et al., 1995, Experimental Cell Res 218:370-80\n, \nHongo et al., 1996, Oncogene 12:1231-38\n). The two regulatory regions contain tyrosine residues that serve as docking sites for signal transducing proteins when phosphorylated by the activated IGF-1R tyrosine kinase (reviewed by \nBaserga (ed.), 1998 The IGF-1 Receptor in Normal and Abnormal Growth, Hormones and Growth Factors in Development and Neoplasia, Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n, \nAdams et al., 2000, Cell Mol Life Sci 57:1050-93\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IGF-1R amino acid sequence is about 70% identical to the insulin receptor (INSR; Swiss-Prot: P06213). The highest homology between the receptors is located in the tyrosine kinase domain (84%); the lowest identity is in the CR region and the C-terminus. The IGF-1R is also highly related (- 55% identical) to the insulin related receptor (IRR; Swiss-Prot: P14616).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman IGF-1R can be activated by the insulin-like growth factors, IGF-1 and IGF-2 and insulin (INS) (\nHill et al., 1985, Pediatric Research 19:879-86\n). IGF-1 and IGF-2 are encoded nonallelic genes (\nBrissenden et al., 1984, Nature 310: 781-8\n, \nBell et al., 1985, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 82: 6450-54\n), and both genes express alternative proteins related by differential RNA splicing and protein processing. The most common and well-studied mature forms of IGF-1 and IGF-2 are respectively 70 and 67 amino acids in length (\nJansen et al., 1983, Nature 306:609-11\n, \nDull et al., 1984, Nature 310: 777-81\n). These proteins (and their isoforms) are identical at 11/21 positions to the insulin A-peptide, and identical at 12/30 positions with the insulin B-peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIGF-1R is expressed in all cells types in the normal adult animal except for liver hepatocytes and mature B-cells. Human blood plasma contains high concentrations of IGF-1 and IGF-2, and IGF-1 can be detected in most tissues. The receptor is an integral component of the physiological mechanism controlling organ size and homeostasis. Without being bound to a particular theory, the \"Somatomedin Hypothesis\" states that Growth Hormone (GH) mediated somatic growth that occurs during childhood and adolescence is dependent on the endocrine form of IGF-1 that is mainly produced and secreted by the liver (\nDaughaday, 2000, Pediatric Nephrology 14: 537-40\n). The synthesis of hepatic IGF-1 is stimulated by GH release in the pituitary in response to hypothalamic GHRH (GH releasing hormone). The serum concentration of IGF-1 increases over 100 fold between ages 5-15 in humans. The bioavailability of IGF-1 is regulated by IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) with approximately 99% of the growth factor compartmentalized in the bound state. Primary IGF-1 deficiency arising form partial gene deletions, and secondary IGF-1 deficiency resulting from defects in GH production or signaling are not lethal (\nWoods, 1999, IGF Deficiency in Contemporary Endocrinology: The IGF System, R. a. R. Rosenfeld, C. Jr. Totowa, ed.s, Humana Press, NJ: 651-74\n). The affected individuals exhibit growth retardation at birth, grow slowly and can face certain CNS abnormalities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIGF-1R signaling promotes cell growth and survival through the IRS adapter protein-dependent activation of the PI3Kinase/Akt pathway. IGF-1R transmits a signal to its major substrates, IRS-1 through IRS-4 and the Shc proteins (\nBlakesley et al., 1999, IGF-1 receptor function: transducing the IGF-1 signal into intracellular events in The IGF System, R. G. a. R. Rosenfeld, Jr. C.T. Totowa, ed.s, Humana Press, NJ: 143-63\n). This results in activation of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase and PI3 Kinase/Akt signaling pathways. However, induction of Akt-mediated cell survival via IRS is the dominant pathway response upon IGF stimulation of most cells. See \nFigure 10\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nAntigen binding proteins\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides antigen binding proteins (\ne.g.\n, antibodies, antibody fragments, antibody derivatives, antibody muteins, and antibody variants), that bind to IGF-1R, \ne.g\n., human IGF-1R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins in accordance with the present invention include antigen binding proteins that inhibit a biological activity of IGF-1R Examples of such biological activities include binding a signaling molecule (\ne.g\n. , IGF-1 and/or IGF-2), and transducing a signal in response to binding a signaling molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferent antigen binding proteins may bind to different domains or epitopes of IGF-1R or act by different mechanisms of action. Examples include but are not limited to antigen binding proteins that interfere with binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R or that inhibit signal transduction. The site of action may be, for example, intracellular (\ne.g\n., by interfering with an intracellular signaling cascade) or extracellular. An antigen binding protein need not completely inhibit an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 induced activity to find use in the present invention; rather, antigen binding proteins that reduce a particular activity of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 are contemplated for use as well. (Discussions herein of particular mechanisms of action for IGF-1R-binding antigen binding proteins in treating particular diseases are illustrative only, and the methods presented herein are not bound thereby.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been observed that IGF-1 and IGF-2 each exhibits biphasic binding to IGF-1R. High affinity binding has been reported to have a K\nD\n in the range of 0.2 nM; high affinity binding, about ten fold higher. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an IGF-1R inhibitor that inhibits both the high and low affinity binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-R It has been suggested that the high affinity binding, rather than the low affinity binding, of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R is required for the conformation change that activates the tyrosine kinase activity of IGF-1R. Thus, in another embodiment, the IGF-1R inhibitor preferentially inhibits the high affinity binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R as compared to the low affinity binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides antigen binding proteins that comprise a light chain variable region selected from the group consisting of L1 through L52 and/or a heavy chain variable region selected from the group consisting of H1 through H52, and fragments, derivatives, muteins, and variants thereof (see \nFigures 2\n and \n3\n). Such an antigen binding protein can be denoted using the nomenclature \"LxHy\", wherein \"x\" corresponds to the number of the light chain variable region and \"y\" corresponds to the number of the heavy chain variable region as they are labeled in \nFigures 2\n and \n3\n. For example, L2H1 refers to an antigen binding protein with a light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of L2 and a heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of H1, as shown in \nFigures 2\n and \n3\n. \nFigures 2\n and \n3\n also indicate the location of the CDR and framework regions of each of these variable domain sequences.

MQALQTPZT; iii. QQ(R/S)(N/S)(S/N)ZPLT; and iv. QSYDSSNXJV; b. a heavy chain CDR3 comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of: i. a heavy chain CDR3 sequence that differs by no more than a total of three amino acid additions, substitutions, or deletions from a CDR3 sequence selected from the group consisting of the heavy chain CDR3 sequences of H1-H52 as shown in \nFigure 9\n; ii. SRLDAFDI; iii. SXYDYYGMDV; iv. HRXDXAWYFDL; and v. DSSG; or c. the light chain CDR3 sequence of (a) and the heavy chain CDR3 sequence of (b); wherein amino acid residue symbols enclosed in parentheses identify alternative residues for the same position in a sequence, each X is independently any amino acid residue, each Z is independently a glycine residue, an alanine residue, a valine residue, a leucine residue, an isoleucine residue, a proline residue, a phenylalanine residue, a methionine residue, a tryptophan residue, or a cysteine residue, each J is independently a glutamine residue, an arginine residue, a valine residue, or a tryptophan residue, and the antigen binding protein binds to human IGF-1R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleotide sequences of \nFigure 1\n, or the amino acid sequences of \nFigures 2 through 9\n, can be altered, for example, by random mutagenesis or by site-directed mutagenesis (\ne.g\n., oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis) to create an altered polynucleotide comprising one or more particular nucleotide substitutions, deletions, or insertions as compared to the non-mutated polynucleotide. Examples of techniques for making such alterations are described in \nWalder et al., 1986,Gene 42:133\n; \nBauer et al.1985, Gene 37:73\n; \nCraik, BioTechniques, January 1985, 12-19\n; \nSmith et al., 1981, Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods, Plenum Press\n; and \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,518,584\n \n and \n \n4,737,462\n \n. These and other methods can be used to make, for example, derivatives of anti-IGF-1R antibodies that have a desired property, for example, increased affinity, avidity, or specificity for IGF-1R, increased activity or stability \nin vivo\n or \nin vitro,\n or reduced \nin vivo\n side-effects as compared to the underivatized antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther derivatives of anti- IGF-1R antibodies within the scope of this invention include covalent or aggregative conjugates of anti-IGF-1R antibodies, or fragments thereof, with other proteins or polypeptides, such as by expression of recombinant fusion proteins comprising heterologous polypeptides fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of an anti- IGF-1R antibody polypeptide. For example, the conjugated peptide may be a heterologous signal (or leader) polypeptide, \ne.g\n., the yeast alpha-factor leader, or a peptide such as an epitope tag. Antigen binding protein-containing fusion proteins can comprise peptides added to facilitate purification or identification of antigen binding protein (\ne.g\n., poly-His). An antigen binding protein also can be linked to the FLAG peptide Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (DYKDDDDK) (SEQ ID NO:255) as described in \nHopp et al., Bio/Technology 6:1204,1988\n, and \n \nU.S. Patent 5,011,912\n \n. The FLAG peptide is highly antigenic and provides an epitope reversibly bound by a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), enabling rapid assay and facile purification of expressed recombinant protein. Reagents useful for preparing fusion proteins in which the FLAG peptide is fused to a given polypeptide are commercially available (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOligomers that contain one or more antigen binding proteins may be employed as IGF-1R antagonists. Oligomers may be in the form of covalently-linked or non-covalently-linked dimers, trimers, or higher oligomers. Oligomers comprising two or more antigen binding protein are contemplated for use, with one example being a homodimer. Other oligomers include heterodimers, homotrimers, heterotrimers, homotetramers, heterotetramers, \netc.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment is directed to oligomers comprising multiple antigen binding proteins joined via covalent or non-covalent interactions between peptide moieties fused to theantigen binding proteins. Such peptides may be peptide linkers (spacers), or peptides that have the property of promoting oligomerization. Leucine zippers and certain polypeptides derived from antibodies are among the peptides that can promote oligomerization of antigen binding proteins attached thereto, as described in more detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, the oligomers comprise from two to four antigen binding proteins. The antigen binding proteins of the oligomer may be in any form, such as any of the forms described above, \ne.g\n., variants or fragments. Preferably, the oligomers comprise antigen binding proteins that have IGF-1R binding activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an oligomer is prepared using polypeptides derived from immunoglobulins. Preparation of fusion proteins comprising certain heterologous polypeptides fused to various portions of antibody-derived polypeptides (including the Fc domain) has been described, \ne.g\n., by \nAshkenazi et al., 1991, PNAS USA 88:10535\n; \nByrn et al., 1990, Nature 344:677\n; and \nHollenbaugh et al., 1992 \"\nConstruction of Immunoglobulin Fusion Proteins\n\", in Current Protocols in Immunology, Suppl. 4, pages 10.19.1 - 10.19.11\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is directed to a dimer comprising two fusion proteins created by fusing an IGF-1R binding fragment of an anti- IGF-1R antibody to the Fc region of an antibody. The dimer can be made by, for example, inserting a gene fusion encoding the fusion protein into an appropriate expression vector, expressing the gene fusion in host cells transformed with the recombinant expression vector, and allowing the expressed fusion protein to assemble much like antibody molecules, whereupon interchain disulfide bonds form between the Fc moieties to yield the dimer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"Fc polypeptide\" as used herein includes native and mutein forms of polypeptides derived from the Fc region of an antibody. Truncated forms of such polypeptides containing the hinge region that promotes dimerization also are included. Fusion proteins comprising Fc moieties (and oligomers formed therefrom) offer the advantage of facile purification by affinity chromatography over Protein A or Protein G columns.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne suitable Fc polypeptide, described in \n \nPCT application WO 93/10151\n \n (hereby incorporated by reference), is a single chain polypeptide extending from the N-terminal hinge region to the native C-terminus of the Fc region of a human IgG1 antibody. Another useful Fc polypeptide is the Fc mutein described in \n \nU.S. Patent 5,457,035\n \n and in \nBaum et al., 1994, EMBO J. 13:3992-4001\n. The amino acid sequence of this mutein is identical to that of the native Fc sequence presented in \n \nWO 93/10151\n \n, except that \namino acid\n 19 has been changed from Leu to Ala, \namino acid\n 20 has been changed from Leu to Glu, and \namino acid\n 22 has been changed from Gly to Ala. The mutein exhibits reduced affinity for Fc receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the variable portion of the heavy and/or light chains of an anti- IGF-1R antibody may be substituted for the variable portion of an antibody heavy and/or light chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the oligomer is a fusion protein comprising multiple antigen binding proteins, with or without peptide linkers (spacer peptides). Among the suitable peptide linkers are those described in \n \nU.S. Patents 4,751,180\n \n and \n \n4,935,233\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother method for preparing oligomeric antigen binding proteins involves use of a leucine zipper. Leucine zipper domains are peptides that promote oligomerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA-binding proteins (\nLandschulz et al., 1988, Science 240:1759\n), and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble oligomeric proteins are described in \n \nPCT application WO 94/10308\n \n, and the leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD) described in \nHoppe et al., 1994, FEBS Letters 344:191\n, hereby incorporated by reference. The use of a modified leucine zipper that allows for stable trimerization of a heterologous protein fused thereto is described in \nFanslow et al, 1994, Semin. Immunol. 6:267-78\n. In one approach, recombinant fusion proteins comprising an anti- IGF-1R antibody fragment or derivative fused to a leucine zipper peptide are expressed in suitable host cells, and the soluble oligomeric anti- IGF-1R antibody fragments or derivatives that form are recovered from the culture supernatant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides antigen binding proteins that interfere with the binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to an IGF-1R. Such antigen binding proteins can be made against IGF-1R, or a fragment, variant or derivative thereof, and screened in conventional assays for the ability to interfere with binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R. Examples of suitable assays are assays that test the antigen binding proteins for the ability to inhibit binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to cells expressing IGF-1R, or that test antigen binding proteins for the ability to reduce a biological or cellular response that results from the binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to cell surface IGF-1R receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that blocks the binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R but does not significantly block the binding of insulin to insulin receptor (INS-R). In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not bind to INS-R In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to the INS-R with such a low affinity that it does not effectively block the binding of insulin to INS-R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to INS-R, but antigen binding protein-bound INS-R can still bind to insulin. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein's selectivity for IGF-1R is at least 50 times greater than its selectivity for insulin receptor. In another embodiment, the selectivity of the antigen binding protein is more than 100 times greater than its selectivity for insulin receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that demonstrates species selectivity. In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to one or more mammalian IGF-1R, for example, to human IGF-1R and one or more of mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, gerbil, cat, rabbit, dog, goat, sheep, cow, horse, camel, and non-human primate IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to one or more primate IGF-1R, for example, to human IGF-1R and one or more of cynomologous, marmoset, rhesus, and chimpanzee IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds specifically to human, cynomologous, marmoset, rhesus, or chimpanzee IGF-1R, In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not bind to one or more of mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, gerbil, cat, rabbit, dog, goat, sheep, cow, horse, camel, and non-human primate IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not bind to a New World monkey species such as a marmoset. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally occurring protein other than IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally occurring protein other than mammalian IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally occurring protein other than primate IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally occurring protein other than human IGF-1R In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein specifically binds to mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein specifically binds to mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R with a similar binding affinity. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein blocks binding of human IGF-1 and IGF-2 with mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein blocks binding of human IGF-1 and IGF-2 with mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R with similar K\ni\n. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein blocks binding of human IGF-1 and IGF-2 with mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R with a K\ni\n of between about 0.57 and about 0.61 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne may determine the selectivity of an antigen binding protein for an IGF-1R using methods well known in the art and following the teachings of the specification. For example, one may determine the selectivity using Western blot, FACS, ELISA or RIA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein (for example, an anti-IGF-1R antibody), that has one or more of the following characteristics: binds to both human and murine IGF-1R, inhibits the binding of both IGF-1 and IGF-2 to human IGF-1R, inhibits the binding of both IGF-1 and IGF-2 to murine IGF-1R, preferentially inhibits the high affinity binding of IGF-1 and/or of IGF-2 to IGF-1R, binds to the L2 domain of IGF-1R, causes relatively little down-regulation of cell-surface expressed IGF-1R after 17 hours of exposure (as compared to MAB391 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN); e.g., amount of IGF-1R is reduced by less than 20%), causes a level of down-regulation of cell-surface expressed IGF-1R on Colo-205 or MiaPaCa-2 xenograft tumor cells in mice as MAB391 after four weeks of once weekly doses of 200 micrograms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen-binding fragments of antigen binding proteins of the invention may be produced by conventional techniques. Examples of such fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab and F(ab')\n2\n fragments. Antibody fragments and derivatives produced by genetic engineering techniques also are contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional embodiments include chimeric antibodies, \ne.g\n., humanized versions of non-human (\ne.g\n., murine) monoclonal antibodies. Such humanized antibodies may be prepared by known techniques, and offer the advantage of reduced immunogenicity when the antibodies are administered to humans. In one embodiment, a humanized monoclonal antibody comprises the variable domain of a murine antibody (or all or part of the antigen binding site thereof) and a constant domain derived from a human antibody. Alternatively, a humanized antibody fragment may comprise the antigen binding site of a murine monoclonal antibody and a variable domain fragment (lacking the antigen-binding site) derived from a human antibody. Procedures for the production of chimeric and further engineered monoclonal antibodies include those described in \nRiechmann et al., 1988, Nature 332:323\n, \nLiu et al., 1987, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 84:3439\n, \nLarrick et al., 1989, Bio/Technology 7:934\n, and \nWinter et al., 1993, TIPS 14:139\n. In one embodiment, the chimeric antibody is a CDR grafted antibody. Techniques for humanizing antibodies are discussed in, \ne.g\n., \n \nU.S. Pat. App. No. 10/194,975 (published February 27, 2003\n \n), \n \nU.S. Pat. No.s 5,869,619\n \n, \n \n5,225,539\n \n, \n \n5,821,337\n \n, \n \n5,859,205\n \n, \nPadlan et al., 1995, FASEB J. 9:133-39\n, and \nTamura et al., 2000, J. Immunol. 164:1432-41\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProcedures have been developed for generating human or partially human antibodies in non-human animals. For example, mice in which one or more endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been inactivated by various means have been prepared. Human immunoglobulin genes have been introduced into the mice to replace the inactivated mouse genes. Antibodies produced in the animal incorporate human immunoglobulin polypeptide chains encoded by the human genetic material introduced into the animal. In one embodiment, a non-human animal, such as a transgenic mouse, is immunized with an IGF-1R polypeptide, such that antibodies directed against the IGF-1R polypeptide are generated in the animal. One example of a suitable immunogen is a soluble human IGF-1R, such as a polypeptide comprising the extracellular domain of the protein of \nFigure 10\n, or other immunogenic fragment of the protein of \nFigure 10\n. Examples of techniques for production and use of transgenic animals for the production of human or partially human antibodies are described in \n \nU.S. Patents 5,814,318\n \n, \n \n5,569,825\n \n, and \n \n5,545,806\n \n, \nDavis et al., 2003, Production of human antibodies from transgenic mice in Lo, ed.

Monoclonal antibodies may be produced using any technique known in the art, \ne.g\n., by immortalizing spleen cells harvested from the transgenic animal after completion of the immunization schedule. The spleen cells can be immortalized using any technique known in the art, \ne.g\n., by fusing them with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas. Myeloma cells for use in hybridoma-producing fusion procedures preferably are non-antibody-producing, have high fusion efficiency, and enzyme deficiencies that render them incapable of growing in certain selective media which support the growth of only the desired fused cells (hybridomas). Examples of suitable cell lines for use in mouse fusions include Sp-20, P3-X63/Ag8, P3-X63-Ag8.653, NS1/1.Ag 41, Sp210-Ag14, FO, NSO/U, MPC-11, MPC11-X45-GTG 1.7 and S194/5XX0 Bul; examples of cell lines used in rat fusions include R210.RCY3, Y3-Ag 1.2.3, IR983F and 4B210. Other cell lines useful for cell fusions are U-266, GM1500-GRG2, LICR-LON-HMy2 and UC729-6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a hybridoma cell line is produced by immunizing an animal (\ne.g\n., a transgenic animal having human immunoglobulin sequences) with an IGF-1R immunogen; harvesting spleen cells from the immunized animal; fusing the harvested spleen cells to a myeloma cell line, thereby generating hybridoma cells; establishing hybridoma cell lines from the hybridoma cells, and identifying a hybridoma cell line that produces an antibody that binds an IGF-1R polypeptide. Such hybridoma cell lines, and anti-1GF-1R monoclonal antibodies produced by them, are encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies secreted by a hybridoma cell line can be purified using any technique known in the art. Hybridomas or mAbs may be further screened to identify mAbs with particular properties, such as the ability to block an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 induced activity. Examples of such screens are provided in the examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMolecular evolution of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in the center of the antibody binding site also has been used to isolate antibodies with increased affinity, for example, antibodies having increased affinity for c-erbB-2, as described by \nSchier et al., 1996, J. Mol. Biol. 263:551\n. Accordingly, such techniques are useful in preparing antibodies to IGF-1R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins directed against an IGF-1R can be used, for example, in assays to detect the presence of IGF-1R polypeptides, either \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo.\n The antigen binding proteins also may be employed in purifying IGF-1R proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography. Those antigen binding proteins that additionally can block binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R may be used to inhibit a biological activity that results from such binding. Blocking antigen binding proteins can be used in the methods of the present invention. Such antigen binding proteins that function as IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 antagonists may be employed in treating any IGF-1 and/or IGF-2-induced condition, including but not limited to cancer, In one embodiment, a human anti- IGF-1R monoclonal antibody generated by procedures involving immunization of transgenic mice is employed in treating such conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins may be employed in an \nin vitro\n procedure, or administered \nin vivo\n to inhibit an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2-induced biological activity. Disorders caused or exacerbated (directly or indirectly) by the interaction of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 with cell surface IGF-1R, examples of which are provided above, thus may be treated. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a therapeutic method comprising \nin vivo\n administration of an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 blocking antigen binding protein to a mammal in need thereof in an amount effective for reducing an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2-induced biological activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins of the invention include partially human and fully human monoclonal antibodies that inhibit a biological activity of IGF-1 and also inhibit a biological activity of IGF-2. One embodiment is directed to a human monoclonal antibody that at least partially blocks binding of IGF-1 and of IGF-2 to a cell that expresses human IGF-1R. In one embodiment, the antibodies are generated by immunizing a transgenic mouse with an IGF- 1R immunogen. In another embodiment, the immunogen is a human IGF-1R polypeptide (e.g., a soluble fragment comprising all or part of the IGF-1R extracellular domain). Hybridoma cell lines derived from such immunized mice, wherein the hybridoma secretes a monoclonal antibody that binds IGF-1R, also are provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough human, partially human, or humanized antibodies will be suitable for many applications, particularly those involving administration of the antibody to a human subject, other types of antigen binding proteins will be suitable for certain applications. The non-human antibodies of the invention can be, for example, derived from any antibody-producing animal, such as mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, donkey, or non-human primate (such as monkey (\ne.g\n., cynomologous or rhesus monkey) or ape (\ne.g\n., chimpanzee)). Non-human antibodies of the invention can be used, for example, in \nin vitro\n and cell-culture based applications, or any other application where an immune response to the antibody of the invention does not occur, is insignificant, can be prevented, is not a concern, or is desired. In one embodiment, a non-human antibody of the invention is administered to a non-human subject. In another embodiment, the non-human antibody does not elicit an immune response in the non-human subject. In another embodiment, the non-human antibody is from the same species as the non-human subject, \ne.g\n., a mouse antibody of the invention is administered to a mouse. An antibody from a particular species can be made by, for example, immunizing an animal of that species with the desired immunogen (\ne.g\n., a soluble IGF-1R polypeptide) or using an artificial system for generating antibodies of that species (\ne.g\n., a bacterial or phage display-based system for generating antibodies of a particular species), or by converting an antibody from one species into an antibody from another species by replacing, \ne.g\n., the constant region of the antibody with a constant region from the other species, or by replacing one or more amino acid residues of the antibody so that it more closely resembles the sequence of an antibody from the other species. In one embodiment, the antibody is a chimeric antibody comprising amino acid sequences derived from antibodies from two or more different species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. For example, they may be purified from cells that naturally express them (e.g., an antibody can be purified from a hybridoma that produces it), or produced in recombinant expression systems, using any technique known in the art. See, for example, \nMonoclonal Antibodies, Hybridomas: A New Dimension in Biological Analyses, Kennet et al. (eds.), Plenum Press, New York (1980\n); and \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Land (eds.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, (1988\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny expression system known in the art can be used to make the recombinant polypeptides of the invention. In general, host cells are transformed with a recombinant expression vector that comprises DNA encoding a desired polypeptide. Among the host cells that may be employed are prokaryotes, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for example \nE. coli\n or bacilli. Higher eukaryotic cells include insect cells and established cell lines of mammalian origin. Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include the COS-7 line of monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL 1651) (\nGluzman et al., 1981, Cell 23:175\n), L cells, 293 cells, C127 cells, 3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 163), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, BHK (ATCC CRL 10) cell lines, and the CVI/EBNA cell line derived from the African green monkey kidney cell line CVI (ATCC CCL 70) as described by \nMcMahan et al., 1991, EMBO J. 10: 2821\n. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts are described by \nPouwels et al. (Cloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual, Elsevier, New York, 1985\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe transformed cells can be cultured under conditions that promote expression of the polypeptide, and the polypeptide recovered by conventional protein purification procedures. One such purification procedure includes the use of affinity chromatography, \ne.g\n., over a matrix having all or a portion (\ne.g\n., the extracellular domain) of IGF-1R bound thereto. Polypeptides contemplated for use herein include substantially homogeneous recombinant mammalian anti- IGF-1R antibody polypeptides substantially free of contaminating endogenous materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins may be prepared, and screened for desired properties, by any of a number of known techniques. Certain of the techniques involve isolating a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide chain (or portion thereof) of an antigen binding protein of interest (e.g., an anti-IGF-1R antibody), and manipulating the nucleic acid through recombinant DNA technology. The nucleic acid may be fused to another nucleic acid of interest, or altered (\ne.g\n., by mutagenesis or other conventional techniques) to add, delete, or substitute one or more amino acid residues, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides antigen-binding fragments of an anti-IGF-1R antibody of the invention. Such fragments can consist entirely of antibody-derived sequences or can comprise additional sequences. Examples of antigen-binding fragments include Fab, F(ab')2, single chain antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, and domain antibodies. Other examples are provided in \nLunde et al., 2002, Biochem Soc. Trans. 30:500-06\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle chain antibodies may be formed by linking heavy and light chain variable domain (Fv region) fragments via an amino acid bridge (short peptide linker), resulting in a single polypeptide chain. Such single-chain Fvs (scFvs) have been prepared by fusing DNA encoding a peptide linker between DNAs encoding the two variable domain polypeptides (V\nL\n and V\nH\n). The resulting polypeptides can fold back on themselves to form antigen-binding monomers, or they can form multimers (\ne.g\n., dimers, trimers, or tetramers), depending on the length of a flexible linker between the two variable domains (\nKortt et al., 1997, Prot. Eng. 10:423\n; \nKortt et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:95-108\n). By combining different V\nL\n and V\nH\n-comprising polypeptides, one can form multimeric scFvs that bind to different epitopes (\nKriangkum et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:31-40\n). Techniques developed for the production of single chain antibodies include those described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,946,778\n \n; \nBird, 1988, Science 242:423\n; \nHuston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879\n; \nWard et al., 1989, Nature 334:544\n, \nde Graaf et al., 2002, Methods Mol Biol. 178:379-87\n. Single chain antibodies derived from antibodies provided herein include, but are not limited to, scFvs comprising the variable domain combinations L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52) are encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody derivatives) of the invention can comprise any constant region known in the art. The light chain constant region can be, for example, a kappa- or lambda-type light chain constant region, \ne.g\n., a human kappa- or lambda-type light chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region can be, for example, an alpha-, delta-, epsilon-, gamma-, or mu-type heavy chain constant regions, \ne.g\n., a human alpha-, delta-, epsilon-, gamma-, or mu-type heavy chain constant region. In one embodiment, the light or heavy chain constant region is a fragment, derivative, variant, or mutein of a naturally occurring constant region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques are known for deriving an antibody of a different subclass or isotype from an antibody of interest, \ni\n.\ne.,\n subclass switching. Thus, IgG antibodies may be derived from an IgM antibody, for example, and \nvice versa.\n Such techniques allow the preparation of new antibodies that possess the antigen-binding properties of a given antibody (the parent antibody), but also exhibit biological properties associated with an antibody isotype or subclass different from that of the parent antibody. Recombinant DNA techniques may be employed. Cloned DNA encoding particular antibody polypeptides may be employed in such procedures, \ne.g\n., DNA encoding the constant domain of an antibody of the desired isotype. See also \nLantto et al., 2002, Methods Mol. Biol.178:303-16\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an antigen binding protein of the invention comprises the IgG1 heavy chain domain of \nFigure 13\n or a fragment of the IgG1 heavy chain domain of \nFigure 13\n. In another embodiment, an antigen binding protein of the invention comprises the kappa light chain constant chain region of \nFigure 13\n or a fragment of the kappa light chain constant region of \nFigure 13\n. In another embodiment, an antigen binding protein of the invention comprises both the IgG1 heavy chain domain, or a fragment thereof, of \nFigure 13\n and the kappa light chain domain, or a fragment thereof, of \nFigure 13\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the antigen binding proteins of the present invention include those comprising, for example, the variable domain combinations L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52, having a desired isotype (for example, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgM, IgE, and IgD) as well as Fab or F(ab')\n2\n fragments thereof. Moreover, if an IgG4 is desired, it may also be desired to introduce a point mutation (CPSCP -> CPPCP) in the hinge region as described in \nBloom et al., 1997, Protein Science 6:407\n, incorporated by reference herein) to alleviate a tendency to form intra-H chain disulfide bonds that can lead to heterogeneity in the IgG4 antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, techniques for deriving antigen binding proteins having different properties (\ni.e.\n, varying affinities for the antigen to which they bind) are also known. One such technique, referred to as chain shuffling, involves displaying immunoglobulin variable domain gene repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, often referred to as phage display. Chain shuffling has been used to prepare high affinity antibodies to the hapten 2-phenyloxazol-5-one, as described by \nMarks et al., 1992, BioTechnology, 10:779\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, antigen binding proteins of the present invention have a binding affinity (K\na\n) for IGF-1R of at least 10\n6\n, measured as described in the Examples. In other embodiments, the antigen binding proteins exhibit a K\na\n of at least 10\n7\n, at least 10\n8\n, at least 10\n9\n, or at least 10\n10\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that has a low dissociation rate from IGF-1R. In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein has a K\noff\n of 1×10\n-4\n s\n-1\n or lower. In another embodiment, the K\noff\n is 5x10\n-5\n s\n-1\n or lower. In another embodiment, the K\noff\n is substantially the same as an antibody having a combination of light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequences selected from the group of combinations consisting of L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to IGF-1R with substantially the same K\noff\n as an antibody that comprises one or more CDRs from an antibody having a combination of light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequences selected from the group of combinations consisting of L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to IGF-1R with substantially the same K\noff\n as an antibody that comprises one of the amino acid sequences illustrated in \nFigures 2 through 9\n. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to IGF-1R with substantially the same K\noff\n as an antibody that comprises one or more CDRs from an antibody that comprises one of the amino acid sequences illustrated in \nFigures 2 through 9\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that binds to the L2 domain of human IGF-1R. Antigen binding proteins that bind to the L2 domain can be made using any technique known in the art. For example, such antigen binding proteins can be isolated using the full-length IGF-1R polypeptide (e.g., in a membrane-bound preparation), a soluble extracellular domain fragment of IGF-1R (an example of which is provided in Example 1), or a smaller fragment of the IGF-1R extracellular domain comprising or consisting of the L2 domain (examples of which are provided in Example 10). Antigen binding proteins so isolated can be screened to determine their binding specificity using any method known in the art (an example of which is provided in Example 10).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that binds to human IGF-1R expressed on the surface of a cell and, when so bound, inhibits IGF-1R signaling activity in the cell without causing a significant reduction in the amount of IGF-1R on the surface of the cell. Any method for determining or estimating the amount of IGF-1R on the surface and/or in the interior of the cell can be used. In one embodiment, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that binds to the L2 domain of a human IGF-1R expressed on the surface of a cell and, when so bound, inhibits IGF-1R signaling activity in the cell without significantly increasing the rate of internalization of the IGF-1R from the surface of the cell. In other embodiments, binding of the antigen binding protein to the IGF-1R-expressing cell causes less than about 75%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 1%, or 0.1% of the cell-surface IGF-1R to be internalized. In another aspect, binding of the antigen binding protein to the IGF-IR-expressing cell causes a gradual reduction in the amount of IGF-1R on the cell surface such that within a few hours of contacting the cell with the antigen binding protein, little or no decrease in cell surface IGF-1R is detected, but, after several days or weeks of exposure of the cell to the antigen binding protein, a marked decrease in cell surface IGF-1R is detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein having a half-life of at least one day \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo\n (\ne.g.,\n when administered to a human subject). In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein has a half-life of at least three days. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein has a half-life of four days or longer. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein has a half-life of eight days or longer. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein is derivatized or modified such that it has a longer half-life as compared to the underivatized or unmodified antigen binding protein. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein contains one or more point mutations to increase serum half life, such as described in \n \nWO 00/09560, published Feb.24, 2000\n \n, incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides multi-specific antigen binding proteins, for example, bispecific antigen binding protein, \ne.g\n., antigen binding protein that bind to two different epitopes of IGF-1R, or to an epitope of IGF-1R and an epitope of another molecule, via two different antigen binding sites or regions. Moreover, bispecific antigen binding protein as disclosed herein can comprise an IGF-1R binding site from one of the herein-described antibodies and a second IGF-1R binding region from another of the herein-described antibodies, including those described herein by reference to other publications. Alternatively, a bispecific antigen binding protein may comprise an antigen binding site from one of the herein described antibodies and a second antigen binding site from another IGF-1R antibody that is known in the art, or from an antibody that is prepared by known methods or the methods described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous methods of preparing bispecific antibodies are known in the art, and discussed in \n \nUS Patent Application 09/839,632, filed April 20, 2001\n \n (incorporated by reference herein). Such methods include the use of hybrid-hybridomas as described by \nMilstein et al., 1983, Nature 305:537\n, and others (\n \nU.S. Patent 4,474,893\n \n, \n \nU.S. Patent 6,106,833\n \n), and chemical coupling of antibody fragments (\nBrennan et a1.,1985, Science 229:81\n; \nGlennie et al.,1987, J. Immunol. 139:2367\n; \n \nU.S. Patent 6,010,902\n \n). Moreover, bispecific antibodies can be produced via recombinant means, for example by using leucine zipper moieties \n(i.e.,\n from the Fos and Jun proteins, which preferentially form heterodimers; \nKostelny et al., 1992, J. Immnol. 148:1547\n) or other lock and key interactive domain structures as described in \n \nU.S. Patent 5,582,996\n \n. Additional useful techniques include those described in Kortt \net al.,\n 1997, \nsupra;\n \n \nU.S. Patent 5,959,083\n \n; and \n \nU.S. Patent 5,807,706\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the antigen binding protein of the present invention comprises a derivative of an antibody. The derivatized antibody can comprise any molecule or substance that imparts a desired property to the antibody, such as increased half-life in a particular use. The derivatized antibody can comprise, for example, a detectable (or labeling) moiety (\ne.g\n., a radioactive, colorimetric, antigenic or enzymatic molecule, a detecable bead (such as a magnetic or electrodense (\ne.g\n., gold) bead), or a molecule that binds to another molecule (\ne.g\n., biotin or streptavidin)), a therapeutic or diagnostic moiety (\ne.g\n., a radioactive, cytotoxic, or pharmaceutically active moiety), or a molecule that increases the suitability of the antibody for a particular use (\ne.g\n., administration to a subject, such as a human subject, or other \nin vivo\n or \nin vitro\n uses). Examples of molecules that can be used to derivatize an antibody include albumin (\ne.g\n., human serum albumin) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Albumin-linked and PEGylated derivatives of antibodies can be prepared using techniques well known in the art. In one embodiment, the antibody is conjugated or otherwise linked to transthyretin (TTR) or a TTR variant. The TTR or TTR variant can be chemically modified with, for example, a chemical selected from the group consisting of dextran, poly(n-vinyl pyurrolidone), polyethylene glycols, propropylene glycol homopolymers, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols and polyvinyl alcohols. \n \nUS Pat. App. No. 20030195154\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides methods of screening for a molecule that binds to IGF-1R using the antigen binding proteins of the present invention. Any suitable screening technique can be used. In one embodiment, an IGF-1R molecule, or a fragment thereof to which an antigen binding protein of the present invention binds, is contacted with the antigen binding protein of the invention and with another molecule, wherein the other molecule binds to IGF-1R if it reduces the binding of the antigen binding protein to IGF-1R Binding of the antigen binding protein can be detected using any suitable method, \ne.g\n., an ELISA. Detection of binding of the antigen binding protein to IGF-1R can be simplified by detectably labeling the antigen binding protein, as discussed above. In another embodiment, the IGF-1R-binding molecule is further analyzed to determine whether it inhibits IGF-1R, IGF-1, and/or IGF-2-mediated signaling.\n\n\n \n\n\nNucleic acids\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules. The nucleic acids comprise, for example, polynucleotides that encode all or part of an antigen binding protein, for example, one or both chains of an antibody of the invention, or a fragment, derivative, mutein, or variant thereof, polynucleotides sufficient for use as hybridization probes, PCR primers or sequencing primers for identifying, analyzing, mutating or amplifying a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide, anti-sense nucleic acids for inhibiting expression of a polynucleotide, and complementary sequences of the foregoing. The nucleic acids can be any length. They can be, for example, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,500, 3,000, 5,000 or more nucleotides in length, and/or can comprise one or more additional sequences, for example, regulatory sequences, and/or be part of a larger nucleic acid, for example, a vector. The nucleic acids can be single-stranded or double-stranded and can comprise RNA and/or DNA nucleotides, and artificial variants thereof (\ne.g\n., peptide nucleic acids).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids encoding antibody polypeptides (\ne.g\n., heavy or light chain, variable domain only, or full length) may be isolated from B-cells of mice that have been immunized with IGF-1R The nucleic acid may be isolated by conventional procedures such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1\n provides nucleic acid sequences encoding the variable regions of the heavy and light chain variable regions shown in \nFigures 2\n and \n3\n. The skilled artisan will appreciate that, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, each of the polypeptide sequences in \nFigures 2 through 9\n also is encoded by a large number of other nucleic acid sequences. The present invention provides each degenerate nucleotide sequence encoding each antigen binding protein of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides nucleic acids that hybridize to other nucleic acids (\ne.g\n., nucleic acids comprising a nucleotide sequence of \nFigure 1\n) under particular hybridization conditions. Methods for hybridizing nucleic acids are well-known in the art. See, \ne.g\n., \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6.\n As defined herein, a moderately stringent hybridization condition uses a prewashing solution containing 5X sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), hybridization buffer of about 50% formamide, 6X SSC, and a hybridization temperature of 55° C (or other similar hybridization solutions, such as one containing about 50% formamide, with a hybridization temperature of 42° C), and washing conditions of 60° C, in 0.5X SSC, 0.1% SDS. A stringent hybridization condition hybridizes in 6X SSC at 45° C, followed by one or more washes in 0.1X SSC, 0.2% SDS at 68° C. Furthermore, one of skill in the art can manipulate the hybridization and/or washing conditions to increase or decrease the stringency of hybridization such that nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences that are at least 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98 or 99% identical to each other typically remain hybridized to each other. The basic parameters affecting the choice of hybridization conditions and guidance for devising suitable conditions are set forth by, for example, \nSambrook, Fritsch, and Maniatis (1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., \n; and \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1995, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., sections 2.10 and 6.3-6.4\n), and can be readily determined by those having ordinary skill in the art based on, for example, the length and/or base composition of the DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChanges can be introduced by mutation into a nucleic acid, thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide (\ne.g\n., an antigen binding protein) that it encodes. Mutations can be introduced using any technique known in the art. In one embodiment, one or more particular amino acid residues are changed using, for example, a site-directed mutagenesis protocol. In another embodiment, one or more randomly selected residues is changed using, for example, a random mutagenesis protocol. However it is made, a mutant polypeptide can be expressed and screened for a desired property (\ne.g\n., binding to IGF-1R or blocking the binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid without significantly altering the biological activity of a polypeptide that it encodes. For example, one can make nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at non-essential amino acid residues. In one embodiment, a nucleotide sequence provided in \nFigure 1\n, or a desired fragment, variant, or derivative thereof, is mutated such that it encodes an amino acid sequence comprising one or more deletions or substitutions of amino acid residues that are shown in \nFigures 2 through 9\n to be residues where two or more sequences differ. In another embodiment, the mutagenesis inserts an amino acid adjacent to one or more amino acid residues shown in \nFigures 2 through 9\n to be residues where two or more sequences differ. Alternatively, one or more mutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid that selectively change the biological activity (\ne.g\n., binding of IGF-1R, inhibiting IGF-1 and/or IGF-2, \netc.\n) of a polypeptide that it encodes. For example, the mutation can quantitatively or qualitatively change the biological activity. Examples of quantitative changes include increasing, reducing or eliminating the activity. Examples of qualitative changes include changing the antigen specificity of an antigen binding protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides nucleic acid molecules that are suitable for use as primers or hybridization probes for the detection of nucleic acid sequences of the invention. A nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a full-length polypeptide of the invention, for example, a fragment that can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding an active portion (\ne.g\n., an IGF-1R binding portion) of a polypeptide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProbes based on the sequence of a nucleic acid of the invention can be used to detect the nucleic acid or similar nucleic acids, for example, transcripts encoding a polypeptide of the invention. The probe can comprise a label group, \ne.g\n., a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme cofactor. Such probes can be used to identify a cell that expresses the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides vectors comprising a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention or a portion thereof. Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, plasmids, viral vectors, non-episomal mammalian vectors and expression vectors, for example, recombinant expression vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant expression vectors of the invention can comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell. The recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory sequences, selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, which is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Regulatory sequences include those that direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cells (\ne.g\n., SV40 early gene enhancer, Rous sarcoma virus promoter and cytomegalovirus promoter), those that direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells (\ne.g\n., tissue-specific regulatory sequences, see \nVoss et al., 1986, Trends Biochem. Sci. 11:287\n, \nManiatis et al., 1987, Science 236:1237\n, incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), and those that direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in response to particular treatment or condition (\ne.g\n., the metallothionin promoter in mammalian cells and the tet-responsive and/or streptomycin responsive promoter in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems (see \nid\n.). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, \netc\n. The expression vectors of the invention can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce proteins or peptides, including fusion proteins or peptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides host cells into which a recombinant expression vector of the invention has been introduced. A host cell can be any prokaryotic cell (for example, \nE\n. \ncoli\n) or eukaryotic cell (for example, yeast, insect, or mammalian cells (\ne.g\n., CHO cells)). Vector DNA can be introduced into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. For stable transfection of mammalian cells, it is known that, depending upon the expression vector and transfection technique used, only a small fraction of cells may integrate the foreign DNA into their genome. In order to identify and select these integrants, a gene that encodes a selectable marker (\ne.g\n., for resistance to antibiotics) is generally introduced into the host cells along with the gene of interest. Preferred selectable markers include those which confer resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin and methotrexate. Cells stably transfected with the introduced nucleic acid can be identified by drug selection (\ne.g\n., cells that have incorporated the selectable marker gene will survive, while the other cells die), among other methods.\n\n\n \n\n\nIndications\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides methods of treating a subject. The method can, for example, have a generally salubrious effect on the subject, \ne.g\n., it can increase the subject's expected longevity. Alternatively, the method can, for example, treat, prevent, cure, relieve, or ameliorate (\"treat\") a disease, disorder, condition, or illness (\"a condition\"). Among the conditions to be treated in accordance with the present invention are conditions characterized by inappropriate expression or activity of IGF-1, IGF-2, and/or IGF-1R. In some such conditions, the expression or activity level is too high, and the treatment comprises administering an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein. In other such conditions, the expression or activity level is too low, and the treatment comprises administering an IGF-1R agonist as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of a type of condition that can be treated using the methods and compositions of the present invention is a condition that involves cell growth, for example, a cancerous condition. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides compositions and methods for treating a cancerous condition. The cancerous condition can be any cancerous condition that can be treated using the compositions comprised herein, for example, IGF-1R antagonizing antigen binding proteins such as anti-IGF-1R antibodies, antibody fragments, or antibody derivatives. Examples of cancerous conditions include, for example, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Adrenocortical Carcinoma, AIDS-Related Cancers, AIDS-Related Lymphoma, Anal Cancer, Childhood Cerebellar Astrocytoma, Childhood Cerebral Astrocytoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer, Bladder Cancer, Osteosarcoma/Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma Bone Cancer, Brain Tumors (e.g., Brain Stem Glioma, Cerebellar Astrocytoma, Cerebral Astrocytoma/Malignant Glioma, Ependymoma, Medulloblastoma, Supratentorial Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors, Visual Pathway and Hypothalamic Glioma), Breast Cancer, Bronchial Adenomas/Carcinoids, Burkitt's Lymphoma, Carcinoid Tumor, Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumor, Carcinoma of Unknown Primary, Primary Central Nervous System, Cerebellar Astrocytoma, Cerebral Astrocytoma/Malignant Glioma, Cervical Cancer, Childhood Cancers, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders, Colon Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma, Endometrial Cancer, Ependymoma, Esophageal Cancer, Ewing's Family of Tumors, Extracranial Germ Cell Tumor, Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumor, Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer, Intraocular Melanoma Eye Cancer, Retinoblastoma Eye Cancer, Gallbladder Cancer, Gastric (Stomach) Cancer, Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumor, Germ Cell Tumors (e.g., Extracranial, Extragonadal, and Ovarian), Gestational Trophoblastic Tumor, Glioma (e.g., Adult, Childhood Brain Stem, Childhood Cerebral Astrocytoma, Childhood Visual Pathway and Hypothalamic), Hairy Cell Leukemia, Head and Neck Cancer, Hepatocellular (Liver) Cancer, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Hypopharyngeal Cancer, Hypothalamic and Visual Pathway Glioma, Intraocular Melanoma, Islet Cell Carcinoma (Endocrine Pancreas), Kaposi's Sarcoma, Kidney (Renal Cell) Cancer, Laryngeal Cancer, Leukemia (e.g., Acute Lymphoblastic, Acute Myeloid, Chronic Lymphocytic, Chronic Myelogenous, and Hairy Cell), Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer, Liver Cancer, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Small Cell Lung Cancer, Lymphoma (e.g., AIDS-Related, Burkitt's, Cutaneous T-Cell, Hodgkin's, Non-Hodgkin's, and Primary Central Nervous System), Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia, Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone/Osteosarcoma, Medulloblastoma, Melanoma, Intraocular (Eye) Melanoma, Merkel Cell Carcinoma, Mesothelioma, Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndrome, Multiple Myeloma/Plasma Cell Neoplasm, Mycosis Fungoides, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Diseases, Myelogenous Leukemia, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Multiple Myeloma, Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders, Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinus Cancer, Nasopharyngeal Cancer, Neuroblastoma, Oral Cancer, Oropharyngeal Cancer, Osteosarcoma/Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone, Ovarian Cancer, Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Ovarian Germ Cell Tumor, Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumor, Pancreatic Cancer, Islet Cell Pancreatic Cancer, Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer, Parathyroid Cancer, Penile Cancer, Pheochromocytoma, Pineoblastoma, Pituitary Tumor, Plasma Cell Neoplasm/Multiple Myeloma, Pleuropulmonary Blastoma, Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma, Prostate Cancer, Rectal Cancer, Renal Cell (Kidney) Cancer, Renal Pelvis and Ureter Transitional Cell Cancer, Retinoblastoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma, Salivary Gland Cancer, Soft Tissue Sarcoma, Uterine Sarcoma, Sezary Syndrome, non-Melanoma Skin Cancer, Merkel Cell Skin Carcinoma, Small Intestine Cancer, Soft Tissue Sarcoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma, Testicular Cancer, Thymoma, Thymic Carcinoma, Thyroid Cancer, Gestational Trophoblastic Tumor, Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Site, Cancer of Unknown Primary Site, Urethral Cancer, Endometrial Uterine Cancer, Uterine Sarcoma, Vaginal Cancer, Visual Pathway and Hypothalamic Glioma, Vulvar Cancer, Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia, and Wilms' Tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour different groups have studied a total of 425 breast cancers, mostly ductal in origin, and 48 normal tissues or benign specimens by radioimmunoassay (\"RIA\") or immunohistochemistry (\"IHC\") (\nPapa et al., 1993, Cancer Research 53: 3736-40\n, \nHapperfield et al., 1997, Journal of Pathology 183: 412-17\n; \nEllis et al., 1998, Breast Cancer Research & Treatment 52: 175-84\n, \nLee et al., 1998, Breast Cancer Research & Treatment 47: 295-302\n, \nSchnarr et al., 2000, International Journal of Cancer 89: 506-13\n). These studies suggest that elevated IGF-1R expression, on the order of 5-10 fold, is associated with favorable prognosis and biomarkers (ER+ PR+), suggesting that estrogen and IGF cooperate in the maintenance or progression of well differentiated tumor. Similarly, estrogen has been shown to be essential for the growth and survival of the ER+ MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, and in this context IGF-1R is up-regulated by estrogen treatment (reviewed in \nEllis et al., 1998, Breast Cancer Research & Treatment 52: 175-84\n). Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating breast cancer in a subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein. In another embodiment, the method further comprises administering a hormone inhibitor, \ne.g\n., an estrogen inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA retrospective IGF-1R IHC analysis has been reported for a collection of 12 colonic adenomas, 36 primary colorectal adenocarcinomas and 27 corresponding metastases, and 34 adjacent normal tissues (\nHakam et al., 1999, Human Pathology. 30: 1128-33\n). The frequency of moderate to strong IHC staining appeared to dramatically increase with higher stage and tumor grade (0% normal vs. 93 % metastases). The results are consistent with RNA analysis by RNAse protection assay (\"RPA\") (\nFreier et al., 1999, Gut 44: 704-08\n). Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating colon cancer in a subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh plasma IGF-1 and reduced IGFbp3 in men 40-80 years old is associated with increased prostate cancer risk (\nChan et al., 1998, Science 279: 563-6\n). High IGF-1 is associated with a risk of other cancers including breast (\nHankinson et al., 1998, Lancet 351: 1393-96\n), colon (\nMa et al., 1999, Journal of the National Cancer Institute 91: 620-25\n) and lung (\nYu et al., 1999, Journal of the National Cancer Institute 91: 151-56\n). In transgenic mouse models, tumor incidence is increased by IGF-1 overexpression in diverse locations (\nBol et al., 1997, Oncogene 14: 1725-34\n; \nDiGiovanni et al., 2000, Cancer Research 60: 1561-70\n; \nDiGiovanni et al., 2000, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 97: 3455-60\n, \nHadsell et al., 2000, Oncogene 19: 889-98\n). These mouse studies point to a role for both serum and stromal produced IGF-1. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an antagonist of IGF-1R as described herein, wherein the antagonist inhibits the activation of IGF-1R by IGF-1. In another embodiment, the subject has cancer. In another embodiment, the subject has a tumor. In another embodiment, the cancer is prostate, breast, colon or lung cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been observed that bone is the major source of IGF-1 in the body. Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides compositions and methods for inhibiting IGF-1R in a bone of a subject. In one embodiment, an IGF-1R inhibitor of the present invention is administered to a subject that has, or is at risk for developing, a tumor in a bone. The tumor can be, for example, a primary tumor or a metastatic tumor. The treatment optionally further comprises administering to the subject one or more additional therapeutic and/or palliative treatments, for example, an anti-tumor treatment (\ne.g\n., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or anti-hormone therapy) or a treatment that inhibits bone turnover (\ne.g\n., denosumab (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIGF-2 is overexpressed in a variety of tumors and stromal tissues. IGF-2 levels appear especially high (as much as 40 fold) in primary liver cancers (\nCariani et al., 1988, Cancer Research 48: 6844-49\n) and adenocarcinoma of the colon (\nFreier et al., 1999, Gut 44: 704-08\n). Many of the overgrowth disorders are associated with an increased incidence of childhood tumors. Five to ten percent of individuals with either the prenatal growth disorder Beckwith-Weidmann Syndrome (BWS) or hemihyperplasia develop tumors such as nephroblastoma, adrenal carcinoma, and neuroblastoma (reviewed by \nMorison et al., 1998, Molecular Medicine Today 4: 110-05\n). The tumor-predisposing factor in these children appears to be the mosaic loss of maternal IGF-2 gene imprinting, or duplication of the paternal chromosomal arm (11p) that carries IGF-2. Both alterations would increase the level of IGF-2 expression. IGF-2 overexpression as a result of mosaic uniparental disomy or loss of IGF-2 imprinting has also been detected in Wilms tumors. Growth disorders are not observed in these children even though the IGF-2 gene alterations also occur in some normal tissues, perhaps reflecting the tissue distribution of the affected cells. Imprinting of the maternal IGF-2 gene also occurs in mice, and the effects of IGF-2 overexpression are consistent with the human situation (\nCariani et al., 1991, Journal of Hepatology 13: 220-26\n, \nSchirmacher et al., 1992, Cancer Research 52: 2549-56\n; \nHarris et al., 1998, Oncogene 16: 203-09\n). The incidence of tumors and organomegaly increases in mice that transgenically express excess IGF-2 (\nChristofori et al., 1994, Nature 369: 414-18\n, \nWard et al., 1994, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 91:10365-9\n, \nWolf et al., 1994, Endocrinology 135: 1877-86\n, \nBates et al., 1995, British Journal of Cancer 72: 1189-93\n, \nHassan et al., 2000, Cancer Research 60: 1070-76\n). Local IGF-2 overexpression increases the spontaneous appearance of prostate, mammary, intestinal, liver and epidermal tumors. Plasma specific expression using liver promoters elevate hepatocellular carcinomas and lymphoma. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an antagonist of IGF-1R as described herein, wherein the antagonist inhibits the activation of IGF-1R by IGF-2. In another embodiment, the subject has cancer. In another embodiment, the subject has a tumor. In another embodiment, the subject has liver cancer, adenocarcinoma of the colon, Beckwith-Weidmann Syndrome, hemihyperplasia, nephroblastoma, adrenal carcinoma, neuroblastoma, mosaic loss of maternal IGF-2 gene imprinting, duplication of the paternal chromosomal arm (11p), increased IGF-2 expression, a tumor (\ne.g\n., a prostate, mammary, intestinal, liver, epidermal, or Wilms tumor), organomegaly, hepatocellular carcinoma, or lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods of preventing or inhibiting a cancer from spreading to another part of the body, or of treating a cancer that has spread to another part of the body. In one embodiment, the cancer has spread to a regional lymph node. In another embodiment, the cancer is metastatic. The primary tumor can be any kind of tumor, for example, an adenocarcinoma tumor (\ne.g\n., a prostate adenocarcinoma tumor, a breast carcinoma tumor, or a renal cell carcinoma tumor), a non-small cell or small cell lung cancer tumor, a thyroid cancer tumor, \netc\n. The site of the metastatic tumor can be anywhere in the body. It can be, for example, in bone, the lymph system, lung, brain, eye, skin, pancrease, or liver. In one particular embodiment, a subject having a tumor disease is treated with an effective amount of an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention such that the primary tumor is prevented from metastasizing. In another particular embodiment, a subject having a primary tumor is treated with an effective amount of an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention such that the primary tumor is inhibited from metastasizing. In another particular embodiment, a subject having a metastatic tumor is treated with an effective amount of an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention such that growth or spreading of the secondary tumor is inhibited. In another particular embodiment, a subject having a metastatic tumor is treated with an effective amount of an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention such that the secondary tumor is reduced in size. In a more particular embodiment, the primary tumor is an adenocarcinoma tumor, a non-small cell lung tumor, a small cell lung tumor, or a thyroid cancer. In another more particular embodiment, the metastatic tumor is in a bone. In another more particular embodiment, a metastatic tumor is prevented or inhibited from forming in a bone. In another more particularly defined embodiment, the method comprises treating the subject with an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention and one or more other treatments (e.g., a treatment that kills or inhibits the growth of cancer cells, such as radiation, hormonal therapy, or chemotherapy, or a treatment that inhibits the turnover of bone, such as denosumab), non-limiting examples of which are provided herein. The one or more other treatments can include, for example the standard of care for the subject's particular condition and/or palliative care.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being bound to any particular theory, tumor cells appear to depend on the PI3 Kinase/Akt signaling pathway to resist the apoptosis-inducing activity of chemotherapeutics, radiation, and anti-hormone therapy. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides methods of treating a subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to the subject an IGF-1R antagonist of the present invention and a chemotherapeutic, radiation, and/or an anti-hormone therapy. This concept has been validated experimentally in cell culture models and rodent tumor models by antisense and dominant negative mutations (reviewed by \nBaserga et al., 1997, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1332: F105-26\n, \nBaserga, 2000, Oncogene 19: 5574-81\n). In one embodiment, the chemotherapeutic agents is selected from ' the group consisting of mitotic inhibitors, alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, intercalating antibiotics, growth factor inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, enzymes, topoisomerase inhibitors, anti-survival agents, biological response modifiers, anti-hormones, e.g. anti-androgens, and anti-angiogenesis agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of a chemotherapeutic agent that can be administered in combination with an IGF-1 receptor inhibitor of the invention is CPT-11. CPT-11 (Irinotecan hydorchloride trihydrate) is a semi synthetic, water soluble derivative of camptothecin, a plant alkaloid. CPT-11 and an associated metabolite called SN38 inhibit topoisomerase 1 (TOPO1). This enzyme introduces reversible single-strand breaks in DNA that allow unwinding and permit DNA replication to proceed. Inhibition of \nTOPO\n 1 prevents religation of single-strand breaks after DNA replication resulting in greatly increased chromosomal fragmentation. This DNA damage promotes cell death by apoptosis through the action of p53 and other systems that monitor genome integrity. The cytotoxic effect of CPT-11 is generally limited to cells that are replicating DNA (S-Phase). Quiescent cells are largely unaffected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides treating a subject in need thereof with an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist of the present invention and with an effective amount of an apoptosis-inducing agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, an anti-angiogenesis agent, such as an MMP-2 (matrix-metalloproteinase 2) inhibitor, an MMP-9 (matrix-metalloproteinase 9) inhibitor, and/or a COX-II (cyclooxygenase II) inhibitor, is used in conjunction with a compound of the invention. Examples of useful COX-II inhibitors include CELEBREX™ (alecoxib), BEXTRA™ (valdecoxib), and VIOXX™ (rofecoxib). Examples of useful matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors are described in \n \nWO 96/33172 (published Oct. 24, 1996\n \n), \n \nWO 96/27583 (published Mar. 7, 1996\n \n), European Patent Application No.\n \n 97304971.1 (filed Jul. 8, 1997\n \n), European Patent Application No. \n \n99308617.2 (filed Oct. 29, 1999\n \n), \n \nWO 98/07697 (published Feb. 26, 1998\n \n), \n \nWO 98/03516 (published Jan. 29, 1998\n \n), \n \nWO 98/34918 (published Aug. 13, 1998\n \n), \n \nWO 98/34915 (published Aug. 13, 1998\n \n), \n \nWO 98/33768 (published Aug. 6, 1998\n \n), \n \nWO 98/30566 (published Jul. 16, 1998\n \n), European Patent Publication \n \n606,046 (published Jul. 13, 1994\n \n), European Patent Publication \n \n931,788 (published Jul. 28, 1999\n \n), \n \nWO 90/05719 (published May 31, 1990\n \n), \n \nWO 99/52910 (published Oct. 21, 1999\n \n), \n \nWO 99/52889 (published Oct. 21, 1999\n \n), \n \nWO 99/29667 (published Jun. 17, 1999\n \n), PCT International Application No. \n \nPCT/IB98/01113 (filed Jul. 21,1998\n \n), European Patent Application No. \n \n99302232.1 (filed Mar. 25, 1999\n \n), Great Britain patent application number \n \n9912961.1 (filed Jun. 3, 1999\n \n), \n \nU.S. Provisional Application No. 60/148,464 (filed Aug. 12, 1999\n \n), \n \nU.S. Pat.

In one embodiment, the MMP inhibitor is one that does not demonstrate arthralgia. In another embodiment, the MMP inhibitor selectively inhibits MMP-2 and/or MMP-9 relative to other matrix-metalloproteinases (\ni.e\n., MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-4, MMP-5, MMP-6, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-10, MMP-11, MMP-12, and MMP-13). Some specific examples of MMP inhibitors useful in the present invention are AG-3340, RO 32-3555, RS 13-0830, and the compounds recited in the following list: 3-[[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzene- sulfonyl]-(1-hydroxycarbamoyl-cyclopentyl)-amino]-propionic acid; 3-exo-3-[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-8-oxa-bicyclo[3.2.1]0- ctane-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; (2R, 3R) 1-[4-(2-chloro-4-fluoro-ben- zyloxy)-benzenesulfonyl]-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-piperidine-2-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; 4-[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-tetrahydro-py-ran-4-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; 3-[[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfon-yl]-(1-hydroxycarbamoyl-cyclobutyl)-amino]-propionic acid; 4-[4-(4-chloro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-tetrahydro-pyran-4-carboxyl- ic acid hydroxyamide; (R) 3-[4-(4-chloro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-te-trahydro-pyran-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; (2R, 3R) 1-[4-(4-fluoro-2-methyl-benzyloxy)-benzenesulfonyl]-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-piperidine-2-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; 3-[[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenes-ulfonyl]-(1-hydroxycarbamoyl-1-methyl-ethyl)-amino]-propionic acid; 3-[[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonyl]-(4-hydroxycarbamoyl-tetrahydro-pyran-4-yl)-amino]-propionic acid; 3-exo-3-[4-(4-chloro-phenoxy)-benzenesu- 1fonylamino]-8-oxa-icyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; 3-endo-3-[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-8-oxa-icyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; and (R) 3-[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-b- enzenesulfonylamino]-tetrahydro-furan-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, derivatives, and other preparations of the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSporadic mutations that inactivate the PETN gene product occur relatively frequently in most human cancers (\nYamada et al., 2001, J Cell Sci 114:2375-82\n, \nHill et al., 2002, Pharmacol ·Therapeut 93:243-51\n). Loss of PTEN causes the Akt phosphorylated state to persist through loss of the ability to down-regulate stimulatory signals originating from IGF-1R and other sources. The status of the p53 tumor suppressor also influences the activity of the IGF-IR signaling system. In the ground state, the basal or constitutive transcription of IGF-1R is repressed by p53 via an indirect mechanism. Activation of Akt promotes the phosphorylation of mdm2, which then binds the p53 tumor suppressor and promotes its degradation (\nMayo et al., 2002, TIBS 27:462-67\n), resulting in increased IGF-1R expression. A similar outcome is observed when p53 is inactivated by mutation. When transiently expressed in Saos-2 (a human osteosarcoma cell line) and RD (a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line), wild-type p53 is able to suppress the activity of a cotransfected IGF-1R promoter construct, whereas tumor-derived, mutant versions of p53 have no effect. It has been proposed that the increased level of IGF-1R promotes the resistance to apoptosis associated with p53 loss in malignant cells (\nWerner et al., 2000, Cell Mol Life Sci 57:932-42\n). Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a cancerous condition in a subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein, wherein the cancerous condition is characterized by cells that have a reduced expression or activity of p53.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe WT1 (Wilms \nkidney tumor suppressor\n 1 protein) also has been shown to bind and repress the IGF-1R promoter. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a cancerous condition in a subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein wherein the cancerous condition is characterized by a reduced expression or activity of WT1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proliferation of normal fibroblasts has been shown to require, under defined culture conditions, the combined action of IGF and a stromal growth factor (\ne.g\n. PDGF, EGF) to ramp-up Ras/Raf/Map Kinase and promote cell cycle entry (the G0 to G1 transition). Fibroblasts derived from IGF-1R (-/-) mice do not respond to growth factor alone, or most oncogenes (\ne.g\n. oncogenic Ras) that activate the Ras/Raf/Map Kinase pathway. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to the subject an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein and an agent that targets a growth factor and/or a growth factor receptor, such as a growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, \ne.g\n., the EGFR, HER-2, bcr-ab1, VEGFR, Kit, raf, mTOR, CDK1/2, VEGFR2, PKCβ, Mek, and/or KDR. Examples of molecules that target such growth factors and/or receptors include panitumumab (Abgenix, Fremont, CA/Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA), HERCEPTIN™ (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), GLEEVEC™ (Novartis, East Hanover, NJ), IRESSA™ (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE), ERBITUX\n™\n, (ImClone, New York, NY), AVASTIN™, (Genentech), PTK787 (Novartis), SU11248 (Pfizer, New York, NY), TARCEVA™ (OSI Pharmaceuticals, Melville, NY), 43-9006 (Bayer, West Haven, CT), CCI-779 (Wyeth, Madison, NJ), RAD001 (Novartis), BMS-387032 (Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY), IMC-1C11 (ImClone), LY333531 (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN), PD 184352 (Pfizer), 2C4 (Genentech), and GW2016 (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe role of IGF-1R in hematological malignancies has been reviewed by (\nNovak et al., 2003, Isulin-Like Growth Factors and Hematological Malignancies in Insulin-Like Growth Factors, LeRoith et ' al., ed.s, Landes Bioscience\n). A functional role for the IGF-1R in hematopoietic malignancies is demonstrated by, for example, the ability of IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies to block transformed cell growth in culture. IGF-1 has been found to enhance growth of freshly isolated human acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia blasts. With respect to T cell malignancies, IGF-1 has been shown to influence the growth of murine lymphoma cells bearing a pre-T cell phenotype and, immature and mature primary human T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were found to express high numbers of IGF-1R. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides methods of treating a hematological malignancy in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an antagonist of IGF-1R as described herein. In another embodiment, the malignancy is an acute myelogenous leukemia, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or a T cell malignancy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides methods of identifying subjects who are more likely to benefit from treatment using the compositions and/or methods of treatment of the present invention. Such methods can enable a caregiver to better tailor a therapeutic regimen to a particular subject's needs and reduce the likelihood of an ineffective or counterproductive course of treatment. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of determining whether a subject is a candidate for treatment using a composition or method as described herein comprising determining whether a target cell type in the subject expresses IGF-1R, wherein if the target cell type expresses IGF-1R, then the subject is a candidate for treatment. In another embodiment, the method comprises determining the approximate average number of IGF-1R molecules per target cell, wherein 10\n2\n, 10\n3\n, 10\n4\n, 10\n5\n, or 10\n6\n IGF-1R per cell indicates that the subject is a candidate for treatment. The approximate average number of IGF-1R molecules per target cell can be determined using any technique known in the art, for example, by staining a sample comprising cells of the target cell type with an IGF-1R binding molecule, and detecting the amount of IGF-1R binding molecule bound to the sample, where the amount of IGF-1R binding molecule detected is proportional to the average number of IGF-1R molecules in the sample. In another embodiment, the method comprises comparing the approximate average number of IGF-1R molecules per target cell to a reference standard, wherein if the approximate average number of IGF-1R molecules per target cell is greater than the reference standard, then the subject is more likely to benefit from treatment using the compositions and/or methods of treatment of the present invention. In another embodiment, the target cell type is a cancerous cell type. In another embodiment, the target cell type is a colon cancer cell type, a breast cancer cell type, an NSCLC cell type, or a leukemic cell type.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a subject who is a candidate for treatment is identified by detecting IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 in the target cell type, or in the stratum of the target cell type. In another embodiment, the target cell type is a cancerous cell type. In another embodiment, the target cell type is a colon cancer cell type, a breast cancer cell type, an NSCLC cell type, or a leukemic cell type.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a subject who is a candidate for treatment is identified by detecting activity of IGF-1R-mediated signaling in the target cell type, wherein IGF-1R-mediated signaling in the target cell type indicates that the subject is a candidate for treatment. Examples of molecules that can be monitored for IGF-1R-dependent changes are shown in \nFigure 10\n, such as molecules in the PI3/Akt pathway, \ne.g\n., IGF-1R, IRS adapters, Akt, \netc\n. Such molecules can be monitored for, for example, a change in phosphorylation status, \ne.g\n., an increase in phosphorylation. Phosphospecific antibodies that recognize the activated forms of these protein markers are highly developed, and these reagents have proven to be reliable for immunoblot detection in experimental systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions and/or methods of the present invention also can be used, for example, in cosmetic treatments, in veterinary treatments, to increase longevity, to treat reproductive defects, and to treat a variety of growth related disorders.\n\n\n \n\n\nTherapeutic methods and administration of antigen binding proteins\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCertain methods provided herein comprise administering an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein to a subject, thereby reducing an IGF-1-induced biological response that plays a role in a particular condition. In particular embodiments, methods of the invention involve contacting endogenous IGF-1R with an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein, \ne.g\n., via administration to a subject or in an \nex vivo\n procedure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"treatment\" encompasses alleviation or prevention of at least one symptom or other aspect of a disorder, or reduction of disease severity, and the like. An antigen binding protein need not effect a complete cure, or eradicate every symptom or manifestation of a disease, to constitute a viable therapeutic agent. As is recognized in the pertinent field, drugs employed as therapeutic agents may reduce the severity of a given disease state, but need not abolish every manifestation of the disease to be regarded as useful therapeutic agents. Similarly, a prophylactically administered treatment need not be completely effective in preventing the onset of a condition in order to constitute a viable prophylactic agent. Simply reducing the impact of a disease (for example, by reducing the number or severity of its symptoms, or by increasing the effectiveness of another treatment, or by producing another beneficial effect), or reducing the likelihood that the disease will occur or worsen in a subject, is sufficient. One embodiment of the invention is directed to a method comprising administering to a patient an IGF-1R antagonist in an amount and for a time sufficient to induce a sustained improvement over baseline of an indicator that reflects the severity of the particular disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is understood in the pertinent field, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the molecules of the invention are administered to a subject in a manner appropriate to the indication. Pharmaceutical compositions may be administered by any suitable technique, including but not limited to parenterally, topically, or by inhalation. If injected, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered, for example, via intra-articular, intravenous, intramuscular, intralesional, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous routes, by bolus injection, or continuous infusion. Localized administration, \ne.g\n. at a site of disease or injury is contemplated, as are transdermal delivery and sustained release from implants. Delivery by inhalation includes, for example, nasal or oral inhalation, use of a nebulizer, inhalation of the antagonist in aerosol form and the like. Other alternatives include eyedrops; oral preparations including pills, syrups, lozenges or chewing gum; and topical preparations such as lotions, gels, sprays, and ointments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUse of antigen binding proteins in \nex vivo\n procedures also is contemplated. For example, a patient's blood or other bodily fluid may be contacted with an antigen binding protein that binds \nIGF-\n1R \nex vivo\n. The antigen binding protein may be bound to a suitable insoluble matrix or solid support material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdvantageously, antigen binding proteins are administered in the form of a composition comprising one or more additional components such as a physiologically acceptable carrier, excipient or diluent. Optionally, the composition additionally comprises one or more physiologically active agents, for example, a second IGF-1 receptor-inhibiting substance, an anti-angiogenic substance, a chemotherapeutic substance, an analgesic substance, \netc\n., non-exclusive examples of which are provided herein. In various particular embodiments, the composition comprises one, two, three, four, five, or six physiologically active agents in addition to an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprise an antigen binding protein of the invention together with one or more substances selected from the group consisting of a buffer, an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid, a low molecular weight polypeptide (such as those having fewer than 10 amino acids), a protein, an amino acid, a carbohydrate such as glucose, sucrose or dextrins, a chelating agent such as EDTA, glutathione, a stabilizer, and an excipient Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with conspecific serum albumin are examples of appropriate diluents. In accordance with appropriate industry standards, preservatives such as benzyl alcohol may also be added. The composition may be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipient solutions (\ne.g\n., sucrose) as diluents. Suitable components are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. Further examples of components that may be employed in pharmaceutical formulations are presented in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Ed. (1980) and 20th Ed. (2000), Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKits for use by medical practitioners include an IGF-1 receptor-inhibiting substance of the invention and a label or other instructions for use in treating any of the conditions discussed herein. In one embodiment, the kit includes a sterile preparation of one or more IGF-1R binding antigen binding proteins, which may be in the form of a composition as disclosed above, and may be in one or more vials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosages and the frequency of administration may vary according to such factors as the route of administration, the particular antigen binding proteins employed, the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, whether the condition is acute or chronic, and the size and general condition of the subject. Appropriate dosages can be determined by procedures known in the pertinent art, \ne.g\n. in clinical trials that may involve dose escalation studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn IGF-1 receptor inhibiting substance of the invention may be administered, for example, once or more than once, \ne.g\n., at regular intervals over a period of time. In particular embodiments, an antigen binding protein is administered over a period of at least a month or more, \ne.g\n., for one, two, or three months or even indefinitely. For treating chronic conditions, long-term treatment is generally most effective. However, for treating acute conditions, administration for shorter periods, \ne.g\n. from one to six weeks, may be sufficient. In general, the antigen binding protein is administered until the patient manifests a medically relevant degree of improvement over baseline for the chosen indicator or indicators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticular embodiments of the present invention involve administering an antigen binding protein at a dosage of from about 1 ng of antigen binding protein per kg of subject's weight per day (\"1ng/kg/day\") to about 10 mg/kg/day, more preferably from about 500 ng/kg/day to about 5 mg/kg/day, and most preferably from about 5 µg/kg/day to about 2 mg/kg/day, to a subject. In additional embodiments, an antigen binding protein is administered to adults one time per week, two times per week, or three or more times per week, to treat an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 mediated disease, condition or disorder, \ne.g\n., a medical disorder disclosed herein. If injected, the effective amount of antigen binding protein per adult dose may range from 1-20 mg/m\n2\n, and preferably is about 5-12 mg/m\n2\n. Alternatively, a flat dose may be administered; the amount may range from 5-100 mg/dose. One range for a flat dose is about 20-30 mg per dose. In one embodiment of the invention, a flat dose of 25 mg/dose is repeatedly administered by injection. If a route of administration other than injection is used, the dose is appropriately adjusted in accordance with standard medical practices. One example of a therapeutic regimen involves injecting a dose of about 20-30 mg of antigen binding protein to one to three times per week over a period of at least three weeks, though treatment for longer periods may be necessary to induce the desired degree of improvement For pediatric subjects (age 4-17), one exemplary suitable regimen involves the subcutaneous injection of 0.4 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 25 mg of antigen binding protein administered two or three times per week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticular embodiments of the methods provided herein involve subcutaneous injection of from 0.5 mg to 10 mg, preferably from 3 to 5 mg, of an antigen binding protein, once or twice per week. Another embodiment is directed to pulmonary administration (\ne.g\n., by nebulizer) of 3 or more mg of antigen binding protein once a week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of therapeutic regimens provided herein comprise subcutaneous injection of an antigen binding protein once a week, at a dose of 1.5 to 3 mg, to treat a condition in which IGF-1R signaling plays a role. Examples of such conditions are provided herein and include, for example, cancer, acromegaly and other overgrowth disorders, diabetes, obesity, macular degeneration, and aging. Weekly administration of antigen binding protein is continued until a desired result is achieved, \ne.g\n., the subject's symptoms subside. Treatment may resume as needed, or, alternatively, maintenance doses may be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther examples of therapeutic regimens provided herein comprise subcutaneous or intravenous administration of a dose of 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, or 20 milligrams of an IGF-1 R inhibitor of the present invention per kilogram body mass of the subject (mg/kg). The dose can be administered once to the subject, or more than once at a certain interval, for example, once a day, three times a week, twice a week, once a week, three times a month, twice a month, once a month, once every two months, once every three months, once every six months, or once a year. The duration of the treatment, and any changes to the dose and/or frequency of treatment, can be altered or varied during the course of treatment in order to meet the particular needs of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, an antigen binding protein is administered to the subject in an amount and for a time sufficient to induce an improvement, preferably a sustained improvement, in at least one indicator that reflects the severity of the disorder that is being treated. Various indicators that reflect the extent of the subject's illness, disease or condition may be assessed for determining whether the amount and time of the treatment is sufficient. Such indicators include, for example, clinically recognized indicators of disease severity, symptoms, or manifestations of the disorder in question. In one embodiment, an improvement is considered to be sustained if the subject exhibits the improvement on at least two occasions separated by two to four weeks. The degree of improvement generally is determined by a physician, who may make this determination based on signs, symptoms, biopsies, or other test results, and who may also employ questionnaires that are administered to the subject, such as quality-of-life questionnaires developed for a given disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElevated levels of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 are associated with a number of disorders, including, for example, cancer (\ne.g\n., lung, prostate, breast and colon cancers), and acromegaly and other overgrowth disorders (\ne.g\n., constitutionally tall children). Subjects with a given disorder may be screened, to identify those individuals who have elevated IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels, thereby identifying the subjects who may benefit most from treatment with an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein. Thus, treatment methods provided herein optionally comprise a first step of measuring a subject's IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels. An antigen binding protein may be administered to a subject in whom IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels are elevated above normal. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating an overgrowth disorder (\ne.g\n., acromegaly) comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an antigen binding protein of the present invention and pegvisomant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA subject's levels of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 may be monitored before, during and/or after treatment with an antigen binding protein, to detect changes, if any, in their levels. For some disorders, the incidence of elevated IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels may vary according to such factors as the stage of the disease or the particular form of the disease. Known techniques may be employed for measuring IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels, \ne.g\n., in a subject's serum. IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels in blood samples may be measured using any suitable technique, for example, ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticular embodiments of methods and compositions of the invention involve the use of an antigen binding protein and one or more additional IGF-1R antagonists, for example, two or more antigen binding proteins of the invention, or an antigen binding protein of the invention and one or more other IGF-1R antagonists. In further embodiments, antigen binding protein are administered alone or in combination with other agents useful for treating the condition with which the patient is afflicted. Examples of such agents include both proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous drugs. When multiple therapeutics are co-administered, dosages may be adjusted accordingly, as is recognized in the pertinent art. \"Coadministration\" and combination therapy are not limited to simultaneous administration, but also include treatment regimens in which an antigen binding protein is administered at least once during a course of treatment that involves administering at least one other therapeutic agent to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of other agents that may be co-administered with an antigen binding protein are other antigen binding proteins or therapeutic polypeptides that are chosen according to the particular condition to be treated. Alternatively, non-proteinaceous drugs that are useful in treating one of the particular conditions discussed above may be co-administered with an IGF-1R antagonist.\n\n\n \n\n\nCombination therapy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject with an IGF-1R inhibiting antigen binding protein and one or more other treatments. In one embodiment, such a combination therapy achieves synergy or an additive effect by, for example, attacking multiple sites or molecular targets in a tumor. Types of combination therapies that can be used in connection with the present invention include inhibiting or activating (as appropriate) multiple nodes in a single disease-related pathway, multiple pathways in a target cell, and multiple cell types within a target tissue (e.g., within a tumor). For example, an IGF-1R inhibitor of the present invention can be combined with a treatment that inhibits IGF-1, promotes apoptosis, inhibits angiogenesis, or inhibits macrophage. In another embodiment, a targeted agent, that, when used by itself, fails to elicit a therapeutically desired effect, could be used to, for example, sensitize cancer cells or augment treatment effect of other agents. In another embodiment, an IGF-1R inhibitor according to the invention is used in combination with a cytotoxic drug or other targeted agent that induces apoptosis. In another embodiment, an IGF-1R inhibitor is used in combination with one or more agents that inhibit different targets that are involved in cell survival (\ne.g\n., PKB, mTOR), different receptor tyrosine kinases (\ne.g\n., ErbB1, ErbB2, c-Met, c-kit), or different cell types (\ne.g\n., KDR inhibitors, c-fms). In another embodiment, an IGF-1R inhibitor of the invention is added to the existing standard of care for a particular condition. Examples of therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, gemcitabine, taxol, taxotere, and CPT-11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a combination therapy method comprises administering to the subject two, three, four, five, six, or more of the IGF-1R agonists or antagonists described herein. In another embodiment, the method comprises administering to the subject two or more treatments that together inhibit or activate (directly or indirectly) IGF-1R-mediated signal transduction. Examples of such methods include using combinations of two or more IGF-1R inhibiting antigen binding progeins, of an IGF-1R inhibiting antigen binding protein and one or more other IGF-1, IGF-2, and/or IGF-1R agonists or antagonists (\ne.g\n., IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 binding polypeptides, IGF-1R binding polypeptides, IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 derivatives, anti-IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 antibodies, anti-sense nucleic acids against IGF-1, IGF-2, and/or IGF-1R, or other molecules that bind to IGF-1, IGF-2, and/or IGF-1R polypeptides or nucleic acids), or of an IGF-1R inhibiting antigen binding protein and one or more other treatments (\ne.g\n., surgery, ultrasound, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or treatment with another anti-cancer agent), as described, for example, in \n \nUS Pat.

Furthermore, one or more anti-IGF-1R antibodies or antibody derivatives can be used in combination with one or more molecules or other treatments, wherein the other molecule(s) and/or treatment(s) do not directly bind to or affect IGF-1R, IGF-1, or IGF-2, but which combination is effective for treating or preventing a condition, such as cancer or an overgrowth disorder (\ne.g\n., acromegaly). In one embodiment, one or more of the molecule(s) and/or treatment(s) treats or prevents a condition that is caused by one or more of the other molecule(s) or treatment(s) in the course of therapy, \ne.g\n., nausea, fatigue, alopecia, cachexia, insomnia, \netc\n. In every case where a combination of molecules and/or other treatments is used, the individual molecule(s) and/or treatment(s) can be administered in any order, over any length of time, which is effective, \ne.g\n., simultaneously, consecutively, or alternately. In one embodiment, the method of treatment comprises completing a first course of treatment with one molecule or other treatment before beginning a second course of treatment. The length of time between the end of the first course of treatment and beginning of the second course of treatment can be any length of time that allows the total course of therapy to be effective, \ne.g\n., seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or even years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the method comprises administering one or more of the IGF-1R antagonists described herein and one or more other treatments (\ne.g\n., a therapeutic or palliative treatment), for example, anti-cancer treatments (such as surgery, ultrasound, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or treatment with another anti-cancer agent). Where a method comprises administering more than one treatment to a subject, it is to be understood that the order, timing, number, concentration, and volume of the administrations is limited only by the medical requirements and limitations of the treatment, \ni.e\n., two treatments can be administered to the subject, \ne.g\n., simultaneously, consecutively, alternately, or according to any other regimen. Examples of agents that can be administered in combination with the IGF-1R antagonists described herein include, but are not limited to, neutrophil-boosting agents, irinothecan, SN-38, gemcitabine, herstatin, or an IGF-1R-binding herstatin derivative (as described, for example, in \n \nUS Pat. App. No. 05/0272637\n \n), AVASTIN® (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), HERCEPTIN® (Genentech), RITUXAN® (Genentech), ARIMIDEX® (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE), IRESSA® (AstraZeneca), BEXXAR® (Corixa, Seattle, WA), ZEVALIN® (Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA), ERBITUX® (Imclone Systems Inc., New York, NY), GEMZAR® (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN), CAMPTOSAR® (Pfizer, New York, NY), GLEEVEC® (Novartis), SU-11248 (Pfizer), BMS-354825 (Bristol-Myers Squibb), panitumumab (Abgenix, Fremont, CA/Arngen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA), and denosumab (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples, both actual and prophetic, are provided for the purpose of illustrating specific embodiments or features of the instant invention and do not limit its scope.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 1: Preparation of Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example demonstrates a method of preparing antibodies recognizing the IGF-1 receptor. IGF-1 receptor polypeptides may be employed as immunogens in generating monoclonal antibodies by conventional techniques. It is recognized that polypeptides in various forms may be employed as immunogens, \ne.g\n., full length proteins, fragments thereof, fusion proteins thereof such as Fc fusions, cells expressing the recombinant protein on the cell surface, \netc\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo summarize an example of such a procedure, an IGF-1R immunogen emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant is injected subcutaneously into Lewis rats, in amounts ranging from 10-100 µl. Three weeks later, the immunized animals are boosted with additional immunogen emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and boosted every three weeks thereafter. Serum samples are periodically taken by retro-orbital bleeding or tail-tip excision for testing by dot-blot assay, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), or inhibition of binding of \n125\nI-IGF-1 or \n125\nI-IGF-2 to extracts of IGF-1R-expressing cells. Following detection of an appropriate antibody titer, positive animals are given a final intravenous injection of antigen in saline. Three to four days later, the animals are sacrificed, splenocytes harvested, and fused to the murine myeloma cell line AG8653. The resulting hybridoma cell lines are plated in multiple microtiter plates in a HAT selective medium (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine) to inhibit proliferation of non-fused cells, myeloma hybrids, and spleen cell hybrids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHybridoma clones thus generated are screened for reactivity with IGF-1R. Initial screening of hybridoma supernatants utilizes an antibody capture and binding of partially purified \n125\nI-IGF-1 receptor. Hybridomas that are positive in this screening method are tested by a modified antibody capture to detect hybridoma cells lines that are producing blocking antibody. Hybridomas that secrete a monoclonal antibody capable of inhibiting \n125\nI-IGF-1 binding to cells expressing IGF-1R are thus detected. Such hydridomas then are injected into the peritoneal cavities of nude mice to produce ascites containing high concentrations (>1 mg/ml) of anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody. The resulting monoclonal antibodies may be purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel exclusion chromatography, and/or affinity chromatography based on binding of antibody to Protein G.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar methods can be used to generate human antibodies in transgenic mice.

The primers included a Kozak translation initiation sequence (underlined above) preceding the start codon, restriction sites for subsequent subcloning, and a caspace-3 site, which is inserted next to the extracellular domain C-terminus. PCR was performed on a PerkinElmer 2400 (PerkinElmer, Torrance, CA) under the following conditions: 1 cycle at 95° C for 2 min, 23 cycles at 95° C for 30 sec, 58.5° C for 30 sec, and 72° C for 3 min, and 1 cycle at 72° C for 10 min. Final reaction conditions were 1X \npfu\n TURBO® buffer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), 200 µM dNTPs, 2 µM each primer, 5 U \npfu\n TURBO® (Stratagene) and 1 ng template DNA. The PCR product was purified using a Clontech Nucleospin Column (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturers instructions, digested with \nHind\n III and \nSal\n I (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and gel purified. The human IGF-1R insert was ligated into \nHind\n IIII/\nSal\n I digested pDSRα-muIgG1. Integrity of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The sequence of the protein encoded by the resulting open reading frame (IGF-1R-C3-muFc) is shown in \nFigure 10\n.

Twenty-four colonies were selected after 10-14 days on DHFR selection medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1x penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen)) and expression levels evaluated by western blot. To perform this assay, 0.5 ml of serum free medium was added to a single well confluent cells cultured in a 24 well plate (Falcon). The conditioned medium was recovered after 48hr. Samples for western blotting were run in 10% Tris-glycine gel (Novex), and blotted on 0.45 µm Nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen), using the Mini Trans-Blot cell (Biorad). The blotted membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG Fc antibody, conjugated with Horseradish Peroxidase (Pierce). The clone expressing the highest level of IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-muIgG1Fc was expanded in DHFR selection medium and 2 x 10\n7\n cells were inoculated into 50 roller bottles each (Corning) in 250 ml of high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen), 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen), 1x glutamine (Invitrogen), 1x Non essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1x sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Medium was gassed with 10% CO\n2\n/balance air for 5 seconds before capping the roller bottle. Roller bottles were kept at 37° C on roller racks spinning at 0.75 rpm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen cells reached approximately 85-90% confluency (after approximately 5-6 days in culture), growth medium was discarded, cells washed with 100 ml PBS and 200 ml production medium was added (50 % DMEM (Invitrogen)/50 % F12 (Invitrogen), 1x glutamine (Invitrogen), 1x non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1x sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1.5% DMSO (Sigma)). The conditioned medium was harvested and replaced at one week intervals. The resulting 30 liters of conditioned medium were filtered through a 0.45 µm cellulose acetate filter (Coming, Acton, MA).\n\n\n \n\n\nPurification of hu IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-muIgG1Fc\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe resulting filtrate from the conditioned medium was concentrated 20-fold using a spiral-wound cartridge (molecular weight cut-off = 10 kDa), then diluted 1:1 with 3 M KCl, 1M glycine, pH 9.0 to bring the final salt concentration to 1.5 M KCl, 0.5 M glycine, pH 9.0. This sample was applied to a rProtein A-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) which had been equilibrated in 1.5 M KC1, 0.5 M glycine, pH 9.0. The column was washed with 40 column volumes of the same buffer, then eluted with 20 column volumes of 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.8. Five-mL fractions were collected and immediately neutralized with 1 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing huIGF1R(ECD)-C3-muIgGFc were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. The yield was 2.4 mg/L of conditioned medium. The major protein species detected were the mature α and β chains and murine Fc, each of which appeared to be properly glycosylated based on their elevated and heterogeneous molecular weights. Unprocessed IGF-1R(ECD), as well as glycosylated but not proteolytically cleaved IGF-1R(CED), was also present in the preparation. The shift in bands to higher molecular weights under non-reducing conditions indicates that disulfide linkages joined the α and β chains. Amino-terminal sequencing of the final product indicated that 60% of the protein was correctly processed between the α- and β-chains of IGF-1R(ECD), while 40% remained unprocessed.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 3: Isolation of Human INSR(ECD)-muIgG1\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example presents a method of cloning and expressing a soluble fragment of the human insulin receptor.\n\nCloning of pDSRα:huINSR(ECD)-muIgG1Fc\n\nPrimers 2830-40:\n\n \n \n \n5' AGCAGCTTCCACCATGGGCACCGGGGGCCGG 3' SEQ ID NO:259 (\nHind\n III site underlined) and 2830-41:\n \n5' ATTT\nGTCGAC\nTTTTGCAATATTTGACGGGACGTCTAA 3' SEQ ID NO:260\n \n\n(\nSal\n I site underlined) were used to amplify the human INSR extracellular domain (1-929) from and INSR parental plamid encoding the B form of the INSR splice variant (\nUllrich et al., 1985, Nature 313:756-61\n; \nEbina et al., 1985, Cell 40:747-58\n).

The library diversity was 3.7 x 10\n10\n clones, containing 3x10\n9\n heavy chains. The source, screening methods, and characterization of the library have been published (\nde Haard et al, 1999, J Biol Chem 274:18218-30\n). Dynabeads (200 µl) M-450 Uncoated (catalog # 140.02, Dynal, Lake Success, NY) were washed 3 times with PBS, resuspended in 200 µl of IGF1R(ECD)-C3-mFc to a concentration of 0.5 µM in PBS, and incubated at 4° C on a rotator overnight. The IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-mFc coated beads were washed 3x with 1 ml of 2% non-fat dry milk (M) in PBS (2% MPBS), and then blocked with 1 ml of 2% MPBS at room temperature for 1 hour. In parallel, 750 µl of the TQ library (4x10\n12\n pfu) was preblocked by mixing with 250 \nµl\n 8% MPBS at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 500 µl of blocked beads were transferred into another microfuge tube and separated from the blocking solution on a magnetic separator. The preblocked phage mixture was added to the blocked beads and incubated for 90 minutes on a rotator at room temperature. Bead-bound phage were separated from the unbound phage, and then washed 6x with \n1ml\n 2% MPBS/0.1\n% Tween\n 20, 6x with 1ml PBS/0.1\n% Tween\n 20, 2x with PBS with a change of tubes between different wash solutions. Bound phage was eluted with 1 ml of 0.1M TEA (pH11) for 10 minutes, then immediately separated from the beads and neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1 M Tris.HCl. The eluted phage pool was mixed with 4 ml 2x YT broth (10 g yeast extract, 16 g bacto-tryptone, 5 g NaCl per liter of water) and 5 ml of TG1 bacterial culture (O.D.\n590\n about 0.5) in a 50-ml conical tube. The infection mixture was incubate at 37° C in an incubator for 30 min., then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 20 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1500 µl 2xYT-CG broth and 300 µl were spread on each of five 2xYT-CG (2x YT broth containing 100 µg/ml carbenicillin and 2% glucose) plates. After 20 hours of incubation at 30° C, 4 ml of 2x YT-AG were added to each plate and the cells were recovered with cell scraper from the plates. This step was repeated three times. A small portion of the recovered cells was used for phage rescue (see below). The remaining cell suspension was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 20 min. The cell pellet was suspended into an amount of 50% glycerol roughly half the volume of the pellet size and stored at -80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to rescue phage, the plated-amplified cell suspension was used to inoculate 40 ml of 2x YT-CG to an OD\n590\n of about 0.05. The culture was incubated at 37° C on a shaker to OD\n590\n 0.5. The log phase culture was infected with M13K07 helper phage (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, catalog # 18311-019, 1.1 x 10\n11\n pfu/ml) at M.O.I. 20 followed by incubation at 37° C for 30 min. The infected cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 200 ml of 2xYT-CK (100 µg/m1 carbenicillin and 40 µg/ml kanamycin) and transferred to two 250-ml flasks and incubated at 30° C with shaking at 270 rpm for 20 hours. The over-night culture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min to removal cell debris. The centrifugation was repeated to ensure the removal of cell debris. About 1/5 volume of PEG solution (20% PEG 8000, 2.5 M NaCl) was added to the supernatant to precipitate the phage particles. The mixture was incubated on ice for at least 1 hour, followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min to collect the precipitated phage particles. The phage pellet was re-suspended into 1 ml of PBS and transferred to a microfuge tube. The phage suspension was left on ice for 1 hour to allow complete suspension of phage particles, and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min to remove the residual cell debris. Phage precipitation step was repeated. The final phage pellet was suspended into PBS after clarification. The rescued phage suspension was used in the next round of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour rounds of selection were performed that included alterations of various standard binding parameters. The second round of selection was identical to the first round of selection. Variations in input phage number and elution reagent were introduced in rounds three and four. For the round three selection, 5x10\n11\n pfu of phages were selected and bound phages were eluted either with 1 µM IGF-1 (catalog # I3769, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or with a 1 µM concentration of a chimeric αIR3-huFc antibody to yield two round-three pools, TQ4-3IS and TQ4-3CA. Round four selection was carried out on rescued phage pools from both round three pools. Two rounds of negative selection with mouse IgG Fc-coated DYNABEADS® (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) were included to remove mouse Fc binders prior to actual IGF-1R selection. The incubation time for negative selection was 30 minutes each. 3.78x10\n11\n pfu of TQ4-3IS pool and 3.75x10\n12\n pfu of TQ4-3CA pool were selected separately. Bound phage were eluted with 1 µM IGF-2 (catalog # I2526, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to yield two round-4 pools, TQ4-4ISI2 and TQ4-4CAI2. The sequence of about 96-192 phage DNA inserts was determined at each elution step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, a secondary screen was done. Phagemid DNA mixtures of the total TQ library, and the selected phage amplified after several rounds of selection against IGF-1R, were prepared using a DNA Maxiprep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). All four DNA preparations were digested with \nAsc\n I and \nEcoR\n I (New England Biolab, Beverly, MA). The resulting two \nAsc\n I/\nEco\nR I fragments were separated on preparative 0.5% agarose gels. The 2.1 kb fragments containing heavy chains were gel purified from the IGF-1R selected phage. The 3.9 kb fragments containing the light chains and pCES1 vector portion were gel purified from the total TQ library DNA. The 2.1 kb fragments were ligated to the 3.9 kb fragments from the DNA sample of TQ library in 3:1 ratio. The ligated DNA was precipitated and used to transform TG1 cells by electroporation. The library size of the resulted light chain shuffled secondary library was 8.8x10\n8\n. After sequencing 96 randomly picked clones, 76 unique light chain sequences were obtained, indicating that the attempt to shuffle light chains was successful.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding, washing and elution condition for screening the light chain shuffle library were essentially the same as decribed for the initial screen. However, several variations were included to increase selection pressure for amplification of IGF-1R binders with higher affinities, especially those with significantly slower off-rates. These parameters were: higher number of input phage (2-2.7 x10\n13\n pfu), smaller bead volume (100 µl for round one, 50 µl for round two, and 25 µl for round three), and extended specific elution time up to 20 hours. Elution buffers were 0.1 M TEA for round one (RD1), 1 µM IGF-1 in 0.4% MPBS for RD2 and 1 µM IGF-1 or IGF-2 in 0.4% MPBS for RD3. In RD2 and RD3, binders that were eluted in 15 min or 2 hours were discarded. Elution was continued and eluted phages were collected after 8-10 hours and again after 20 hours.\n\n\n \nPhage Fab ELISA Screen\n\n\n \n \n \nIn 96-well 2-ml deep-well blocks, 480 µl/well 2xYT-CG broth was inoculated with 20 µl of overnight cultures of the individual clones, then incubated at 37° C, 300 rpm for 3 hours. To each well, 50 µl of 1:3 diluted M13KO7 helper phage were added to infect the cells. The block was incubated at 37° C without shaking for 30 minutes, and then shaken gently for another 30 minutes at 150 rpm. The block was centrifuged at 3600 rpm for 20 minutes to pellet the infected cells. The cell pellet in each well was suspended into 480 µl of 2xYT-CK (2xYT broth containing 100 µg/ml carbenicillin and 40 µg/ml kanamycin), and incubated at 30° C overnight for about 20 hours. The cell debris was separated by centrifugation at 3600 rpm for 20 minutes. The rescued phage supernatant was used in the phage ELISA to check for IGF-1R-specific, INSR-cross reactive, or mouse Fc binding of individual clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree sets of Nunc MaxiSorb Immunoplates were coated with 100 µl/well of IGF-1R-C3-mFc at 5 µg/ml, INSR-mFc at 5 µg/ml, or mouse IgG1 (catalog # 010-0103, Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) at 2 ltg/ml in PBS, respectively, at 4° C overnight The coated plates were washed 3x with 300 µl/well of PBS. The washed plates were blocked with 300 µl/well 2% MPBS at room temperature for one hour. Meanwhile, rescued phages of individual clones were pre-blocked by mixing 170 µl of rescued phage with 170 µl of 4% MPBS. The blocked plates were washed 5x with 300 µl/well TBST (TBS: 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl; Tween-20. 0.1%). 100 µl/well of pre-blocked phage dilutions were distributed to each set of coated plate, which were incubated at room temperature on a rocker for 90 minutes. The plates were washed 5x with 300 µl/well TBST. 100 µl/well of anti-M13-HRP in 2% MPBS (1:3000 dilution, catalog number 27-9421-01, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were distributed, and plates were incubated at room temperature on rocker for one hour. The plates were washed 5x with 300 µl/well TBST. 100 µl/well of the substrate 1-Step™ ABTS (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, catalog number 37615) were added. Plates were incubated for one hour. OD\n405\n was measured for signal detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phage displayed antibodies exhibited essentially no crossreactivity with the insulin receptor and murine Fc domain. The signal observed in the IGF-1R ELISA is therefore specific for the IGF-1R extracellular domain. Results from similar assays for four of the phage-displayed antibodies are shown in \nFigure 14\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA inserts of IGF-1R positive, INSR and mu IgG1 negative, clones were sequenced. Fifty-two unique Fab sequences were identified, having the following combinations of light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequences: L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20, H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52, wherein \"Lx\" indicates light chain variable domain number \"x\" and \"Hx\" indicates heavy chain variable domain number \"x.\" \nFigure 1\n presents the polynucleotide sequences of each of these light and heavy variable domains. \nFigures 2\n and \n3\n present the corresponding amino acid sequences.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 4: Subcloning of V\nH\n and V\nL\n into IgG1 expression vectors\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example presents a method of subcloning the previously identified variable domain sequences into an IgG1 expression vector.\n\n\n \n\n\nConstruction\n\n\nof pDSRα20 and pDSRα20:hIgG1C\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pDSRα20:hIgG1C\nH\n expression vector (\n \nWO 90/14363\n \n) was a derivative of pDSR19:hIgG1C\nH\n \n(see\n \n \nU.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/370,407, filed April 5, 2002\n \n, \"Human Anti-OPGL Neutralizing Antibodies As Selective OPGL Pathway Inhibitors,\" incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).

All transfections were performed as 250 mL cultures. Briefly, 1.25 x 10\n8\n cells (5.0 x 10\n5\n cells/mL x 250 mL) were centrifuged at 2,500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4° C to remove the conditioned medium. The cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM and centrifuged again at 2,500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4° C. After aspirating the wash solution, the cells were resuspended in growth medium [DMEM/F1 (3:1) + 1x Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium Supplement + 1X Pen Strep Glut + 2mM L-Glutamine + 20 mM HEPES + 0.01% Pluronic F68] in a 500 mL spinner flask culture. The spinner flask culture was maintained on magnetic stir plate at 125 RPM which was placed in a humidified incubator maintained at 37° C and 5% CO\n2\n. The plasmid DNA was incubated with the transfection reagent in a 50 mL conical tube. The DNA-transfection reagent complex was prepared in 5% of the final culture volume in serum-free DMEM. One microgram of plasmid DNA per milliliter of culture was first added to serum-free DMEM, followed by 1 µl X-TremeGene RO-1539/mL culture. The complexes were incubated at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes and then added to the cells in the spinner flask. The transfection/expression was performed for 7 days, after which the conditioned medium was harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 RPM for 60 minutes at 4° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the initial transfection failed to yield the required 100 µg purified antibody, those clones were reexpressed in roller bottles. These transfections used 293T adherent cells grown and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS + 1x Non-Essential Amino Acids + 1x Pen Strep Glut + 1x Sodium Pyruvate. Approximately, 4-5 \nx\n 10\n7\n 293T cells were seeded in a 850 cm\n2\n roller bottles overnight. The previously seeded cells were then transfected the following day using \nFUGENE™\n 6 transfection reagent. The DNA - transfection reagent mixture was prepared in approximately in 6.75 mL serum-free DMEM. 675 \nµl FUGENE™\n 6 transfection reagent was first added, followed by 112.5 µg plasmid DNA. The complex was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The entire mixture was then added to a roller bottle. The roller bottle was infused with a 5% CO\n2\n gas mixture, capped tightly and placed in a 37° C incubator on a roller rack rotating at 0.35 RPM. The transfection was performed for 24 hours after which the medium was replaced with 100 mL DMEM + 1X Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium Supplement + 1X Pen Strep Glu + 1X Non-Essential Amino Acids + 1X Sodium Pyruvate. Typically, 2-3 harvests (100ml) were obtained from each roller bottle at a 48 hr interval. The harvested serum-free conditioned medium was pooled together and centrifuged at 4,000 RPM for 30 minutes at 4°C.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 6: Anti-IGF-1R Antibody Small-scale Purification\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example provides a method of purifying anti-IGF-1R antibodies on a small scale. Conditioned medium was filtered through a 0.45 µm cellulose acetate filter and concentrated approximately 8-fold using a Vivaflow 200 50 K tangential flow membrane (Vivascience, Goettingen, Germany). rProtein A SEPHAROSE™ Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) was washed with phosphate buffered saline (2.7 mM potassium chloride, 138 mM sodium chloride, 1.5 mM potassium phosphate, and 8.1 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) (PBS) four times then directly applied to the concentrated media. The amount of resin used was based on antibody concentration determined by ELISA where 1 µl of resin was used per 5 µg antibody. The medium was incubated overnight at 4° C with gentle agitation. The resin was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min. at 4° C. The supernatant was decanted as the unbound fraction. The resin was washed with PBS four times for one minute at room temperature with gentle agitation, each time collecting the resin by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min. at 4° C. The antibody was eluted by incubating the resin with 1.5 volumes of 0.1 M glycine pH 3.0 for 10 min. at room temperature. The resin was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min. at 4° C and the supernatant decanted as eluted antibody. The elution step described above was repeated for a total of three elutions; each time the eluted material was neutralized with 0.04 volumes of 1.0 M tris-HCl, pH 9.2. The sample was filtered through a 0.2 µm cellulose acetate filter. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) as per the supplied instructions using Human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as a standard. The sample was compared to a Human IgG1, K standard (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) using a 4-20% tris-glycine SDS polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) gel stained with Coomassie brilliant blue dye. No contaminating protein was visible in these preparations.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 7: Isolation of Stable CHO Clones Expressing Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example provides a method for isolating stable CHO cell lines expressing anti-IGF-1R antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStable expression of TQ11C, TQ25, \nTQ\n 58 and TQ59 IgG1 was achieved by co-transfection of AM1-D CHO cells (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,210,924\n \n, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) with pDSRα20 heavy and light chian IgG1 expression constructs. The plasmid transfections were performed using LF2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 4 x 106AM1-D CHO cells were plated 24 hours prior to transfection, in 100 mm diameter FALCON™ plastic petri dishes (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in 10 ml of Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1x penicillin-streptomycin and glutamine (Invitrogen), non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), sodium pyruvate, and HT (0.1 mM sodiumhypoxanthine, 16 nM thymidine; Invitrogen). Approximately 15 mg of each pDSRα21- light chain and heavy chain plasmid DNA were linearized using \nPvu\n I (New England Biolabs) and diluted in 2 ml of OPTI-MEM® (Invitrogen). The diluted plasmids were mixed with 75 µl of LIPOFECTAMINE™ 2000 (LF2000; GIBCO/BRL) diluted in 2 ml of OPTI-MEM® and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The following day fresh growth medium was added. The cells were cultured in complete growth medium for 48 hours, then plated in HT- selection medium in 1:20 and 1:50 dilutions. Approximately 2 weeks after transfection, 12-24 visible colonies were picked into 24-well plates, using the sterile cloning discs (RPI). The clones expressing the highest level of TQ11C, TQ25, TQ58 and TQ59 IgG1 were identified by western immunoblot analysis. To perform this assay, 0.5 ml of serum free medium was added to a single-well confluent cells cultured in a 24 well plate (BD Falcon). The conditioned medium was recovered after 24 hr, and 10 µl of CM was mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer to run a 10% Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide protein gel (Invitrogen). The gel was transferred to a 0.45 µm pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen), and western blot analysis was done using 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-human IgG Fc ImmunoPure antibody (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL) and ECL as detection agent.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 8: Mid-scale Expression of Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example provides a method of expressing anti IGF-1R antibodies expressed by stable CHO cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CHO cell lines made according to Example 7 were expanded to T-175 tissue culture flasks (Falcon) for scale-up expression. A confluent T175 flask (approximately 2 -3 \nx\n 107 cells) was used to seed 3 - 850 cm2 roller bottles (Corning Life Sciences, Acton, MA), and three confluent roller bottles (approximately 1-2 \nx\n 108 cells per roller bottle) were used to seed 30 rollers in 250 ml of high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen), 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen), 1x glutamine (Invitrogen), 1x non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1x sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Medium was infused with 10% CO\n2\n/balance air for 5 seconds before capping the roller bottle. Roller bottles were incubated at 37° C on roller racks spinning at 0.75 rpm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen cells reached approximately 85-90% confluency (approximately 5-6 days in culture), the growth medium was discarded, the cells were washed with 100 ml PBS, and 200 ml production medium was added (50% DMEM (Invitrogen)/ 50% F12 (Invitrogen), 1x glutamine (Invitrogen), 1x non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1x sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1.5% DMSO (Sigma). Conditioned medium was harvested every seven days for a total of four harvests.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConditioned medium was filtered through a 0.45 µm cellulose acetate filter and concentrated approximately 10-fold using a Sartorius Sartocon Slice Disposable 30 K tangential flow membrane (Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany). The concentrated material was applied to a 10 ml rProtein A Sepharose column at 4° C and the flowthrough was collected as the unbound fraction. The column was washed with four column volumes of PBS. The bound sample was eluted with approximately four column volumes of 0.1 M glycine pH 3.0. The eluate peak was collected and neutralized with 0.04 volumes of 1.0 M tris-HCl, pH 9.2. The eluate was dialyzed against 150 volumes of PBS overnight at 4° C. The sample was filtered through a 0.2 µm cellulose acetate filter and protein concentration was measured by determining the absorbance at 280nm using an extinction coefficient of 14,000 M-1. The sample was compared to a Human IgG1, K standard (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) using a 4-20% tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie brilliant blue stain. Endotoxin levels in each antibody prepration was determined using the Pyrotell Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Inc., Falmouth, Ma) as per the supplied instructions.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 9: ORIGEN\n®\n Dose Response Competition Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example provides methods for testing the ability of an antibody to block ligand binding to IGF-1R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn ORIGEN\n®\n binding assay was used to determine whether TQ11C, TQ25, \nTQ\n 58 and TQ59 IgG1 antibodies could block ligand binding to IGF-1R using procedures provided by the manufacturer (Igen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). To label IGF-1 and IGF-2 with ruthenium, lyophilized proteins were dissolved into PBS to give a 1.0 mg/ml solution. Label (ORI-TAG-NHS ester from Igen, Cat # 110034) was added to the protein at a molar ratio of 5:1 (label: protein) from a label stock of 5 mg/ml in DMSO. The mixture was incubated at room temperature (20-22° C) for 1 hr in the dark then treated with 20 µl 2M glycine for 10 min at room temperature. The labeled protein was separated from the free label by application to an Amersham Biosciences NAP-5 column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated in PBS and 0.33 ml fractions collected. The protein concentration of the fractions was determined by Micro BCA Protein Assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL). Fractions two and three contained significant protein and were combined. The amount of incorporated ruthenium label was assessed using the following formula: ruthenium tris-bipyridyl compound (Ru(bpy)\n3\n \n2+\n) labeling of IGF-1 and IGF-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDynal M450 paramagnetic beads coated with sheep anti-mouse IgG was used as the solid support phase for the IGF-1R(BCD)-C3-muFc. The M450 beads were prepared for receptor loading by washing three times with assay buffer containing 1x PBS, 0.05% TWEEN™ 20 (ICI Americas, Inc., Wilmington DE) 0.1% BSA, 0.01% sodium azide. The IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-muFc was bound for 1 hr at a ratio of 50 ng receptor per 1 x 10\n6\n M450 beads in a volume of 25 µl assay buffer. To generate dose response data, the antibodies or unlabeled IGF-1 and IGF-2 factors were added at increasing concentrations (10\n-11\nM to 10\n-6\nM) simultaneously with 1 nM Ru-IGF-1 or 2 nM Ru-IGF-2. The final reaction volume was 100 µl. After incubation at room temperature in the dark for 2 hr, an M8 Analyzer (Igen) was used to remove free ruthenium labeled ligand and determine the amount of ligand bound to receptor. The data were expressed as the percent of total ligand bound minus background remaining after competition with excess unlabeled growth IGF1 or IGF-2. Competition curves were generated with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) using a single component equilibirium model. Essentially all (> 98%) binding was competed with excess unlabeled growth factors. The positive control antibodies in the binding analysis were the murine anti-IGF-1R antibodies αIR3 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) or MAB391 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN), 24-57 (Biocarta, San Diego, CA) and 1H7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The negative control antibody was an anti-CD20 antibody. Ligand competition data are shown in \nFigure 15\n.

The total reaction volume was 100 µl, The INSR binding reactions were identical except they contained 50 ng INSR(ECD)-muFc and 0.64 nM \n125\nI-INS (Amersham). Receptor was loaded onto SPA PVT microspheres for 1h at room temperature prior to assembly of the binding reactions. To generate dose response data, antibodies or unlabeled growth factors were added at increasing concentrations (10\n-11\n M to 10\n-6\nM) simultaneously with \n125\nI-labeled growth factors. Essentially all binding was competed with excess unlabeled growth factors. The receptor-independent background, caused by random y stimulation of the SPT PVT microspheres, was less than 0.5% of the input \n125\nI cpm. The data were expressed as the percent of total ligand bound minus background remaining after competition with excess unlabeled growth IGF1 or IGF-2. Competition curves were generated with GraphPad Prism software using a single component equilibrium model.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 11: Antibody Binding to IGF-1R\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example provides a method of detecting the binding of an anti-IGF-1R antibody to IGF-IR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBIACORE® 2000, sensor chip CM5, surfactant P20, HBS-EP (10mM HEPES, 0.15M NaCl, 3.4mM EDTA, 0.005% P20, pH 7.4), amine coupling kit, 10mM acetate pH 4.5 and 10mM glycine pH 1.5 all were purchased from BIACore, Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 1X, no calcium chloride, no magnesium chloride) was from Gibco. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V, IgG free) was from Sigma. Recombinant Protein G (\"rProtein G\") was from Pierce Biotechnology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmobilization of rProtein G and IGF-1R-C3-muFc to the sensor chip surface was performed according to manufacturer's instructions, using a continuous flow of 10mM HEPES, 0.15M NaCl, 3.4mM EDTA, 0.005% P20, pH 7.4 (HBS-EP buffer). Briefly, carboxyl groups on the sensor chips's surfaces were activated by injecting 60 µl of a mixture containing 0.2 M N-ethyl-N'-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and 0.05 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Specific surfaces were obtained by injecting rProtein A (Pierce) or IGF-1R-C3-mFc diluted in 10mM acetate, pH 4.5 at concentrations between 20 and 50 µg/ml. Excess reactive groups on the surfaces were deactivated by injecting 60 µl of 1 M ethanolamine. Final immobilized levels were 5,000-6,000 resonance units (RU) for the Protein G surfaces, and ~7,800 RU for the IGF-1R-mFc surfaces. A blank, mock-coupled reference surface was also prepared on the IGF-1R-mFc sensor chip.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kinetic analysis of the interaction between IGF-1R-mFc and antibodies was performed as follows. Antibodies as well as a positive control antibody (anti-IR3-CDR-human-mouse chimera) were diluted in PBS + 0.005% P20 + 0.1 mg/ml BSA and injected over the Protein G surfaces to capture the antibodies. IGF-1R-mFc was diluted in PBS + 0.005% P20 + 0.1 mg/ml BSA from 500nM to 3.9nM, and each concentration was injected over the captured antibody surfaces, as well as over a blank Protein G surface for background subtraction. After a 10 minute dissociation, each surface was regenerated by injecting 10mM glycine, pH 1.5. Kinetic analysis of the resulting sensorgrams was performed using BIAEvaluation, v. 3.2 (BIACore, Inc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA solution affinity analysis was done by incubating two different concentrations (0.2nM and 1nM) of antibody with varying concentrations (0.01nM to 50nM) of IGF-1R-mFc in PBS + 0.005% P-20 + 0.1 mg/ml BSA. Incubations were done at room temperature for at least five hours to allow samples to reach equilibrium. Samples were then injected over the immobilized IGF-IR-mFc surface. After the sample injection, the surfaces were regenerated by injecting 25 µl 8mM glycine, pH 1.5. The binding signal obtained is proportional to the free antibody in solution at equilibrium. The dissociation equilibrium constant (K\nD\n) was obtained from nonlinear regression analysis of the competition curves using a dual-curve one-site homogeneous binding model (KinExA software v. 2.3, Sapidyne Instruments Inc., Boise ID).

The IGF-1R subdomains were cloned into the expression vector pCep4avidin-N such that chicken avidin sequence (with endogenous signal sequence) is joined to the N-terminus of the expressed IGF-1R proteins. Expression of each avidin-fusion protein was achieved by transient transfection of human 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) in roller bottles cultures. The cells were grown and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS + 1x Non-Essential Amino Acids + 1x Pen Strep Glut + 1x Sodium Pyruvate. Approximately 4-5 \nx\n 10\n7\n 293-EBNA cells were seeded in 850 cm\n2\n roller bottles overnight. The previously seeded cells were then transfected with pCep4-avidin plasmid DNA the following day using \nFUGENE™\n 6 transfection reagent. The DNA -transfection reagent mixture was prepared in approximately in 6.75 mL serum-free DMEM. 675 \nµl FUGENE™\n 6 transfection reagent was first added, followed by 112.5 µg plasmid DNA. The complex was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The entire mixture was then added to a roller bottle. The roller bottle was gassed with a 5% CO\n2\n gas mixture, capped tightly and placed in a 37° C incubator on a roller rack rotating at 0.35 RPM. The transfection was performed for 24 hours after which the medium was replaced with 100 mL DMEM + 1X Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium Supplement + 1X Pen Strep Glu + 1X Non-Essential Amino Acids + 1X Sodium Pyruvate. Harvest of the condition medium and replacement with fresh medium occurred 48 hr intervals (2-3 cycles). The harvested serum-free conditioned medium was pooled together and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 30 minutes at 4° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of avidin-fusion in each conditioned medium was determined using a quantitative FACS based method. The avidin fusion protein in 200 µl of conditioned medium was captured by incubation for 2 hr at room temperature with 5 µl (- 3.5 x 10\n5\n) of biotin coated polystyrene beads (Spherotech, Inc., Libertyville, IL). The conditioned medium was removed by three cycles of centrifugation and resuspension of the avidin-coated beads in PBS containing 0.5% BSA (BPBS). The avidin-beads were stained with 1 µg/ml of goat FITC-labeled anti-avidin antibody (Vector Lab Burlingame, CA) in 1ml BPBS. After 0.5 hr incubation antibody-beads complexes were collected by centrifugation at 1800 rpm for 5 min and the pellet was washed three times. The FITC fluorescence was detected with a FACSCAN (Beckton Dickson Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The signal was converted to protein mass using a standard curve derived with recombinant avidin. For epitope mapping the biotin-beads were loaded with 50-100 ng avidin-fusion protein per ~3.5 x 10\n5\n beads of beads by incubation with the appropriate amount (1-20 ml) of conditioned medium. The loaded beads were washed extensively and resuspended in 1ml BPBS. For all experiment the biotin-beads were blocked with 10% BSA in PBS prior to loading fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMethod\n 1, One Color Assay:\n Biotin-coated polystyrene beads loaded with IGF-1R (ECD) and IGF-1R subdomain fusion proteins were mixed with 1 µg of anti-IGF-1R antibody in 1 ml of BPBS. After incubation for 1 hr at room temperature, 4 ml washing buffer was added and the antibody-beads complexes were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 750g. The pellet was washed 3 times by resuspension in 4 ml of BPBS. The antibody bound to avidin-bead complexes was detected by treatment with 0.5 µg/ml Phycoerythrin-(PE) labeled goat anti-human F(ab')2 (Southern Biotech Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) in 1 ml BPBS. Tested antibodies were found to bind to the avidin-fusion protein containing the complete IGF-1R ECD and the L2 domain. Binding to L1, CR or FnIII-1 was not detected in this experiment. A relatively weak reaction was also observed with the L1 domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMethod\n 2, Two color assay:\n To simultaneously monitor the amounts of anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody and avidin-fusion bound to biotin-beads, FITG-labeled anti-avidin antibody was included (1 µg/ml) was included in the binding reaction in combination with 0.5 µg/ml PE-labeled goat anti-human IgG1. The beads were prepared for FACSCAN analysis as described for the one color assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMethod\n 3, Antibody Competition:\n To prepare for labeling with fluorescein the antibodies were dialyzed or resuspended at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in PBS (pH 8.5). Label ([6-fluorescein-5- (and-6)-carboxamido] hexanoic acid, succinimidyl ester 5(6)-SFX] mixed isomers from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, Cat. No. F2181) was added to the protein at a molar ratio 9.5:1 (label: protein) from a label stock of 5mg/ml in DMSO. The mixture was incubated at 4° C overnight in the dark. The labeled antibody was separated from the free label by dialysis in PBS. The FITC/ antibody ratios obtained ranged from 3 to 8. For each competition experiment, a binding reaction was assembled that contained a 50 fold excess (10-50 µg/ml) of unlabeled competitor antibody, 3.5 x 10\n5\n biotin beads coated with avidin fusion protein in BPBS. The FITC-labeled antibody (1 µg/ml) was added after a 30 min preincubation. The process followed the one color method from this point forward.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the four tested antibodies binds to the IGF-1R L2 domain, as shown in Table 8.

A Balb/C 3T3 cell line that stably overexpresses the human IGF-1R (- 3 x10\n5\n receptors per cell) was derived using with a retroviral vector essentially as described by \nPietrzkowski et al., 1992, Cell Growth Differentiation 3:199-205\n. MCF-7 breast cancer cells that overproduce huIGF-1R were transfected with a pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen Corp.). Zeocin resistant cells that express a high level of hu IGF-1R (~4 x 10\n5\n receptors per cell) were expanded after selection by FACS using anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody αIR3 and an PE-labeled goat anti murine IgG antibody (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The process of selection and expansion was repeated four times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIGF-1R Receptor antibody staining and receptor expression was monitored by FACS as follows: the cells were released from T175 flasks (Corning) by washing 2 times with excess PBS (Ca/Mg free) followed by treatment with 5 ml of Cell Dissociation Buffer (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed two times by resuspending them in PBS and centrifugation. For primary antibody staining, 1 µg of antibody was added to 10\n6\n cells resuspended in 100 µl PBS plus 0.5% BSA (BPBS) and the cells were incubated at 4°C for 1.5 hr. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with BPBS to remove unbound primary antibody. The cells were resuspended in 100 µl of BPBS and incubated with 1 µg of FTTC-labeled goat anti-human F(ab')2 (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) at 4°C for 30 minutes. After washing to remove unbound FITC secondary antibody, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS+ 0.5% BSA and FITC cell fluorescence was detected with a FACSCAN (Beckton Dickson Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The fluorescence levels were converted to absolute receptor levels using Quantum microbead (Bangs Laboratories, Inc., Fishers, IN) with predetermined IgG1 binding capacity to generate a standard curve. Data reduction was performed with QuickCal v2.1 software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) provided by the manufacturer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peak fluorescent intensity of anti-IGF-1R antibody labeling of the IGF-1R overexpressors was increased 10-20 fold relative to parental Balb/C 3T3 and MCF-7 cells for each of the tested antibodies. This is the result predicted for an antibody that specifically binds IGF-1R. Background fluorescence of cells treated with no antibodies or FITC-labeled secondary alone were insignificant.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 14: Inhibition of IGF-1R\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example presents methods of detecting inhibition of IGF-1R by anti-IGF-1R antibodies.\n\n\n \n32D hu IGF-1R+IRS-1 Cell Inhibition\n\n\n \n \n \nMurine 32D cells that coexpress the human IGF-1R receptor (20K per cell) and human IRS-1 have proven to be a effective system to examine the molecular components IGF-1R signaling \nValentinis et al., 1999, J Biol Chem 274:12423-30\n. Normal 32D cells express relatively low levels of the murine orthologs of these two gene products. 32D cell normally required IL3 for growth and survival. IGF-1 or IGF-2 can replace IL3 in 32D huIGF-1R+IRS-1 cells as shown in \nFigure 16\n, panel A. The EC\n50\n to the IGF-1 dose response curve was about 0.5 nM, whereas the IGF-2 EC\n50\n (2.8 nM) is about six fold higher reflecting weaker affinity of IGF-2 for IGF-1R. To assess the ability of the antibodies TQ11C, TQ25, TQ58, and TQ59 to block IGF-1 or IGF-2 stimulation, 96-well microtitre plates were seeded with 30,000 32D hu IGF-1R+IRS-1 cells per well in a volume of 200 at of RPMI (Gibco/BRL) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco/BRL) and 1x penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine (Giboco/BRL) and increasing concentrations of antibody (10\n-12\nM to 10\n-6\nM) or no antibody. IF-1 (2 nM), IGF-2 (8 nM) or nothing was added after 1 hr preincubation with antibody. \n3\nH-thymidine (1 µCi per well) was added at 27 hr post-antibody addition. The cells were harvested 21 hr later, and incorporation of \n3\nH- thymidine into DNA was determined for each sample. The assays were performed in triplicate. An anti-CD20 antibody was used as a negative control. Each of antibodies TQ11C, TQ25, TQ58, and TQ59 was able to completely block the IGF-1 and IGF-2 mediated stimulation of the 32D cells. The reduction of background proliferation in the absence of added IGF-1 and IGF-2 is due to the inhibition of serum IGF-1 and IGF-2. The binding data were analyzed using GraphPad PRIZM\n™\n software.

This phenomenon is recapitulated with both IGF-1 and IGF-2 in a Balb/C 3T3 cell line hu IGF-1R overexpressor. Both growth factors stimulated \n3\nH-thymidine incorporation by about 20-fold. The EC\n50\n of the IGF-1 dose response curve was about 0.7 nM, whereas the IGF-2 EC\n50\n (4.4 nM) is sevenfold higher, indicating a weaker affinity of IGF-2 for IGF-1R. To assess the ability of a given antibody to block IGF-1 or IGF-2 stimulation, 96-well microtitre plates were seeded with 10,000 cells per well in a volume of 200 µl of DMEM (Gibco/BRL) containing 10% calf serum (Gibco/BRL) and 1x penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine (Giboco/BRL). After overnight incubation when the cells were about 80% confluent the growth medium was replaced with 100 µl DMEM containing 0.1% BSA after washing once with 200 µl PBS. Antibodies at increasing concentrations (10\n-12\n M to 10\n-6\n M), or no antibody, were added at 24 hr post-serum starvation. IGF-1 (2 nM), IGF-2 (8 nM) and \n3\nH-thymindine (1µCi per well) were added after a 1 hr preincubation with antibody. The cells were harvested 24 hr later, and incorporation of \n3\nH- thymidine into DNA was determined for each sample. The assays were performed in triplicate. Each tested antibody was able to completely block the IGF-1 and IGF-2 mediated stimulation of Balb/C 3T3 cells, as shown in \nFigure 17\n. An anti-CD20 antibody was used as a negative control (\"CD20\" in \nFigure 17\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach reference cited herein is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all that it teaches and for all purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the above, it will be appreciated that the invention also encompasses the following items:\n\n \n \n \n1.
