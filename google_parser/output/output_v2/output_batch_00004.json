Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/585,124, filed on Jul. 1, 2004, the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nInterleukin-12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric cytokine (p70) composed of two subunits (p35 and p40), and plays key roles in immune responses by bridging innate resistance and antigen-specific adaptive immunity. Trinchieri (1993) \nImmunol Today \n14: 335. For example, it promotes type 1 T helper cell (Th1) responses and, hence, cell-mediated immunity. Chan et al. (1991) \nJ Exp Med \n173: 869; Seder et al. (1993) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n90: 10188; Manetti et al. (1993) \nJ Exp Med \n177: 1199; and Hsieh et al. (1993) \nScience \n260: 547. Overproduction of IL-12 causes excessive Th1 responses, and may result in inflammatory disorders, such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, or sepsis. See, for example, Gately et al. (1998) \nAnnu Rev Immunol. \n16: 495; and Abbas et al. (1996) \nNature \n383: 787. Thus, inhibiting IL-12 overproduction is an approach to treating the just-mentioned diseases. Trembleau et al. (1995) \nImmunol. Today \n16: 383; and Adorini et al. (1997) \nChem. Immunol. \n68: 175. For example, overproduction of IL-12 and the resultant excessive Th1 type responses can be suppressed by modulating IL-12 production. Therefore, compounds that down-regulates IL-12 production can be used for treating inflammatory diseases. Ma et al. (1998) \nEur Cytokine Netw \n9: 54.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThe invention relates to heterocyclic compounds, compositions including the compounds and methods of using and methods of making thereof.

For example, a “lower alkyl” refers to an alkyl radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and a “lower alkenyl” or “lower alkynyl” refers to an alkenyl or alkynyl radical having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, respectively.\n\n\nNote that unless otherwise depicted, the left atom shown in any substituted group described above is the one closest to the heterocyclic ring. Also note that when n is 2 or greater, the just-described heterocyclic compound may have two or more different C(R\n2\nR\n4\n) moieties, or when there are more than one group having a designation (e.g., R\nc\n-, or R\nd\n-containing substituted groups) in a heterocyclic compound, the moieties (e.g., R\nc\n, R\nd\n) can be the same or different. The same rules apply to other similar situations. Further note that the group (e.g., R\nc\n, R\nd\n) can in some instances be a monovalent or bivalent substituent.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention are defined herein by their chemical structures and/or chemical names. Where a compound is referred to by both a chemical structure and a chemical name, and the chemical structure and chemical name conflict, the chemical structure is determinative of the compound's identity.\n\n\nCombinations of substituents and variables envisioned by this invention are only those that result in the formation of stable compounds. The term “stable”, as used herein, refers to compounds which possess stability sufficient to allow manufacture and which maintains the integrity of the compound for a sufficient period of time to be useful for the purposes detailed herein (e.g., formulation into therapeutic products, intermediates for use in production of therapeutic compounds, isolatable or storable intermediate compounds, treating IL-12 overproduction-related disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). The compounds produced by the methods herein can be incorporated into compositions, including solutions, capsules, cremes, or ointments for administration to a subject (e.g., human, animal). Such compositions (e.g., pharmaceuticals) are useful for providing to the subject desirable health or other physiological benefits that are associated with such compounds.\n\n\nNucleophilic agents are known in the art and are described in the chemical texts and treatises referred to herein. The chemicals used in the aforementioned methods may include, for example, solvents, reagents, catalysts, protecting group and deprotecting group reagents and the like. The methods described above may also additionally include steps, either before or after the steps described specifically herein, to add or remove suitable protecting groups in order to ultimately allow synthesis of the compound of the formulae described herein. The methods delineated herein contemplate converting compounds of one formula to compounds of another formula. The process of converting refers to one or more chemical transformations, which can be performed in situ, or with isolation of intermediate compounds. The transformations can include reacting the starting compounds or intermediates with additional reagents using techniques and protocols known in the art, including those in the references cited herein. Intermediates can be used with or without purification (e.g., filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography). Other embodiments relate to the intermediate compounds delineated herein, and their use in the methods (e.g., treatment, synthesis) delineated herein.\n\n\nSet forth below are exemplary compounds of

and their prodrugs, if applicable. Such salts, for example, can be formed between a positively charged substituent (e.g., amino) on a compound and an anion. Suitable anions include, but are not limited to, chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, citrate, methanesulfonate, trifluoroacetate, and acetate. Likewise, a negatively charged substituent (e.g., carboxylate) on a compound can form a salt with a cation. Suitable cations include, but are not limited to, sodium ion, potassium ion, magnesium ion, calcium ion, and an ammonium cation such as teteramethylammonium ion. Examples of prodrugs include esters and other pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives, which, upon administration to a subject, are capable of providing the heterocyclic compounds described above in vivo (see Goodman and Gilman's, The Pharmacological basis of Therapeutics, 8\nth \ned., McGraw-Hill, Int. Ed. 1992, “Biotransformation of Drugs”).\n\n\nIn addition, some of the heterocyclic compounds of this invention have one or more double bonds, or one or more asymmetric centers. Such compounds can occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, individual diastereomers, diastereomeric mixtures, and cis- or trans- or E- or Z-double isomeric forms. All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. The compounds of this invention may also be represented in multiple tautomeric forms, in such instances, the invention expressly includes all tautomeric forms of the compounds described herein (e.g., alkylation of a ring system may result in alkylation at multiple sites, the invention expressly includes all such reaction products). All such isomeric forms of such compounds are expressly included in the present invention. All crystal forms of the compounds described herein are expressly included in the present invention.\n\n\nFurther, the aforementioned heterocyclic compounds also include their N-oxides. The term “N-oxides” refers to one or more nitrogen atoms, when present in a heterocyclic compound, are in N-oxide form, i.e., N→O.\n\n\nThe compounds described herein can be prepared by methods well known in the art, as well as by the synthetic routes disclosed herein. For example, a pyrimidine compound can be prepared by using 2,4,6-trichloro-pyrimidine as a starting material. The three chloro groups can be displaced by various substitutes. More specifically, a first chloro group (e.g., at position 6) can react with, e.g., morpholine, to form a morpholinyl pyrimidine. 2-Aryl and 2-alkylpyrimidine dichloro compounds can also be prepared by reacting an amidine with a malonic ester followed by treatment with phosphorous oxychloride. A second chloro group can be replaced by reacting with a nucleophile, such as an alcohol in the presence of base, e.g., sodium hydride. In other examples, a compound of formula (I), wherein Y is CH\n2 \ncan be prepared by reacting the pyrimidine chloride with a Grignard reagent, an organotin reagent, an organocopper reagent, an organoboric acid, or an organozinc reagent in the presence of an organopalladium compound as a catalyst. Isomeric forms may be produced. The desired isomeric product can be separated from others by, e.g., high performance liquid chromatography. A third chloro group can undergo a displacement reaction with, e.g., hydrazine, and the primary amine of the coupled hydrazine moiety further reacts with an aldehyde, e.g., indole-3-carboxaldehyde to form a hydrazone linkage. Thus, a pyrimidine compound of this invention is obtained. If preferred, other types of linkages can be prepared by similar reactions. Sensitive moieties on a pyrimidinyl intermediate and a nucleophile can be protected prior to coupling. The chemicals used in the above-described synthetic routes may include, for example, solvents, reagents, catalysts, and protecting group and deprotecting group reagents. The methods described above may also additionally include steps, either before or after the steps described specifically herein, to add or remove suitable protecting groups in order to ultimately allow synthesis of the heterocyclic compounds. In addition, various synthetic steps may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compounds. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing applicable heterocyclic compounds are known in the art and include, for example, those described in R. Larock, \nComprehensive Organic Transformations\n, VCH Publishers (1989); T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis, \n3\nrd \nEd., John Wiley and Sons (1999); L. Fieser and M. Fieser, \nFieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley and Sons (1994); and L. Paquette, ed., \nEncyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley and Sons (1995) and subsequent editions thereof.\n\n\nCorrespondingly, pyridinyl and triazinyl compounds described herein can be made according to methods know in the art, including those in the aforementioned treatises. The pyridinyl and triazinyl compounds can be made using analogous synthetic procedures and reagents as described for the pyrimidinyl compounds. It is recognized by one of ordinary skill that pyrimidines demonstrate reactivity intermediate relative to that of pyridines and triazines, therefore reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, reaction time, etc.) may be adjusted accordingly, which is routine for one of ordinary skill.\n\n\nA heterocyclic compound thus obtained can be further purified by flash column chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, or crystallization.\n\n\nAlso within the scope of this invention is a pharmaceutical composition that contains one or more of the heterocyclic compounds of this invention (including an effective amount of the compound(s)) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Further, the present invention covers a method of administering an effective amount of such a compound to a subject in need of treatment of IL-12 overproduction related diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). “An effective amount” refers to the amount of the compound which is required to confer a therapeutic effect on the treated subject. The interrelationship of dosages for animals and humans (based on milligrams per meter squared of body surface) is described in Freireich et al., (1966) \nCancer Chemother Rep \n50: 219. Body surface area may be approximately determined from height and weight of the patient. See, e.g., Scientific Tables, Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Ardley, N.Y., 1970, 537. An effective amount of the heterocyclic compound of this invention can range from about 0.001 mg/Kg to about 1000 mg/Kg, more preferably 0.01 mg/Kg to about 100 mg/Kg. Effective doses will also vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on the diseases treated, route of administration, excipient usage, and the possibility of co-usage with other therapeutic treatments such as use of other agents.\n\n\nTo practice the method of the present invention, a heterocyclic compound, as a component of a pharmaceutical composition, can be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term “parenteral” as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.\n\n\nA sterile injectable composition, for example, a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension, can be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are mannitol, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium (e.g., synthetic mono- or diglycerides). Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions can also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, or carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents. Other commonly used surfactants such as Tweens or Spans or other similar emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms can also be used for the purposes of formulation.\n\n\nA composition for oral administration can be any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, emulsions and aqueous suspensions, dispersions and solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions or emulsions are administered orally, the active ingredient can be suspended or dissolved in an oily phase combined with emulsifying or suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring, or coloring agents can be added. A nasal aerosol or inhalation composition can be prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and can be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art. A heterocyclic compound of this invention can also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration.\n\n\nThe carrier in the pharmaceutical composition must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the active ingredient of the formulation (and preferably, capable of stabilizing it) and not deleterious to the subject to be treated. For example, solubilizing agents such as cyclodextrins, which form specific, more soluble complexes with the compounds of this invention, or one or more solubilizing agents, can be utilized as pharmaceutical excipients for delivery of the heterocyclic compounds. Examples of other carriers include colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, and D&C Yellow # 10.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “animal”, “subject” and “patient”, include, but are not limited to, a cow, monkey, horse, sheep, pig, chicken, turkey, quail, cat, dog, mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig and human (preferably, a human).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable solvate,” is a solvate formed from the association of one or more solvent molecules to one of the compounds of formula (I). The term solvate includes hydrates (e.g., mono-hydrate, dihydrate, trihydrate, tetrahydrate, and the like).\n\n\nThe biological activities of a heterocyclic compound can be evaluated by a number of cell-based assays. One of such assays can be conducted using cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or human monocytic cell line (THP-1). The cells are stimulated with a combination of human interferon-γ (IFNγ) and lipopolysaccharide or a combination of IFNγ and \nStaphylococcus aureus \nCowan I in the presence of a test compound. The level of inhibition of IL-12 production can be measured by determining the amount of p70 by using a sandwich ELISA assay with anti-human IL-12 antibodies. IC\n50 \nof the test compound can then be determined. Specifically, PBMC or THP-1 cells are incubated with the test compound. Cell viability was assessed using the bioreduction of MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] (Promega, Madison, Wis.).\n\n\nA heterocyclic compound can also be evaluated by animal studies. For example, one of such studies involves the ability of a test compound to treat adjuvant arthritis (i.e., a IL-12 overproduction related disorder) in rats.\n\n\nWithout further elaboration, it is believed that the above description has adequately enabled the present invention. The following specific embodiments are, therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limitative of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever. All of the references and publications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nSynthesis of Compound 1\n\n\n2-Methyl-4,6-dihydroxy pyrimidine (42.0 g.; 333 mmol) was added to phosphoryl chloride (350 mL). The reaction mixture was heated at reflux for three hours. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure until the volume was approximately 100 mL, and the reaction mixture was then poured onto ice (500 mL) and stirred for ten minutes. Dichloromethane (200 mL) was added, and after shaking, the organic layer was dried with sodium sulfate and evaporated to yield crude S1; 2-methyl-4,6-dichloropyrimidine (41.8 g.; 256 mmol).\n\n\nThe crude S1; 2-methyl-4,6-dichloropyrimidine (41.8 g.; 256 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (200 mL) and chilled to −78° C. in an inert atmosphere.

A solution of oxirane dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (40 mL, 41.5M, 60 mmol) was added, and the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature while stirring overnight. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the crude material was dissolved in methylene chloride (200 mL) and washed with saturated ammonium chloride (2×50 mL), dried with sodium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness. The compound was purified by column chromatography to give S3; 3-(4-chloro-6-morpholin-4-yl-pyrimidin-2-yl)-propan-1-ol (6.6 g., 25.6 mmol).\n\n\nS3; 3-(4-Chloro-6-morpholin-4-yl-pyrimidin-2-yl)-propan-1-ol (5.0 g., 19.4 mmol) was dissolved in dioxane (30 mL).

The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the crude solid was dissolved in a mixture of dichloromethane (800 mL) and 10% potassium carbonate (40 mL). The organic layer was isolated, dried with sodium sulfate, and evaporated to yield crude S4; 3-(4-hydrazino-6-morpholin-4-yl-pyrimidin-2-yl)-propan-1-ol (4.3 g., 17 mmol).\n\n\nS4; 3-(4-hydrazino-6-morpholin-4-yl-pyrimidin-2-yl)-propan-1-ol (4.3 g., 17 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (40 mL). To the mixture was added m-tolylaldehyde (2.15 g., 18 mmol) and one drop of glacial acetic acid. The reaction was heated at 50° C. for one hour, and then cooled to room temperature. The precipitate was filtered, washed with ethanol (10 mL) and dried in vacuo to give S5; 3-{4-[N′-(3-methyl-benzylidene)-hydrazino]-6-morpholin-4-yl-pyrimidin-2-yl}-propan-1-ol (5.0 g., 14 mmol) as a white powder.\n\n\nS5; 3-{4-[N′-(3-methyl-benzylidene)-hydrazino]-6-morpholin-4-yl-pyrimidin-2-yl}-propan-1-ol (355 mg, 1 mmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile (4 mL). To the mixture was added m-methoxyphenylisocyanate (149 mg., 1 mmol) and a catalytic amount of dimethylaminopyridine. The reaction was stirred at 60° C. for 16 hours.

\nSerratia marscencens\n) was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.). Human and mouse recombinant IFNγ were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany) and Pharmingen (San Diego, Calif.), respectively.\n\n\nHuman In Vitro Assay. Human PBMC were isolated by centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and prepared in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. PBMC were plated in wells of a 96-well plate at a concentration of 5×10\n5 \ncells/well, and primed by adding IFNγ (30 U/mL) for 22 h and stimulated by adding LPS (1 μg/mL), or by adding IFNγ (100 U/mL) and then stimulated by adding SAC (0.01%). A test pyrimidine compound was dissolved in DMSO, and added to wells of the 96-well plate. The final DMSO concentration was adjusted to 0.25% in all cultures, including the compound-free control. Human THP-1 cells were plated in wells, primed by adding IFNγ (100 U/mL) for 22 h and stimulated by adding SAC (0.025%) in the presence of different concentrations of the pyrimidine compound. Cell-free supernatants were taken 18 h later for measurement of cytokines. Cell viability was assessed using the bioreduction of MTS. Cell survival was estimated by determining the ratio of the absorbance in compound-treated groups versus compound-free control.\n\n\nThe supernatant was assayed for the amount of IL-12p40, IL-12p70, or IL-10 by using a sandwich ELISA with anti-human antibodies, i.e., a Human IL-12 p40 ELISA kit from R&D Systems (Berkeley, Calif.), and a Human IL-12 p70 or IL-10 ELISA kit from Endogen (Cambridge, Mass.). Assays were based on the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nMurine In Vitro Assay. Balb/c mice (Taconic, Germantown, N.Y.) were immunized with \nMycobacterium tuberculosis \nH37Ra (Difco, Detroit, Mich.). The splenocytes were harvested 5 days and prepared in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics in a flat bottom 96-well plate with 1×10\n6 \ncells/well. The splenocytes were then stimulated with a combination of IFNγ (60 ng/mL) and SAC (0.025%) [or LPS (20 μg/mL)] in the presence of a test compound. Cell-free supernatants were taken 24 h later for the measurement of cytokines. The preparation of compound and the assessment of cell viability were carried out as described above. Mouse IL-12 p70, IL-10, IL-1β, and TNFα were measured using ELISA kits from Endogen, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nThe biological activities of pyrimidine compounds were tested on human PBMC or THP-1 cells. Unexpectedly, some of the test compounds have IC\n50 \nvalues as low as <1 nM.

Rats were given a test compound orally once a day for 12 days, starting the day following the induction. The development of polyarthritis was monitored daily by macroscopic inspection and assignment of an arthritis index to each animal, during the critical period (days 10 to 25 post-immunization).\n\n\nThe intensity of polyarthritis was scored according to the following scheme: (a) Grade each paw from 0 to 3 based on erythema, swelling, and deformity of the joints: 0 for no erythema or swelling; 0.5 if swelling is detectable in at least one joint; 1 for mild swelling and erythema; 2 for swelling and erythema of both tarsus and carpus; and 3 for ankylosis and bony deformity. Maximum score for all 4 paws was thus 12. (b) Grade for other parts of the body: for each ear, 0.5 for redness and another 0.5 if knots are present; 1 for connective tissue swelling (saddle nose); and 1 for the presence of knots or kinks in the tail. The highest possible arthritic index was 16.\n\n\nOral administration of pyrimidine compounds of this invention (e.g., Compound 12) reproducibly reduced the arthritic score and delayed the development of polyarthritis in a dose-dependent manner. The arthritis score used in this model was a reflection of the inflammatory state of the structures monitored and the results therefore show the ability of the test compound to provide relief for this aspect of the pathology.\n\n\nTreatment of Crohn's disease in dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced inflammatory bowel syndrome model rats: Wistar derived male or female rats weighing 200±20 g and fasted for 24 hours were used. Distal colitis was induced by intra-colonic instillation of 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS, 25 mg in 0.5 mL ethanol 30%) after which air (2 mL) was gently injected through the cannula to ensure that the solution remained in the colon. A test compound and/or vehicle was administered orally 24 and 2 hours before DNBS instillation and then daily for 5 days. One control group was similarly treated with vehicle alone while the other is treated with vehicle plus DNBS. The animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the final dose of test compound administration and each colon was removed and weighed. Colon-to-body weight ratio was then calculated for each animal according to the formula: Colon (g)/BW×100. The “Net” increase in ratio of Vehicle-control+DNBS group relative to Vehicle-control group was used as a base for comparison with test substance treated groups and expressed as “% Deduction.” Pyrimidine compounds of this invention (e.g., Compound 12) reproducibly had about 30% deduction. A 30% or more reduction in colon-to-body weight ratio, relative to the vehicle treated control group, was considered significant.\n\n\nRats treated with test substance orally showed a marked reduction in the inflammatory response. These experiments were repeated three times and the effects were reproducible.\n\n\nTreatment of Crohn's disease in CD4\n+\n CD45Rb\nhigh \nT cell-reconstituted SCID colitis model mice: Spleen cells were prepared from normal female BALB/c mice. For cell purification, the following anti-mouse antibodies were used to label non-CD4\n+\n T cells: B220 (RA3-6B2), CD11b (M1/70), and CD8α (53-6.72). All antibodies were obtained from BioSource (Camarillo, Calif.). M450 anti-rat IgG-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were used to bind the antibodies and negative selection was accomplished using an MPC-1 magnetic concentrator. The enriched CD4\n+\n cells were then labeled for cell sorting with FITC-conjugated CD45RB (16A, Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.) and PE-conjugated CD4 (CT-CD4, Caltag, Burlingame, Calif.). CD4\n+\n CD45RB\nhigh \ncells were operationally defined as the upper 40% of CD45Rb-staining CD4\n+\n cells and sorted under sterile conditions by flow cytometry. Harvested cells were resuspended at 4×10\n6\n/mL in PBS and injected 100 μL intraperitoneally into female C.B-17 SCID mice. Pyrimidine compounds of this invention (e.g., Compound 12) and/or vehicle was orally administered once a day, 5 days per week, starting the day following the transfer. The transplanted SCID mice were weighed weekly and their clinical condition was monitored.\n\n\nColon tissue samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 μm) collected from ascending, transverse, and descending colon were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The severity of colitis was determined based on histological examination of the distal colon sections, whereby the extent of colonic inflammation was graded on a scale of 0-3 in each of four criteria: crypt elongation, cell infiltration, depletion of goblet cells, and the number of crypt abscesses.\n\n\nLP lymphocytes were isolated from freshly obtained colonic specimens. After removal of payer's patches, the colon was washed in Ca/Mg-free HBSS, cut into 0.5 cm pieces and incubated twice in HBSS containing EDTA (0.75 mM), DTT (1 mM), and antibiotics (amphotericin 2.5 μg/mL, gentamicin 50 μg/mL from Sigma) at 37° C. for 15 min. Next, the tissue was digested further in RPMI containing 0.5 mg/mL collagenase D, 0.01 mg/mL DNase I (Boehringer Manheim), and antibiotics at 37° C. LP cells were then layered on a 40-100% Percoll gradient (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), and lymphocyte-enriched populations were isolated from the cells at the 40-100% interface.\n\n\nTo measure cytokine production, 48-well plates were coated with 10 μg/mL murine anti-CD3ε antibody (145-2C11) in carbonate buffer (PH 9.6) overnight at 4° C. 5×10\n5 \nLP cells were then cultured in 0.5 ml of complete medium in precoated wells in the presence of 1 μg/mL soluble anti-CD28 antibody (37.51). Purified antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen. Culture supernatants were removed after 48 h and assayed for cytokine production. Murine IFNγ was measured using an ELISA kit from Endogen (Cambridge, Mass.), according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nHistological analysis showed that oral administration of pyrimidine compounds of this invention (e.g., Compound 12) reduced colonic inflammation as compared to vehicle control. The suppressive effect was dose-dependent with a substantial reduction at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The calculated colon-to-body weight ratio was consistent with the histological score, showing attenuation by treatment with the test compound. Furthermore, analysis of cytokines from LP cells in response to anti-CD3 antibody and anti-CD28 antibody demonstrated that LP cells from vehicle control produced an augmented level of IFNγ and treatment with test substance greatly diminished the production. These results clearly demonstrated the potential of the test substance in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease represented by Crohn's disease.\n\n\nThe contents of all patents, patent applications, and publications cited throughout this specification are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nAll of the features disclosed in this specification may be combined in any combination.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/793,807, filed Apr. 21, 2006, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAll publications cited herein, including patents and published articles, are hereby incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by progressive impairment in cognitive function and behavior. This progressive, irreversible brain disorder affects millions of lives and imposes a devastating burden on the health care around the world. Over the past two decades, significant progress has been made in deciphering the pathogenesis and developing new therapeutic approaches. The pathological features of AD include neuritic plaques composed of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) fibrils, neurofibrillary tangles of hyper-phosphorylated tau, and neurotransmitter deficits. Recent efforts of managing AD have been focused on the prevention of production, aggregation, and deposition of amyloid-β peptides in the brain and the acceleration of clearance of Aβ from the brain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-invasive detection and quantitation of amyloid deposits in the brain has been used to develop anti-amyloid therapies. Direct imaging of amyloid load in vivo in patients with AD is useful for the early diagnosis of AD and the development and assessment of treatment strategies. To this end, compounds suitable for in vivo imaging of amyloid deposits in human brains have been developed. Among these compounds are monoclonal antibodies against Aβ and peptide fragments, but these have had limited uptake by the brain when tested in patients with AD. Putrescine-gadolinium-Aβ has been injected into transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid, and this has resulted in labeling observed with MRI. Amyloid deposition can also be non-invasively imaged and quantitated with a radiotracer that readily enters the brain and selectively binds to amyloid deposits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe small molecule approach for amyloid imaging has so far been the most successful. Some of the promising compounds that have been used to image amyloid are based on Congo red, thioflavin, stilbene, and FDDNP. The binding of different derivatives of Congo red and thioflavin has been studied in human autopsy brain tissue and in transgenic mice. Two compounds in advanced testing, fluorine-18-labelled-FDDNP (2-(1-{6-[(2-[\n18\nF]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile) and carbon-11-labelled-PIB (6-hydroxy-2-(4′-methylaminophenyl)benzothiazole; Pittsburg compound B), both show more binding in the brains of patients with AD than in those of healthy people.

Med. Chem. \n2004, 47, 2208-2218. After intravenous injection of either radioligand into rodent or monkey there is rapid and high uptake of radioactivity into brain with an SUV (standardized uptake value, % I.D.kg/g) of about 160 followed by biphasic clearance with a fast and a very slow component. These radioligands were rapidly metabolized by processes involving de-alkylation of the tertiary aromatic amino group, culminating in defluoridation and high uptake of radioactivity in bone. Tetra-deuteration of the fluoroethyl group did not lead to a significant reduction in the residual brain radioactivity, but reduced the bone uptake of radioactivity, presumably due to an isotope effect on metabolism. An object of the present invention is to provide radioligands that do not undergo rapid defluoridation and do not produce residual radioactivity in the brain. The invention therefore resides in further analogs of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (IMPY) useful as radioligands for the detection of Aβ amyloid aggregates in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. Preferred among these analogs are imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine N-methylbenzeneamines in which a methyl group or a group similar in size to a methyl group (such as a bromine atom) is bonded to the ortho ring position nearest to the amine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective management of Alzheimer's disease requires tools to diagnose, monitor, treat and prevent the disease. An object of the present invention is therefore to provide amyloid imaging agents with high specificity of binding to beta amyloid, low background noise, better entry into brains, and improved labeling efficiencies.\n\n\n \nTHE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo novel classes of amyloid imaging agents are disclosed herein.

Analytical HPLC was performed using a reverse phase column (X-Tera C18; 5 μm; 10.0×250 mm; Waters) eluted with c. ammonia (0.25%) in acetonitrile-water at 6.2 mL/min. The chromatography system was fitted with a continuous wavelength UV-vis detector (Beckman System Gold 168 Detector) and an autosampler (Beckman System Gold 508 Autosampler). For semi-preparative Beckman HPLC, a reverse phase column (X-Tera C18; 5 μm; 19×250 mm; Waters) was eluted at 20.0 mL/min. The HPLC system was fitted with a manual injector (5 mL injection loop) and a third delivery pump using acetonitrile as eluant at 1 mL/min. The purity of compounds was determined with HPLC monitored for UV absorbance at 280 nm (for IMPY derivatives) or 254 nm (for other aromatic compounds) and expressed as area percentage of all peaks. The \n1\nH and \n13\nC NMR spectra of all compounds were acquired on a Jeol GSX 270 (270 MHz \n1\nH and 68 MHz \n13\nC), on a Bruker DRX 300 (300 MHz \n1\nH and 75 MHz \n13\nC), on a Bruker DRX 400 (400 MHz \n1\nH and 100 MHz \n13\nC) and on a Bruker AM500 (500 MHz \n1\nH and 125 MHz \n13\nC), using the chemical shifts of residual deuterated solvent as the internal standard; chemical shift (δ) data for the proton and carbon resonance were reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to the internal standard.

After assembly, the tubes were vortexed, and incubated for 3 hrs at room temperature. After separation using a cell harvester, the filter paper (GF/B filter paper pretreated with 0.5% polyimine solution) was washed with 10% ethanol in PBS (3×3 mL).

The nucleus of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines is made through the condensation between a 2-amino pyridine and an α-haloketone in a manner described before.\n2 \nThe reaction tolerates a variety of substituents, including amide and imine groups in both substrates. Two strategies have been developed to synthesize the α-bromoketones (\nFIG. 1\n). One is from bromination of ketones. Mono-methylation of the amino group of 1-(4-aminophenyl)ethanone follows the method established, to give 1-(4-methylaminophenyl)ethanone, K1.\n2 \nOrtho-bromination of the aromatic amine was accomplished using NBS, a mild bromination agent for activated phenyl group, to give K2 and K3.\n3 \nThe amino group was protected using either trifluoroacetyl or acetyl group to give K5 and K6 before bromination of the α-methyl ketone. Three bromination procedures have been reported.\n4 \nOne is through tetra-n-butyl ammonium tribromide, the second is through copper (II) bromide, and the third is through the reduction of di-bromides, to afford α-bromoketones B2, B3, B4, B5. The other method to synthesize the α-bromoketones is through Friedel-Crafts reaction to introduce α-bromoacetyl group directly in the aromatic nucleus. The aromatic amino group in A1 and A2 were protected using trifluoroacetyl or acetyl group, to give A3 and A4. Friedel-Crafts reactions using trifluoroacetyl or bromoacetyl bromide catalyzed by AlCl\n3 \nin CS\n2 \nwent smoothly to give B2, B3, B4, B5.\n5-7 \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of 2-Aminopyridines and 2-Aminopyrazines. The synthetic methods of pyridine derivatives depend on the substituents on the ring (\nFIG. 2\n). For CN group, halide substitution using CuCN is an optimal choice, such as the synthesis of P3\n8-10 \nand P4 (available from Acros). Some halo group could be introduced through electrophilic substitution of either bromination or iodination, such as the synthesis of P10, P11 and P12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution of halide by OCH\n3 \nand SEt group is more challenging. The first attempts to prepare P5 by a nucleophilic aromatic displacement of the bromide with a methoxy group catalyzed by Cu powder in a conventional way\n11 \nor with microwave heating or an ultrasound bath were frustrated by the apparent unreactivity of the substrate. An attempt was carried out with an ultrasound high power probe (Branson 450 Sonifier) beaming the 40 dB sound waves directly in the solution, but even this technology did not enable the expected transformation (eq 1).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother literature procedure to perform aromatic substitutions with the methoxy anion was followed.\n12 \nThe method uses salts of copper (I) and a small amount of ester to form a stabilized tetrahedral adduct which should act as a powerful methoxide donor (\nFIG. 3\n). Unfortunately, due to the presence of the free amino group on the bromopyridine and the ethyl acetate as co-catalyst, the reaction product was just the acetamide of the substrate (eq 2).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAttempts to improve the result were made by increasing the equivalents of catalyst used. It was believed that copper could be coordinated and thus inactivated by the nitrogen atoms of the substrate. By this means the expected product was achieved in 36% yield (eq 3). The reaction mixture, after being heated for 14 hrs, still contained a significant amount of starting material together with black polymers. The reaction was quenched to avoid further formation of polymers and degradation of the formed product. In order to decrease the reaction time, the transformation in \neq\n 3 was carried out with microwave irradiation according to Table 3.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrowave reaction of \neq\n 3 at 140° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\neq3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRatio of Substitution:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime (h)\n\n\nSolvent\n\n\nStarting Recovered\n\n\nReduction:Polymer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0\n\n\nMeOH\n\n\nNothing\n\n\nsmall:small:large\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nDME\n\n\n70%\n\n\n0:0:0:large\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nDMF\n\n\nTrace\n\n\n17%:0:large\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome modifications to this method were tried to increase the yield. 5-Iodo-2-aminopyridine was used in the hope that the weaker C—I bond could help to increase the rate of the displacement. The consumption of aromatic iodide was faster (6 h) but unfortunately only polymers formed. Decreasing the reaction temperature did not help (eq 4).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA different strategy was designed using 5-pyridyl boronate and subsequently oxidized to P5 in the presence of NaOCH\n3\n. After a first attempt to prepare the boronate P6 in DMSO\n13 \nwith conventional heating failed, the same coupling was tried with microwave heating using DME as the solvent.\n14 \nThis procedure gave the desired boronate in 20 min instead of 20 h, but only in 10% yield due to problems found in the work-up (eq 5).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe free amino group was protected to avoid undesirable coordination of the Pd catalyst and simplify the reaction work-up. In addition, 5-iodo-2-aminopyridine was used to facilitate the Pd insertion in the C-halogen bond. Therefore P1 was protected with trifluoroacetic anhydride to give trifluoroacetamide P7 in 77% yield. This was reacted with pinacolborane in dioxane at 80° C. for 3 h to give the protected pyridyl boronate P8 in 67% yield (eq 6).\n15 \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOxidation Studies did not generate any desired product. The route was discontinued.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution of halide by SEt group was similar to that of OCH\n3 \ngroup when using copper as catalysts. Although syntheses of P9\n16;17 \nhave been reported, the reported methods made use of copper as catalyst and methanol as solvent at 150° C. under pressure.\n18 \nDue to the inconvenience of the procedure, other solvents were evaluated to replace the low boiling point methanol. Ethylene glycol proved to be an excellent choice in this reaction, giving high yield in a short reaction time. The benefits of ethylene glycol as solvent in other copper or copper(I)-catalyzed reaction have been noted.\n19 \nEthylene glycol was found to be the ligand and solvent when CuI was used as catalyst, to give the aromatic thio-ether, 2-amino-5-ethylthio-pyridine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis of 5-chloro-2-aminopyrazine described in the literature is not a very efficient multi-step process.\n20 \nDirect chlorination of the 2-aminopyrazine using N-chlorosuccinimide was used, although the method is known to give overchlorinated by-products. Initial attempt showed that the reaction gave a lot of black polymers after a few min., with the main product being 3,5-dichloro-2-amino pyrazine. Only small amount of 5-chloro-2-aminopyrazine was isolated (eq 7). This reaction could not be scaled up because it was not reproducible. To avoid over chlorination, milder conditions were examined. No reaction was observed at RT, but a complete transformation into the dichloro derivative was observed at 50° C.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the distilled chloroform used for the reaction was pre-treated over basic Al\n2\nO\n3\n, the black polymers formed in the reaction decreased dramatically. When NCS was added slowly into the refluxing 2-aminopyrazine, the product was isolated at 26%. Moreover, when microwave irradiation was used at 70° C. for 10 min., the yield reached 45% (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of IMPY Derivatives I. Most of the IMPY derivatives were synthesized through the direct condensation of α-bromoketones and 2-amino-pyridines (FIG. \n5\n).\n2 \nIn selected examples, when trifluoroacetyl group was used to protect aromatic amino group, no base was needed for the condensation. The difficulty facing the synthesis of L22 came from separation. When excess amine was used, the product could not be separated from the starting amine. When excess α-bromoketone was used, a persistent amount of the starting pyrimidine existed. A small amount of DMF was added in the reaction mixture to dissolve the amine completely, and to induce the precipitation of the product at the same time. By filtering this solution hot, even before reaction complete, we were able to isolate the desired imidazopyrimidine L22 in 23% yields (eq 8).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImidazopyrazine L21 was synthesized from condensation of chloropyrazine P13 and bromoacetophenone B1 (eq 9). The amine 67 was very unreactive though it is very soluble in acetonitrile. Long reaction time and stronger bases such as triethylamine were examined with limited success.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis of L12 was through demethylation of the methoxy group in L9. The most effective reagent to perform the reaction is BBr\n3 \nin DCM (eq 10).\n21 \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe trifluoroacetyl group on the aromatic amino group in L15, L16, and L17, was easily removed under mild condition of K\n2\nCO\n3 \nin methanol or ethanol (\nFIG. 4\n). This provides an excellent method for the synthesis of IMPY derivatives with amino group(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of IMPY Derivatives II. For L9, we also attempted direct methoxylation of halide in pre-formed IMPY derivatives. Unfortunately the reaction produced a low yield mixture of reduced (L11), cine (L10) and ipso (L9) substituted analogues which were difficult to separate (\nFIG. 6\n). Catalytic substitution of halides by thiolate based on palladium-catalysts was developed to overcome the reduction of the halide (FIG. \n7\n).\n22 \nThe new method has been applied to the synthesis of a number of IMPY derivatives with thiolate group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn advantage of the IMPY derivatives of the present invention relative to the prior art compound [\n11\nC]PIB (6-OH-BTA-1) is that the derivatives of the present invention can be easily labeled with [\n18\nF], which has a half-life of about two hours as compared with twenty minutes for [\n11\nC]. A process for radiolabeling the IMPY derivatives with either label is shown below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsolation of Human Amyloid\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for isolating human β-amyloid plaques from brain tissue\n23;24 \nwas modified by incorporating repeated homogenization and centrifugation in 1% SDS buffer and by using DNase and collagenase for digestion. The concentration of β-amyloid plaques was gauged from the concentration of Aβ\n1-40 \nand Aβ\n1-42 \nmonomers, using ELISA to detect dissolved plaques in formic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Vitro Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of the binding affinities of new ligands for β-amyloid is the first step in selecting candidate radioligands for PET studies in humans. Three types of amyloid plaques have been used to assay ligand binding in vitro, namely synthetic aggregates of Aβ\n1-40\n, Aβ\n1-42\n, amyloid plaques from transgenic mice and amyloid plaques from human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue. Results from the three types and also from different batches of synthetic amyloid plaques vary with respect to binding site concentration.\n25 \nThese findings may reflect variations in binding site architecture, though no significant difference in ligand binding affinity has been detected among the three types of amyloid plaques for the binding site typical of 6-OH-BTA-1.\n26 \nSince the ultimate test for a radioligand is successful application in humans, in vitro evaluation using human AD brain tissue is highly appropriate. However, it should be noted that other proteins with similar binding sites might interfere with the binding of the ligand to β-amyloid plaques. This may then be reflected in a lower percentage of displaceable radioactivity in the binding assay.\n27 \nThe use of isolated human amyloid plaques may also help to identify other native binding sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsolated plaques were used in developing an in vitro binding assay. Tritiated 6-OH-BTA-1 was selected as the reference radioligand based on its use in human PET imaging and high affinity.\n28 \nDisplacement curves were created using non-radioactive 6-OH-BTA-1 and other novel ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe displacement of [\n3\nH]6-OH-BTA-1 by non-radioactive 6-OH-BTA-1 or other ligands resulted in classical displacement curves. Some lipophilic ligands required ethanol in the medium to increase their solubility and to effect displacement of reference radioligand. Non-radioactive 6-OH-BTA-1 achieved >95% displacement of reference radioligand, indicating that the presence of competing binding sites for the isolated amyloid plaques was negligible. This assay could therefore be used to screen compounds for amyloid binding without interference from other proteins, such as tau-tangles. This displacement curve was also analyzed using a homologous displacement mathematical model to extract the B\nmax \nof the amyloid plaques. The measured B\nmax \nis linear with the amount of amyloid used in the experiment. The ratio between B\nmax \nand the amount of Aβ\n1-42 \nmonomer measured by ELISA is about 1:2, somewhat less than that reported previously.\n25 \nThe denaturing agents used to aid dissolution of the amyloid plaques may account for the observed difference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinities for a variety of IMPY derivatives are listed in Table 3. In this table, Ki is a measure (in nM units) of the binding affinity of the compound toward beta-amyloid plaques in AD brain tissue, measured through a competitive radioligand displacement in vitro assay using [\n3\nH]6-OH-BTA-1 as the reference radioligand. The lipophilicity of the compound is represented by cLogD\n7.4 \nwhich is calculated through a software package (ACD/LogD version 8.0) at pH=7.4, a close mimic of physiological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPY derivatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLigand\n\n\n \n\n\nR\n1\n \n\n\nR\n2\n \n\n\nR\n3\n \n\n\nR\n4\n \n\n\nR\n5\n \n\n\ncLogD\n7.4\n \n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nL1\n\n\n \n\n\nI\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n4.37 ± 0.88\n\n\n8.9 ± 0.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(IMPY)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nL4\n\n\n \n\n\nBr\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n4.11 ± 0.88\n\n\n5.9 ± 0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL5\n\n\n \n\n\nCl\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n3.93 ± 0.84\n\n\n24.2 ± 5.6 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nL6\n\n\n \n\n\nF\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n3.38 ± 0.88\n\n\n13.0 ± 1.6 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nL7\n\n\n \n\n\nNO\n2\n \n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n3.09 ± 1.30\n\n\n7.6 ± 0.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL8\n\n\n \n\n\nCN\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n2.80 ± 1.31\n\n\n8.2 ± 1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL9\n\n\n \n\n\nOMe\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n3.05 ± 1.30\n\n\n38.5 ± 5.0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nL12\n\n\n \n\n\nOH\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n1.26 ± 1.29\n\n\n177 ± 31 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nT7\n\n\n \n\n\nSEt\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n4.24 ± 1.31\n\n\n8.3 ± 0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL13\n\n\n \n\n\nBr\n\n\nI\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n5.17 ± 0.93\n\n\n183 ± 61 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nL14\n\n\n \n\n\nBr\n\n\nCN\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n3.28 ± 1.35\n\n\n>180 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nL18\n\n\n \n\n\nBr\n\n\nH\n\n\nBr\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\n4.30 ± 0.94\n\n\n7.4 ± 0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL19\n\n\n \n\n\nBr\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\n4.16 ± 0.88\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL20\n\n\n \n\n\nBr\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\n3.28 ± 0.87\n\n\n658 ± 47 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nT1\n\n\n \n\n\nSCH\n2\nCONH\n2\n \n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\n1.59 ± 1.33\n\n\n1840 ± 497 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nT2\n\n\n \n\n\nSCH\n2\nCONH\n2\n \n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n2.02 ± 1.33\n\n\n391 ± 76 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nT3\n\n\n \n\n\nSCH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\n2.54 ± 1.35\n\n\n645 ± 75 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nT4\n\n\n \n\n\nSCH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n2.96 ± 1.35\n\n\n88 ± 6 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nT5\n\n\n \n\n\nSCH\n2\nC\n6\nH\n4\nOCH\n3\n \n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n4.76 ± 1.35\n\n\n8.3 ± 1.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT6\n\n\n \n\n\nSMe\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nMe\n\n\n3.67 ± 1.31\n\n\n7.9 ± 0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT8\n\n\n \n\n\nSCH\n2\nCONH\n2\n \n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\n2.12 ± 1.33\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT9\n\n\n \n\n\nSCH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\n3.07 ± 1.35\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL2\n\n\n \n\n\nI\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nF\n\n\n4.52 ± 0.92\n\n\n31 ± 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nL3\n\n\n \n\n\nI\n\n\nH\n\n\nH\n\n\nMe\n\n\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nF\n\n\n4.90 ± 0.92\n\n\n41 ± 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe BTA derivatives were synthesized through the condensation of 2-amino-aryl-thiols and aryl carboxylic acid under acidic conditions.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\ncLogD\n7.4\n \n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL21\n\n\n2.54 ± 1.30\n\n\n88 ± 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL22\n\n\n3.14 ± 1.43\n\n\n147 ± 20 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP1\n\n\n4.36\n\n\n5.7 ± 0.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPIB\n\n\n3.31\n\n\n7.23 ± 1.0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nL22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nP1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPIB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComparison of the Ki values of L1, L18 and L19 in Table 4 shows that the “isosteric effect” works partially. Since Br and Me are similar in size, the data show that a polar group increases binding. Similar analysis of the binding affinities of L1, L5, L6, and T7 shows that the thiol ether group provides optimal electronic and steric effects for binding, but the effect disappears as soon as a hydrophilic group is attached (cf results for T4 and T8). Increasing the size of substituents on the aromatic amino group decreases binding affinity, as reflected in L1, L2 and L3. However, there is substantial requirement for size in the 6-position (c.f. L6, L12 and L9). For L12, the combination of small and polar properties for the 6-substituent abolishes all binding affinity. Interestingly, introduction of a CN group into 8-position also completely removes the binding affinity (as in L14), reflecting minimal tolerance for any substituents at the periphery of the IMPY skeleton.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reference citations above are identified below under Reference List No. 1.\n\n\n \nREFERENCE LIST NO. 1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n1.

In the following description, the cited references are identified under Reference List No. 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAromatic thioethers of IMPY compounds are valuable as synthetic intermediates and as therapeutic drugs.\n1;2 \nHomogeneous catalysts based on either copper(I) or palladium have been developed for their syntheses.\n2;3 \nMechanistic studies of palladium-catalyzed aromatic substitution of halo or triflate groups by thiolate show that both three and four coordinate intermediates might be involved.\n4-6 \nIndeed, both mono and bidentate phosphine ligands have been developed for this type of reaction.\n7-12 \nCopper(I)-based catalysts for similar syntheses are mechanistically much less clear.\n13-17 \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the synthesis of these compounds, introducing the thioether group in the last step avoids manipulation and protection of this sensitive group in the synthesis of the IMPY skeleton. The aromatic halide substrates to be substituted are generally accessible in multiple step syntheses.\n18 \nSuccessful substitution of aryl halides with thiolates requires the avoidance of a competing reductive removal of the halogen substituent. The objects of this aspect of the invention are to achieve (a) an one-step introduction of a thioether group into a halogen position in an aryl ring; (b) selective introduction of a thioether group at an iodo position in the presence of other halogen substituents, such as bromo; (c) tolerance of functional groups, especially amino groups; and (d) fast microwave-assisted reaction conditions. Disclosed herein is a general, efficient, and operationally simple palladium-catalyzed aryl thioether synthesis that achieves these objects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo reaction schemes are described below. The first is a copper(I)-mediated coupling of aryl iodides with thiols (Scheme B1), while the second is a palladium-catalyzed coupling of aryl iodides with tin thiolates (Scheme B2).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aryl halide 4-(6-iodoindolizin-2-yl)-N-methylbenzenamine was used as the substrate, with either 2-mercaptoacetamide or 2-mercaptoethanol as the thiolating agent. In the copper-catalyzed reaction (Scheme B1), the catalyst used was CuI. Two ligands, ethylene glycol and ethylene diamine, were evaluated along with a variety of bases and solvents (Table B1). Low conversion of the iodo compound was observed with a catalytic amount of CuI. The reaction went to completion only when a greater than stoichiometric amount of CuI was used. For 2-mercaptoacetamide, the majority of the reaction product arose from reductive removal of the iodo group. For 2-mercaptoethanol, substitution of the iodo group was nearly quantitative for one substrate when 5 equivalents of CuI were used. However, no catalytic or general reaction was observed and so no further effort was expended on this approach for other substrates.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE B1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe copper (I)-mediated coupling of aryl iodides (1 or 2) with thiols:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent yield of conversion followed by ratio of substitution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto reduction in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMethod:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSubstituents:\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR\n2 \n= —CH\n2\nCONH\n2\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n 81\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR = Me\n\n\n(1:4.0)\n\n\n(0:1)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR\n2 \n= —CH\n2\nCONH\n2\n \n\n\n 81\n\n\n100\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR = H\n\n\n(1:8.3)\n\n\n(1:4.1)\na,b\n \n\n\n(0:1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR\n2 \n= —CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH\n\n\n 60\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR = Me\n\n\n(messy)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR\n2 \n= —CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH\n\n\n 96\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR = H\n\n\n(1:0.038)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe general conditions were 130° C., 10 min, 50 W, 300 p.s.i., substrate: thiol=1: 1.2-5.

Full citations for these references may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to describe more fully the art to which this invention pertains.\n\n\nDepression is the most common of mental disorders and yet is often underdiagnosed and undertreated, inflicting substantial morbidity and psychosocial impairment on its sufferers. Depression is mainly characterized by sadness, flatness, loss of feeling, anhedonia (lack of pleasure), tearfulness, agitation or retardation, thoughts of guilt, and worthlessness; in severe cases, suicide, hallucinations and delusions.\n\n\nDepression can be mainly categorized into bipolar disorders, identifying wide swings of mood; major depressive illness, marked by severe depressive symptoms but without manic swings; and less defined milder forms of bipolar and major depression that fall short of the specific diagnostic criteria e.g. dysthymic disorder (formerly called depressive neurosis). The symptomatology and diagnostic criteria for depression are set out in the DSMIV guidelines (American Psychiatric Association (1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). Although many patients have single episodes of major depressive illness, the condition also can be repetitive, and this recurrent condition is frequently called unipolar depressive illness.\n\n\nThe key features of depressive illness are a markedly gloomy mood in which there is a loss of interest in life, and general feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. Depressive symptoms range in severity from mild mood swings to severe delusions about self-worth, accomplishments, and the future.\n\n\nThe “blackness” of the presentation in the depressed patient is most often accompanied by severe motor retardation with profound sleep and appetite disturbance and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, depressive illness can also present in a highly anxious or agitated state.\n\n\nThe degree to which the underlying brain mechanisms in anxiety and depression differ or overlap remains unknown.\n\n\nThe fact, however, that to some extent the same neurotransmitter systems are involved in depression and anxiety does not mean that the mechanisms are identical. However, the majority of people in an episode of either depression or anxiety also meet criteria for at least one other psychiatric disorder. But by far the strongest comorbidities in both cases are between depression and anxiety disorders. Therefore, it is now becoming common clinical practice to treat both indications with antidepressants such as SSRIs.\n\n\nThe key clinical features of anxiety disorders relate to various combinations of psychological and physical manifestations of anxiety, not attributable to real danger and occurring either in attacks (panic disorder—PD) or as a persisting state (generalized anxiety disorder—GAD). Other neurotic features may be present (obsessional or hysterical symptoms) but do not dominate the clinical picture.\n\n\nThe Pathophysiology of Depression\n\n\nTheories underlying the pathophysiology of depression have developed from several lines of evidence including: 1) changes in neurotransmitter monoamine levels; 2)endocrine imbalance; and 3) electrophysiological studies on sleep functions.\n\n\nEvidence implicating the role of neurotransmitters in depression, in particular the monoamines serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine, include the success of pharmacological agents in treating depressive disorders. Many of the tricylic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) effective in the treatment of depression increase the availability of the catecholamines (noradrenaline and dopamine) and indolamines (serotonin) in the central nervous system (CNS). The clinical efficacy of these agents has given rise to the catecholamine-indolamine hypothesis of depression. This theory postulates that a certain level of amines and/or receptor sensitivity to catecholamines functions to generate a normal mood. A receptor insensitivity, a depletion of monoamines, or a decrease in their release, synthesis or storage have been postulated to lead to depression.\n\n\nCurrent Treatments for Depression\n\n\nA variety of pharmacological agents have been employed to treat depression based on the catecholamine-indolamine hypothesis of depression. Drugs used to treat depression include MAOIs, atypical antipsychotics, lithium, TCAs, and SSRIs. In addition, a number of off-label agents such as antiepileptics are used to treat depression in treatment-resistant patients.\n\n\nTricyclic antidepressants are about equal to SSRIs in effectiveness against depression thus providing supporting evidence for the catecholamine-indolamine hypothesis of depression. However, SSRIs have largely displaced TCAs because of side effects associated with TCAs and the need to monitor EKG and plasma drug concentration. Although the SSRIs are viewed as an improvement over other antidepressants, they are not without their clinical problems. Adverse effects on sexual function, primarily anorgasmia and delayed ejaculation, have been consistently reported. Other, common side-effects include sleep disorders, yawning, weight changes, suicidal ideation and extrapyramidal-like side-effects such as dystonic reactions. Thus, there clearly remains a medical need for new treatments of depression, without the adverse side-effect profile of existing agents and with improved efficacy.\n\n\nCurrent Treatments for Anxiety\n\n\nThere is now considerable direct evidence for the efficacy of the SSRIs both in depression and in anxiety disorders.\n\n\nOf the current SSRIs approved for marketing in the USA all have shown sufficient efficacy to be further approved for the treatment of at least one anxiety disorder, for example; obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Compounds such as paroxetine and sertraline are also indicated for the treatment of panic disorder (PD).\n\n\nHowever, it is clear from the issues raised earlier relating to the efficacy and side-effect profile of SSRIs and for that matter the more widely prescribed benzodiazapines, there still exists a real medical need for novel approaches for the treatment of anxiety and depression.\n\n\nDiscovery of GALR3 Receptor Subtype and its Role in Depression and Anxiety\n\n\nThe investigations leading to the present invention-arose from the discovery that mRNA for the GALR3 receptor is localized to areas of the rat brain associated with mood and emotion (see PCT International Publication No. WO 98/15570, published Apr. 16, 1998), thus supporting the expression of GALR3 in those regions. Protein for the GALR3 receptor is also shown to localize to areas of the rat brain associated with mood and emotion (see Table 11 and discussion herein).\n\n\nThis discovery led to the hypothesis that the GALR3 receptor may play a role in controlling the activity of catecholamine and indolamine neurons in the CNS. Galanin is known to hyperpolarize neurons, including monoaminergic neurons (Seutin, et al., 1989) and to have inhibitory effects on 5-HT neurons (Xu, et al., 1998), and dopamine neurons (Gopalan, et al., 1993; De Weille, et al., 1989; Jansson, et al., 1989; Nordstrom, et al., 1987; Weiss, et al., 1998). In light of these reports, a series of in vivo behavioral experiments were carried out to evaluate the antidepressant properties of a selective GALR3 receptor antagonist. The rat Forced Swim Test and the rat Social Interaction Test were employed to evaluate the use of selective GALR3 receptor antagonists to treat depression and anxiety. These models are considered by experts in the field to reflect the potential of agents to treat depression and anxiety.\n\n\nRat Forced Swim Test (FST)\n\n\nThe rat Forced Swim Test (FST) is a behavioral test that is used to screen compounds for antidepressant efficacy (Porsolt et al., 1977, 1978; Porsolt, 1981). This test is widely used as it is reliable across laboratories, relatively easy to perform and is sensitive to the effects of some of the major classes of antidepressant drugs, including TCAs and MAOIs, and various atypical antidepressants. Furthermore, this test is relatively selective for antidepressant drugs, as few psychoactive drugs produce similar behavioral actions in the FST.\n\n\nIn the rat FST, animals are placed in a cylinder of water, from which there is no escape, for an extended period of time. Typically, animals will display a range of behaviors such as immobility, climbing, swimming, and diving, with immobility being predominant after several minutes of immersion in the water. Consequently, many past studies have only measured or scored immobility after the administration of the test agent. Unfortunately, this method does not score any other active behaviors that may be produced by potential antidepressants. Thus, if a particular class of antidepressant were to have very little effect on immobility, yet produce characteristic behaviors during the FST, these behaviors would not be scored and the conclusion would be that the compound in question does not possess antidepressant action.\n\n\nRecently, however, a sampling technique was developed to score active behaviors in the FST, such as swimming, climbing and diving, in addition to immobility (Detke, et al., 1995; Lucki, 1997; Page, et al., 1999; Reneric and Lucki, 1998). This modified sampling technique has indicated that SSRIs, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline, significantly decrease immobility and increase swimming time (Detke, et al., 1995; Page, et al., 1999). In contrast, selective reuptake inhibitors of norepinephrine (NE) increase climbing behavior but do not alter swimming time (Detke, et al., 1995; Page, et al., 1999).\n\n\nRat Social Interaction Test (SIT)\n\n\nThere are a number of paradigms that have been used to determine whether a compound possesses anxiolytic action. A number of these tests involve food or water deprivation, punishment or measurement of consummatory behavior (see File, et al., 1980; File, 1985; Rodgers, et al., 1997; and Treit, 1985, for review). In addition, in these models, prior conditioning reduces the uncertainty or anxiety. In general, these tests lack ethological validity.\n\n\nOne model that is based upon an unconditioned response that does not involve punishment or deprivation is the Social Interaction Test (SIT) (File and Hyde, 1978, 1979). In this model, rats previously housed singly are placed in a familiar, dimly lit, test arena with weight-matched, novel partners. The principal anxiogenic stimulus under these conditions is the partner novelty, which involves an unconditioned response to a potential threat. After pharmacological treatments, the following behaviors are scored as active social interaction: grooming, sniffing, biting, boxing, wrestling, following, crawling over and crawling under. A wide range of psychoactive drugs have been examined in this paradigm and it has been shown that the social interaction test can distinguish anxiolytics from antidepressants, antipsychotics, analeptics and sedative agents (File, 1985; Guy and Gardner, 1985). This test can detect anxiolytic agents such as the benzodiazepines (File and Hyde, 1978; File and Hyde, 1979; File, 1980), in addition to non-benzodiazepines, including paroxetine and other SSRIs (Lightowler, et al., 1994). Finally, the social interaction test can detect anxiogenic agents, including the inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonists (File, et al., 1982; File and Pellow, 1983; File and Pellow, 1984; File, 1985).\n\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention the synthesis of indolones which bind selectively to the cloned human GALR3 receptor, compared to other cloned human G-protein coupled receptors, as measured in in vitro assays, is disclosed. The in vitro receptor assays described hereinafter were performed using various cultured cell lines, each transfected with and expressing only a single galanin-type receptor. Thus, we demonstrate that the GALR3 receptor antagonists, which may be classified as neutral antagonists, inverse agonists or allosteric modulators, provide a novel method to treat depressive disorders and/or anxiety.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound having the structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein each of Y\n1\n, Y\n2\n, Y\n3\n, and Y\n4 \nis independently —H;

Further derivatives may be obtained utilizing methods shown in Schemes 6a, 7a and 8-10. The substituents in Schemes 6a, 7a and 8-10 are described in the Detailed Description.\n\n\nIt may be necessary to incorporate protection and deprotection strategies for substituents such as amino, amido, carboxylic acid, and hydroxyl groups in the synthetic methods described above to form indolone derivatives. Methods for protection and deprotection of such groups are well-known in the art, and may be found, for example in Green, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M.

Oral Compositions\n\n\n\nAs a specific embodiment of an oral composition of a compound of this invention, 100 mg of one of the compounds described herein is formulated with sufficient finely divided lactose to provide a total amount of 580 to 590 mg to fill a size O hard gel capsule.\n\n\nII. In-Vivo Models\n\n\nA. Materials and Methods\n\n\n1. Forced Swim Test (FST)\n\n\nThe procedure used in this study was similar to that previously described (Porsolt, et al., 1978), except the water depth (30 cm in this procedure). The greater depth in this test prevented the rats from supporting themselves by touching the bottom of the cylinder with their feet. Swim sessions were conducted by placing rats in individual plexiglass cylinders (46 cm tall×20 cm in diameter) containing 23-25° \nC. water\n 30 cm deep (Porsolt, et al. used a depth of only 15 cm; also, see Detke, et al., 1995). Two swim tests were conducted always between 1200 and 1800 hours: an initial 15-min pretest followed 24 h later by a 5-minute test. Drug treatments were administered 60 minutes before the 5-minute test period. All other test sessions were conducted between 1300 to 1700 hours. Following all swim sessions, rats were removed from the cylinders, dried with paper towels and placed in a heated cage for 15 minutes and returned to their home cages. All test sessions were videotaped using a Panasonic color video camera and recorder for scoring later.\n\n\nAnimals\n\n\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, N.Y.) were used in all experiments. Rats were housed in pairs and maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. Rats were handled for 5 minutes each day for 5 days prior to behavioral testing.\n\n\nBehavioral Scoring\n\n\nThe rat's behavior was rated at 5 second intervals during the 5 minute test as one of the following:\n\n \n \n1. Immobility—rat remained floating in the water without struggling and was only making those movements necessary to keep its head above water;\n \n2. Climbing—rat was making active movements with its forepaws in and out of the water, usually directed against the walls;\n \n3. Swimming—rat was making active swimming motions, more than necessary to merely maintain its head above water, e.g., moving around in the cylinder; and\n \n4. Diving—entire body of the rat was submerged.\n \n\n\nAll of the behavior scoring was done by a single rater, who was blind to the treatment condition. The rater was also present in the room throughout the entire test period.\n\n\nDrug Administration\n\n\nAnimals were randomly assigned to receive a single i.p. administration of Example 92 (1, 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, dissolved in 100% DMSO), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, dissolved in distilled water) or vehicle (equal mixture of DMSO and distilled water) 30 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period. All injections were given using 1 cc tuberculin syringe with 26⅜ gauge needles (Becton-Dickinson, VWR Scientific, Bridgeport, N.J.). The volume of injection was 1 ml/kg.\n\n\nIn another set of experiments, animals were randomly assigned to receive a single p.o. administration of one of the following treatments: Example 151 (1, 3 or 10 mg/kg), fluoxetine (5 or 10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of 100% N,N-dimethylacetamide) 60 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period. The drugs were dissolved in 100% N,N-dimethylacetamide. All administrations were given using 1 cc tuberculin syringes, to which a 3 inch, curved, stainless steel gavage needle was attached. The volume of administration was 1 ml/kg.\n\n\nIn other sets of experiments, animals were randomly assigned to receive a single p.o. administration of one of the following treatments: Example 103 (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of 100% N,N-dimethylacetamide) 60 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period; or Example 272 (3 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of 100% N,N-dimethylacetamide) 24 hours before the start of the 5 minute test period; or Example 98 (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of 100% N,N-dimethylacetamide) 60 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period; or Example 34 (0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of a 100% solution of dimethylacetamide) 60 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period; or Example 49 (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of 100% N,N-dimethylacetamide) 60 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period; or Example 22 (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg), fluoxetine. (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of 100% N,N-dimethylacetamide) 60 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period. The compounds were dissolved in 100% N,N-dimethylacetamide. All administrations were given using 1 cc tuberculin syringes, to which a 3 inch, curved, stainless steel gavage needle was attached. The volume of administration was 1 ml/kg.\n\n\nThe effect of 5 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine was utilized in the FST as a positive control.\n\n\nData Analysis\n\n\nThe forced swim test data (immobility, swimming, climbing, diving) were subjected to a randomized, one-way ANOVA and post hoc tests conducted using the Student-Newman-Keuls test. The data were analyzed using the GBSTAT program, version 6.5 (Dynamics Microsystems, Inc., Silver Spring, Md., 1997). All data are presented as means±S.E.M.\n\n\n2. Social Interaction Test (SIT)\n\n\nRats were allowed to acclimate to the animal Care facility for 5 days and were housed singly for 5 days prior to testing. Animals were handled for 5 minutes per day. The design and procedure for the Social Interaction Test was carried out as previously described by Kennett, et al. (1997). On the test day, weight matched pairs of rats (±5%), unfamiliar to each other, were given identical treatments and returned to their home cages. Animals were randomly divided into 5 treatment groups, with 5 pairs per group, and were given one of the following i.p. treatments: Example 92 (10, 30 or 100 mg/kg), vehicle (1 ml/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). Dosing was 1 hour prior to testing. Rats were subsequently placed in a white perspex test box or arena (54×37×26 cm), whose floor was divided up into 24 equal squares, for 15 minutes. An air conditioner was used to generate background noise and to keep the room at approximately 74° F. All sessions were videotaped using a JVC camcorder (model GR-SZ1, Elmwood Park, N.J.) with either TDK (HG ultimate brand) or \nSony\n 30 minute videocassettes. All sessions were conducted between 1:00-4:30 P.M. Active social interaction, defined as grooming, sniffing, biting, boxing, wrestling, following and crawling over or under, was scored using a stopwatch (Sportsline model no. 226, 1/100 sec. discriminability). The number of episodes of rearing (animal completely raises up its body on its hind limbs), grooming (licking, biting, scratching of body), and face washing (i.e. hands are moved repeatedly over face), and number of squares crossed were scored. Passive social interaction (animals are lying beside or on top of each other) was not scored.\n\n\nAll behaviors were assessed later by an observer who was blind as to the treatment of each pair. At the end of each test, the box was thoroughly wiped with moistened paper towels.\n\n\nAnimals\n\n\nMale albino Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, N.Y.) were housed in pairs under a 12 hr light dark cycle (lights on at 0700 hrs.) with free access to food and water.\n\n\nDrug Administration\n\n\nExample 92 was dissolved in 100% DMSO (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.). Chlordiazepoxide (purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) was dissolved in double distilled water. The vehicle consisted of 50% DMSO (v/v). All drug solutions were made up 10 minutes prior to injection and the solutions were discarded.\n\n\nData Analysis\n\n\nThe social interaction data (time interacting, rearing and squares crossed) were subjected to a randomized, one-way ANOVA and post hoc tests conducted using the Student-Newman-Keuls test. The data were subjected to a test of normality (Shapiro-Wilk test). The data were analyzed using the GBSTAT program, version 6.5 (Dynamics Microsystems, Inc., Silver Spring, Md., 1997). All data are presented as means±S.E.M.\n\n\nB. Results\n\n\n1. Forced Swim Test\n\n\nA. The Effect of Vehicle, Fluoxetine and Example 92 on Immobility, Climbing and Swimming in the Forced Swim Test\n\n\nImmobility\n\n\nStatistical analysis indicated that there was a significant drug effect [F(4,45)=12.1, p<0.0001] on immobility. Subsequent post hoc analysis revealed that a single injection of 10 mg/kg i.p. of fluoxetine significantly decreased immobility to 21.0±0.9 (Student-Newman-Keuls value was 36.5, p<0.01) compared to vehicle-treated controls (Table 5 and \nFIG. 1\n). In addition, a single injection of either 3 or 10 mg/kg i.p. of Example 92 significantly decreased immobility (24±1.1 & 24±0.8 counts at each dose, respectively) compared to vehicle-treated \ncontrols\n 30±1.2 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 16.8 and 15.7, respectively) (Table 5 and \nFIG. 1\n). No significant effects on immobility were observed with Example 92 at 30 mg/kg i.p. (Table 5 and \nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\nClimbing\n\n\nThe statistical analysis of the climbing counts indicated that there was a significant drug effect [F(4,45)=4.4, p=0.004]. Post hoc analysis indicated that a single injection of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine did not significantly alter climbing counts compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 5 and \nFIG. 2\n). In contrast, a single injection of 10 mg/kg of Example 92 produced a significant increase (16.8±0.6) in climbing counts (Student-Newman-Keuls value=11.6, p<0.01) compared to vehicle-treated animals (12±0.8). Example 92 dosed at 1, 3 & 30 mg/kg did not significantly alter climbing.\n\n\nSwimming\n\n\nThe statistical analysis of the swimming data indicated that there was a significant drug effect [F(4,45)=6.6, p<0.0001] (Table 5 and \nFIG. 3\n). The post hoc test showed that a single injection of 10 mg/kg i.p. of fluoxetine produced a significant increase (25±1.2) in swimming counts over the vehicle treated animals, 18±1 (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 19.9, p<0.01). In contrast, a single injection of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg i.p. of Example 92 did not significantly alter swimming counts 20±1.1, 21±0.9,& 18±0.9, respectively (Table 5 and \nFIG. 3\n). (However, at 30 mg/kg i.p. Example 92 significantly increased swim behavior in the rat, comparable to fluoxetine at 10 mg/kg i.p. (27±2.5 vs. 25±1.2, Table 5 and \nFIG. 3\n).\n\n\nDiving\n\n\nThis behavior was rarely observed following a single injection of vehicle (0.1±0.1, one animal dove once), fluoxetine (0.1±0.1, one animal out of 10 dove once), 1 mg/kg of Example 92 (0.6±0.2; 5 animals had counts of 2, 1, 1, 1, and 1), 3 mg/kg of Example 92 (0.6±0.3; 3 animals had counts of 3, 2 and 1) or 10 mg/kg of Example 92 (0.5±0.5; note: only one animal at this dose showed diving behavior and the score was 5). At 30 mg/kg i.p. of Example 92 diving behavior was only observed in two animals (mean=0.2±0.2). Thus there was no significant drug effect on diving [F(4,45)=0.77, p=0.55].\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe effect of a single injection of vehicle,\n \n \n \nfluoxetine and Example 92 on immobility, climbing and\n \n \n \nswimming in the rat Forced Swim Test.\n \n \n \n \n \nTreatment\n \nDose (mg/kg)\n \nImmobility\n \nClimbing\n \nSwimming\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVehicle\n \n—\n \n30 ± 1.2\n \n12.0 ± 0.8\n \n18 ± 1\n \n \n \n \nFluoxetine\n \n \n10\n \n21 ± 0.9\na\n \n \n14.3 ± 0.9\n \n25 ± 1.2\nb\n \n \n \n \nExample 92\n \n1\n \n28 ± 1.0\n \n11.7 ± 1.1\n \n20 ± 1.1\n \n \n \nExample 92\n \n3\n \n24 ± 1.1\na\n \n \n14.6 ± 1.5\n \n21 ± 0.9\n \n \n \nExample 92\n \n10\n \n24 ± 0.8\na\n \n \n16.8 ± 0.6\nc\n \n \n18 ± 0.9\n \n \n \nExample 92\n \n30\n \n25 ± 3.5\n \n 8.6 ± 1.7\n \n27 ± 2.5\nd\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach value represents the mean number of counts per 5 seconds ± S.E.M in a 5 minute observation period.\n \n \n \n \na\nSignificantly less than Vehicle on immobility scores, p < 0.01, ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test.\n \n \n \n \nb\nSignificantly, greater than Vehicle and 1, 3 & 10 of Example 92, on swim scores, p < 0.01, ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls.\n \n \n \n \nc\nSignificantly greater than vehicle and 1, 3 & 30 mg/kg dose of Example 92 on climbing scores, p < 0.01, ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls\n \n \n \n \nd\nSignificantly greater than Vehicle, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg i.p. of Example 92 on swim scores, p < 0.01, ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test.\n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe results of the Forced Swim Test indicate that using a modified version of the Lucki forced swim test, a single injection of 10 mg/kg i.p. of fluoxetine produced a significant decrease in immobility and an increase in swimming in male Sprague-Dawley rats. This is consistent with findings from previous studies using the Lucki version (Detke, et al., 1995; Kirby and Lucki, 1997; Lucki, 1997; Page, et al., 1999; Reneric and Lucki, 1998). In addition, the results obtained using fluoxetine are consistent with those using other SSRIs (Detke, et al., 1995). Thus, a modified version of the Lucki forced swim test can consistently detect the antidepressant action of SSRIs such as fluoxetine.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg i.p., Example 92, significantly decreased immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals. The magnitude of the decrease was not significantly different than that of fluoxetine. Thus, based on past interpretations of the Forced Swim Test, our results suggest that Example 92 has antidepressant-like properties.\n\n\nA single injection of either 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg i.p. of Example 92 did not significantly alter swimming behavior. This is in contrast to the results obtained with fluoxetine, which increased swimming at 10 mg/kg i.p. Previously, it has been reported that compounds which selectively block serotonin uptake significantly increase swimming but not climbing whereas selective NE uptake blockers significantly increase climbing but not swimming behavior (Reneric and Lucki, 1998). Thus, the present findings suggest that Example 92 exhibits a profile similar to NE and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) depending on the dose tested.\n\n\nFinally, as previously reported by Lucki, diving behavior was rarely observed in vehicle or fluoxetine-treated animals (1 dive in one rat for each group). Example 92 at all doses tested did not produce a significant effect on diving behavior. It is possible that antidepressant drugs do not induce diving behavior.\n\n\nIn conclusion, compared to vehicle-treated animals, Example 92, at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg, produced a significant decrease in immobility and a significant increase in climbing at the 10 mg/kg dose. At 30 mg/kg i.p. Example 92 produced a significant increase in swimming behavior comparable with that observed with the antidepressant fluoxetine, thus supporting the antidepressant-like profile of Example 92.\n\n\nB. The Effect of a Single P.O. Administration of Example 103, Fluoxetine and Vehicle on Swimming, Immobility, Climbing and Diving in the Forced Swim Test\n\n\nImmobility\n\n\nStatistical analysis indicated a significant effect of treatment on immobility (ANOVA, F(4,40)=6.3, p=0.0005). Post hoc analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine significantly decreased immobility (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 8.3) compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 5b). The decrease in immobility produced by fluoxetine was significantly greater than that of either 3 or 10 mg/kg p.o. of Example 103 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 9.1 and 6.1, respectively).\n\n\nA single p.o. administration of either 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 103 did not significantly alter immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals. However, the 30 mg/kg dose of Example 103 produced a significant decrease in immobility (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 13.9) compared to vehicle-treated animals. In addition, the decrease in immobility produced by 30 mg/kg of Example 103 was significantly greater than that of 3 and 10 mg/kg of Example 103 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 14.4 and 10.6, respectively). There was no significant difference between fluoxetine and 30 mg/kg of Example 103 in the reduction of immobility.\n\n\nSwimming\n\n\nStatistical analysis indicated a significant treatment effect on swimming behavior (ANOVA, F(4, 40)=9.2, p<0.0001). Post hoc analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine produced a significant increase in swimming behavior compared to animals treated with vehicle, 3 or 10 mg/kg p.o. of Example 103 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 14.9, 15.3 and 11.6, respectively) (Table 5b).\n\n\nA single p.o. administration of either 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 103 did not significantly alter swimming behavior compared to vehicle-treated animals. A single p.o. administration of 30 mg/kg of Example 103 produced a significantly greater increase in swimming behavior compared to animals treated with either vehicle, 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 103 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 18, 18.6 and 14.5 respectively).\n\n\nClimbing Behavior\n\n\nStatistical analysis revealed that diving was not significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 103 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(4,40)=1.2, p=0.31) (Table 5b).\n\n\nDiving\n\n\nStatistical analysis revealed that diving was not significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 103 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(4,40)=1.1, p=0.36) (Table 5b).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 5b\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe effect of a single p.o. administration of\n \n \n \nvehicle, 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine and 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of\n \n \n \nExample 103 on immobility, climbing, diving and swimming\n \n \n \nin the forced swim test in male Sprague-Dawley rats.\n \n \n \n \n \nTreatment\n \nImmobility\n \nClimbing\n \nSwimming\n \nDiving\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVehicle\n \n44 ± 1.7\n \n2.9 ± 0.7\n \n13.1 ± 1.2\n \n0.4 ± 0.2\n \n \n \n 3 mg/kg EX103\n \n44 ± 2.7\n \n2.8 ± 0.6\n \n13.2 ± 1.9\n \n0.5 ± 0.4\n \n \n \n10 mg/kg EX103\n \n42 ± 2.2\n \n3.5 ± 0.6\n \n14.3 ± 1.6\n \n0.4 ± 0.2\n \n \n \n30 mg/kg EX103\n \n32 ± 1.8\na\n \n \n4.8 ± 0.7\n \n22.7 ± 1.1\nc\n \n \n1.1 ± 0.5\n \n \n \n10 mg/kg Fluox\n \n34 ± 2.3\nb\n \n \n3.8 ± 0.8\n \n21.8 ± 1.4\nc\n \n \n0.1 ± 0.1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach value represents the mean ± S.E.M.

The magnitude of these changes are similar to those reported of our past studies with 10 mg/kg p.o. of fluoxetine. In contrast, neither climbing nor diving behavior was significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine.\n\n\n\nA single p.o. administration of either 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 103 did not significantly alter swimming, climbing, immobility or diving in male rats in the FST, indicating that at these doses using the p.o. route, Example 103 does not exhibit antidepressant action in the FST. In contrast, a single p.o. administration of 30 mg/kg of Example 103 produced a significant increase in swimming and a significant decrease in immobility compared to animals treated with vehicle or 10 mg/kg of Example 103. However, the 30 mg/kg p.o. dose of Example 103 did not significantly alter diving or climbing counts compared to vehicle-treated animals. The increase in swimming counts produced by 30 mg/kg p.o. of Example 103 was comparable to that for 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine.\n\n\nIn conclusion, a single p.o. administration of 3.0 mg/kg of Example 103 (one hour before the last swim test) increases swimming and decreases immobility counts in the FST, suggesting that Example 103 has antidepressant properties.\n\n\nC. Effect of a single p.o. administration of example 272, Fluoxetine and Vehicle on Swimming, Climbing, Immobility and Diving in the Forced Swim Test\n\n\nImmobility\n\n\nStatistical analysis indicated a significant effect of treatment on immobility (ANOVA, F(2,27)=5.2, p=0.0126). Post hoc analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine and 3 mg/kg of Example 272 significantly decreased immobility (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 5.4 and 9.8, respectively) compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 5c). There was no significant difference between fluoxetine and 3 mg/kg of Example 272 in the reduction of immobility (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 0.53).\n\n\nSwimming\n\n\nStatistical analysis indicated a significant treatment effect on swimming behavior (ANOVA, F(2,27)=9.9, p<0.0007). Post hoc-analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine and Example 272 produced a significant increase in swimming behavior compared to animals treated with vehicle (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 11.9 and 17.5, respectively) (Table 5c). There was no significant difference in the increase in swimming between 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine and 3 mg/kg of Example 272 (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 0.42).\n\n\nClimbing Behavior\n\n\nStatistical analysis revealed that diving was not significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of either 3 mg/kg of Example 272 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(2,27)=1.8, p=0.19) (Table 5c).\n\n\nDiving\n\n\nStatistical analysis revealed that diving was not significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of 3 mg/kg of Example 272 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(2,27)=0.65, p=0.53) (Table 5c).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 5c\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe effect of a single p.o. administration of\n \n \n \nvehicle, fluoxetine and Example 272 on immobility,\n \n \n \nclimbing, diving and swimming in the forced swim test in\n \n \n \nmale Sprague-Dawley rats.\n \n \n \n \n \nTreatment\n \nImmobility\n \nClimbing\n \nSwimming\n \nDiving\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVehicle\n \n43 ± 3.3\n \n2.4 ± 0.4\n \n13.4 ± 2.2\n \n0.2 ± 0.1\n \n \n \n 3 mg/kg\n \n33 ± 1.8\na\n \n \n3.9 ± 0.6\n \n22.9 ± 1.3\nb\n \n \n0.6 ± 0.4\n \n \n \n \nEX272\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 mg/kg\n \n35 ± 1.7\na\n \n \n3.3 ± 0.6\n \n21.4 ± 1.0\nb\n \n \n0.2 ± 0.1\n \n \n \nFLUOX\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach value represents the mean ± S.E.M.

However, the administration of Example 272 did not significantly alter climbing or diving compared to vehicle-treated animals. These results are similar to those of a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine. Our finding suggest that a single p.o. administration of 3 mg/kg of Example 272 has the profile of an antidepressant in male Sprague-Dawley rats in the Lucki version of the FST.\n\n\n\nE. Effect of a Single p.o. Administration of Example 98, Fluoxetine and Vehicle on Swimming, Climbing, Immobility and Diving in the Forced Swim Test.\n\n\nImmobility\n\n\nStatistical analysis indicated a significant effect of treatment on immobility (ANOVA, F(4,43)=7.5, p=0.0001). Post hoc analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine significantly decreased immobility (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 23.8) compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 5d).\n\n\nA single p.o. administration of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 98 significantly decreased immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 19.3, 9.7 and 13.7, respectively). There was no significant difference between fluoxetine and 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 98 in the magnitude of the reduction of immobility. There were no significant differences between the doses of Example 98 regarding the magnitude of the decrease in immobility.\n\n\nSwimming\n\n\nStatistical analysis indicated a significant treatment effect on swimming behavior (ANOVA, F(4,43)=11, p<0.0001). Post hoc analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine produced a significant increase in swimming behavior compared to vehicle-treated animals (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 35.1) (Table 5d).\n\n\nA single p.o. administration of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 98 significantly increased swimming compared to vehicle-treated animals (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 24.4, 14.7 and 25.1, respectively) (Table 5d). There was no significant difference between fluoxetine and 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 98 in the magnitude of the increase in swimming. There were no significant differences between the doses of Example 98 regarding the magnitude of the increase in immobility.\n\n\nClimbing Behavior\n\n\nThere was a significant treatment effect on climbing behavior (ANOVA, F(4,43)=2.8, p=0.04) (Table 5d). Post hoc tests indicated that this was the result of the 3 mg/kg dose of Example 98 producing a significantly greater increase in climbing compared to 30 mg/kg of Example 98 (Table 5d; Student-Newman-Keuls value of 8.6). There was no significant difference in the number of climbing counts between animals treated with vehicle and Example 98.\n\n\nDiving\n\n\nStatistical analysis revealed that diving was not significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 98 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(4,43)=1.29, p=0.29) (Table 5d).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 5d\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe effect of a single p.o. administration of\n \n \n \nvehicle, 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine and 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of\n \n \n \nExample 98 on immobility, climbing, diving and swimming\n \n \n \nin the forced swim test in male Sprague-Dawley rats.\n \n \n \n \n \nTreatment\n \nImmobility\n \nClimbing\n \nSwimming\n \nDiving\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVehicle\n \n48 ± 1.2\n \n2.5 ± 0.5\n \n 8.8 ± 0.9\n \n0.4 ± 0.3\n \n \n \n 3 mg/kg EX98\n \n35 ± 2.6\na\n \n \n4.3 ± 0.9\nb\n \n \n20.4 ± 1.9\nc\n \n \n0.1 ± 0.1\n \n \n \n10 mg/kg\n \n39 ± 1.1\na\n \n \n2.4 ± 0.3\n \n17.6 ± 1.0\nc\n \n \n0.8 ± 0.4\n \n \n \nEX98\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n30 mg/kg\n \n38 ± 2.3\na\n \n \n2.0 ± 0.3\n \n20.3 ± 2.1\nc\n \n \n0.2 ± 0.2\n \n \n \nEX98\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 mg/kg\n \n34 ± 3.0\na\n \n \n3.4 ± 0.8\n \n22.8 ± 2.2\nc\n \n \n0.1 ± 0.1\n \n \n \nFluox\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach value represents the mean ± S.E.M.

In addition, the Example 98 induced alterations were similar in magnitude to that of a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg p.o. of fluoxetine. However, neither fluoxetine nor Example 98 produced a significant alteration in climbing or diving compared to vehicle-treated animals.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, these results indicate that a single p.o. administration of Example 98 produces a profile in the modified Lucki version of the FST resembling that of the clinically established antidepressant fluoxetine.\n\n\nI.

The Effect of Example 92 and Chlordiazepoxide on Behavior in the Rat Social Interaction Test\n\n\n\nA single i.p. administration of either 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 92 significantly increased social interaction (Table 6 and \nFIG. 4\n), as did the benzodiazepine anxiolytic, chlordiazepoxide (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 31.3) compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(4,45)=10.3, p<0.0001; Student-Newman-Keuls values for the 10 and 30 mg/kg doses were 8.61 and 19.55, respectively]. However, the 100 mg/kg i.p. dose of Example 92 did not significantly alter social interaction time compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 6 and \nFIG. 4\n). The degree of social interaction was greater in the chlordiazepoxide-treated animals compared to those that received either the 10 or 30 mg/kg doses of Example 92.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Effect Of A Single Injection Of Vehicle,\n \n \n \nChlordiazepoxide And Example 92 On The Social Interaction\n \n \n \nAnd Rearing Of Unfamiliar Cage Mates In A Familiar Arena\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDrug Social Treatment (i.p.)\n \nInteraction (sec)\na\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVehicle, 1 ml/kg\n \n 96 ± 12\n \n \n \n \n \nChlordiazepoxide, 5 mg/kg\n \n188 ± 15\nb\n \n \n \n \n \n \nExample 92, 10 mg/kg\n \n144 ± 12\nb\n \n \n \n \n \n \nExample 92, 30 mg/kg\n \n169 ± 13\nc\n \n \n \n \n \n \nExample 92, 100 mg/kg\n \n117 ± 6\nd\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na\nEach value represents the mean seconds of social interaction ± S.E.M.\n \n \n \n \nb\nSignificantly greater than Vehicle, p < 0.05, ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test.\n \n \n \n \nc\nSignificantly greater than Vehicle, p < 0.01, ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test.\n \n \n \n \nd\nSignificantly less than 30 mg/kg dose and chlordiazepoxide, p < 0.01, ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls.\n \n \n \n \n \n\nB. The Effect of Example 92 and Chlordiazepoxide on Rearing Behavior, Locomotor Activity and Grooming in the Rat Social Interaction Test\n\n\n\nThe administration of 10 and 30 mg/kg, but not 100 mg/kg of Example 92, significantly increased rearing behavior compared to either vehicle or chlordiazepoxide [ANOVA, F(4,45)=2.6, p=0.046; See Table 13]. In addition, the number of rearings at the 10 mg/kg dose of Example 92 was significantly greater than that produced by chlordiazepoxide (Table 13).\n\n\nThe administration of either Example 92 or chlordiazepoxide did not significantly alter the number of grooming bouts compared to vehicle-treated animals [F(4,45)=0.67, p=0.62].\n\n\nA single injection of either 10 or 30 mg/kg i.p. of Example 92 or 5 mg/kg i.p. of chlordiazepoxide did not significantly alter the number of squares crossed (Table 13). However, the number of squares crossed following the 100 mg/kg dose of Example 92 was significantly lower than animals treated with either vehicle, 10 mg/kp i.p. of Example 92, 30 mg/kg i.p. of Example 92 or 5 mg/kg i.p. of chlordiazepoxide.

Also, the anxiolytic agent (5 mg/kg i.p. chlordiazepoxide) produced a significant increase in social interaction time compared, to vehicle-treated animals. The response produced by the 30 mg/kg dose of Example 92 was comparable to that of the positive control, chlordiazepoxide. The 30 mg/kg dose of Example 92 produced a significant increase in rearing compared to vehicle- and chlordiazepoxide-treated animals. Previously, it has been shown that in the Social Interaction Test, psychostimulants such as amphetamine and caffeine, increase social interaction and locomotor activity, whereas anxiolytics increase social interaction time. (File, 1985; File and Hyde, 1979; Guy and Gardner, 1985). Consistent with an increase in social interaction, Example 92 increased rearing behavior. However, it did not produce an increase in horizontal locomotor activity or grooming bouts. In addition, Example 92 did not elicit stereotypes or produce aggressive behaviors. In fact, locomotor activity as measured by squares crossed was significantly reduced at the 100 mg/kg i.p. dose of Example 92 compared to vehicle-treated animals. This decrease in locomotor activity did not appear to be accompanied by ataxia or sedation. Thus, it is unlikely that Example 92 is producing a non-specific effect on social interaction through motor stimulation. In order to justify this claim, in another study (not reported), the effect of Example 92 was dosed to familiar cage mates in the social interaction test and no significant increase in interaction in this variation of the Social Interaction Test was observed. In this test, the anxiogenic stimulus of a novel partner is removed and therefore only locomotor activity and normal behavior are observed (Guy and Gardner, 1985). In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that Example 92, at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p., significantly increases social interaction time without producing an increase in horizontal locomotor activity or grooming bouts. Furthermore, the effect produced by the 30 mg/kg of Example 92 was comparable to that observed for 5 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide, the active control. No increase in social interaction was observed at the 100 mg/kg dose of Example 92. However, a decrease in the number of squares crossed was observed. In summary, Example 92 has the profile of an anxiolytic drug in the Social Interaction Test.\n\n\nII. Binding Properties of Compounds at Cloned Receptors\n\n\nA. Materials and Methods\n\n\nThe binding properties of the compounds of the present invention were evaluated at one or more cloned receptors or native, tissue-derived transporters, using protocols described below.\n\n\nCell Culture\n\n\nCOS-7 cells were grown on 150 mm plates in D-MEM with supplements (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% bovine calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n. Stock plates of COS-7 cells were trypsinized and split 1:6 every 3-4 days. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown on 150 mm plates in D-MEM with supplements (minimal essential medium) with Hanks' salts and supplements (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% bovine calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n. Stock plates of 293 cells were trypsinized and split 1:6 every 3-4 days. Mouse fibroblast LM(tk-) cells were grown on 150 mm plates in D-MEM with supplements (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% bovine calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin) at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n. Stock plates of LM(tk-) cells were trypsinized and split 1:10 every 3-4 days. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells were grown on 150 mm plates in HAM's F12 medium with (HAM's F-12 with 10% bovine calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin) at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n. Stock plates of CHO cells were trypsinized and split 1:8 every 3-4 days.\n\n\nLM(tk-) cells were stably transfected with the human GAL1 or GALR3 receptor. CHO cells were stably transfected with the human GAL2 receptor.\n\n\nStable Transfection\n\n\ncDNAs for the human and rat GAL1, and human and rat GALR3 receptors were transfected with a G-418 resistant gene into the mouse fibroblast LM(tk-) cell line by a calcium phosphate transfection method (Cullen, 1987). Stably transfected cells were selected with G-418. Human and rat GAL2 receptors were similarly transfected into CHO cells.\n\n\nMembrane Harvest\n\n\nMembranes were harvested from stably transfected LM(tk-) cells. Adherent cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (138 mM NaCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH\n2\nPO4, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) and lysed by sonication in ice-cold sonication buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.7). Large particles and debris were cleared by low speed centrifugation (200×g, 5 min, 4° C.). Membranes were collected from the supernatant fraction by centrifugation (32,000×g, 18 min, 4° C.), washed with ice-cold hypotonic buffer, and collected again by centrifugation (32,000×g, 18 min, 4° C.). The final membrane pellet was resuspended by sonication into a small volume of ice-cold binding buffer (−1 ml for every 5 plates: 10 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 0.22 mM KH\n2\nPO4, 1.26 mM CaCl2, 0.81 mM MgSO4, pH 7.4). Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976) using Bio-Rad Reagent, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Membranes were held on ice for up to one hour and used fresh, or flash frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Membranes were prepared similarly from CHO cells.\n\n\nAs described in the Background of the Invention, compounds that block the effects of galanin on the GALR3 receptor subtype can potentially be used for the treatment of depression and anxiety. Biogenic amine transmitter molecules that mediate neuronal signals are currently known in the art and include among others serotonin (5HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA). Recent advances in the molecular studies of the mechanisms for these transmitter molecules, together with the characterization of their pharmacological properties, has enabled the identification of numerous potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Inhibitors of the 5HT, NE and DA transporter systems, and inhibitors of the enzyme, monoamine oxidase, have been widely studied and are known to enhance the action of biogenic amine neurotransmitters. The resultant clinically effective antidepressant drugs are known today as TCAs, SSRIs and MAOIs. (Tatsumi et al., 1997; Iversen, 2000).\n\n\nIn the case of galanin, the evidence presented in this invention suggests that GPCR-targeted molecules that bind to and antagonize the GALR3 receptor may be used for the treatment of depression and/or anxiety disorders. Another approach could involve the administration of an antagonist of the GALR3 receptor, such as those described herein, which also possesses 5HT\n4 \nreceptor antagonist properties (Kennett et al., 1997). A further approach could involve the administration of a GALR3 antagonist, such as those described herein, which also possesses 5HT\n1A \nreceptor binding properties (Razani et al., 1997). However, in any case the GALR3 antagonist(s) should be free of activity at the human GAL1 receptor and the 5HT, NE and DA transporters. Furthermore, the GALR3 antagonist(s) should not inhibit the enzymatic activity of monoamine oxidase A (MAO\nA\n) or monoamine oxidase B (MAO\nB\n) present in the brain (i.e. central MAO). The design of such compounds can be optimized by determining their binding affinity at the recombinant GALR3, GAL1, 5HT\n4\n, and 5HT\nA \nreceptors; and the native 5HT, NE and DA transporters. The design of such compounds can be further optimized by determining their interaction with central MAO\nA \nand central MAO\nB\n.\n\n\nAdditionally, the GALR3 antagonist(s) would optimally not bind at the following receptors due to possible side effects: human GAL2; human H\n1 \nhistamine; human α\n1A \nadrenergic, human α\n1B \nadrenergic, human α\n1D \nadrenergic, human α\n2A \nadrenergic, human α\n2B \nadrenergic, and human α\n2C \nadrenergic; human dopamine D\n1\n, D\n2\n, D\n3\n, D\n4\n, and D\n5\n; and the human 5HT\n1B\n, human 5HT\n1D\n, human 5HT\n1E\n, human 5HT\n1F\n, human 5HT\n2A\n, rat 5HT\n2C\n, human 5HT\n6\n, and human 5HT\n7 \nreceptors.\n\n\nRadioligand Binding Assays and Enzymatic Assays\n\n\nThe methods to obtain the cDNA of the receptors, express said receptors in heterologous systems, and carry out assays to determine binding affinity are described as follows.\n\n\nGalanin Receptors: Binding assays were performed according to the following published methods: human GALR3 (PCT International Publication No. WO 98/15570), human GAL1 (PCT International Publication No. WO 95/2260), human GAL2 (PCT International Publication No. WO 97/26853).\n\n\nHuman 5HT\n1B\n, 5HT\n1D\n, 5HT\n1E\n, 5HT\n1F\n, and 5HT\n7 \nReceptors: The cell lysates of LM(tk-) clonal cell line stably transfected with the genes encoding each of these 5HT receptor-subtypes were prepared as described above. Cell membranes were suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4 at 37° C.) containing 10 mM MgCl2, O.2 mM EDTA, 10 M pargyline, and 0.1% ascorbate. The affinities of compounds were determined in equilibrium competition binding assays by incubation for 30 minutes at 37° C. in the presence of 5 nM [\n3\nH]-serotonin. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM serotonin. The bound radioligand was separated by filtration through GF/B filters using a cell harvester.\n\n\nHuman 5HT\n2A \nReceptor: The coding sequence of the human 5HT\n2A \nreceptor was obtained from a human brain cortex cDNA library, and cloned into the cloning site of pCEXV-3 eukaryotic expression vector. This construct was transfected into COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method (Cullen, 1987). Cells were harvested after 72 hours and lysed by sonication in 5 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4° C., and the supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 30,000×g for 20 minutes at 4° C. The pellet was suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7 at room temperature) containing 10 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% ascorbate. The affinity of compounds at 5HT\n2A \nreceptors were determined in equilibrium competition binding assays using [\n3\nH]ketanserin (1 nM). Nonspecific binding was defined by the addition of 10 μM mianserin. The bound radioligand was separated by filtration through GF/B filters using a cell harvester.\n\n\n5-HT\n1A \nReceptor: The cDNA corresponding to the 5-HT\n1A \nreceptor open reading frames and variable non-coding 5′- and 3′-regions, was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCEXV-3. These constructs were transfected transiently into COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method (Cullen, 1987), and harvested after 72 hours. Radioligand binding assays were performed as described above for the 5-HT\n2A \nreceptor, except that \n3\nH-8-OH-DPAT was used as the radioligand and nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 10 μM mianserin.\n\n\nOther 5-HT Receptors: Other serotonin receptor binding assays were performed according to published methods: rat 5HT\n2C \nreceptor (Julius et al., 1988); and 5-HT\n6 \n(Monsma, et al., 1993). The binding assays using the 5-HT\n4 \nreceptor were performed according to the procedures described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,879, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this application.\n\n\nOther receptors: Cell membranes expressing human dopamine D\n1\n, D\n2\n, D\n4 \nand rat D\n3 \nreceptors were purchased through BioSignal, Inc. (Montreal, Canada). Binding assays using the histamine H\n1 \nreceptor; dopamine receptors; and α\n1A\n, α\n1B\n, and α\n2 \nadrenergic receptors may be carried out according to the procedures described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,485, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this application. Binding assays using the dopamine D\n5 \nreceptor may be carried out according to the procedures described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,882,855, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this application. Binding assays for the human α\n1D \nadrenergic receptor may be carried out according to the procedures described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,156,518, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this application.\n\n\nThe methods to determine binding affinity at native transporters are described in the following publications: 5HT transporter and NE transporter (Owens et al., 1997), and DA transporter (Javitch et al, 1984).\n\n\nThe methods to determine activity at monoamine oxidase enzymes (for example, central MAO\nA \nand MAO\nB\n) are described by Otsuka and Kobayashi, 1964, and were performed by NovaScreen (Hanover, Md.) with the following modifications.\n\n\nCentral Monoamine Oxidase A Enzyme Assay: Rat brain was used as the enzyme source. The enzyme source was pre-incubated with reference compound (RO 41-1049), test compound (Example 92), and subtype selective blocker (100 nM deprenyl) for 60 minutes at 37° C. in 50 mM KPO\n4 \ncontaining 50 μM EDTA and 10 μM dithiothreitol (pH 7.2 at. 25° C.). Substrate ([\n14\nC]Serotonin, 45-60 Ci/mmol) was then added and incubated for 30 minutes. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of 1-2M citric acid. Radioactive product was extracted into xylene/ethyl acetate fluor and compared to control values by scintillation spectrophotometry in order to ascertain any interactions of test compound with central MAO\nA\n.\n\n\nCentral Monoamine Oxidase B Enzyme Assay: Rat brain was used as the enzyme source. The assay was performed as described above for central MAO\nA\n, except the reference compound was RO 166491 and the subtype selective blocker was 100 nM clorgyline. Also, the substrate ([\n14\nC]Phenylethylamine, 0.056 Ci/mmol) was added and incubated for 10 minutes.\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\nCell culture media and supplements were from Specialty Media (Lavallette, N.J.). Cell culture plates (150 mm and 96-well microtiter) were from Corning (Corning, N.Y.). Polypropylene 96-well microtiter plates were from Co-star (Cambridge, Mass.). Bovine serum albumin (ultra-fat free, A-7511) was from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.). All radioligands were from New England Nuclear (Boston, Mass.). Commercially available peptides and peptide analogs were either from Bachem California (Torrance, Calif.) or Peninsula (Belmont, Calif.). All other materials were reagent grade.\n\n\nData Analysis\n\n\nBinding data were analyzed using nonlinear regression and statistical techniques available in the GraphPAD Prism package (San Diego, Calif.). Enzymatic assay data were derived from a standard curve of reference compound data.\n\n\nThe selectivity ratios for compounds of the claimed invention were calculated from the binding data presented in Tables 1-4 of the subject application. More specifically, these ratios were calculated by dividing (a) the binding affinity (K\ni \nvalue) of said compound to a particular receptor or transporter by (b) the binding affinity (K\ni \nvalue) of said compound to the human GALR3 receptor.\n\n\nB.

GALR3 Receptor Localization\n\n\nA. Materials And Methods\n\n\nPreparation of the Anti-GALR3 Antiserum\n\n\n\nBioSource International, Hopkinton, Mass. performed the immunization and maintenance of rabbits. Following a pre-immune bleed, one peptide for each GAL receptor was injected into a pair of New Zealand white rabbits. The peptide sequences was chosen based on sequence specificity and immunogenicity. The rabbit anti-GALR3 antiserum were raised against C-terminal epitopes corresponding to amino acids 357-370 (Genbank accession number AF073798). The peptides were conjugated to the carrier KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) by a cross linker and subcutaneously injected into the rabbits. The generation of the anti-GALR3 antiserum required OVA followed by a third series of injections with the GALR3 peptide conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TTOX). All injections were done using the Freund's Adjuvant System. Once immunoreactivity was established (see below) the antiserum was affinity purified by passing it over an agarose based column thiol coupled to its antigenic peptide. The column was washed and the antiserum was eluted using a low pH glycine buffer. The purified material was dialyzed, the optical density is taken at 280λ and the purified antiserum was frozen.\n\n\nCharacterization of the Anti-GALR3 Antiserum\n\n\nRecombinant GAL1, GAL2, and GALR3 Receptor Transfected Cells\n\n\nTo determine the ability of the GALR3 antiserum to recognize only the GALR3 receptor protein in vitro, COS-7 cells were grown on poly-L-lysine-coated plastic chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, Ill.) and transfected with recombinant rat GAL receptors (Genbank accession numbers U30290, AF010318, AF073798, respectively) or expression vector only (for mock-transfected cells) as previously described by Borowsky et al. (1999). Receptor expression was confirmed by radioligand binding. Briefly, a subset of slides was washed three times in binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% bacitracin) and incubated in 500 μl binding buffer containing porcine \n125\nI-galanin (625,000 dpm) plus or minus 10 μM porcine galanin. After incubation at room temperature for 1 hour, the binding buffer was aspirated. and slides were rinsed three times in ice cold 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5. Cells were solubilized in 1 ml of 0.1 N NaOH and 0.05% sodium deoxycholate for 30 minutes, then transferred to test tubes for gamma counting of \n125\nI. To evaluate antibody activity another subset of slides were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) to remove the medium and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) then permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS and incubated in 3% normal goat serum for 30 minutes to minimize nonspecific binding of the primary antibody. Cells were incubated overnight at 4° C. with the anti-GALR3 antiserum (1:1000 dilution). The cells were rinsed three times with PBS, incubated for 30 minutes at 25° C. with, goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif.), rinsed and processed using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) reaction of Sternberger et al. (1982). Control experiments for antibody specificity were (1) incubation of the cells in primary antiserum that had been preabsorbed with the respective antigenic peptide (20 μg/ml), (2) incubation without the primary antiserum, or (3) incubation with the primary antiserum replaced by normal goat serum.\n\n\nWestern Blotting\n\n\nMembranes were prepared from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the rat recombinant receptors GAL1, GAL2, and GALR3 as previously described (Borowsky et al., 1999). Transfected cells were lysed by sonication in ice-cold sonication buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 5 mM EDTA). Cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 4° C. for 10 minutes at 200 g. The supernatant was then fractionated by centrifugation at 4° C. for 18 minutes at 32,000 g. The resulting membrane pellet was suspended into 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EDTA. Protein samples (1-10 μg) were solubilized in 2× Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.) and fractionated by SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes for immunoblot analysis in ice-cold 25 mM Tris, pH 8, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol as previously described by Harlow and Lane (1999). Blots were incubated for 1 hour at 25° C. in blocking buffer composed of 5% non-fat dried milk in TTBS (0.1% Tween-20, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5) then for 16 hours at 25° C. with the receptor-specific polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer) (0.25 mg/ml for GAL2 or 1.5 mg/ml for GALR3). Immunoreactive bands were detected with the Phototope-HRP Detection Kit for Western Blotting (New England BioLab, Beverly, Mass.) according to the protocol. Briefly, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG then developed with a mixture of LumiGLO plus hydrogen peroxide and recorded by chemiluminescence on Kodak Biomax-ML film (Kodak, Rochester, N.Y.).\n\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\n\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats, (200-250 g; Charles Rivers, Rochester, N.Y.) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of \nketamine\n 20 mg/kg (RBI, Natick, Mass.) and xylazine 0.2 mg/kg (Bayer, Shawnee Mission, Kans.) then transcardially perfused with 200 ml PBS, pH 7.4 followed by 200 ml 4% PFA in PBS. The brains and spinal cords were removed, blocked, and postfixed in the same fixative for 4 hours at 4° C. then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4° C. for 48 hours before freezing on dry ice. Coronal brain sections and transverse spinal cord sections were cut at 30 μm using a freezing microtome. Tissue sections were immediately immersed in PBS and stored at 4° C. until use. Sections were processed free-floating according to the protocol outlined in NEN Life Science Products TSA (Tyramide Signal Amplification) Indirect Kit. Briefly, tissue sections were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.)/PBS, incubated in 1% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.)/PBS to remove endogenous peroxidase activity then blocked in TNB Buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.5% Blocking Reagent. Sections were incubated for 24 hours at 4° C. in either the anti-GAL2 or anti-GALR3 antiserum (1:100). Following incubation with the primary antiserum, the tissue sections were washed in TNT Buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) followed by incubation at 25° C. for 30 minutes with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:200) (Sternberger Monoclonals Inc., Lutherville, Md.). Tissue sections were rinsed in TNT Buffer and incubated in a solution containing biotinylated tyramide to amplify the signal then rinsed in TNT buffer and incubated with HRP-conjugated to streptavidin at 25° C. for 30 minutes. An immunoperoxidase reaction was done by incubating the section in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) (0.05%) in 0.1 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and adding hydrogen peroxide to 0.006% immediately before use. The reaction was stopped in water and the sections mounted on microscopic slide with mounting medium (40% ethanol: gelatin) and counterstained with Cresyl violet then coverslipped for light microscopy.\n\n\nOptimal GALR3 antibody concentrations (1:200) for rat brain sections were determined in preliminary titration experiments. Experimental controls in the tissue sections included (1) incubation in normal rabbit serum or (2) omission of the primary antiserum.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\nCOS-7 cells and tissue sections were examined using a Zeiss Axioscope. A total of 6 male rats were examined with the anti-GALR3 antiserum. The identification of GALR3-LI in the transfected cells and brain regions was based on the presence of immunoreactivity appearing as a brownish precipitate in individual cells and their projections or in the neuropil of the tissue by light microscopy. The descriptions of neuroanatomic boundaries are based on the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (1998).\n\n\nB. Results\n\n\nCharacterization of the GALR3 Antiserum\n\n\nRecombinant GAL1, GAL2, and GALR3 Receptor Transfected Cells\n\n\nThe ability of the anti-GALR3 antiserum to recognize only the GALR3 receptor protein in vitro was established by performing immunocytochemistry on COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the recombinant receptor proteins for the rat GAL1, GAL2, and GALR3, or mock-transfected with vector only. Specific porcine \n125\nI-galanin binding was detected for all transfectants except mock-transfected cells. An immune response was detected only in the COS-7 cells incubated with the antiserum generated for the particular recombinant receptor. Specifically, no immune reaction was observed with the anti-GALR3 antiserum (1:1000) in GAL1 or GAL2 transfected cells. Furthermore, no visible immune reaction was detected in the mock-transfected cells. Incubation of the cells in primary antiserum that had been preabsorbed with the antigenic peptide (20 μg/ml) or without the primary antiserum or with the primary replaced by normal goat serum did not result in an immune response.\n\n\nTaken together, these data demonstrate that the anti-GALR3 antiserum recognizes the receptor against which it was generated and does not show cross reactivity with other known GAL receptors.\n\n\nWestern Blots\n\n\nTo determine the specificity of the anti-GALR3 antiserum, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected either with recombinant rat GAL2 or GALR3 receptors or with expression vector only; membranes were then isolated for evaluation by immunoblotting (see \nFIG. 5\n). The anti-GALR3 antiserum labeled proteins in membranes only from rat GALR3-transfected cells; a predominant band was evident with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 56 kDa (\nFIG. 5\n), somewhat higher than the amino acid-derived value of 40.4 kDa. (For comparison, apparent molecular weights determined by SDS-PAGE are 56 kDa (Servin et al., 1987) or 54 kDa (Chen et al., 1992) for native GAL receptors purified from rat brain and 54 kDa (Amiranoff et al., 1989) for native GAL receptors purified from Rin m 5F cells. These values are all higher than the amino acid-derived value any known GAL receptor subtype, including the value of 38.9 kDa for rat GAL1 (Parker et al., 1995). The apparently high molecular weight observed for rat GALR3 very likely reflects post-translational processing such as glycosylation; note that rat GALR3 contains multiple N-terminal glycosylation sites (Smith et al., 1998). Relative to the predominant band, additional species of higher molecular weight as well as lower molecular weight were labeled by the corresponding antiserum (\nFIG. 5\n). These are presumably receptor-related species composed of protein aggregates of C-terminal fragments, as they are absent in mock-transfected cells.\n\n\nImmunohistochemical Distribution of GALR3-LI in the CNS\n\n\nGALR3-like immunoreactivity (GALR3-LI) was observed in many regions of the brain, specifically, the neocortex, septum, hippocampus, amygdala, and brainstem (see Table 12). Throughout the brain and spinal cord GALR3-LI was found to be associated with neuronal profiles however, there was, neuropil staining observed in several brain regions. Several regions of the CNS almost exclusively expressed GALR3-LI, specifically the accumbens nucleus, dorsal raphe, ventral tegmental area (Table 12). There was no observable staining of the fiber tracts.\n\n\nThe specificity of the anti-GALR3 antiserum was determined in tissue sections by (1) omission of the primary antiserum or (2) incubation with normal rabbit serum. No specific staining was observed in either condition. Preabsorption of the GALR3 primary antiserum with the antigenic peptide (10 μg/ml) decreased but did not completely block staining in the tissue sections as in the transfected cells. This was most likely related to the different localization approaches. In the transiently transfected COS-7 cells the expression of GALR3 receptor protein was relatively high therefore, indirect immunocytochemistry with no amplification was used. In contrast, GALR3 receptor protein expression is presumed to be relatively lower in the tissue sections and for that reason the TSA (amplification) technique was employed. It is possible that because of the amplification (1000-fold) in the TSA technique even small amounts of unabsorbed antiserum may result in a signal.\n\n\nDistribution of GALR3-LI in the Rat CNS\n\n\nCerebral Cortex\n\n\nGALR3-LI was widespread in the cerebral cortex and the distribution pattern extended rostrocaudally. A weak to moderate GALR3-LI was seen in numerous cell bodies in the anterior cingulate cortex.\n\n\nSeptal Region\n\n\nAn extensive and densely stained fiber network was seen throughout the entire lateral, intermediate and medial septal nuclei. The dorsal division of the lateral septum contained scarce moderately GALR3-like immunoreactive somata.\n\n\nBasal Ganglia\n\n\nNumerous moderately GALR3-like immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were present in the shell and core of the accumbens nucleus. The cell bodies of the subthalamic nucleus, a relay nucleus in the basal ganglia, contained weak GALR3-LI.\n\n\nAmygdala and Extended Amygdala\n\n\nIn general, GALR3-LI was weak throughout the amygdala. Scattered cell bodies and fibers exhibited weak staining in several nuclei. Very fine GALR3-like immunoreactive fibers with scattered moderately labeled cells were detected in the central amygdaloid nucleus.\n\n\nMidbrain/Mesencephalon\n\n\nLabeled cells were detected within the dorsal raphe and projections from these cells were seen converging toward the midline of the raphe. Moderately immunoreactive scattered cells were evident in the ventral tegmental area.\n\n\nBrain Stem\n\n\nIntense staining was observed in cell bodies in the locus coeruleus.\n\n\nThe distribution of rat GALR3 protein in the CNS using receptor subtype selective polyclonal antibodies and tyramide signal amplification (TSA) immunocytochemistry is illustrated in Table 12. These were qualitative evaluations for the rat GALR3 receptor protein distribution based on the relative intensity of the chromogen (3,3′-diaminobenzidine) observed in individual cells at the microscopic level.\n\n\nA total of 4 rat brains were analyzed for this study. As shown in Table 12, the strength of the signal obtained in various regions of the rat brain was graded as weak (+), or moderate (++) or intense (+++).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPotential\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTherapeutic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREGION\n\n\ncells\n\n\nfibers\n\n\nApplication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelencephalon\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontal cortex\n\n\n++\n\n\n \n\n\nAnxiety/Depression\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCingulate cortex\n\n\n++\n\n\n \n\n\nAnxiety/Depression\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasal ganglia\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccumbens nucleus\n\n\n++\n\n\n−\n\n\nTreatment of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\npositive symptoms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nof schizophrenia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTreatment of drug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\naddiction.

The anatomical distribution of the GALR3 receptor protein in the rat CNS was determined using a modified immunohistochemical technique to enhance sensitivity and delectability via tyramide signal amplification (Toda et al., 1999).\n\n\nThe results indicate that the expression GALR3-LI was primarily found in neuronal profiles with neuropil labeling detectable in several areas. In general, the distribution of GALR3-LI is in good agreement with the reported distribution for galanin-LI, galanin binding sites, and GALR3 mRNA in the rat brain (for recent review, Branchek et al., 2000). Overall, GALR3-LI was extensively distributed throughout the brain. Paralleling the distribution of galanin binding sites GALR3-LI was observed in ventral regions of the brain.\n\n\nThe localization of the GALR3 protein in the dorsal raphe and locus coeruleus suggests a potential therapeutic application of galanin receptor antagonists in the treatment of depression by attenuating galanin's inhibitory tone on both of these regions.\n\n\nA decrease in central serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission has been implicated in depression. GALR3 antagonists could possibly act via GALR3 receptors on the cell bodies of dorsal raphe neurons to increase firing rate of raphe neurons thus increasing 5-HT release in the telencephalon and diencephalon. Another possible site of action for a GALR3 antagonist could be on postsynaptic GALR3 receptors in the limbic forebrain to block the putative ability of galanin to negatively regulate 5-HT\n1A \nreceptor transmission (Misane et al, 1998).\n\n\nUnlike the dorsal raphe cells, the cells of the locus coeruleus express abundant galanin under normal conditions and it has been proposed that galanin may be released from dendrites and soma of the noradrenergic cell bodies (for review, Hökfelt et al., 1998). The ascending afferent projections of the locus coeruleus are extensive throughout the brain. Changes in the noradrenergic system have been hypothesized to be involved in depression-related behaviors and symptoms (for review, Weiss et al., 1998). The ventral tegmental area (VTA) receives projections from the locus coeruleus that have been reported to co-localize galanin and noradrenaline. It has been proposed that in certain pathological states (ex. stress induced depression) galanin released from noradrenergic terminals in the VTA inhibits dopaminergic neurons in the region that results in decreased dopamine release in the forebrain regions, particularly the accumbens nucleus and prefrontal cortex. This decrease in dopamine release produces a decreased motor activation and anhedonia. GALR3 has been identified in all of these regions and thus presents itself as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of depression. Drugs that would effectively decrease galanin's release in the VTA whether at the level of the locus coeruleus (somatodendritic GALR3 receptors to decrease the activity of LC cells) or in the VTA itself (presynaptically on NE/GAL terminals in the VTA or via GALR3 receptors on VTA-DA neurons to prevent the hyperpolarization VTA-DA cells by released galanin) would produce an antidepressant effect.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association (1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition.
