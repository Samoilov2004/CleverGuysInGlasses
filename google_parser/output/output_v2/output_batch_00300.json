Description\n\n\n\n\n AZOLYL UREA COMPOUNDS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application no.\n\n\n61/349,110, filed May 27, 2010. The disclosure of the above referenced application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. \n\n\nFIELD \n\n\n [0002] Provided herein are azolyl urea compounds. In certain embodiments, the compounds are modulators of type III receptor tyrosine kinase family. In other embodiments, the compounds are modulators of CSF-1R kinases. Also provided are compositions comprising the compounds and methods of use thereof. The \n\n\ncompounds provided are useful in the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of a disease or disorder related to CSF-1R kinase activity or one or more symptoms associated with such diseases or disorders. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n [0003] Protein kinases (PKs) are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxy groups on tyrosine, serine and threonine residues of proteins. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are a sub-family of protein kinases that play a critical role in cell signaling and are involved in the process of tumorigenesis including cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. A class of RTK known as the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family, which includes the receptors \n\n\nPDGFR a, PDGFR β, FLT3, KIT, VEGFR and CSF-1R, has been implicated in various proliferative and inflammatory diseases. \n\n\n [0004] CSF-1R (also known as macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor\n\n\n(M-CSFR) or fms) is a receptor for the macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF-1). Binding of the CSF-1 ligand to its receptor results in dimerization and auto-phosphorylation of the receptor and leads to activation of downstream signal transduction pathways including the PI3K/Akt and the mitogen activating protein kinase MAPK pathways. Activation of CSF-1R leads to the proliferation, survival, motility and differentiation of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and hence plays a role in normal tissue development and immune defense. Activation of CSF- 1R also leads to the proliferation and differentiation of osteoclast precursors and therefore mediates the process of bone resorption. \n\n [0005] Because of its role in osteoclast biology, CSF-IR is believed to be an important therapeutic target for osteoporosis and inflammatory arthritis. For example, elevated M-CFS signaling leads to elevated osteoclast activity, which leads to bone loss attending arthritis and other inflammatory bone erosion. (See Scott et al. \n\n\nRheumatology 2000, 39: 122-132, Ritchlin et al. J. Clin. Invest. 2003, 111 :821-831). Inhibition of CSF-IR therefore represents a promising therapeutic approach for arthritis and other inflammatory bone erosion which is further supported by the efficacy data of known CSF-IR inhibitors such as ΚΪ20227 and GW2580 in arthritic animal models (See Conwat et al. JP£T2008, 326:41-50 and Ohno et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 2008, 38:283-291). Dysregulation of osteoclast development and disruption in the balance of bone resorption and bone formation that underlie osteoporosis might also be treated with a modulator of CSF-IR. \n\n\n [0006] Elevated expression or activation of CSF-IR and/or its ligand have been found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, prostate, breast, ovarian, endometrial, colorectal, pancreatic and a variety of other cancers, and elevated levels of M-CSF is associated with poor prognosis in certain cancers (See, Muller-Tidow et al. Clin Cancer Res, 2004, 10:1241-1249, Bauknecht et al. Cancer Detect. Prev., 1994, 18: 231-239; Baiocchi G et al. Cancer 1991, 67:990-996; Kirma et al Cancer Res. 2007; Sapi et al. Exp. Biol. Med., 2004, 229: 1-11; Kluger et al. Clin. Cane. Res. 2004 10:173-177; Mroczko et al, Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2005 43: 146-50 and Mroczko et al, Clin. Chim. Acta 2007, 380:208-212). The data suggests that CSF-IR may be a valuable therapeutic target for these solid tumors. \n\n\n[0007] Early studies have associated elevated expression of M-CSF with increased leukocyte infiltration of solid tumors in human breast and ovarian cancers (Scholl et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994, 86: 120-126, Tang et al. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990, 44: 189-198). Further studies have shown that M-CSF is one of several cytokines implicated in the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that contribute to tumor angiogenesis and tumor progression to metastasis, and more recently, that the preclinical inhibitor GW2580 inhibits tumor metastasis and angiogenesis in mice tumor xenograft experiments (Priceman et al. Blood 2010 115(7): 1461-1471). Stimulated osteoclast activity is also believed to underlie the pathophysiology of bone metastases. (Lipton, J. Support. Oncol. 2004 2:205-220). Metastatic bone lesions results in significant localized bone loss and lead to skeletal morbidity, symptoms which include bone pain, bone fractures and hypercalcemia. \n\n Inhibition of CSF-IR therefore may therefore provide therapy for solid tumors and metastatic cancer including metastases to the bone. \n\n\n [0008] KIT (or stem cell factor receptor, or SCFR) is another member of the\n\n\nRTK family, and the presence of kit mutations is a key diagnostic marker for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) (Duensing et al. Cancer Investigation 2004, 22(1): 106-116). Gleevec® (imatinib mesylate or STI571), the first FDA-approved RTK inhibitor originally approved for c-Abl-mediated chronic myeloid leukemia, gained FDA-approval for KIT-mediated GIST in 2002 and has validated the molecular-based approach of Kit inhibition for the treatment of GIST. (Giorgi and Verweij, Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005 4(3):495-501). Gain of function mutations of the Kit receptor are also associated with mast cell/myeloid leukemia and \n\n\nseminomas/dysgerminomas (Blume -Jensen Nature 2001 411(17): 355-365. KIT mutations have been also identified in certain melanomas and is recognized as a potential therapeutic target for melanoma (Curtain et al. J Clin. Oncol. 2006 \n\n\n24(26):4340-4346). \n\n\n [0009] There continues to be a need for the identification of small molecules that inhibit RTKs, particularly compounds useful for the treatment of CSF-IR- or KIT- mediated diseases. \n\n\n BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n\n\n [0010] Fig 1 depicts the mean microradiograph score from the rat MRMT-1 bone metastases model.

Such chiral centers may be of either the (R) or (S) configuration, or may be a mixture thereof. It is to be understood that the chiral centers of the compounds provided herein may undergo epimerization in vivo. As such, one of skill in the art will recognize that administration of a compound in its (R) form is equivalent, for compounds that undergo epimerization in vivo, to administration of the compound in its (S) form. \n\n\n [0052] Optically active (+) and (-), (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques, such as chromatography on a chiral stationary phase. \n\n\n[0053] As used herein, \"isotopic composition\" refers to the amount of each isotope present for a given atom, and \"natural isotopic composition\" refers to the naturally occurring isotopic composition or abundance for a given atom. Atoms containing their natural isotopic composition may also be referred to herein as \"non- enriched\" atoms. Unless otherwise designated, the atoms of the compounds recited herein are meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. For example, unless \n\n otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as \"H\" or \"hydrogen\", the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural isotopic composition. \n\n\n[0054] As used herein, \"isotopically enriched\" refers to an atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. \n\n\n\"Isotopically enriched\" may also refer to a compound containing at least one atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. \n\n\n [0055] As used herein, \"isotopic enrichment\" refers to the percentage of incorporation of an amount of a specific isotope at a given atom in a molecule in the place of that atom's natural isotopic abundance. For example, deuterium enrichment of 1% at a given position means that 1% of the molecules in a given sample contain deuterium at the specified position. Because the naturally occurring distribution of deuterium is about 0.0156%, deuterium enrichment at any position in a compound synthesized using non-enriched starting materials is about 0.0156%. The isotopic enrichment of the compounds provided herein can be determined using conventional analytical methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. \n\n\n[0056] Where the number of any given substituent is not specified (e.g., haloalkyl), there may be one or more substituents present. For example, \"haloalkyl\" may include one or more of the same or different halogens. \n\n\n[0057] In the description herein, if there is any discrepancy between a chemical name and chemical structure, the structure controls. \n\n\n[0058] \"Anti-cancer agents\" refers to anti-metabolites (e.g., 5-fluoro-uracil, methotrexate, fludarabine), antimicrotubule agents (e.g., vinca alkaloids such as vincristine, vinblastine; taxanes such as paclitaxel, docetaxel), alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, melphalan, carmustine, nitrosoureas such as \n\n\nbischloroethylnitrosurea and hydroxyurea), platinum agents (e.g. cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, JM-216 or satraplatin, CI-973), anthracyclines (e.g., doxrubicin, daunorubicin), antitumor antibiotics (e.g., mitomycin, idarubicin, adriamycin, daunomycin), topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., etoposide, camptothecins), anti-angiogenesis agents (e.g. Sutent® and Bevacizumab) or any other cytotoxic agents, (estramustine phosphate, prednimustine), hormones or hormone agonists, antagonists, partial agonists or partial antagonists, kinase inhibitors, and radiation treatment. \n\n [0059] \"Anti-inflammatory agents\" refers to matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., anti-TNF molecules, TNF soluble receptors, and IL1) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as prostaglandin synthase inhibitors (e.g., choline magnesium salicylate, salicylsalicyclic acid), COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors), or glucocorticoid receptor agonists such as corticosteroids, methylprednisone, prednisone, or cortisone. \n\n\n[0060] As used herein, the abbreviations for any protective groups, amino acids and other compounds, are, unless indicated otherwise, in accord with their common usage, recognized abbreviations, or the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (see, Biochem. 1972, 77:942-944). \n\n\n B.

(morpholinomethyl)picolinamide, and \n\n\n 6-(aminomethyl)-N-(4-(3-(5-(tert-butyl)isoxazol-3-yl)ureido)phenyl)picolinamide hydrochloride. \n\n\n [00142] Also provided herein are isotopically enriched analogs of the compounds provided herein. Isotopic enrichment (for example, deuteration) of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (\"PK\"), pharmacodynamics (\"PD\"), and toxicity profiles, has been demonstrated previously with some classes of drugs. See, for example, Lijinsky et. al, Food Cosmet. Toxicol, 20: 393 (1982); Lijinsky et. al., J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 69: 1127 (1982); Mangold et. al, Mutation Res. 308: 33 (1994); Gordon et. al, Drug Metab. Dispos., 15: 589 (1987); Zello et. al, \n\n\nMetabolism, 43: 487 (1994); Gately et. al., J. Nucl. Med., 27: 388 (1986); Wade D, Chem. Biol. Interact. I ll: 191 (1999). \n\n\n [00143] Isotopic enrichment of a drug can be used, for example, to (1) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (2) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (3) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (4) decrease the amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect, (5) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed, and/or (6) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not. \n\n\n[00144] Replacement of an atom for one of its isotopes often will result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"KIE\"). For example, if a C-H bond is broken during a rate- determining step in a chemical reaction {i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the \n\n Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"DKIE\"). (See, e.g, Foster et al., Adv. Drug Res., vol. 14, pp. 1-36 (1985); Kushner et al, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol, vol. 77, pp. 79- 88 (1999)). \n\n\n [00145] Tritium (\"T\") is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used in research, fusion reactors, neutron generators and radiopharmaceuticals. Tritium is a hydrogen atom that has 2 neutrons in the nucleus and has an atomic weight close to 3. It occurs naturally in the environment in very low concentrations, most commonly found as T\n2\n0. Tritium decays slowly (half-life = 12.3 years) and emits a low energy beta particle that cannot penetrate the outer layer of human skin. Internal exposure is the main hazard associated with this isotope, yet it must be ingested in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. As compared with deuterium, a lesser amount of tritium must be consumed before it reaches a hazardous level. Substitution of tritium (\"T\") for hydrogen results in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects. Similarly, substitution of isotopes for other elements, including, but not limited to, \n13\nC or \n14\nC for carbon, \n33\nS, \n34\nS, or \n36\nS for sulfur, \n15\nN for nitrogen, and \n17\n0 or \n18\n0 for oxygen, will provide a similar kinetic isotope effects. \n\n\n[00146] In another embodiment, provided herein are methods of using the disclosed compounds and compositions, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or hydrates thereof, for the local or systemic treatment or prophylaxis of human and veterinary diseases, disorders and conditions modulated or otherwise affected mediated via CSF-1R kinase activity. \n\n\n C. FORMULATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL \n\n\n COMPOSITIONS \n\n\n[00147] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein contain \n\n\ntherapeutically effective amounts of one or more of compounds provided herein that are useful in the prevention, treatment, or amelioration of CSF-1R kinase mediated diseases or one or more of the symptoms thereof. \n\n\n [00148] The compositions contain one or more compounds provided herein.\n\n\nThe compounds can be formulated into suitable pharmaceutical preparations such as solutions, suspensions, tablets, dispersible tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations or elixirs, for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration, as well as transdermal patch preparation and dry powder inhalers. Typically the compounds described above are formulated \n\n into pharmaceutical compositions using techniques and procedures well known in the art. \n\n\n [00149] In the compositions, effective concentrations of one or more compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate or prodrug is (are) mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier or vehicle. The concentrations of the compounds in the compositions are effective for delivery of an amount, upon administration, that treats, prevents, or ameliorates one or more of the symptoms of CSF-1R kinase mediated diseases. \n\n\n [00150] Typically, the compositions are formulated for single dosage administration. To formulate a composition, the weight fraction of compound is dissolved, suspended, dispersed or otherwise mixed in a selected vehicle at an effective concentration such that the treated condition is relieved or ameliorated. Pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles suitable for administration of the compounds provided herein include any such carriers known to those skilled in the art to be suitable for the particular mode of administration. \n\n\n [00151] In addition, the compounds may be formulated as the sole \n\n\npharmaceutically active ingredient in the composition or may be combined with other active ingredients. Liposomal suspensions, including tissue-targeted liposomes, such as tumor-targeted liposomes, may also be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, liposome formulations may be prepared as known in the art. \n\n\nBriefly, liposomes such as multilamellar vesicles (MLV's) may be formed by drying down egg phosphatidyl choline and brain phosphatidyl serine (7:3 molar ratio) on the inside of a flask. A solution of a compound provided herein in phosphate buffered saline lacking divalent cations (PBS) is added and the flask shaken until the lipid film is dispersed. The resulting vesicles are washed to remove unencapsulated compound, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended in PBS. \n\n\n [00152] The active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on the patient treated. The therapeutically effective concentration may be determined empirically by testing the compounds in in vitro and in vivo systems described herein and then extrapolated therefrom for dosages for humans. \n\n [00153] The concentration of active compound in the pharmaceutical composition will depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the active compound, the physicochemical characteristics of the compound, the dosage schedule, and amount administered as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. For example, the amount that is delivered is sufficient to ameliorate one or more of the symptoms of CSF-1R kinase mediated diseases. \n\n\n[00154] Typically a therapeutically effective dosage should produce a serum concentration of active ingredient of from about 1 ng/ml to about 50-100 μg/ml. The pharmaceutical compositions typically should provide a dosage of from about 10 mg to about 4000 mg of compound per kilogram of body weight per day. Pharmaceutical dosage unit forms are prepared to provide from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg and in certain embodiments, from about 10 mg to about 500 mg, from about 20 mg to about 250 mg or from about 25 mg to about 100 mg of the essential active ingredient or a combination of essential ingredients per dosage unit form. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical dosage unit forms are prepared to provide about 10 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg or 2000 mg of the essential active ingredient. \n\n\n [00155] The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the disease being treated and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the \n\n\nadministration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed compositions. \n\n\n [00156] Pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives include acids, bases, enol ethers and esters, salts, esters, hydrates, solvates and prodrug forms. The derivative is selected such that its pharmacokinetic properties are superior to the corresponding neutral compound. \n\n [00157] Thus, effective concentrations or amounts of one or more of the compounds described herein or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof are mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier or vehicle for systemic, topical or local administration to form pharmaceutical compositions. Compounds are included in an amount effective for ameliorating one or more symptoms of, or for treating or preventing CSF-IR kinase mediated diseases. The concentration of active compound in the composition will depend on absorption, inactivation, excretion rates of the active compound, the dosage schedule, amount administered, particular formulation as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. \n\n\n [00158] The compositions are intended to be administered by a suitable route, including, but not limited to, orally, parenterally, rectally, topically and locally. For oral administration, capsules and tablets can be formulated. The compositions are in liquid, semi-liquid or solid form and are formulated in a manner suitable for each route of administration. \n\n\n [00159] Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, \n\n\nsubcutaneous, or topical application can include any of the following components: a sterile diluent, such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oil, polyethylene glycol, glycerine, propylene glycol, dimethyl acetamide or other synthetic solvent; antimicrobial agents, such as benzyl alcohol and methyl parabens; antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid and sodium bisulfite; chelating agents, such as \n\n\nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); buffers, such as acetates, citrates and phosphates; and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. Parenteral preparations can be enclosed in ampules, disposable syringes or single or multiple dose vials made of glass, plastic or other suitable material. \n\n\n[00160] In instances in which the compounds exhibit insufficient solubility, methods for solubilizing compounds may be used. Such methods are known to those of skill in this art, and include, but are not limited to, using cosolvents, such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), using surfactants, such as TWEEN®, or dissolution in aqueous sodium bicarbonate. \n\n\n [00161] Upon mixing or addition of the compound(s), the resulting mixture may be a solution, suspension, emulsion or the like. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. In one embodiment, \n\n the effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the symptoms of the disease, disorder or condition treated and may be empirically determined. \n\n\n[00162] The pharmaceutical compositions are provided for administration to humans and animals in unit dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, and oral solutions or suspensions, and oil-water emulsions containing suitable quantities of the compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. The pharmaceutically \n\n\ntherapeutically active compounds and derivatives thereof are typically formulated and administered in unit-dosage forms or multiple-dosage forms. Unit-dose forms as used herein refer to physically discrete units suitable for human and animal subjects and packaged individually as is known in the art. Each unit-dose contains a \n\n\npredetermined quantity of the therapeutically active compound sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier, vehicle or diluent. Examples of unit-dose forms include ampules and syringes and individually packaged tablets or capsules. Unit-dose forms may be administered in fractions or multiples thereof. A multiple-dose form is a plurality of identical unit-dosage forms packaged in a single container to be administered in segregated unit-dose form. Examples of multiple-dose forms include vials, bottles of tablets or capsules or bottles of pints or gallons. Hence, multiple dose form is a multiple of unit-doses which are not segregated in packaging. \n\n\n [00163] Sustained-release preparations can also be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the compound provided herein, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained- release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl- methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides, copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene -vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid- glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D- (-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated compound remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 °C, resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in \n\n their structure. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism of action involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S--S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions \n\n\n[00164] Dosage forms or compositions containing active ingredient in the range of 0.005% to 100% with the balance made up from non-toxic carrier may be prepared. For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic composition is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talcum, cellulose derivatives, sodium crosscarmellose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate or sodium saccharin. Such compositions include solutions, suspensions, tablets, capsules, powders and sustained release formulations, such as, but not limited to, implants and microencapsulated delivery systems, and biodegradable, biocompatible polymers, such as collagen, ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, polyorthoesters, polylactic acid and others. \n\n\nMethods for preparation of these compositions are known to those skilled in the art. The contemplated compositions may contain about 0.001%- 100% active ingredient, in certain embodiments, about 0.1-85%), typically about 75-95%). \n\n\n[00165] The active compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives may be prepared with carriers that protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as time release formulations or coatings. \n\n\n [00166] The compositions may include other active compounds to obtain desired combinations of properties. The compounds provided herein, or \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof as described herein, may also be advantageously administered for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes together with another pharmacological agent known in the general art to be of value in treating one or more of the diseases or medical conditions referred to hereinabove, such as CSF- 1R kinase mediated diseases. It is to be understood that such combination therapy constitutes a further aspect of the compositions and methods of treatment provided herein. \n\n\n 1. Compositions for oral administration \n\n [00167] Oral pharmaceutical dosage forms are either solid, gel or liquid. The solid dosage forms are tablets, capsules, granules, and bulk powders. Types of oral tablets include compressed, chewable lozenges and tablets which may be \n\n\nenteric-coated, sugar-coated or film-coated. Capsules may be hard or soft gelatin capsules, while granules and powders may be provided in non-effervescent or effervescent form with the combination of other ingredients known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n [00168] In certain embodiments, the formulations are solid dosage forms, such as capsules or tablets. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder; a diluent; a disintegrating agent; a lubricant; a glidant; a sweetening agent; and a flavoring agent. \n\n\n [00169] Examples of binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gum \n\n\ntragacanth, glucose solution, acacia mucilage, gelatin solution, sucrose and starch paste.

For example, the composition can be formulated in an enteric coating that maintains its \n\n integrity in the stomach and releases the active compound in the intestine. The composition may also be formulated in combination with an antacid or other such ingredient. \n\n\n [00171] When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to material of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. In addition, dosage unit forms can contain various other materials which modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar and other enteric agents. The compounds can also be administered as a component of an elixir, suspension, syrup, wafer, sprinkle, chewing gum or the like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and colorings and flavors. \n\n\n [00172] The active materials can also be mixed with other active materials which do not impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired action, such as antacids, H2 blockers, and diuretics. The active ingredient is a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof as described herein. Higher concentrations, up to about 98% by weight of the active ingredient may be included. \n\n\n [00173] Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers included in tablets are binders, lubricants, diluents, disintegrating agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, and wetting agents. Enteric-coated tablets, because of the enteric-coating, resist the action of stomach acid and dissolve or disintegrate in the neutral or alkaline intestines. Sugar-coated tablets are compressed tablets to which different layers of \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable substances are applied. Film-coated tablets are compressed tablets which have been coated with a polymer or other suitable coating. Multiple compressed tablets are compressed tablets made by more than one compression cycle utilizing the pharmaceutically acceptable substances previously mentioned. Coloring agents may also be used in the above dosage forms. Flavoring and sweetening agents are used in compressed tablets, sugar-coated, multiple compressed and chewable tablets. Flavoring and sweetening agents are especially useful in the formation of chewable tablets and lozenges. \n\n\n[00174] Liquid oral dosage forms include aqueous solutions, emulsions, suspensions, solutions and/or suspensions reconstituted from non-effervescent granules and effervescent preparations reconstituted from effervescent granules. \n\n Aqueous solutions include, for example, elixirs and syrups. Emulsions are either oil-in- water or water-in-oil. \n\n\n [00175] Elixirs are clear, sweetened, hydroalcoholic preparations. \n\n\n Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in elixirs include solvents. Syrups are concentrated aqueous solutions of a sugar, for example, sucrose, and may contain a preservative. An emulsion is a two-phase system in which one liquid is dispersed in the form of small globules throughout another liquid. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in emulsions are non-aqueous liquids, emulsifying agents and preservatives. Suspensions use pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agents and preservatives. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances used in non-effervescent granules, to be reconstituted into a liquid oral dosage form, include diluents, sweeteners and wetting agents. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances used in effervescent granules, to be reconstituted into a liquid oral dosage form, include organic acids and a source of carbon dioxide. Coloring and flavoring agents are used in all of the above dosage forms. \n\n\n [00176] Solvents include glycerin, sorbitol, ethyl alcohol and syrup. Examples of preservatives include glycerin, methyl and propylparaben, benzoic add, sodium benzoate and alcohol. Examples of non-aqueous liquids utilized in emulsions include mineral oil and cottonseed oil. Examples of emulsifying agents include gelatin, acacia, tragacanth, bentonite, and surfactants such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. Suspending agents include sodium carboxymethylcellulose, pectin, tragacanth, Veegum and acacia. Diluents include lactose and sucrose. Sweetening agents include sucrose, syrups, glycerin and artificial sweetening agents such as saccharin. Wetting agents include propylene glycol monostearate, sorbitan monooleate, diethylene glycol monolaurate and polyoxyethylene lauryl ether. \n\n\nOrganic adds include citric and tartaric acid. Sources of carbon dioxide include sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate. Coloring agents include any of the approved certified water soluble FD and C dyes, and mixtures thereof. Flavoring agents include natural flavors extracted from plants such fruits, and synthetic blends of compounds which produce a pleasant taste sensation. \n\n\n [00177] For a solid dosage form, the solution or suspension, in for example propylene carbonate, vegetable oils or triglycerides, is encapsulated in a gelatin capsule. For a liquid dosage form, the solution, e.g., for example, in a polyethylene \n\n glycol, may be diluted with a sufficient quantity of a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier, e.g. , water, to be easily measured for administration. \n\n\n[00178] Alternatively, liquid or semi-solid oral formulations may be prepared by dissolving or dispersing the active compound or salt in vegetable oils, glycols, triglycerides, propylene glycol esters {e.g., propylene carbonate) and other such carriers, and encapsulating these solutions or suspensions in hard or soft gelatin capsule shells. Other useful formulations include, but are not limited to, those containing a compound provided herein, a dialkylated mono- or poly-alkylene glycol, including, but not limited to, 1 ,2-dimethoxymethane, diglyme, triglyme, tetraglyme, polyethylene glycol-350-dimethyl ether, polyethylene glycol-550-dimethyl ether, polyethylene glycol-750-dimethyl ether wherein 350, 550 and 750 refer to the approximate average molecular weight of the polyethylene glycol, and one or more antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate, vitamin E, hydroquinone, hydroxycoumarins, ethanolamine, lecithin, cephalin, ascorbic acid, malic acid, sorbitol, phosphoric acid, thiodipropionic acid and its esters, and dithiocarbamates. \n\n\n [00179] Other formulations include, but are not limited to, aqueous alcoholic solutions including a pharmaceutically acceptable acetal. Alcohols used in these formulations are any pharmaceutically acceptable water-miscible solvents having one or more hydroxyl groups, including, but not limited to, propylene glycol and ethanol. Acetals include, but are not limited to, di(lower alkyl) acetals of lower alkyl aldehydes such as acetaldehyde diethyl acetal. \n\n\n [00180] In all embodiments, tablets and capsules formulations may be coated as known by those of skill in the art in order to modify or sustain dissolution of the active ingredient. Thus, for example, they may be coated with a conventional enterically digestible coating, such as phenylsalicylate, waxes and cellulose acetate phthalate. \n\n\n 2. Injectables, solutions and emulsions \n\n\n[00181] Parenteral administration, generally characterized by injection, either subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously is also contemplated herein. \n\n\nInjectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol or ethanol. In addition, if desired, the pharmaceutical compositions to be \n\n administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, stabilizers, solubility enhancers, and other such agents, such as for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate and cyclodextrins. In one embodiment, the composition is administered as an aqueous solution with hydroxypropyl-beta- cyclodextrin (HPBCD) as an excipient. In one embodiment, the aqueous solution contains about 1% to about 50% HPBCD. In one embodiment, the aqueous solution contains about 1%, 3%, 5%, 10% or about 20% HPBCD. \n\n\n [00182] Implantation of a slow-release or sustained-release system, such that a constant level of dosage is maintained is also contemplated herein. Briefly, a compound provided herein is dispersed in a solid inner matrix, e.g., \n\n\npolymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, plasticized or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethyleneterephthalate, natural rubber, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polyethylene, ethylene - vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, hydrophilic polymers such as hydrogels of esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid, collagen, cross-linked polyvinylalcohol and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate, that is surrounded by an outer polymeric membrane, e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene/vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, \n\n\npolydimethyl siloxanes, neoprene rubber, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, vinylchloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and ethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, that is insoluble in body fluids. The compound diffuses through the outer polymeric membrane in a release rate controlling step. The percentage of active compound contained in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the activity of the compound and the needs of the subject. \n\n\n [00183] Parenteral administration of the compositions includes intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations. Preparations for parenteral administration include sterile solutions ready for injection, sterile dry soluble products, such as lyophilized powders, ready to be combined with a solvent just prior to use, including hypodermic tablets, sterile suspensions ready for injection, sterile \n\n dry insoluble products ready to be combined with a vehicle just prior to use and sterile emulsions. The solutions may be either aqueous or nonaqueous. \n\n\n[00184] If administered intravenously, suitable carriers include physiological saline or phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and solutions containing thickening and solubilizing agents, such as glucose, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol and mixtures thereof. \n\n\n [00185] Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in parenteral preparations include aqueous vehicles, nonaqueous vehicles, antimicrobial agents, isotonic agents, buffers, antioxidants, local anesthetics, suspending and dispersing agents, emulsifying agents, sequestering or chelating agents and other pharmaceutically acceptable substances. \n\n\n [00186] Examples of aqueous vehicles include Sodium Chloride Injection,\n\n\nRingers Injection, Isotonic Dextrose Injection, Sterile Water Injection, Dextrose and Lactated Ringers Injection. Nonaqueous parenteral vehicles include fixed oils of vegetable origin, cottonseed oil, corn oil, sesame oil and peanut oil. Antimicrobial agents in bacteriostatic or fungistatic concentrations must be added to parenteral preparations packaged in multiple-dose containers which include phenols or cresols, mercurials, benzyl alcohol, chlorobutanol, methyl and propyl p-hydroxybenzoic acid esters, thimerosal, benzalkonium chloride and benzethonium chloride. Isotonic agents include sodium chloride and dextrose. Buffers include phosphate and citrate. \n\n\nAntioxidants include sodium bisulfate. Local anesthetics include procaine \n\n\nhydrochloride. Suspending and dispersing agents include sodium \n\n\ncarboxymethylcelluose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Emulsifying agents include Polysorbate 80 (TWEEN® 80). A sequestering or chelating agent of metal ions include EDTA. Pharmaceutical carriers also include ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol for water miscible vehicles and sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, citric acid or lactic acid for pH adjustment. \n\n\n[00187] The concentration of the pharmaceutically active compound is adjusted so that an injection provides an effective amount to produce the desired \n\n\npharmacological effect. The exact dose depends on the age, weight and condition of the patient or animal as is known in the art. \n\n\n [00188] The unit-dose parenteral preparations are packaged in an ampule, a vial or a syringe with a needle. All preparations for parenteral administration must be sterile, as is known and practiced in the art. \n\n [00189] Illustratively, intravenous or intraarterial infusion of a sterile aqueous solution containing an active compound is an effective mode of administration. \n\n\nAnother embodiment is a sterile aqueous or oily solution or suspension containing an active material injected as necessary to produce the desired pharmacological effect. \n\n\n[00190] Injectables are designed for local and systemic administration. \n\n\n Typically a therapeutically effective dosage is formulated to contain a concentration of at least about 0.1% w/w up to about 90%> w/w or more, such as more than 1% w/w of the active compound to the treated tissue(s). The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the tissue being treated and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary with the age of the individual treated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the formulations, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed formulations. \n\n\n [00191] The compound may be suspended in micronized or other suitable form or may be derivatized to produce a more soluble active product or to produce a prodrug. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the symptoms of the condition and may be empirically determined. \n\n\n 3. Lyophilized powders \n\n\n[00192] Of interest herein are also lyophilized powders, which can be reconstituted for administration as solutions, emulsions and other mixtures. They may also be reconstituted and formulated as solids or gels. \n\n\n [00193] The sterile, lyophilized powder is prepared by dissolving a compound provided herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, in a suitable solvent. The solvent may contain an excipient which improves the stability or other pharmacological component of the powder or reconstituted solution, prepared from the powder. Excipients that may be used include, but are not limited to, dextrose, \n\n sorbital, fructose, corn syrup, xylitol, glycerin, glucose, sucrose, hydroxypropyl-beta- cyclodextrin (HPBCD) or other suitable agent. The solvent may also contain a buffer, such as citrate, sodium or potassium phosphate or other such buffer known to those of skill in the art at, typically, about neutral pH. Subsequent sterile filtration of the solution followed by lyophilization under standard conditions known to those of skill in the art provides the desired formulation. Generally, the resulting solution will be apportioned into vials for lyophilization. Each vial will contain a single dosage (10- 1000 mg, 100-500 mg, 10-500 mg, 50-250 mg or 25-100 mg) or multiple dosages of the compound. The lyophilized powder can be stored under appropriate conditions, such as at about 4°C to room temperature. \n\n\n [00194] Reconstitution of this lyophilized powder with water for injection provides a formulation for use in parenteral administration. For reconstitution, about 1-50 mg, about 5-35 mg, or about 9-30 mg of lyophilized powder, is added per mL of sterile water or other suitable carrier. The precise amount depends upon the selected compound. Such amount can be empirically determined. \n\n\n 4. Topical administration \n\n\n[00195] Topical mixtures are prepared as described for the local and systemic administration. The resulting mixture may be a solution, suspension, emulsions or the like and are formulated as creams, gels, ointments, emulsions, solutions, elixirs, lotions, suspensions, tinctures, pastes, foams, aerosols, irrigations, sprays, \n\n\nsuppositories, bandages, dermal patches or any other formulations suitable for topical administration. \n\n\n [00196] The compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof may be formulated as aerosols for topical application, such as by inhalation. These formulations for administration to the respiratory tract can be in the form of an aerosol or solution for a nebulizer, or as a microfme powder for insufflation, alone or in combination with an inert carrier such as lactose. In such a case, the particles of the formulation will typically have diameters of less than 50 microns or less than 10 microns. \n\n\n [00197] The compounds may be formulated for local or topical application, such as for topical application to the skin and mucous membranes, such as in the eye, in the form of gels, creams, and lotions and for application to the eye or for intracisternal or intraspinal application. Topical administration is contemplated for \n\n transdermal delivery and also for administration to the eyes or mucosa, or for inhalation therapies. Nasal solutions of the active compound alone or in combination with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients can also be administered. \n\n\n[00198] These solutions, particularly those intended for ophthalmic use, may be formulated as 0.01% - 10% isotonic solutions, pH about 5-7, with appropriate salts. \n\n\n 5. Compositions for other routes of administration \n\n\n [00199] Other routes of administration, such as topical application, transdermal patches, and rectal administration are also contemplated herein. \n\n\n[00200] For example, pharmaceutical dosage forms for rectal administration are rectal suppositories, capsules and tablets for systemic effect. Rectal suppositories are used herein mean solid bodies for insertion into the rectum which melt or soften at body temperature releasing one or more pharmacologically or therapeutically active ingredients. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances utilized in rectal suppositories are bases or vehicles and agents to raise the melting point. Examples of bases include cocoa butter (theobroma oil), glycerin-gelatin, carbowax (polyoxyethylene glycol) and appropriate mixtures of mono-, di- and triglycerides of fatty acids. Combinations of the various bases may be used. Agents to raise the melting point of suppositories include spermaceti and wax. Rectal suppositories may be prepared either by the compressed method or by molding. The typical weight of a rectal suppository is about 2 to 3 gm. \n\n\n [00201] Tablets and capsules for rectal administration are manufactured using the same pharmaceutically acceptable substance and by the same methods as for formulations for oral administration. \n\n\n 6. Sustained Release Compositions \n\n\n [00202] Active ingredients provided herein can be administered by controlled release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719, 5,674,533, 5,059,595, 5,591,767, 5,120,548, 5,073,543, 5,639,476, 5,354,556, 5,639,480, 5,733,566, 5,739,108, 5,891,474, 5,922,356, 5,972,891, 5,980,945, 5,993,855, 6,045,830, 6,087,324, 6,113,943, 6,197,350, 6,248,363, 6,264,970, 6,267,981, \n\n\n6,376,461,6,419,961, 6,589,548, 6,613,358, 6,699,500 and 6,740,634, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, \n\n hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled-release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients provided herein. \n\n\n [00203] All controlled-release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled counterparts. Ideally, the use of an optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release formulations include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled-release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the drug, and can thus affect the occurrence of side (e.g., adverse) effects. \n\n\n[00204] Most controlled-release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of drug (active ingredient) that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of other amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of drug in the body, the drug must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds. \n\n\n [00205] In certain embodiments, the agent may be administered using intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. In one embodiment, a pump may be used. In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target, i.e., thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose. In some embodiments, a controlled release device is introduced into a subject in proximity of the site of inappropriate immune activation or a tumor. The active ingredient can be dispersed in a solid inner matrix, e.g., polymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, plasticized or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized \n\n polyethyleneterephthalate, natural rubber, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polyethylene, ethylene-vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, hydrophilic polymers such as hydrogels of esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid, collagen, cross-linked \n\n\npolyvinylalcohol and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate, that is surrounded by an outer polymeric membrane, e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, \n\n\nethylene/vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethyl siloxanes, neoprene rubber, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, vinylchloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and \n\n\nethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, that is insoluble in body fluids. The active ingredient then diffuses through the outer polymeric membrane in a release rate controlling step. The percentage of active ingredient contained in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the needs of the subject. \n\n\n 7. Targeted Formulations \n\n\n[00206] The compounds provided herein, or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, may also be formulated to be targeted to a particular tissue, receptor, or other area of the body of the subject to be treated. Many such targeting methods are well known to those of skill in the art. All such targeting methods are contemplated herein for use in the instant compositions. For non- limiting examples of targeting methods, see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,316,652, 6,274,552, 6,271,359, 6,253,872, 6,139,865, 6,131,570, 6,120,751, 6,071,495, 6,060,082, 6,048,736, 6,039,975, 6,004,534, 5,985,307, 5,972,366, 5,900,252, 5,840,674, 5,759,542 and 5,709,874. \n\n\n [00207] In one embodiment, liposomal suspensions, including tissue -targeted liposomes, such as tumor-targeted liposomes, may also be suitable as \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art. Briefly, liposomes such as multilamellar vesicles (MLV's) may be formed by drying down egg phosphatidyl choline and brain phosphatidyl serine (7:3 molar ratio) on the inside of a flask. A solution of a compound provided herein in phosphate buffered saline lacking divalent cations \n\n (PBS) is added and the flask shaken until the lipid film is dispersed. The resulting vesicles are washed to remove unencapsulated compound, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended in PBS. \n\n\n D. EVALUATION OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPOUNDS \n\n\n[00208] Standard physiological, pharmacological and biochemical procedures are available for testing the compounds to identify those that possess biological activities that modulate the activity of CSF-IR kinase. \n\n\n [00209] Such assays include, for example, biochemical assays such as binding assays, radioactivity incorporation assays, as well as a variety of cell based assays. \n\n\n[00210] In certain embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein are tested in an M-NFS-60 cell proliferation assay to determine their cellular potency against CSF- IR. M-NFS-60s are mouse monocytic cells that depend on the binding of the ligand M-CSF to its receptor, CSF-IR, to proliferate. Inhibition of CSF-IR kinase activity will cause reduced growth and/or cell death. This assay assesses the potency of compounds as CSF-IR inhibitors by measuring the reduction of Alamar Blue reagent by viable cells. An exemplary assay is described in the Examples section. \n\n\n[00211] In certain embodiments, competition binding assays were performed as described in Fabian et ah, Nature Biotechnology 2005, 23,329-336. \n\n\n[00212] In one embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of about or less than about 150 nM against FLT3 kinase.

Even lower doses may be useful, and thus ranges can include from about 0.1-0.5 mg/kg body weight of the recipient per day. The effective dosage range of the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives is calculated based on the weight of the parent compound to be delivered.

PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS \n\n\n[00257] Starting materials in the synthesis examples provided herein are either available from commercial sources or via literature procedures (e.g. , March Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, (1992) 4th Ed.; Wiley Interscience, New York). All commercially available compounds were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. 300 MHz Proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 300 NMR spectrometer. Significant peaks are tabulated and typically include: number of protons, and multiplicity (s, singlet; d, double; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br s, broad singlet). Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (δ) relative to tetramethylsilane. Low resolution mass spectra (MS) were obtained as electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra, which were recorded on a Shimadzu HPLC/MS instrument using reverse-phase conditions (acetonitrile/water, 0.05% acetic acid). Preparative reverse phase HPLC was typically performed using a Varian HPLC system equipped with a Phenomenex phenylhexyl, a Phenomenex Luna CI 8, or a Varian Pursuit diphenyl reverse phase column; typical elution conditions utilized a gradient containing an increasing composition of organic cosolvent (0.05% \n\n\nHOAc/CHsCN or 0.05% HOAc/MeOH) to aqueous cosolvent (0.05% aq HO Ac). Silica gel chromatography was either performed manually, typically following the published procedure for flash chromatography (Still et al. (1978) J. Org. Chem. \n\n\n43:2923), or on an automated system (for example, Biotage SP instrument) using prepacked silica gel columns. \n\n\n [00258] It is understood that in the following description, combinations of substituents and/or variables of the depicted formulae are permissible only if such contributions result in stable compounds under standard conditions. \n\n\n[00259] It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described below, the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsilyl (e.g., t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for \n\n amino, amidino and guanidino include t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto include -C(0)-R (where R is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl), /?-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters. \n\n\n [00260] Protecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques, which are well-known to those skilled in the art and as described herein. The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Green, T.W. and P.G.M. Wutz, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (1991), 2nd Ed., Wiley-Interscience. \n\n\n[00261] One of ordinary skill in the art could easily ascertain which choices for each substituent are possible for the reaction conditions of each Scheme. Moreover, the substituents are selected from components as indicated in the specification heretofore, and may be attached to starting materials, intermediates, and/or final products according to schemes known to those of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n[00262] Also it will be apparent that the compounds provided herein could exist as one or more isomers, that is, E/Z isomers, enantiomers and/or diastereomers. \n\n\n[00263] Compounds of formula (I) may be generally prepared as depicted in the following schemes, unless otherwise noted, the various substituents are as defined elsewhere herein. \n\n\n [00264] Standard abbreviations and acronyms as defined in J.

The commercially available nucleophiles 1 (H-L\n2\n-R\n3\n, in which L\n2\n may represent -OR\n9\n, -SR\n9\n, or -N(R\n10\n)R\n9\n) and cyano-substituted heteroaryl compound 2 with a leaving group, such as, but not limited to, chloride or fluoride, are condensed under nucleophilic substitution conditions to give compounds 3. The reaction is promoted by bases such as, but not limited to, NaH or t-BuOK in solvents such as, but not limited to, DMF and THF. The reaction can be promoted using heating in a conventional oil bath or in a microwave reactor. The cyano group of compounds 3 is hydrolyzed under basic conditions, such as, but not limited to, aqueous NaOH in EtOH to give the carboxylic acids 4.

The anilines 8 can couple with acids 4 using appropriate coupling reagents, such as, but not limited to, EDCI or HATU, promoted by bases such as DIEA, TEA, or DMAP to give the amide derivates 9. \n\n [00266] In an illustrative method, urea amide compounds of formula (I) may also be routinely prepared according to the synthetic route outlined in Scheme 2. In cases when R\n3\n (either acylic or cyclic) contains a protected amino group, such as, but not limited to, the tert-butyloxy carbonyl group, the protecting group within the amide derivatives 10 can be deprotected to give amines 11, using various conditions, such as, but not limited to, TFA in DCM or 4N HC1 in 1,4-dioxane. Amines 11 can undergo reductive amination with various aldehydes and ketones, using reducing agents, such as, but not limited to NaCNBH\n3\n, Na(OAc)\n3\nBH, or NaBH\n4\n. The reaction can be conducted in a pH~4 NaOAc/AcOH buffer in MeOH, or promoted by addition of AcOH in dichloroethane. The reaction can be run at ambient temperature for reaction with aldehydes to give amines 12a, or be promoted using heating in a conventional oil bath for reaction with ketones to give amines 12b. The amines 11 can also undergo Michael addition with electron-withdrawing group (EWG)-activated vinyl derivatives to give amines 12c. The reaction may be promoted with the addition of bases, such as, but not limited to, DIEA, at elevated temperature if necessary. The amines 11 can also be alkylated with appropriate electrophiles, such as, but not limited to, alkyl halides or alkyl triflate, to give amines 12d. The reaction may be promoted with the addition of bases, such as, but not limited to, DIEA or TEA, at elevated temperature if necessary. \n\n\nScheme 2: General synthesis of azolyl ureas. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX = CI, Br, I, OTf \n\n\n Q\n3\n, and Q\n4\n each independently alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl, cycloalkyl; \n\n\n EWG is electron withdrawing group \n\n\n\n\n[00267] In an illustrative method, urea amide compounds of formula (I) may also be routinely prepared according to the synthetic route outlined in Scheme 3. In cases when R\n3\n contains a primary alcohol (13a) or secondary alcohol (13b), such as, but not limited to, the hydroxymethyl group, the hydroxy 1 group within the amide derivatives 13 can be oxidized to give aldehydes 14a or ketones 14b, using oxidizing agents, such as, but not limited to, Dess-Martin periodinane. Aldehydes 14a or ketones 14b can undergo reductive amination with various amines, using reducing agents, such as, but not limited to NaCNBH\n3\n, Na(OAc)\n3\nBH, or NaBH\n4\n. The reaction can be done in a pH~4 NaOAc/AcOH buffer in MeOH, or promoted by addition of AcOH in dichloroethane. The reaction can be run at ambient temperature for aldehydes to give amines 15 a, or be promoted using heating in a conventional oil bath for ketones to give amines 15b. \n\n\nScheme 3: General synthesis of azolyl ureas. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Q\na\n, Q\nb\n = H, alkyl, aryl, 15a (R = H) \n\n\n cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, 15b (R = R') \n\n\n heteroaryl, etc \n\n\n[00268] In an illustrative method, urea amide compounds of formula (I) may also be routinely prepared according to the synthetic route outlined in Scheme 4. The amide derivatives 16 containing a heteroaryl moiety B substituted with a reactive halogen atom, such as, but not limited to, bromide or iodide, can undergo a variety of transition metal-mediated catalyzed reactions with various organometallic reagents or nucleophiles. For example, the halogen-containing amide derivatives 16 can undergo Negishi coupling with organozinc reagents to give compounds 17a, in which L\n2\n is such as, but not limited to, an alkylene or a direct bond. Such coupling reactions are \n\n catalyzed using transition metal catalysts, such as, but not limited to, Cl\n2\nNi(Ph2PCH2CH\n2\nPPh2). \n\n\n [00269] In another example, the halogen-containing amide derivatives 16 can also undergo Suzuki coupling with reagents, such as, but not limited to, boronic acids, boronate esters, or trifluoroborates, to give compounds 17b, in which L\n2\n maybe, but is not limited to, a direct bond, an alkylene, an alkenylene. Such coupling reactions are catalyzed using transition metal catalysts, such as, but not limited to, Pd(Ph\n3\nP)4, and are promoted by bases, such as, but not limited to, Na\n2\nC0\n3\n, and using heating in a conventional oil bath or in a microwave reactor. The addition of ligands, such as, but not limited to, Xphos, may be necessary to facilitate the transformations. \n\n\n[00270] In yet another example, the halogen-containing amide derivatives 16 can also undergo Buchwald-Hartwig coupling with various nucleophiles, such as, but not limited to, amines, mercaptans, alcohols, and carbon nucleophiles, to give compounds 17c, in which L\n2\n is -NR\n12\nR\n12a\n, -SR\n12\n, -OR\n12\n, or an alkylene.

The carboxylic acids 4 can then be converted to mixed anhydrides by reacting with an alkyl chloroformate, such as, but not limited to, ethyl chloroformate, with the addition of bases, such as, but not limited to, TEA. The mixed anhydride can then be condensed with the anilines 8 to give the amide derivatives 9.

O * -N\n\n\n\n\n\n 38 39 \n\n\n[00283] Scheme 13 shows an example for the synthesis of azole amine derivatives (R\n1\n)\nP\n-A-NH\n2\n, wherein the heteroaryl ring A is 3-substituted-5- aminoisoxazole, whereby an appropriate 3-oxonitrile 39, prepared as described in Scheme 12, is treated with hydroxylamine under appropriate conditions of pH and temperature, as described again in Takase et al. Heterocycles 1991 32(6), 1153-1158, to afford the desired aryl amine product (41). This method is particularly applicable for cases in which the atom of R\n1\n directly attached to the aromatic ring is not highly substituted, for example, is not an α,α-dialkyl substituent (See Eddington et al. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2002 37, 635-648), or when R\n1\n contains one or more highly electron- \n\n withdrawing groups, for example fluorine, or under special conditions of pH and solvent, such as an ethanol and water mixture as described in EP 0220947. \n\n\nScheme 13: General synthesis of 5-aminoisoxazole derivatives. \n\n\n\n\n\n 39 41 \n\n\n[00284] Azole amine derivatives (R\n1\n)\nP\n-A-NH\n2\n, wherein the NH\n2\n group is directly attached to a nitrogen atom of the azole ring, may be prepared by amination of the corresponding azoles using methods well known in the art. Scheme 14 shows one example where (R^p-A is 4-substituted-pyrazole 42, whereby the amination can be realized by treating with a base, such as, but not limited to, NaH, and using amination reagents, such as, but not limited to, hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid or chloroamine. The reaction can be run in solvents such as, but not limited to, DMF and THF. The reaction can be promoted using heating in a conventional oil bath. Azole amine derivatives 43 can then be converted to the corresponding activated arylcarbamic acid derivatives 44 by reacting with phenyl chloroformate in the presence of a base, such as, but not limited to, K\n2\nC0\n3\n, in a solvent, such as, but not limited to, THF. \n\n\n Scheme 14: General synthesis of 1-aminopyrazole derivatives and arylcarbamic acid derivatives. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 42 43 44 \n\n\n [00285] In an illustrative method, cyclohexane urea compounds of formula (I) may also be routinely prepared according to the synthetic routes outlined in Scheme 15. The cyclohexane ureas 46 can be prepared by the reaction of the \n\n\ncyclohexanediamine derivatives 45 with activated arylcarbamic acid derivatives 5 in solvents such as THF or DMF, promoted with bases such as DIEA or DMAP and by heating as necessary at elevated temperatures. The fert-butyloxy carbonyl group of 46 is cleaved under acidic conditions, such as, but not limited to, TFA in DCM or 4N HC1 in 1,4-dioxane, to give the cyclohexaneamines 47. The amines 47 can couple \n\n with acids 4 using appropriate coupling reagents, such as, but not limited to, EDCI or HATU, promoted by bases such as DIEA, TEA, or DMAP to give the amide derivative 48. \n\n\n Scheme 15: General synthesis of cyclohexane urea amides. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00286] In an illustrative method, cyclohexane urea amide compounds of formula (I) may also be routinely prepared according to the synthetic route outlined in Scheme 16. In cases when R\n3\n (either acylic or cyclic) contains a protected amino group, such as, but not limited to, the tert-butyloxy carbonyl group, the protecting group within the amide derivatives 49 can be deprotected to give amines 50, using various conditions, such as, but not limited to, TFA in DCM or 4N HC1 in 1,4- dioxane. Amines 50 can undergo reductive amination with various aldehydes and ketones, using reducing agents, such as, but not limited to NaCNBH\n3\n, Na(OAc)\n3\nBH, or NaBH\n4\n. The reaction can be conducted in a pH~4 NaOAc/AcOH buffer in MeOH, or promoted by addition of AcOH in dichloroethane. The reaction can be run at ambient temperature for reaction with aldehydes to give amines 5 la, or be promoted using heating in a conventional oil bath for reaction with ketones to give amines 51b. \n\n\nScheme 16: General synthesis of cyclohexane urea amides. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00287] The subject matter has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of description rather than of limitation.

Hydrazine hydrate (0.1 mL) was then added, the resulting mixture was heated at 70 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C and filtered through celite. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the crude residue was purified by preparative TLC, eluting with MeOH in DCM (10: 1, \n\n v:v).

M-NFS-60s are mouse monocytic cells that depend on the binding of the ligand M-CSF to its receptor, CSFIR, to proliferate. Inhibition of CSFIR kinase activity will cause reduced growth and/or cell death. This assay assesses the potency of compounds as CSFIR inhibitors by measuring the reduction of Alamar Blue reagent by viable cells. \n\n\n[00461] On day one of the experiment, M-NFS-60 cells were maintained in\n\n\nRPMI complete medium (Omega Scientific) plus 10%> FBS supplemented with 20 ng/mL of M-CSF (R&D Systems). 96-well TC- treated, flat bottom plates were seeded at 10,000 cell/well at a volume of 100 μΐ, per well. The cells were cultured overnight at 37°C under 5% C0\n2\n. \n\n\n [00462] On day two, compounds were added to the cells at 9 different concentrations, with half-log intervals alongside a control reference compound serving as a positive control. Final DMSO concentration was kept at 0.5% for a final volume of 200 μΐ,. The compounds were allowed to incubate with the cells for 72 hours at 37°C under 5% C0\n2\n. \n\n\n [00463] On day five of the experiment, 40 μΐ of Alamar Blue reagent was added to each well and allowed to incubate for 3 hours. Alamar Blue fluorescence was read using SoftMax Pro software at 560nm (excitation) and 590nm (emission). IC50S were generated as an average of duplicates and represents the concentration of test compound that achieves 50% inhibition of cellular proliferation compared to control. \n\n\n [00464] In one embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have IC50 of about or less than about 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 or 0.01 μΜ. In another embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have activity IC50 of about or less than about 2000, 1000, 500, 300, 100, 50, 40, 30 or 20 nM. In \n\n another embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have activity IC50 of less than about 200 or 100 nM. \n\n\n Example 77 \n\n\n Competition binding assay to determine selectivity scores and binding constants \n\n\n (Kd) of the compounds against a panel of kinases \n\n\n[00465] Competition binding assays used herein were developed, validated and performed as described in Fabian et al, Nature Biotechnology 2005, 25,329-336. Kinases were produced as fusions to T7 phage {See, Fabian et al. or WO04/015142) or alternatively, the kinases were expressed in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for PCR detection (See, WO08/005310). For the binding assays, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated affinity ligands for 30 min at room temperature to generate affinity resins. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce nonspecific binding. Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinase, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1 x binding buffer (20 % SeaBlock, 0.17x PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 100 x stocks in DMSO and diluted into the aqueous environment. K s were determined using an eleven point threefold serial dilutions. DMSO or control compounds were was added to control assays lacking a test compound. Primary screen assays were performed in polypropylene 384-well plates in a final volume of 20-40 μί, while Kd determinations were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 135 ^L. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour to allow the binding reactions to reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed \n\n\nextensively with wash buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20) to remove unbound protein. The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 0.5 μΜ non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by quantitative PCR. \n\n\n [00466] A selectivity score (S10) is a quantitative measure of selectivity of a compound against a panel of kinases. An S10 was calculated for a compound by dividing the number of kinases found to have a percent of control (DMSO) less than 10 by the total number of distinct kinases tested (excluding mutant variants). Percent of control (POC) is calculated by subtracting the signal of the control compound \n\n (POC = 0) from the signal of the test compound and dividing the outcome by the signal of DMSO (POC = 100) minus the signal of the control compound. For the compounds disclosed herein, S10 scores were obtained by testing the compounds at 10 μΜ concentration in a kinase panel containing either 359 or 386 distinct kinases. \n\n\n[00467] In one embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have S10 score of about or less than about 0.1, 0.08, 0.06, 0.04, 0.03, or 0.02. \n\n\n Example 78 \n\n\n Rat Toxicity Study \n\n\n [00468] The potential toxicity of a compound of Formula I was assessed in rats administered by oral gavage, 60 mg/kg of a compound of of Formula I in 1% hydropropyl cellulose (Klucell®) QD, either once weekly, twice weekly or three times weekly, for up to 21 days. A fourth dosing group was administered 20 mg/kg of a compound of Formula I in 1% hydroxypropyl cellulose (Klucell®) QD three times weekly by oral gavage for up to 21 days. \n\n\n [00469] The animals were evaluated for the following: clinical signs (daily), body weight (weekly), food consumption (weekly), hematology (pre-treatment and at necropsy), coagulation (at necropsy), serum chemistry (pre-treatment and \n\n\nat necropsy), urinalysis (end of dosing and end of recovery), macroscopic \n\n\nobservations at necropsy, organ weights and histopathology (on selected tissues). No statistically significant changes were seen in the clinical pathology parameters in the dosing group receiving a compound of Formula I at 60 mg/kg once weekly. \n\n\n[00470] A separate group of animals across the four dosing groups were evaluated solely for toxicokinetics. For the toxicokinetic study, blood was collected by jugular venipuncture at the beginning of dosing (day 1) and at the end of the study (end of week 3). Samples were collected from subgroups so that both male and female subgroups were available for sample collection at the following time points of 0 hour, 0.5 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours after dosing. \n\n\nToxicokinetic parameters were estimated using WinNonlin pharmacokinetic software (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, California, USA.). A non-compartmental approach consistent with the oral route of administration was used for parameter estimation. All parameters were generated from mean concentrations of the compound of Formula I in plasma from Days 1 and Week 3 unless otherwise stated. Mean concentrations were derived from 3 animals/sex/group/time point/TK sampling occasion for the four dosing groups. The parameters C\nmax\n (the maximum observed \n\n concentration of the compound of Formula I and its metabolite measured after dosing), C\nmax\n/D (C\nmax\n divided by the dose administered), T\nmax\n (time after dosing at which the maximum observed concentration of the compound of Formula I was observed), AUC\n(0-t)\n (area under the concentration (of the compound of Formula I) versus time curve from time zero to the time after dosing at which the last quantifiable concentration of the drug was observed or imputed estimated by the linear or linear/log trapezoidal method), AU o-t D (AUC\n(0-t)\n divided by the dose administered) were estimated using sampling times relative to the start of each dose administration. \n\n\n[00471] When data permitted, the slope of the terminal elimination phase of each arithmetic mean concentration versus time curve was determined by log-linear regression, and the following additional parameters were also estimated: Ti/\n2\n \n\n\n(apparent terminal eliminate half life), AUC\n(\no_i\nn\nf) (area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity) and AU o-inf) /D (the AU o-inf) divided by the dose administered). In addition to parameter estimates for individual animals, descriptive statistics (arithmetic and geometric means, ranges, standard deviations and coefficient of variance [%]) by dose group, day and sex (as appropriate) were generated using WinNonlin. For T\nmax\n, median values were reported. In addition to parameter estimates from mean concentration vs. time curves, the standard error of the AUC(O-t) and C\nmax\n by dose group, day and sex (as appropriate) were generated using WinNonlin. \n\n\nExample 79 \n\n\n Rat MRMT-1 Bone Metastasis Model \n\n\n[00472] A rat mammary MRMT-1 bone metastasis model was performed by\n\n\nRicerca Biosciences, LLC. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley; -125-150 g) were acclimated for 1 wk. The animals were randomized into six treatment groups (n= 10). On day 1 of the study, 3 x 10\n4\n MRMT-1 rat mammary gland carcinoma cells were injected into the medullary cavity of the left proximal tibia of each rat. Groups of inoculated rats received a dose of compound having the Formula I at 120 mg/kg p.o. QD on a once weekly dosing schedule (on days 3 and 10 of the study) or at a dose of 60 mg/kg p.o. QD on a once weekly dosing schedule (on days 3 and 10 of the study). Another group of inoculated rats received a dose of compound having the Formula I at 60 mg/kg p.o. QD on a twice weekly dosing schedule (on days 3, 7, 10 and 14 of the study). The positive control group was given \n\n 0.03 mg/kg zoledronate in calcium and magnesium-free PBS by s.c. injection every other day beginning on day 3. Rats were sacrificed on day 17. \n\n\n[00473] The left tibia from each animal was excised and the distal end was severed to expose the marrow cavity. The microradiographs were prepared using high resolution microradiograph (Faxitron X-ray Corporation). Tibiae \n\n\nmicroradiographs were evaluated for the extent of tumor-induced osteolysis at the end of the study using the scoring criteria outlined in Table A: \n\n\nTable A: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00474] All hind limbs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and decalcified for tartrate -resistant alkaline phosphate -positive (TRAP ) staining and for evaluation of bone structure, tumor osteolysis and osteoclast activity. The summary of the microradiographic score is shown in Fig 1. Both once weekly dose and twice weekly dose showed to be as protective against bone destruction as the positive control, zoledronate. \n\n\n\n\n[00475] The compounds provided herein were found to have the following activity shown in Table 1 :\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n 150198 \n\n\n PCT/US2011/038123 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n 198 \n\n\n PCT/US2011/038123 \n\n\n \n\n 198 \n\n\n PCT/US2011/038123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB B B A \n\n\n \n\n C C D A \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00476] In Table 1, \n\n\n CSF1R (human) Kd (nM): A <3, 3<B<10, C>10; and ND= no data; \n\n\n CSF1R (mouse) Kd (nM): A <3, 3<B<10, O10; and ND= no data; \n\n\n CSF1R Cell Proliferation Assay (M-NSF-60) IC\n50\n (nM): A <100, 100<B<250,\n\n\n250<C<1000, D>1000; and ND= no data; and \n\n\n S score: A <0.03, 0.03<B<0.05, C > 0.05; and ND= no data. \n\n\n[00477] The embodiments described above are intended to be merely exemplary, and those skilled in the art will recognize, or will be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, numerous equivalents of specific compounds, materials, and procedures.
