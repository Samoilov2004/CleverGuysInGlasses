Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides compositions and methods for modulating the expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2. In particular, this invention relates to antisense compounds, particularly oligonucleotide compounds, which, in preferred embodiments, hybridize with nucleic acid molecules encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2. Such compounds are shown herein to modulate the expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nTriglycerides are one of the major energy storage molecules in eukaryotes. The absorption of triglycerides (also called triacylglycerols) from food is a very efficient process which occurs by a series of steps wherein the dietary triacylglycerols are hydrolyzed in the intestinal lumen and then resynthesized within enterocytes. The resynthesis of triacylglycerols can occur via the monoacylglycerol pathwaywhich commences with monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) catalyzing the synthesis of diacylglycerol from monoacylglycerol and fatty acyl-CoA. An alternative synthesis of diacylglycerols is provided by the glycerol-phosphate pathway which describes the coupling of two molecules of fatty acyl-CoA to glycerol-3-phosphate. In either case, diacylglycerol is then acylated with another molecule of fatty acyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by one of two diacylglycerol acyltransferase enzymes to form the triglyceride (\nFarese et al., Curr. Opin. Lipidol., 2000, 11, 229-234\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase is the final and only committed step in triglyceride synthesis. As such, diacylglycerol acyltransferase is involved in intestinal fat absorption, lipoprotein assembly, regulating plasma triglyceride concentrations, and fat storage in adipocytes. The first diacylglycerol acyltransferase, diacylglycerol transferase 1, was identified in 1960 and the human and mouse genes encoding this protein were isolated in 1998 (\nCases et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 1998, 95, 13018-13023\n; \nOelkers et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1998, 273, 26765-26771\n). Mice lacking diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 are viable and can still synthesize triglycerides through other biological routes, suggesting the existence of multiple mechanisms for triglyceride synthesis (\nSmith et al., Nat. Genet., 2000, 25, 87-90\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second diacylglycerol transferase, diacylglycerol transferase 2 (also known as DGAT2, diacylglycerol O-transferase 2, acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2), was subsequently identified in the fungus Mortierella, humans and mice (\nCases et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276, 38870-38876\n; \nLardizabal et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276, 38862-38869\n). Enzymatic assays indicate that this recently identified protein does possess diacylglycerol transferase activity that utilizes a broad range of long chain fatty acyl-CoA substrates (\nCases et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276, 38870-38876\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiacylglycerol transferase 2 is a member of a family of genes whose sequences are unrelated to diacylglycerol transferase 1. In addition to differing in sequence compared to diacylglycerol transferase 1, \nin vitro\n assays illustrate that diacylglycerol transferase 2 has higher activity at lower concentrations of magnesium chloride and oleoyl-CoA (\nCases et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276, 38870-38876\n). The predicted protein sequence of diacylglycerol transferase 2 contains at least one putative transmembrane domain, three potential N-linked glycosylation sites, six potential protein kinase C phosphorylation consensus sites, as well as sequences in common with a putative glycerol phosphorylation site found in acyltransferase enzymes (\nCases et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276, 38870-38876\n). The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium has mapped human diacylglycerol transferase 2 to chromosome 11q13.3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn human tissues, the highest levels of diacylglycerol transferase 2 are detected in liver and white adipose tissues, with lower levels found in mammary gland, testis and peripheral blood leukocytes (\nCases et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276, 38870-38876\n). Two mRNA species of 2.4 and 1.8 kilobases are detected in human tissues, whereas the major diacylglycerol transferase 2 mRNA species in mouse tissues is 2.4 kilobases. In addition to liver and white adipose tissues, diacylglycerol transferase 2 is expressed in all segments of the small intestine in mice, with higher expression in the proximal intestine and lower expression in the distal intestine (\nCases et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276, 38870-38876\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiacylglycerol transferase activity exhibits distinct patterns during postnatal development of the rat liver. As there is no correlation between the mRNA expression and activity patterns, post-translational modifications may participate in the regulation of diacylglycerol transferase 2 activity during rat development (\nWaterman et al., J. Lipid. Res., 2002, 43, 1555-1562\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiacylglycerol transferase 2 mRNA is preferentially upregulated by insulin treatment, as shown by in vitro assays measuring the diacylglycerol activity from the membrane fraction of cultured mouse adipocytes (\nMeegalla et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 2002, 298, 317-323\n). In fasting mice, diacylglycerol transferase 2 expression is greatly reduced, and dramatically increases upon refeeding. The expression patterns of two enzymes that participate in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase, respond to fasting and refeeding in a similar fashion. These results, combined with the observation that diacylglycerol transferase 2 is abundantly expressed in liver, suggest that diacylglycerol transferase 2 is tightly linked to the endogenous fatty acid synthesis pathway (\nMeegalla et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 2002, 298, 317-323\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies of mice harboring a disruption in the diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 gene provide evidence that diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 contributes to triglyceride synthesis. Levels of diacylglycerol transferase 2 mRNA expression are similar in intestinal segments from both wild type and diacylglycerol transferase 1-deficient mice (\nBuhman et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2002, 277, 25474-25479\n). Using magnesium chloride to distinguish between diacylglycerol transferase 1 and 2 activity, Buhman, et al. observed that, in diacylglycerol transferase 1-deficient mice, diacylglycerol transferase activity is reduced to 50% in the proximal intestine and to 10-15% in the distal intestine (\nBuhman et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2002, 277, 25474-25479\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, diacylglycerol transferase 2 mRNA levels are not up-regulated the liver or adipose tissues of diacylglycerol transferase 1-deficient mice, even after weeks of high-fat diet (\nCases et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276, 38870-38876\n; \nChen et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2002, 109, 1049-1055\n). However, in ob/ob mice, which have a mutation in the leptin gene that results in obesity, diacylglycerol transferase 2 is more highly expressed than in wild type mice, suggesting that diacylglycerol transferase 2 may be partly responsible for the highly accumulated fat mass seen in these mice. Furthermore, the combined mutations of leptin and diacylglycerol transferase 1 leads to a three-fold elevation in diacylglycerol transferase 2 expression in white adipose tissue, compared to the levels in the same tissue from diacylglycerol transferase 1-deficient mice (\nChen et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2002, 109, 1049-1055\n). Diacylglycerol transferase 2 mRNA is also upregulated in the skin of these mice (\nChen et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2002, 109, 175-181\n). These data suggest leptin normally downregulates diacylglycerol transferase 2 expression, and that the upregulation of diacylglycerol transferase 2 in white adipose tissue in these mice may provide an alternate pathway for the triglyceride synthesis that still occurs in leptin deficient/diacylglycerol transferase 1-deficient mice (\nChen et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2002, 109, 1049-1055\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 knockout mice exhibit interesting phenotypes in that they are lean, resistant to diet-induce obesity, have decreased levels of tissue triglycerides and increased sensitivity to insulin and leptin (\nChen et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2002, 109, 1049-1055\n; \nSmith et al., Nat. Genet., 2000, 25, 87-90\n). As diacylglycerol transferase 2 also participates in triglyceride synthesis, interfering with diacylglycerol transferase 2 may similarly lead to reduced body fat content.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \n \nUS pre-grant publications 20030124126 \n \nand \n \n20020119138\n \n claim and disclose a nucleic acid molecule encoding human diacylglycerol transferase 2 alpha, as well as compositions, including antisense oligonucleotides, for modulating the activity of said diacylglycerol transferase 2 alpha (Cases et al., \n2003\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \n \nUS pre-grant publication 20030104414\n \n refers to nucleic acid sequences which are members of a group of genes referred to as \"protein cluster V\" as well as the method for identification of an agent capable of modulating nucleic acid molecules in the protein cluster V group. This application also refers to the use of RNA interference or double-stranded RNA to disrupt the function of protein cluster V gene family members (Attersand, \n2003\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \n \nUS pre-grant publication 20030100480\n \n refers to modifying diacylglycerol transferase activity, including that of diacylglycerol transferase 2, by a variety of methods, including antisense, RNA interference and diacylglycerol transferase 2 antisense plasmid constructs (Smith et al., \n2003\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \n \nUS pre-grant publication 20030028923\n \n refers to a method for modifying the triacylglycerol composition in a plant cell, comprising transforming a plant cell with a nucleic acid construct encoding an enzyme active in the formation of triacylglycerol from diacylglycerol and fatty acyl substrates, including nucleic acid constructs in the antisense orientation. Also referred to is a method for ameliorating a disease or condition associated with altered diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity by administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a diacylglycerol acyltransferase agonist. This application indicates that such antagonists can include antisense molecules (Lardizabal et al., \n2003\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \n \nPCT publication WO 00/78961\n \n refers to isolated nucleic acid molecules selected from a group including a nucleic acid sequence encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2.

Such methods comprise administering a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more of the compounds or compositions of the invention to the person in need of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides the use of a compound or composition of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of any and all conditions disclosed herein.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\nA. Overview of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention employs antisense compounds, preferably oligonucleotides and similar species for use in modulating the function or effect of nucleic acid molecules encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2. This is accomplished by providing oligonucleotides that specifically hybridize with one or more nucleic acid molecules encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2. As used herein, the terms \"target nucleic acid\" and \"nucleic acid molecule encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2\" have been used for convenience to encompass DNA encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, RNA (including pre-mRNA and mRNA or portions thereof) transcribed from such DNA, and also cDNA derived from such RNA. The hybridization of a compound of this invention with its target nucleic acid is generally referred to as \"antisense\". Consequently, the preferred mechanism believed to be included in the practice of some preferred embodiments of the invention is referred to herein as \"antisense inhibition.\" Such antisense inhibition is typically based upon hydrogen bonding-based hybridization of oligonucleotide strands or segments such that at least one strand or segment is cleaved, degraded, or otherwise rendered inoperable. In this regard, it is presently preferred to target specific nucleic acid molecules and their functions for such antisense inhibition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe functions of DNA to be interfered with can include replication and transcription. Replication and transcription, for example, can be from an endogenous cellular template, a vector, a plasmid construct or otherwise. The functions of RNA to be interfered with can include functions such as translocation of the RNA to a site of protein translation, translocation of the RNA to sites within the cell which are distant from the site of RNA synthesis, translation of protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNA to yield one or more RNA species, and catalytic activity or complex formation involving the RNA which may be engaged in or facilitated by the RNA. One preferred result of such interference with target nucleic acid function is modulation of the expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2. In the context of the present invention, \"modulation\" and \"modulation of expression\" mean either an increase (stimulation) or a decrease (inhibition) in the amount or levels of a nucleic acid molecule encoding the gene, e.g., DNA or RNA. Inhibition is often the preferred form of modulation of expression and mRNA is often a preferred target nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of this invention, \"hybridization\" means the pairing of complementary strands of oligomeric compounds. In the present invention, the preferred mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleoside or nucleotide bases (nucleobases) of the strands of oligomeric compounds. For example, adenine and thymine are complementary nucleobases which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. Hybridization can occur under varying circumstances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antisense compound is specifically hybridizable when binding of the compound to the target nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the target nucleic acid to cause a loss of activity, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the antisense compound to non-target nucleic acid sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, e.g., under physiological conditions in the case of \nin vivo\n assays or therapeutic treatment, and under conditions in which assays are performed in the case of in vitro assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present invention the phrase \"stringent hybridization conditions\" or \"stringent conditions\" refers to conditions under which a compound of the invention will hybridize to its target sequence, but to a minimal number of other sequences. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances and in the context of this invention, \"stringent conditions\" under which oligomeric compounds hybridize to a target sequence are determined by the nature and composition of the oligomeric compounds and the assays in which they are being investigated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Complementary,\" as used herein, refers to the capacity hydrogen bonding between the oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid is considered to be a complementary position. The oligonucleotide and the further DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide molecule are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of complementary positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleobases which can hydrogen bond with each other. Thus, \"specifically hybridizable\" and \"complementary\" are terms which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of precise pairing or complementarity over a sufficient number of nucleobases such that stable and specific binding occurs between the oligonucleotide and a target nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood in the art that the sequence of an antisense compound may be, but need not be, 100% complementary to that of its target nucleic acid to be specifically hybridizable. Moreover, an oligonucleotide may hybridize over one or more segments such that intervening or adjacent segments are not involved in the hybridization event (e.g., a loop structure or hairpin structure). It is preferred that the antisense compounds of the present invention comprise at least 70%, or at least 75%, or at least 80%, or at least 85% sequence complementarity to a target region within the target nucleic acid. Moreover, they may comprise at least 90% sequence complementarity, at least 95% or at least 99% sequence complementarity to the target region within the target nucleic acid sequence to which they are targeted. For example, an antisense compound in which 18 of 20 nucleobases of the antisense compound are complementary to a target region, and would therefore specifically hybridize, would represent 90 percent complementarity. In this example, the remaining noncomplementary nucleobases may be clustered or interspersed with complementary nucleobases, and need not be contiguous to each other or to complementary nucleobases. As such, an antisense compound which is 18 nucleobases in length having 4 (four) noncomplementary nucleobases which are flanked by two regions of complete complementarity with the target nucleic acid would have 77.8% overall complementarity with the target nucleic acid and would thus fall within the scope of the present invention. Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a region of a target nucleic acid can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and PowerBLAST programs known in the art (\nAltschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990, 215, 403-410\n; \nZhang and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649-656\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPercent homology, sequence identity, or complementarity, can be determined by, for example, the Gap program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, Madison WI), using default settings, which uses the algorithm of \nSmith and Waterman (Adv. Appl. Math., 1981, 2, 482-489\n). In some preferred embodiments, homology, sequence identity, or complementarity, between the oligomeric compound and target is between about 50% to about 60%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is between about 60% to about 70%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is between about 70% and about 80%. In further embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is between about 80% and about 90%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is about 90%, about 92%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99% or about 100%.\n\n\n \n\n\nB. Compounds of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention, antisense compounds include antisense oligomeric compounds, antisense oligonucleotides, siRNAs, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, alternate splicers, and other oligomeric compounds which hybridize to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid. As such, these compounds may be introduced in the form of single-stranded, double-stranded, circular or hairpin oligomeric compounds and may contain structural elements such as internal or terminal bulges or loops. Once introduced to a system, the compounds of the invention may elicit the action of one or more enzymes or structural proteins to effect modification of the target nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne non-limiting example of such an enzyme is RNase H, a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. It is known in the art that single-stranded antisense compounds that are \"DNA-like\" elicit RNase H. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of gene expression. Similar roles have been postulated for other ribonucleases such as those in the RNase III and ribonuclease L family of enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the one form of antisense compound is a single-stranded antisense oligonucleotide, in many species the introduction of double-stranded structures, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, has been shown to induce potent and specific antisense-mediated reduction of the function of a gene or its associated gene products. This phenomenon occurs in both plants and animals and is believed to have an evolutionary connection to viral defense and transposon silencing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe first evidence that dsRNA could lead to gene silencing in animals came in 1995 from work in the nematode, \nCaenorhabditis elegans\n (\nGuo and Kempheus, Cell, 1995, 81, 611-620\n). The primary interference effects of dsRNA are posttranscriptional (\nMontgomery et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1998, 95, 15502-15507\n). The posttranscriptional antisense mechanism defined in \nCaenorhabditis elegans\n resulting from exposure to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) has since been designated RNA interference (RNAi). This term has been generalized to mean antisense-mediated gene silencing involving the introduction of dsRNA leading to the sequence-specific reduction of endogenous targeted mRNA levels (\nFire et al., Nature, 1998, 391, 806-811\n). Recently, the single-stranded RNA oligomers of antisense polarity of the dsRNAs have been reported to be the potent inducers of RNAi (\nTijsterman et al., Science, 2002, 295, 694-697\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antisense compounds of the present invention also include modified compounds in which a different base is present at one or more of the nucleotide positions in the compound. For example, if the first nucleotide is an adenosine, modified compounds may be produced which contain thymidine, guanosine or cytidine at this position. This may be done at any of the positions of the antisense compound. These compounds are then tested using the methods described herein to determine their ability to inhibit expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of this invention, the term \"oligomeric compound\" refers to a polymer or oligomer comprising a plurality of monomeric units. In the context of this invention, the term \"oligonucleotide\" refers to an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or mimetics, chimeras, analogs and homologs thereof. This term includes oligonucleotides composed of naturally occurring nucleobases, sugars and covalent internucleoside (backbone) linkages as well as oligonucleotides having non-naturally occurring portions which function similarly. Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often preferred over native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for a target nucleic acid and increased stability in the presence of nucleases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile oligonucleotides are a preferred form of the antisense compounds of this invention, the present invention comprehends other families of antisense compounds as well, including but not limited to oligonucleotide analogs and mimetics such as those described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antisense compounds in accordance with this invention preferably comprise from about 8 to about 80 nucleobases (i.e. from about 8 to about 80 linked nucleosides).

Targets of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\"Targeting\" an antisense compound to a particular nucleic acid molecule, in the context of this invention, can be a multistep process. The process usually begins with the identification of a target nucleic acid whose function is to be modulated. This target nucleic acid may be, for example, a cellular gene (or mRNA transcribed from the gene) whose expression is associated with a particular disorder or disease state, or a nucleic acid molecule from an infectious agent. In the present invention, the target nucleic acid encodes diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe targeting process usually also includes determination of at least one target region, segment, or site within the target nucleic acid for the antisense interaction to occur such that the desired effect, e.g., modulation of expression, will result. Within the context of the present invention, the term \"region\" is defined as a portion of the target nucleic acid having at least one identifiable structure, function, or characteristic. Within regions of target nucleic acids are segments. \"Segments\" are defined as smaller or sub-portions of regions within a target nucleic acid. \"Sites,\" as used in the present invention, are defined as positions within a target nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince, as is known in the art, the translation initiation codon is typically 5'-AUG (in transcribed mRNA molecules; 5'-ATG in the corresponding DNA molecule), the translation initiation codon is also referred to as the \"AUG codon,\" the \"start codon\" or the \"AUG start codon\". A minority of genes having a translation initiation codon with the RNA sequence 5'-GUG, 5'-UUG or 5'-CUG, and 5'-AUA, 5'-ACG and 5'-CUG have been shown to function \nin vivo\n. Thus, the terms \"translation initiation codon\" and \"start codon\" can encompass many codon sequences, even though the initiator amino acid in each instance is typically methionine (in eukaryotes) or formylmethionine (in prokaryotes). It is also known in the art that eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes may have two or more alternative start codons, any one of which may be preferentially utilized for translation initiation in a particular cell type or tissue, or under a particular set of conditions. In the context of the invention, \"start codon\" and \"translation initiation codon\" refer to the codon or codons that are used \nin vivo\n to initiate translation of an mRNA transcribed from a gene encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, regardless of the sequence(s) of such codons. It is also known in the art that a translation termination codon (or \"stop codon\") of a gene may have one of three sequences, i.e., 5'-UAA, 5'-UAG and 5'-UGA (the corresponding DNA sequences are 5'-TAA, 5'-TAG and 5'-TGA, respectively).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"start codon region\" and \"translation initiation codon region\" refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5' or 3') from a translation initiation codon. Similarly, the terms \"stop codon region\" and \"translation termination codon region\" refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5' or 3') from a translation termination codon. Consequently, the \"start codon region\" (or \"translation initiation codon region\") and the \"stop codon region\" (or \"translation termination codon region\") are all regions which may be targeted effectively with the antisense compounds of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe open reading frame (ORF) or \"coding region,\" which is known in the art to refer to the region between the translation initiation codon and the translation termination codon, is also a region which may be targeted effectively. Within the context of the present invention, a preferred region is the intragenic region encompassing the translation initiation or termination codon of the open reading frame (ORF) of a gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther target regions include the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 5' direction from the translation initiation codon, and thus including nucleotides between the 5' cap site and the translation initiation codon of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene), and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 3' direction from the translation termination codon, and thus including nucleotides between the translation termination codon and 3' end of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene). The 5' cap site of an mRNA comprises an N7-methylated guanosine residue joined to the 5'-most residue of the mRNA via a 5'-5' triphosphate linkage. The 5' cap region of an mRNA is considered to include the 5' cap structure itself as well as the first 50 nucleotides adjacent to the cap site. It is also preferred to target the 5' cap region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention provides antisense compounds that target a portion of nucleotides 1-2439 as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4. In another embodiment, the antisense compounds target at least an 8-nucleobase portion of nucleotides 1-230, comprising the 5'UTR as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4. In another embodiment, the antisense compounds target at least an 8-nucleobase portion of nucleotides 1395-2439, comprising the 3'UTR as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4. In another embodiment, the antisense compounds target at least an 8-nucleobase portion of nucleotides 231-1394, comprising the coding region as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4. In still other embodiments, the antisense compounds target at least an 8-nucleobase portion of a \"preferred target segment\" (as defined herein) as set forth in Table 3 or additional Tables in the Examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough some eukaryotic mRNA transcripts are directly translated, many contain one or more regions, known as \"introns,\" which are excised from a transcript before it is translated. The remaining (and therefore translated) regions are known as \"exons\" and are spliced together to form a continuous mRNA sequence, resulting in exon-exon junctions at the sites where exons are joined. Targeting exon-exon junctions can be useful in situations where the overproduction of a normal splice product is implicated in disease, or where the overproduction of an aberrant splice product is implicated in disease. Targeting splice sites, i.e., intron-exon junctions or exon-intron junctions, may also be particularly useful in situations where aberrant splicing is implicated in disease, or where an overproduction of a particular splice product is implicated in disease. Aberrant fusion junctions due to rearrangements or deletions are also preferred target sites. mRNA transcripts produced via the process of splicing of two (or more) mRNAs from different gene sources, known as \"fusion transcripts\", are also suitable target sites. It is also known that introns can be effectively targeted using antisense compounds targeted to, for example, DNA or pre-mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also known in the art that alternative RNA transcripts can be produced from the same genomic region of DNA. These alternative transcripts are generally known as \"variants\". More specifically, \"pre-mRNA variants\" are transcripts produced from the same genomic DNA that differ from other transcripts produced from the same genomic DNA in either their start or stop position and contain both intronic and exonic sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon excision of one or more exon or intron regions, or portions thereof during splicing, pre-mRNA variants produce smaller \"mRNA variants\". Consequently, mRNA variants are processed pre-mRNA variants, and each unique pre-mRNA variant must always produce a unique mRNA variant as a result of splicing. These mRNA variants are also known as \"alternative splice variants\". If no splicing of the pre-mRNA variant occurs then the pre-mRNA variant is identical to the mRNA variant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also known in the art that variants can be produced through the use of alternative signals to start or stop transcription and that pre-mRNAs and mRNAs can possess more that one start codon or stop codon. Variants that originate from a pre-mRNA or mRNA that use alternative start codons are known as \"alternative start variants\" of that pre-mRNA or mRNA. Those transcripts that use an alternative stop codon are known as \"alternative stop variants\" of that pre-mRNA or mRNA. One specific type of alternative stop variant is the \"polyA variant\" in which the multiple transcripts produced result from the alternative selection of one of the \"polyA stop signals\" by the transcription machinery, thereby producing transcripts that terminate at unique polyA sites. Within the context of the invention, the types of variants described herein are also preferred target nucleic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe locations on the target nucleic acid to which the preferred antisense compounds hybridize are hereinbelow referred to as \"preferred target segments.\" As used herein the term \"preferred target segment\" is defined as at least an 8-nucleobase portion of a target region to which an active antisense compound is targeted. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is presently believed that these target segments represent portions of the target nucleic acid which are accessible for hybridization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the specific sequences of certain preferred target segments are set forth herein, one of skill in the art will recognize that these serve to illustrate and describe particular embodiments within the scope of the present invention. Additional preferred target segments may be identified by one having ordinary skill.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTarget segments 8-80 nucleobases in length comprising a stretch of at least eight (8) consecutive nucleobases selected from within the illustrative preferred target segments are considered to be suitable for targeting as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTarget segments can include DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least the 8 consecutive nucleobases from the 5'-terminus of one of the illustrative preferred target segments (the remaining nucleobases being a consecutive stretch of the same DNA or RNA beginning immediately upstream of the 5'-terminus of the target segment and continuing until the DNA or RNA contains about 8 to about 80 nucleobases). Similarly preferred target segments are represented by DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least the 8 consecutive nucleobases from the 3'-terminus of one of the illustrative preferred target segments (the remaining nucleobases being a consecutive stretch of the same DNA or RNA beginning immediately downstream of the 3'-terminus of the target segment and continuing until the DNA or RNA contains about 8 to about 80 nucleobases). It is also understood that preferred antisense target segments may be represented by DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least 8 consecutive nucleobases from an internal portion of the sequence of an illustrative preferred target segment, and may extend in either or both directions until the oligonucleotide contains about 8 to about 80 nucleobases. One having skill in the art armed with the preferred target segments illustrated herein will be able, without undue experimentation, to identify further preferred target segments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce one or more target regions, segments or sites have been identified, antisense compounds are chosen which are sufficiently complementary to the target, i.e., hybridize sufficiently well and with sufficient specificity, to give the desired effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oligomeric antisense compounds can also be targeted to regions of a target nucleobase sequence, such as those disclosed herein (e.g., in Example 13) All regions of a nucleobase sequence to which an oligomeric antisense compound can be targeted, wherein the regions are greater than or equal to 8 and less than or equal to 80 nucleobases, are described as follows:\n\n \n \n \nLet R(n, n+m-1) be a region from a target nucleobase sequence, where \"n\" is the 5'-most nucleobase position of the region, where \"n+m-1\" is the 3'-most nucleobase position of the region and where \"m\" is the length of the region. A set \"S(m)\", of regions of length \"m\" is defined as the regions where n ranges from 1 to L-m+1, where L is the length of the target nucleobase sequence and L>m. A set, \"A\", of all regions can be constructed as a union of the sets of regions\n\nfor each length from where m is greater than or equal to 8 and is less than or equal to 80.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThis set of regions can be represented using the following mathematical notation: \n \n \nA\n \n=\n \n \n \n∪\n \nm\n \n \n \nS\n \n \nm\n \n \n \n \nwhere\n \n \n \nm\n \n∈\n \nN\n \n \n|\n \n \n8\n \n≤\n \nm\n \n≤\n \n80\n \n \n \n \n\nand \n \n \nS\n \n \nm\n \n \n=\n \n \n{\n \n \nR\n \n \nn\n \n,\n \nn\n \n+\n \nm\n \n-\n \n1\n \n \n \n \n|\n \n \nn\n \n∈\n \n \n1\n \n,\n \n2\n \n,\n \n3\n \n,\n \n…\n \n,\n \nL\n \n-\n \nm\n \n+\n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere the mathematical operator | indicates \"such that\",\n\nwhere the mathematical operator ∈ indicates \"a member of a set\" (e.g. y ∈ Z indicates that element y is a member of set Z),\n\nwhere x is a variable,\n\nwhere N indicates all natural numbers, defined as positive integers,\n\nand where the mathematical operator ∪ indicates \"the union of sets\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the set of regions for m equal to 8, 20 and 80 can be constructed in the following manner.

Once it is shown that the candidate modulator or modulators are capable of modulating (e.g. either decreasing or increasing) the expression of a nucleic acid molecule encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, the modulator may then be employed in further investigative studies of the function of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, or for use as a research, diagnostic, or therapeutic agent in accordance with the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preferred target segments of the present invention may be also be combined with their respective complementary antisense compounds of the present invention to form stabilized double-stranded (duplexed) oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch double stranded oligonucleotide moieties have been shown in the art to modulate target expression and regulate translation as well as RNA processing via an antisense mechanism. Moreover, the double-stranded moieties may be subject to chemical modifications (\nFire et al., Nature, 1998, 391, 806-811\n; \nTimmons and Fire, Nature 1998, 395, 854\n; \nTimmons et al., Gene, 2001, 263, 103-112\n; \nTabara et al., Science, 1998, 282, 430-431\n; \nMontgomery et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1998, 95, 15502-15507\n; \nTuschl et al., Genes Dev., 1999, 13, 3191-3197\n; \nElbashir et al., Nature, 2001, 411, 494-498\n; \nElbashir et al., Genes Dev. 2001, 15, 188-200\n). For example, such double-stranded moieties have been shown to inhibit the target by the classical hybridization of the antisense strand of the duplex to the target, thereby triggering enzymatic degradation of the target (\nTijsterman et al., Science, 2002, 295, 694-697\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can also be applied in the areas of drug discovery and target validation. The present invention comprehends the use of the compounds and preferred target segments identified herein in drug discovery efforts to elucidate relationships that exist between diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 and a disease state, phenotype, or condition. These methods include detecting or modulating diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 comprising contacting a sample, tissue, cell, or organism with the compounds of the present invention, measuring the nucleic acid or protein level of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 and/or a related phenotypic or chemical endpoint at some time after treatment, and optionally comparing the measured value to a non-treated sample or sample treated with a further compound of the invention. These methods can also be performed in parallel or in combination with other experiments to determine the function of unknown genes for the process of target validation or to determine the validity of a particular gene product as a target for treatment or prevention of a particular disease, condition, or phenotype.\n\n\n \n\n\nE. Kits, Research Reagents, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antisense compounds of the present invention are utilized for diagnostics, therapeutics, prophylaxis and as research reagents and kits. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides, which are able to inhibit gene expression with exquisite specificity, are often used by those of ordinary skill to elucidate the function of particular genes or to distinguish between functions of various members of a biological pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use in kits and diagnostics, the compounds of the present invention, either alone or in combination with other compounds or therapeutics, are used as tools in differential and/or combinatorial analyses to elucidate expression patterns of a portion or the entire complement of genes expressed within cells and tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs one nonlimiting example, expression patterns within cells or tissues treated with one or more antisense compounds are compared to control cells or tissues not treated with antisense compounds and the patterns produced are analyzed for differential levels of gene expression as they pertain, for example, to disease association, signaling pathway, cellular localization, expression level, size, structure or function of the genes examined. These analyses can be performed on stimulated or unstimulated cells and in the presence or absence of other compounds which affect expression patterns.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of methods of gene expression analysis known in the art include DNA arrays or microarrays (\nBrazma and Vilo, FEBS Lett., 2000, 480, 17-24\n; \nCelis, et al., FEBS Lett., 2000, 480, 2-16\n), SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) (\nMadden, et al., Drug Discov.

The primers and probes disclosed herein are useful in methods requiring the specific detection of nucleic acid molecules encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 and in the amplification of said nucleic acid molecules for detection or for use in further studies of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2. Hybridization of the primers and probes with a nucleic acid encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 can be detected by means known in the art. Such means may include conjugation of an enzyme to the primer or probe or any other suitable detection means. Kits using such detection means for detecting the level of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in a sample may also be prepared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides for the use of a compound or composition of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of any and all conditions disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specificity and sensitivity of antisense are also harnessed by those of skill in the art for therapeutic uses. Antisense compounds have been employed as therapeutic moieties in the treatment of disease states in animals, including humans. Antisense oligonucleotide drugs, including ribozymes, have been safely and effectively administered to humans and numerous clinical trials are underway. It is thus established that antisense compounds can be useful therapeutic modalities that can be configured to be useful in treatment regimes for the treatment of cells, tissues and animals, especially humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor therapeutics, an animal, preferably a human, suspected of having a disease or disorder which can be treated by modulating the expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 is treated by administering antisense compounds in accordance with this invention. For example, in one non-limiting embodiment, the methods comprise the step of administering to the animal in need of treatment, a therapeutically effective amount of a diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 inhibitor. The diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 inhibitors of the present invention effectively inhibit the activity of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 protein or inhibit the expression of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 protein. In one embodiment, the activity or expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in an animal is inhibited by about 10%. Preferably, the activity or expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in an animal is inhibited by about 30%. More preferably, the activity or expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in an animal is inhibited by 50% or more. Thus, the antisense compounds modulate expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 mRNA by at least 10%, by at least 20%, by at least 25%, by at least 30%, by at least 40%, by at least 50%, by at least 60%, by at least 70%, by at least 75%, by at least 80%, by at least 85%, by at least 90%, by at least 95%, by at least 98%, by at least 99%, or by 100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the reduction of the expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 may be measured in serum, adipose tissue, liver or any other body fluid, tissue or organ of the animal. Preferably, the cells contained within said fluids, tissues or organs being analyzed contain a nucleic acid molecule encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 protein and/or the diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 protein itself.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antisense compounds of the invention can be utilized in pharmaceutical compositions by adding an effective amount of a compound to a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The compounds and methods of the invention may also be useful prophylactically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antisense compounds of the present invention are also useful for identifying diseased states associated with diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression. The methods include identifying the presence of a nucleic acid encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in a sample using at least one of the primers comprising SEQ ID NOs: 6 or 7, or the probe comprising SEQ ID NO: 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antisense compounds are further useful for treating or preventing a variety of conditions. Typically, the compounds of the present invention are utilized to ameliorate or lessen the severity of a condition in an animal. The conditions can include cardiovascular disorder, obesity such as diet induced obesity, diabetes, cholesterolemia, and liver steatosis, among others. There are several physical indicia of obesity and include increased fat, among others. The treatment or prevention of a condition using the compounds of the invention can include contacting an animal with an effective amount of a compound of the invention. Preferably, expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 is inhibited and the measurement of one or more physical indicia of the condition indicates a lessening of the severity of the condition. Typically, the animal is obese.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antisense compounds are additionally utilized for lowering certain components of blood from an animal. Typically, the compounds of the invention are useful for lowering serum free fatty acids, serum triglycerides, lowering HDL cholesterol, lowering total serum cholesterol, plasma or serum insulin, or hepatic triglycerides in an animal. Typically, the animal is contacted with an effective amount of a compound of the invention. Preferably, the plasma insulin levels are lowered at about two or four weeks after contacting the animal with a compound of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are also useful in inhibiting the expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in a cell or tissue of an animal. The method includes contacting the cell or tissue with a compound of the invention. Preferably, expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 is inhibited in the present method. Typically, the tissue of the animal is white adipose tissue or brown adipose tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are further useful in methods for modulating fatty acid synthesis, lipogenesis, or gluconeogenesis, among others, in an animal. Typically, the animal is contacted with a compound of the invention. The modulation of lipogenesis can be determined by a change in the mRNA level of a nucleic acid encoding a lipogenic gene. The lipogenic gene is selected from among glycerol kinase, ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2, fatty acid synthase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, HMG-CoA reductase, lipoprotein lipase and sterol regulatory binding element protein 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are additionally useful for reducing the liver weight of an animal. For this use, the animal is contacted with a compound of the invention. Typically, the animal is obese or diabetic.\n\n\n \n\n\nF. Modifications\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs is known in the art, a nucleoside is a base-sugar combination. The base portion of the nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base sometimes referred to as a \"nucleobase\" or simply a \"base\". The two most common classes of such heterocyclic bases are the purines and the pyrimidines. Nucleotides are nucleosides that further include a phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside. For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to the 2', 3' or 5' hydroxyl moiety of the sugar. In forming oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link adjacent nucleosides to one another to form a linear polymeric compound. In turn, the respective ends of this linear polymeric compound can be further joined to form a circular compound, however, linear compounds are generally preferred. In addition, linear compounds may have internal nucleobase complementarity and may therefore fold in a manner as to produce a fully or partially double-stranded compound. Within oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the internucleoside backbone of the oligonucleotide. The normal linkage or backbone of RNA and DNA is a 3' to 5' phosphodiester linkage.\n\n\n \n\n\nModified Internucleoside Linkages (Backbones)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAntisense compounds useful in this invention include oligonucleotides containing modified backbones or non-natural internucleoside linkages. As used herein, and \"oligonucleotide mimetic\" or \"mimetic\" refers to any compound of the invention which is modified from the naturally occurring RNA or DNA nucleic acids. As defined herein, oligonucleotides having modified backbones include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone. For the purposes of this specification, and as sometimes referenced in the art, modified oligonucleotides that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to be oligonucleosides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred modified oligonucleotide backbones containing a phosphorus atom therein include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3'-alkylene phosphonates, 5'-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3'-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, selenophosphates and boranophosphates having normal 3'-5' linkages, 2'-5' linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein one or more internucleotide linkages is a 3' to 3', 5' to 5' or 2' to 2' linkage. Preferred oligonucleotides having inverted polarity comprise a single 3' to 3' linkage at the 3'-most internucleotide linkage i.e. a single inverted nucleoside residue which may be abasic (the nucleobase is missing or has a hydroxyl group in place thereof). Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative United States patents that teach the preparation of the above phosphorus-containing linkages include, but are not limited to, \n \nU.S. Patent Nos: 3,687,808\n \n; \n \n4,469,863\n \n; \n \n4,476,301\n \n; \n \n5,023,243\n \n; \n \n5,177,196\n \n; \n \n5,188,897\n \n; \n \n5,264,423\n \n; \n \n5,276,019\n \n; \n \n5,278,302\n \n; \n \n5,286,717\n \n; \n \n5,321,131\n \n; \n \n5,399,676\n \n; \n \n5,405,939\n \n; \n \n5,453,496\n \n; \n \n5,455,233\n \n; \n \n5,466,677\n \n; \n \n5,476,925\n \n; \n \n5,519,126\n \n; \n \n5,536,821\n \n; \n \n5,541,306\n \n; \n \n5,550,111\n \n; \n \n5,563,253\n \n; \n \n5,571,799\n \n; \n \n5,587,361\n \n; \n \n5,194,599\n \n; \n \n5,565,555\n \n; \n \n5,527,899\n \n; \n \n5,721,218\n \n; \n \n5,672,697\n \n and \n \n5,625,050\n \n, each of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred modified oligonucleotide backbones that do not include a phosphorus atom therein have backbones that are formed by short chain alkyl or cycloalkyl internucleoside linkages, mixed heteroatom and alkyl or cycloalkyl internucleoside linkages, or one or more short chain heteroatomic or heterocyclic internucleoside linkages.

Included in stabilizing groups are cap structures. By \"cap structure or terminal cap moiety\" is meant chemical modifications, which have been incorporated at either terminus of oligonucleotides (see for example Wincott et al. and International Patent Publication No. \n \nWO 97/26270\n \n, incorporated by reference herein). These terminal modifications protect the oligomeric compounds having terminal nucleic acid molecules from exonuclease degradation, and can help in delivery and/or localization within a cell. The cap can be present at the 5'-terminus (5'-cap) or at the 3'-terminus (3'-cap) or at both termini. In non-limiting examples, the 5'-cap includes inverted abasic residue (moiety), 4',5'-methylene nucleotide; 1-(beta-D-erythrofuranosyl) nucleotide, 4'-thio nucleotide, carbocyclic nucleotide; 1,5-anhydrohexitol nucleotide; L-nucleotides; alpha-nucleotides; modified base nucleotide; phosphorodithioate linkage; threo-pentofuranosyl nucleotide; acyclic 3',4'-seco nucleotide; acyclic 3,4-dihydroxybutyl nucleotide; acyclic 3,5-dihydroxypentyl ribonucleotide, 3'-3'-inverted nucleotide moiety; 3'-3'-inverted abasic moiety; 3'-2'-inverted nucleotide moiety; 3'-2'-inverted abasic moiety; 1,4-butanediol phosphate; 3'-phosphoramidate; hexylphosphate; aminohexyl phosphate; 3'-phosphate; 3'-phosphorothioate; phosphorodithioate; or bridging or non-bridging methylphosphonate moiety (for more details see Wincott et al., International Patent Publication No. \n \nWO 97/26270\n \n, incorporated by reference herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly preferred 3'-cap structures of the present invention include, for example 4',5'-methylene nucleotide; 1-(beta-D-erythrofuranosyl) nucleotide; 4'-thio nucleotide, carbocyclic nucleotide; 5'-amino-alkyl phosphate; 1,3-diamino-2-propyl phosphate, 3-aminopropyl phosphate; 6-aminohexyl phosphate; 1,2-aminododecyl phosphate; hydroxypropyl phosphate; 1,5-anhydrohexitol nucleotide; L-nucleotide; alpha-nucleotide; modified base nucleotide; phosphorodithioate; threo-pentofuranosyl nucleotide; acyclic 3',4'-seco nucleotide; 3,4-dihydroxybutyl nucleotide; 3,5-dihydroxypentyl nucleotide, 5'-5'-inverted nucleotide moiety; 5'-5'-inverted abasic moiety; 5'-phosphoramidate; 5'-phosphorothioate; 1,4-butanediol phosphate; 5'-amino; bridging and/or non-bridging 5'-phosphoramidate, phosphorothioate and/or phosphorodithioate, bridging or non bridging methylphosphonate and 5'-mercapto moieties (for more details see \nBeaucage and Tyer, 1993, Tetrahedron 49, 1925\n; incorporated by reference herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther 3' and 5'-stabilizing groups that can be used to cap one or both ends of an oligomeric compound to impart nuclease stability include those disclosed in International Patent Publication No. \n \nWO 03/004602, published January 16, 2003\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\nChimeric compounds\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is not necessary for all positions in a given compound or oligonucleotide mimetic to be uniformly modified, and in fact one or more of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single compound or even at a single nucleoside within an oligonucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes antisense compounds or mimetics which are chimeric compounds. \"Chimeric\" antisense compounds or \"chimeras,\" in the context of this invention, are antisense compounds, particularly oligonucleotides, which contain at least two chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one monomer unit, i.e., a nucleotide in the case of an oligonucleotide compound. Chimeric antisense oligonucleotides are thus a form of antisense compound. These oligonucleotides typically contain at least one chemically distinct region wherein the oligonucleotide is modified so as to confer upon the oligonucleotide increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, increased stability and/or increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid. An additional chemically distinct region of the oligonucleotide may serve as a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or RNA:RNA hybrids. By way of example, RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. Modifications that activate, recruit or trigger RNase H and result in cleavage of the RNA target thereby greatly enhance the efficiency of oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of gene expression. The cleavage of RNA:RNA hybrids can, in like fashion, be accomplished through the actions of endoribonucleases such as RnaseL, which cleaves both cellular and viral RNA. Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely detected by gel electrophoresis and, if necessary, associated nucleic acid hybridization techniques known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred chimeric oligonucleotides are those disclosed in the Examples herein. Particularly preferred chimeric oligonucleotides are those referred to as SEQ ID NOS: 65, 26, 29, and 35, as well as those chimeric oligonucleotides set forth in Tables 2, 3, 14, and 15 and specified in the Examples below. Preferred siRNAs are those referred to as SEQ ID Nos: 238, 242, 243, 251, and 252, as well as those set forth in Table 11 and specified in the Examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric antisense compounds of the invention may be formed as composite structures of two or more oligonucleotides, modified oligonucleotides, oligonucleosides and/or oligonucleotide mimetics as described above. Chimeric antisense compounds can be of several different types. These include a first type wherein the \"gap\" segment of linked nucleosides is positioned between 5' and 3' \"wing\" segments of linked nucleosides and a second \"open end\" type wherein the \"gap\" segment is located at either the 3' or the 5' terminus of the chimeric antisense compound. Compounds of the first type are also known in the art as \"gapmers\" or gapped oligonucleotides. Compounds of the second type are also known in the art as \"hemimers\" or \"wingmers\". Such compounds have also been referred to in the art as hybrids. In a gapmer that is 20 nucleotides in length, a gap or wing can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 nucleotides in length. In one embodiment, a 20-nucleotide gapmer is comprised of a gap 8 nucleotides in length, flanked on both the 5' and 3' sides by wings 6 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, a 20-nucleotide gapmer is comprised of a gap 10 nucleotides in length, flanked on both the 5' and 3' sides by wings 5 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, a 20-nucleotide gapmer is comprised of a gap 12 nucleotides in length flanked on both the 5' and 3' sides by wings 4 nucleotides in length. In a further embodiment, a 20-nucleotide gapmer is comprised of a gap 14 nucleotides in length flanked on both the 5' and 3' sides by wings 3 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, a 20-nucleotide gapmer is comprised of a gap 16 nucleotides in length flanked on both the 5' and 3' sides by wings 2 nucleotides in length. In a further embodiment, a 20-nucleotide gapmer is comprised of a gap 18 nucleotides in length flanked on both the 5' and 3' ends by wings 1 nucleotide in length. Alternatively, the wings are of different lengths, for example, a 20-nucleotide gapmer may be comprised of a gap 10 nucleotides in length, flanked by a 6-nucleotide wing on one side (5' or 3') and a 4-nucleotide wing on the other side (5' or 3').\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a hemimer, an \"open end\" chimeric antisense compound having two chemically distinct regions, a first chemically distinct region, or the gap segment, in a compound 20 nucleotides in length can be located at either the 5' or 3' terminus of the oligomeric compound, can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 or 19 nucleotides in length. A second chemically distinct region in a compound 20 nucleotides in length can be located at the 3' terminus of the compound and can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 or 19 nucleotides in length. For example, a 20-nucleotide hemimer can have a first chemically distinct region, or a gap segment, of 10 nucleotides at the 5' end and a second segment of 10 nucleotides at the 3' end.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative United States patents that teach the preparation of such hybrid structures include, but are not limited to, \n \nU.S. Patent Nos: 5,013,830\n \n; \n \n5,149,797\n \n; \n \n5,220,007\n \n; \n \n5,256,775\n \n; \n \n5,366,878\n \n; \n \n5,403,711\n \n; \n \n5,491,133\n \n; \n \n5,565,350\n \n; \n \n5,623,065\n \n; \n \n5,652,355\n \n; \n \n5,652,356\n \n; and \n \n5,700,922\n \n, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n\n\nG.

Accordingly, for example, the disclosure is also drawn to prodrugs and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such prodrugs, and other bioequivalents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"prodrug\" indicates a therapeutic agent that is prepared in an inactive form that is converted to an active form (i.e., drug) within the body or cells thereof by the action of endogenous enzymes or other chemicals and/or conditions. In particular, prodrug versions of the oligonucleotides of the invention are prepared as SATE [(S-acetyl-2-thioethyl) phosphate] derivatives according to the methods disclosed in International Patent Publication No. \n \nWO 93/24510 to Gosselin et al., published December 9, 1993\n \n or in International Patent Publication No. \n \nWO 94/26764\n \n and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,770,713 to Imbach et al\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" refers to physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention: i.e., salts that retain the desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects thereto. For oligonucleotides, preferred examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and their uses are further described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,287,860\n \n, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts are formed with metals or amines, such as alkali and alkaline earth metals or organic amines.

The base addition salts of said acidic compounds are prepared by contacting the free acid form with a sufficient amount of the desired base to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free acid form may be regenerated by contacting the salt form with an acid and isolating the free acid in the conventional manner. The free acid forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to their respective free acid for purposes of the present invention. As used herein, a \"pharmaceutical addition salt\" includes a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of an acid form of one of the components of the compositions of the invention.

Administration may be topical (including ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary, e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Oligonucleotides with at least one 2'-O-methoxyethyl modification are believed to be particularly useful for oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred topical formulations include those in which the oligonucleotides of the invention are in admixture with a topical delivery agent such as lipids, liposomes, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, steroids, chelating agents and surfactants. Preferred lipids and liposomes include neutral (e.g. dioleoylphosphatidyl DOPE ethanolamine, dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline DMPC, distearolyphosphatidyl choline) negative (e.g. dimyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol DMPG) and cationic (e.g. dioleoyltetramethylaminopropyl DOTAP and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine DOTMA). Oligonucleotides of the invention may be encapsulated within liposomes or may form complexes thereto, in particular to cationic liposomes. Alternatively, oligonucleotides may be complexed to lipids, in particular to cationic lipids. Preferred fatty acids and esters include but are not limited arachidonic acid, oleic acid, eicosanoic acid, lauric acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein, dilaurin, glyceryl 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, an acylcarnitine, an acylcholine, or a C\n1-10\n alkyl ester (e.g. isopropylmyristate IPM), monoglyceride, diglyceride or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Topical formulations are described in detail in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,747,014\n \n, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an oligonucleotide may be administered to a subject via an oral route of administration. The subjects of the present invention comprise animals. An animal subject may be a mammal, such as a mouse, a rat, a dog, a guinea pig, a human, a non-human primate, a cat or a pig. Non-human primates include monkeys and chimpanzees. A suitable animal subject may be an experimental animal, such as a mouse, a rat, a dog, a non-human primate, a cat or a pig.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the subject may be a human. In certain embodiments, the subject may be a human patient as discussed in more detail herein. In certain embodiments, it may be necessary to modulate the expression of one or more genes of the human patient. In some particular embodiments, it may be necessary to inhibit expression of one or more genes of the human patient. In particular embodiments, it may be necessary to modulate, i.e. inhibit or enhance, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in order to obtain therapeutic outcomes discussed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, non-parenteral (e.g. oral) oligonucleotide formulations according to the present invention result in enhanced bioavailability of the oligonucleotide. In this context, the term \"bioavailability\" refers to a measurement of that portion of an administered drug which reaches the circulatory system (e.g. blood, especially blood plasma) when a particular mode of administration is used to deliver the drug. Enhanced bioavailability refers to a particular mode of administration's ability to deliver oligonucleotide to the peripheral blood plasma of a subject relative to another mode of administration. For example, when a non-parenteral mode of administration (e.g. an oral mode) is used to introduce the drug into a subject, the bioavailability for that mode of administration may be compared to a different mode of administration, e.g. an IV mode of administration. In some embodiments, the area under a compound's blood plasma concentration curve (AUC\n0\n) after non-parenteral administration may be divided by the area under the drug's plasma concentration curve after intravenous (i.v.) administration (AUC\niv\n) to provide a dimensionless quotient (relative bioavailability, RB) that represents fraction of compound absorbed via the non-parenteral route as compared to the IV route. A composition's bioavailability is said to be enhanced in comparison to another composition's bioavailability when the first composition's relative bioavailability (RB\n1\n) is greater than the second composition's relative bioavailability (RB\n2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, bioavailability correlates with therapeutic efficacy when a compound's therapeutic efficacy is related to the blood concentration achieved, even if the drug's ultimate site of action is intracellular (\nvan Berge-Henegouwen et al., Gastroenterol., 1977, 73, 300\n). Bioavailability studies have been used to determine the degree of intestinal absorption of a drug by measuring the change in peripheral blood levels of the drug after an oral dose (\nDiSanto, Chapter 76 In: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1990, pages 1451-1458\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the bioavailability of an oral composition (comprising an oligonucleotide) is said to be \"enhanced\" when its relative bioavailability is greater than the bioavailability of a composition substantially consisting of pure oligonucleotide, i.e. oligonucleotide in the absence of a penetration enhancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrgan bioavailability refers to the concentration of compound in an organ. Organ bioavailability may be measured in test subjects by a number of means, such as by whole-body radiography. Organ bioavailability may be modified, e.g. enhanced, by one or more modifications to the oligonucleotide, by use of one or more carrier compounds or excipients, etc. as discussed in more detail herein. In general, an increase in bioavailability will result in an increase in organ bioavailability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOral oligonucleotide compositions according to the present invention may comprise one or more \"mucosal penetration enhancers,\" also known as \"absorption enhancers\" or simply as \"penetration enhancers.\" Accordingly, some embodiments of the invention comprise at least one oligonucleotide in combination with at least one penetration enhancer. In general, a penetration enhancer is a substance that facilitates the transport of a drug across mucous membrane(s) associated with the desired mode of administration, e.g. intestinal epithelial membranes. Accordingly it is desirable to select one or more penetration enhancers that facilitate the uptake of an oligonucleotide, without interfering with the activity of the oligonucleotide, and in such a manner the oligonucleotide can be introduced into the body of an animal without unacceptable degrees of side-effects such as toxicity, irritation or allergic response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiments of the present invention provide compositions comprising one or more pharmaceutically acceptable penetration enhancers, and methods of using such compositions, which result in the improved bioavailability of oligonucleotides administered via non-parenteral modes of administration. Heretofore, certain penetration enhancers have been used to improve the bioavailability of certain drugs. See \nMuranishi, Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1\n and \nLee et al., Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, 8, 91\n. It has been found that the uptake and delivery of oligonucleotides can be greatly improved even when administered by non-parenteral means through the use of a number of different classes of penetration enhancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, compositions for non-parenteral administration include one or more modifications to naturally-occurring oligonucleotides (i.e. full-phosphodiester deoxyribosyl or full-phosphodiester ribosyl oligonucleotides). Such modifications may increase binding affinity, nuclease stability, cell or tissue permeability, tissue distribution, or other biological or pharmacokinetic property. Modifications may be made to the base, the linker, or the sugar, in general, as discussed in more detail herein with regards to oligonucleotide chemistry. In some embodiments of the invention, compositions for administration to a subject, and in particular oral compositions for administration to an animal (human or non-human) subject, will comprise modified oligonucleotides having one or more modifications for enhancing affinity, stability, tissue distribution, or other biological property.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable modified linkers include phosphorothioate linkers. In some embodiments according to the invention, the oligonucleotide has at least one phosphorothioate linker. Phosphorothioate linkers provide nuclease stability as well as plasma protein binding characteristics to the oligonucleotide. Nuclease stability is useful for increasing the in vivo lifetime of oligonucleotides, while plasma protein binding decreases the rate of first pass clearance of oligonucleotide via renal excretion. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the oligonucleotide has at least two phosphorothioate linkers. In some embodiments, wherein the oligonucleotide has exactly n nucleosides, the oligonucleotide has from one to n-1 phosphorothioate linkages. In some embodiments, wherein the oligonucleotide has exactly n nucleosides, the oligonucleotide has n-1 phosphorothioate linkages. In other embodiments wherein the oligonucleotide has exactly n nucleoside, and n is even, the oligonucleotide has from 1 to n/2 phosphorothioate linkages, or, when n is odd, from 1 to (n-1)/2 phosphorothioate linkages. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide has alternating phosphodiester (PO) and phosphorothioate (PS) linkages. In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide has at least one stretch of two or more consecutive PO linkages and at least one stretch of two or more PS linkages. In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide has at least two stretches of PO linkages interrupted by at least one PS linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, at least one of the nucleosides is modified on the ribosyl sugar unit by a modification that imparts nuclease stability, binding affinity or some other beneficial biological property to the sugar. In some cases, the sugar modification includes a 2'-modification, e.g. the 2'-OH of the ribosyl sugar is replaced or substituted. Suitable replacements for 2'-OH include 2'-F and 2'-arabino-F. Suitable substitutions for OH include 2'-\nO\n-alkyl, e.g. 2-\nO\n-methyl, and 2'-\nO\n-substituted alkyl, e.g. 2'-\nO\n-methoxyethyl, 2'-NH\n2\n, 2'-\nO\n-aminopropyl, etc. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide contains at least one 2'-modification. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide contains at least two 2'-modifications. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide has at least one 2'-modification at each of the termini (i.e. the 3'- and 5'-terminal nucleosides each have the same or different 2'-modifications). In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide has at least two sequential 2'-modifications at each end of the oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, oligonucleotides further comprise at least one deoxynucleoside. In particular embodiments, oligonucleotides comprise a stretch of deoxynucleosides such that the stretch is capable of activating RNase (e.g. RNase H) cleavage of an RNA to which the oligonucleotide is capable of hybridizing. In some embodiments, a stretch of deoxynucleosides capable of activating RNase-mediated cleavage of RNA comprises about 6 to about 16, e.g. about 8 to about 16 consecutive deoxynucleosides. In further embodiments, oligonucleotides are capable of eliciting cleaveage by dsRNAse enzymes which act on RNA:RNA hybrids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOligonucleotide compositions of the present invention may be formulated in various dosage forms such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, liquid syrups, soft gels, suppositories, and enemas. The term \"alimentary delivery\" encompasses e.g. oral, rectal, endoscopic and sublingual/buccal administration. A common requirement for these modes of administration is absorption over some portion or all of the alimentary tract and a need for efficient mucosal penetration of the oligonucleotides or mimetics thereof so administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery of a drug via the oral mucosa, as in the case of buccal and sublingual administration, has several desirable features, including, in many instances, a more rapid rise in plasma concentration of the drug (\nHarvey, Chapter 35 In: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1990, page 711\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndoscopy may be used for drug delivery directly to an interior portion of the alimentary tract. For example, endoscopic retrograde cystopancreatography (ERCP) takes advantage of extended gastroscopy and permits selective access to the biliary tract and the pancreatic duct (\nHirahata et al., Gan To Kagaku Ryoho, 1992, 19(10 Suppl.), 1591\n). Pharmaceutical compositions, including liposomal formulations, can be delivered directly into portions of the alimentary canal, such as, \ne.g.,\n the duodenum (\nSomogyi et al., Pharm. Res., 1995, 12, 149\n) or the gastric submucosa (\nAkamo et al., Japanese J. Cancer Res., 1994, 85, 652\n) via endoscopic means. Gastric lavage devices (\nInoue et al., Artif. Organs, 1997, 21, 28\n) and percutaneous endoscopic feeding devices (Pennington \net al., Ailment Pharmacol. Ther.,\n 1995, \n9\n, 471) can also be used for direct alimentary delivery of pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, oligonucleotide formulations may be administered through the anus into the rectum or lower intestine. Rectal suppositories, retention enemas or rectal catheters can be used for this purpose and may be preferred when patient compliance might otherwise be difficult to achieve (\ne.g.\n, in pediatric and geriatric applications, or when the patient is vomiting or unconscious). Rectal administration can result in more prompt and higher blood levels than the oral route. (\nHarvey, Chapter 35 In: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1990, page 711\n). Because about 50% of the drug that is absorbed from the rectum will likely bypass the liver, administration by this route significantly reduces the potential for first-pass metabolism (\nBenet et al., Chapter 1 In: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Ed., Hardman et al., eds., McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, 1996\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome embodiments employ various penetration enhancers in order to effect transport of oligonucleotides and other nucleic acids across mucosal and epithelial membranes. Penetration enhancers may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories - surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (\nLee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92\n). Accordingly, some embodiments comprise oral oligonucleotide compositions comprising at least one member of the group consisting of surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating surfactants. Further embodiments comprise oral oligonucleotide compositions comprising at least one fatty acid, e.g. capric or lauric acid, or combinations or salts thereof. Other embodiments comprise methods of enhancing the oral bioavailability of an oligonucleotide, the method comprising co-administering the oligonucleotide and at least one penetration enhancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther excipients that may be added to oral oligonucleotide compositions include surfactants (or \"surface-active agents\"). These are chemical entities which, when dissolved in an aqueous solution, reduce the surface tension of the solution or the interfacial tension between the aqueous solution and another liquid, with the result that absorption of oligonucleotides through the alimentary mucosa and other epithelial membranes is enhanced. In addition to bile salts and fatty acids, surfactants include, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether and polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether (\nLee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92\n); and perfluorohemical emulsions, such as FC-43 (\nTakahashi et al., J. Pharm. Phamacol., 1988, 40, 252\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFatty acids and their derivatives which act as penetration enhancers and may be used in compositions of the present invention include, for example, oleic acid, lauric acid, capric acid (n-decanoic acid), myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein (1-monooleoyl-rac-glycerol), dilaurin, caprylic acid, arachidonic acid, glyceryl 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, acylcarnitines, acylcholines and mono- and di-glycerides thereof and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof (\ni.e.,\n oleate, laurate, caprate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, linoleate, \netc.\n) (\nLee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92\n; \nMuranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1\n; \nE1-Hariri et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1992, 44, 651\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of bile salts also function as penetration enhancers to facilitate the uptake and bioavailability of drugs. The physiological roles of bile include the facilitation of dispersion and absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins (\nBrunton, Chapter 38 In: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Ed., Hardman et al., eds., McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, 1996, pages 934-935\n). Various natural bile salts, and their synthetic derivatives, act as penetration enhancers. Thus, the term \"bile salt\" includes any of the naturally occurring components of bile as well as any of their synthetic derivatives. The bile salts of the invention include, for example, cholic acid (or its pharmaceutically acceptable sodium salt, sodium cholate), dehydrocholic acid (sodium dehydrocholate), deoxycholic acid (sodium deoxycholate), glucholic acid (sodium glucholate), glycholic acid (sodium glycocholate), glycodeoxycholic acid (sodium glycodeoxycholate), taurocholic acid (sodium taurocholate), taurodeoxycholic acid (sodium taurodeoxycholate), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, sodium chenodeoxycholate), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), sodium tauro-24,25-dihydro-fusidate (STDHF), sodium glycodihydrofusidate and polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (POE) (\nLee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92\n; \nSwinyard, Chapter 39 In: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1990, pages 782-783\n; \nMuranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1\n; \nYamamoto et al., J. Pharm. Exp. Ther., 1992, 263, 25\n; \nYamashita et al,, J. Pharm. Sci., 1990, 79, 579\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, penetration enhancers of the present invention are mixtures of penetration enhancing compounds. One such penetration mixture is UDCA (and/or CDCA) with capric and/or lauric acids or salts thereof e.g. sodium. Such mixtures are useful for enhancing the delivery of biologically active substances across mucosal membranes, in particular intestinal mucosa. Other penetration enhancer mixtures comprise about 5-95% of bile acid or salt(s) UDCA and/or CDCA with 5-95% capric and/or lauric acid. Particular penetration enhancers are mixtures of the sodium salts of UDCA, capric acid and lauric acid in a ratio of about 1:2:2 respectively. Another such penetration enhancer is a mixture of capric and lauric acid (or salts thereof) in a 0.01:1 to 1:0.01 ratio (mole basis). In particular embodiments capric acid and lauric acid are present in molar ratios of e.g. about 0.1:1 to about 1:0.1, in particular about 0.5:1 to about 1:0.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther excipients include chelating agents, i.e. compounds that remove metallic ions from solution by forming complexes therewith, with the result that absorption of oligonucleotides through the alimentary and other mucosa is enhanced. With regards to their use as penetration enhancers in compositions containing DNA-like oligonucleotides of the present invention, chelating agents have the added advantage of also serving as DNase inhibitors, as most characterized DNA nucleases require a divalent metal ion for catalysis and are thus inhibited by chelating agents (\nJarrett, J. Chromatogr., 1993, 618, 315\n). Chelating agents of the invention include, but are not limited to, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), citric acid, salicylates (\ne.g.\n, sodium salicylate, 5-methoxysalicylate and homovanilate), N-acyl derivatives of collagen, laureth-9 and N-amino acyl derivatives of beta-diketones (enamines)(\nLee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92\n; \nMuranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1\n; \nBuur et al., J. Control Rel., 1990, 14, 43\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, non-chelating non-surfactant penetration enhancers may be defined as compounds that demonstrate insignificant activity as chelating agents or as surfactants but that nonetheless enhance absorption of oligonucleotides through the alimentary and other mucosal membranes (\nMuranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1\n). This class of penetration enhancers includes, but is not limited to, unsaturated cyclic ureas, 1-alkyl- and 1-alkenylazacyclo-alkanone derivatives (\nLee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92\n); and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as diclofenac sodium, indomethacin and phenylbutazone (\nYamashita et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1987, 39, 621\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, oligonucleotide compositions for oral delivery comprise at least two discrete phases, which phases may comprise particles, capsules, gel-capsules, microspheres, etc. Each phase may contain one or more oligonucleotides, penetration enhancers, surfactants, bioadhesives, effervescent agents, or other adjuvant, excipient or diluent. In some embodiments, one phase comprises at least one oligonucleotide and at least one penetration enhancer. In some embodiments, a first phase comprises at least one oligonucleotide and at least one penetration enhancer, while a second phase comprises at least one penetration enhancer. In some embodiments, a first phase comprises at least one oligonucleotide and at least one penetration enhancer, while a second phase comprises at least one penetration enhancer and substantially no oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, at least one phase is compounded with at least one degradation retardant, such as a coating or a matrix, which delays release of the contents of that phase. In some embodiments, a first phase comprises at least one oligonucleotide and at least one penetration enhancer, while a second phase comprises at least one penetration enhancer and a release-retardant. In particular embodiments, an oral oligonucleotide composition comprises a first phase comprising particles containing an oligonucleotide and a penetration enhancer, and a second phase comprising particles coated with a release-retarding agent and containing penetration enhancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgents that enhance uptake of oligonucleotides at the cellular level may also be added to the pharmaceutical, therapeutic and other compositions of the present invention. For example, cationic lipids, such as LIPOFECTIN™ reagent (\n \nJunichi et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,705,188\n \n), cationic glycerol derivatives, and polycationic molecules, such as polylysine (Lollo \net al.,\n International Patent Publication No. \n \nWO 97/30731\n \n), can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"pharmaceutical carrier\" or \"excipient\" may be a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, suspending agent or any other pharmacologically inert vehicle for delivering one or more nucleic acids to an animal. The excipient may be liquid or solid and is selected, with the planned manner of administration in mind, so as to provide for the desired bulk, consistency, etc., when combined with a an oligonucleotide and the other components of a given pharmaceutical composition. Typical pharmaceutical carriers include, but are not limited to, binding agents (\ne.g.\n, pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, etc.); fillers (\ne.g.\n, lactose and other sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, pectin, gelatin, calcium sulfate, ethyl cellulose, polyacrylates or calcium hydrogen phosphate, etc.); lubricants (\ne.g.\n, magnesium stearate, talc, silica, colloidal silicon dioxide, stearic acid, metallic stearates, hydrogenated vegetable oils, corn starch, polyethylene glycols, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, etc.); disintegrants (\ne.g.\n, starch, sodium starch glycolate, EXPLOTAB™); and wetting agents (\ne.g.\n, sodium lauryl sulphate, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOral oligonucleotide compositions may additionally contain other adjunct components conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions, at their art-established usage levels. Thus, for example, the compositions may contain additional, compatible, pharmaceutically-active materials such as, for example, antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory agents, or may contain additional materials useful in physically formulating various dosage forms of the composition of present invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opacifiers, thickening agents and stabilizers. However, such materials, when added, should not unduly interfere with the biological activities of the components of the compositions of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions and formulations for parenteral, intrathecal or intraventricular administration may include sterile aqueous solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives such as, but not limited to, penetration enhancers, carrier compounds and other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention, which may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, may be prepared according to conventional techniques well known in the pharmaceutical industry. Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the active ingredients with the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredients with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention may be formulated into any of many possible dosage forms such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gel capsules, liquid syrups, soft gels, suppositories, and enemas. The compositions of the present invention may also be formulated as suspensions in aqueous, non-aqueous or mixed media. Aqueous suspensions may further contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran. The suspension may also contain stabilizers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, foams, solutions, emulsions, and liposome-containing formulations. These compositions may be generated from a variety of components that include, but are not limited to, preformed liquids, self-emulsifying solids and self-emulsifying semisolids. The pharmaceutical compositions and formulations of the present invention may comprise one or more penetration enhancers, carriers, excipients or other active or inactive ingredients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated and used as foams. Pharmaceutical foams include formulations such as, but not limited to, emulsions, microemulsions, creams, jellies and liposomes. While basically similar in nature these formulations vary in the components and the consistency of the final product. The preparation of such compositions and formulations is generally known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical and formulation arts and may be applied to the formulation of the compositions of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be prepared and formulated as emulsions. Emulsions are typically heterogeneous systems of one liquid dispersed in another in the form of droplets usually exceeding 0.1 µm in diameter (\nIdson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199\n; \nRosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., Volume 1, p. 245\n; \nBlock in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 2, p. 335\n; \nHiguchi et al., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1985, p. 301\n). Emulsions are often biphasic systems comprising of two immiscible liquid phases intimately mixed and dispersed with each other. In general, emulsions may be either water-in-oil (w/o) or of the oil-in-water (o/w) variety. When an aqueous phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk oily phase the resulting composition is called a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion. Alternatively, when an oily phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk aqueous phase the resulting composition is called an oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion. Emulsions may contain additional components in addition to the dispersed phases and the active drug which may be present as a solution in either the aqueous phase, oily phase or itself as a separate phase. Pharmaceutical excipients such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, dyes, and anti-oxidants may also be present in emulsions as needed. Pharmaceutical emulsions may also be multiple emulsions that are comprised of more than two phases such as, for example, in the case of oil-in-water-in-oil (o/w/o) and water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsions. Such complex formulations often provide certain advantages that simple binary emulsions do not. Multiple emulsions in which individual oil droplets of an o/w emulsion enclose small water droplets constitute a w/o/w emulsion. Likewise a system of oil droplets enclosed in globules of water stabilized in an oily continuous provides an o/w/o emulsion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOften, the dispersed or discontinuous phase of the emulsion is well dispersed into the external or continuous phase and maintained in this form through the means of emulsifiers or the viscosity of the formulation. Either of the phases of the emulsion may be a semisolid or a solid, as is the case of emulsion-style ointment bases and creams. Other means of stabilizing emulsions entail the use of emulsifiers that may be incorporated into either phase of the emulsion. Emulsifiers may broadly be classified into four categories: synthetic surfactants, naturally occurring emulsifiers, absorption bases, and finely dispersed solids (\nIdson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthetic surfactants, also known as surface active agents, have found wide applicability in the formulation of emulsions and have been reviewed in the literature (\nRieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 285\n; \nIdson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, volume 1, p. 199\n). Surfactants are typically amphiphilic and comprise a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic portion. The ratio of the hydrophilic to the hydrophobic nature of the surfactant has been termed the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB) and is a valuable tool in categorizing and selecting surfactants in the preparation of formulations. Surfactants may be classified into different classes based on the nature of the hydrophilic group: nonionic, anionic, cationic and amphoteric (\nRieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 285\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNaturally occurring emulsifiers used in emulsion formulations include lanolin, beeswax, phosphatides, lecithin and acacia. Absorption bases possess hydrophilic properties such that they can soak up water to form w/o emulsions yet retain their semisolid consistencies, such as anhydrous lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum. Finely divided solids have also been used as good emulsifiers especially in combination with surfactants and in viscous preparations. These include polar inorganic solids, such as heavy metal hydroxides, nonswelling clays such as bentonite, attapulgite, hectorite, kaolin, montmorillonite, colloidal aluminum silicate and colloidal magnesium aluminum silicate, pigments and nonpolar solids such as carbon or glyceryl tristearate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA large variety of non-emulsifying materials are also included in emulsion formulations and contribute to the properties of emulsions. These include fats, oils, waxes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty esters, humectants, hydrophilic colloids, preservatives and antioxidants (\nBlock, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 335\n; \nIdson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHydrophilic colloids or hydrocolloids include naturally occurring gums and synthetic polymers such as polysaccharides (for example, acacia, agar, alginic acid, carrageenan, guar gum, karaya gum, and tragacanth), cellulose derivatives (for example, carboxymethylcellulose and carboxypropylcellulose), and synthetic polymers (for example, carbomers, cellulose ethers, and carboxyvinyl polymers). These disperse or swell in water to form colloidal solutions that stabilize emulsions by forming strong interfacial films around the dispersed-phase droplets and by increasing the viscosity of the external phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince emulsions often contain a number of ingredients such as carbohydrates, proteins, sterols and phosphatides that may readily support the growth of microbes, these formulations often incorporate preservatives. Commonly used preservatives included in emulsion formulations include methyl paraben, propyl paraben, quaternary ammonium salts, benzalkonium chloride, esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and boric acid. Antioxidants are also commonly added to emulsion formulations to prevent deterioration of the formulation. Antioxidants used may be free radical scavengers such as tocopherols, alkyl gallates, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, or reducing agents such as ascorbic acid and sodium metabisulfite, and antioxidant synergists such as citric acid, tartaric acid, and lecithin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe application of emulsion formulations via dermatological, oral and parenteral routes and methods for their manufacture have been reviewed in the literature (\nIdson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199\n). Emulsion formulations for oral delivery have been very widely used because of reasons of ease of formulation, efficacy from an absorption and bioavailability standpoint. (\nRosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 245\n; \nIdson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199\n). Mineral-oil base laxatives, oil-soluble vitamins and high fat nutritive preparations are among the materials that have commonly been administered orally as o/w emulsions. In one embodiment of the present invention, the compositions of oligonucleotides are formulated as microemulsions. A microemulsion may be defined as a system of water, oil and amphiphile which is a single optically isotropic and thermodynamically stable liquid solution (\nRosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 245\n). Typically microemulsions are systems that are prepared by first dispersing an oil in an aqueous surfactant solution and then adding a sufficient amount of a fourth component, generally an intermediate chain-length alcohol to form a transparent system. Therefore, microemulsions have also been described as thermodynamically stable, isotropically clear dispersions of two immiscible liquids that are stabilized by interfacial films of surface-active molecules (\nLeung and Shah, in: Controlled Release of Drugs: Polymers and Aggregate Systems, Rosoff, M., Ed., 1989, VCH Publishers, New York, pages 185-215\n). Microemulsions commonly are prepared via a combination of three to five components that include oil, water, surfactant, cosurfactant and electrolyte. Whether the microemulsion is of the water-in-oil (w/o) or an oil-in-water (o/w) type is dependent on the properties of the oil and surfactant used and on the structure and geometric packing of the polar heads and hydrocarbon tails of the surfactant molecules (\nSchott, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1985, p. 271\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phenomenological approach utilizing phase diagrams has been extensively studied and has yielded a comprehensive knowledge, to one skilled in the art, of how to formulate microemulsions (\nRosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 245\n; \nBlock, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 335\n). Compared to conventional emulsions, microemulsions offer the advantage of solubilizing water-insoluble drugs in a formulation of thermodynamically stable droplets that are formed spontaneously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurfactants used in the preparation of microemulsions include, but are not limited to, ionic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants, Brij 96, polyoxyethylene oleyl ethers, polyglycerol fatty acid esters, tetraglycerol monolaurate (ML310), tetraglycerol monooleate (MO310), hexaglycerol monooleate (PO310), hexaglycerol pentaoleate (PO500), decaglycerol monocaprate (MCA750), decaglycerol monooleate (MO750), decaglycerol sequioleate (SO750) decaglycerol decaoleate (DA0750), alone or in combination with cosurfactants. The cosurfactant, usually a short-chain alcohol such as ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol, serves to increase the interfacial fluidity by penetrating into the surfactant film and consequently creating a disordered film because of the void space generated among surfactant molecules. Microemulsions may, however, be prepared without the use of cosurfactants and alcohol-free self-emulsifying microemulsion systems are known in the art. The aqueous phase may typically be, but is not limited to, water, an aqueous solution of the drug, glycerol, PEG300, PEG400, polyglycerols, propylene glycols, and derivatives of ethylene glycol. The oil phase may include, but is not limited to, materials such as Captex 300, Captex 355, Capmul MCM, fatty acid esters, medium chain (C8-C12) mono, di, and triglycerides, polyoxyethylated glyceryl fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, polyglycolized glycerides, saturated polyglycolized C8-C10 glycerides, vegetable oils and silicone oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroemulsions are particularly of interest from the standpoint of drug solubilization and the enhanced absorption of drugs. Lipid based microemulsions (both o/w and w/o) have been proposed to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs, including peptides (\nConstantinides et al., Pharmaceutical Research, 1994, 11, 1385-1390\n; \nRitschel, Meth. Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol., 1993, 13, 205\n). Microemulsions afford advantages of improved drug solubilization, protection of drug from enzymatic hydrolysis, possible enhancement of drug absorption due to surfactant-induced alterations in membrane fluidity and permeability, ease of preparation, ease of oral administration over solid dosage forms, improved clinical potency, and decreased toxicity (\nConstantinides et al., Pharmaceutical Research, 1994, 11, 1385\n; \nHo et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1996, 85, 138-143\n). Often microemulsions may form spontaneously when their components are brought together at ambient temperature. This may be particularly advantageous when formulating thermolabile drugs, peptides or oligonucleotides. Microemulsions have also been effective in the transdermal delivery of active components in both cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. It is expected that the microemulsion compositions and formulations of the present invention will facilitate the increased systemic absorption of oligonucleotides from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as improve the local cellular uptake of oligonucleotides within the gastrointestinal tract, vagina, buccal cavity and other areas of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroemulsions of the present invention may also contain additional components and additives such as sorbitan monostearate (Grill 3), Labrasol, and penetration enhancers to improve the properties of the formulation and to enhance the absorption of the oligonucleotides and nucleic acids of the present invention. Penetration enhancers used in the microemulsions of the present invention may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are many organized surfactant structures besides microemulsions that have been studied and used in the formulation of drugs. These include monolayers, micelles, bilayers and vesicles. Vesicles, such as liposomes, have attracted great interest because of their specificity and the duration of action they offer from the standpoint of drug delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of the present invention include liposomal formulations. As used in the present invention, the term \"liposome\" means a vesicle composed of amphiphilic lipids arranged in a spherical bilayer or bilayers. Liposomes are unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles which have a membrane formed from a lipophilic material and an aqueous interior that contains the composition to be delivered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to cross intact mammalian skin, lipid vesicles must pass through a series of fine pores, each with a diameter less than 50 nm, under the influence of a suitable transdermal gradient. Therefore, it is desirable to use a liposome which is highly deformable and able to pass through such fine pores.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther advantages of liposomes include: liposomes obtained from natural phospholipids are biocompatible and biodegradable; liposomes can incorporate a wide range of water and lipid soluble drugs; and liposomes can protect encapsulated drugs in their internal compartments from metabolism and degradation (\nRosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 245\n). Important considerations in the preparation of liposome formulations are the lipid surface charge, vesicle size and the aqueous volume of the liposomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes are useful for the transfer and delivery of active ingredients to the site of action. Because the liposomal membrane is structurally similar to biological membranes, when liposomes are applied to a tissue, the liposomes start to merge with the cellular membranes. As the merging of the liposome and cell progresses, the liposomal contents are emptied into the cell where the active agent may act.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomal formulations have been the focus of extensive investigation as the mode of delivery for many drugs. There is growing evidence that for topical administration, liposomes present several advantages over other formulations. Such advantages include reduced side-effects related to high systemic absorption of the administered drug, increased accumulation of the administered drug at the desired target, and the ability to administer a wide variety of drugs, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic, into the skin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral reports have detailed the ability of liposomes to deliver agents including high-molecular weight DNA into the skin. Compounds including analgesics, antibodies, hormones and high-molecular weight DNAs have been administered to the skin. The majority of applications resulted in the targeting of the upper epidermis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes fall into two broad classes, cationic and non-cationic, both of which are useful for the delivery of DNA, RNA or any nucleic acid-based construct into cells. Cationic liposomes are positively charged liposomes which interact with negatively charged DNA molecules to form a stable complex. The positively charged DNA/liposome complex binds to the negatively charged cell surface and is internalized in an endosome. Due to the acidic pH within the endosome, the liposomes are ruptured, releasing their contents into the cell cytoplasm (\nWang et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1987, 147, 980-985\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes which are pH-sensitive or negatively-charged, also known as non-cationic liposomes, entrap DNA rather than complex with it. Since both the DNA and the lipid are similarly charged, repulsion rather than complex formation occurs. Nevertheless, some DNA is entrapped within the aqueous interior of these liposomes. pH-sensitive liposomes have been used to deliver DNA encoding the thymidine kinase gene to cell monolayers in culture. Expression of the exogenous gene was detected in the target cells (\nZhou et al., Journal of Controlled Release, 1992, 19, 269-274\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne major type of liposomal composition includes phospholipids other than naturally-derived\n\nphosphatidylcholine. Neutral liposome compositions, for example, can be formed from dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Anionic liposome compositions generally are formed from dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, while anionic fusogenic liposomes are formed primarily from dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE). Another type of liposomal composition is formed from phosphatidylcholine (PC) such as, for example, soybean PC, and egg PC. Another type is formed from mixtures of phospholipid and/or phosphatidylcholine and/or cholesterol. Several studies have assessed the topical delivery of liposomal drug formulations to the skin. Application of liposomes containing interferon to guinea pig skin resulted in a reduction of skin herpes sores while delivery of interferon via other means (\ne.g.\n as a solution or as an emulsion) were ineffective (\nWeiner et al., Journal of Drug Targeting, 1992, 2, 405-410\n). Further, an additional study tested the efficacy of interferon administered as part of a liposomal formulation to the administration of interferon using an aqueous system, and concluded that the liposomal formulation was superior to aqueous administration (\ndu Plessis et al., Antiviral Research, 1992, 18, 259-265\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-ionic liposomal systems have also been examined to determine their utility in the delivery of drugs to the skin, in particular systems comprising non-ionic surfactant and cholesterol. Non-ionic liposomal formulations comprising the Novasome™ I (glyceryl dilaurate/cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) and Novasome™ II (glyceryl distearate/cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) reagents were used to deliver cyclosporin-A into the dermis of mouse skin. Results indicated that such non-ionic liposomal systems were effective in facilitating the deposition of cyclosporin-A into different layers of the skin (\nHu et al. S.T.P.Pharma. Sci., 1994, 4, 6, 466\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes also include \"sterically stabilized\" liposomes, a term which, as used herein, refers to liposomes comprising one or more specialized lipids that, when incorporated into liposomes, result in enhanced circulation lifetimes relative to liposomes lacking such specialized lipids. Examples of sterically stabilized liposomes are those in which part of the vesicle-forming lipid portion of the liposome (A) comprises one or more glycolipids, such as monosialoganglioside G\nM1\n, or (B) is derivatized with one or more hydrophilic polymers, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is thought in the art that, at least for sterically stabilized liposomes containing gangliosides, sphingomyelin, or PEG-derivatized lipids, the enhanced circulation half-life of these sterically stabilized liposomes derives from a reduced uptake into cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (\nAllen et al., FEBS Letters, 1987, 223, 42\n; \nWu et al., Cancer Research, 1993, 53, 3765\n). Liposomes and their uses are further described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,287,860\n \n, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious liposomes comprising one or more glycolipids are known in the art. \nPapahadjopoulos et al. (Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1987, 507, 64\n) reported the ability of monosialoganglioside G\nM1\n, galactocerebroside sulfate and phosphatidylinositol to improve blood half-lives of liposomes. These findings were expounded upon by \nGabizon et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1988, 85, 6949\n). \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,837,028\n \n and \n \nWO 88/04924, both to Allen et al.\n \n \n,\n disclose liposomes comprising (1) sphingomyelin and (2) the ganglioside G\nM1\n or a galactocerebroside sulfate ester. \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,543,152 (Webb et al.\n \n) discloses liposomes comprising sphingomyelin. Liposomes comprising 1,2-\nsn-\ndimyristoylphosphatidylcholine are disclosed in \n \nWO 97/13499 (Lim et al.\n \n)\n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany liposomes comprising lipids derivatized with one or more hydrophilic polymers, and methods of preparation thereof, are known in the art. \nSunamoto et al. (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1980, 53, 2778\n) described liposomes comprising a nonionic detergent, 2C\n12\n15G, that contains a PEG moiety. \nIllum et al. (FEBS Lett., 1984, 167, 79\n) noted that hydrophilic coating of polystyrene particles with polymeric glycols results in significantly enhanced blood half-lives. Synthetic phospholipids modified by the attachment of carboxylic groups of polyalkylene glycols (\ne.g.\n, PEG) are described by Sears (\n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,426,330\n \n and \n \n4,534,899\n \n). \nKlibanov et al. (FEBS Lett., 1990, 268, 235\n) described experiments demonstrating that liposomes comprising phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) derivatized with PEG or PEG stearate have significant increases in blood circulation half-lives. \nBlume et al. (Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1990, 1029, 91\n) extended such observations to other PEG-derivatized phospholipids, \ne.g.,\n DSPE-PEG, formed from the combination of distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE) and PEG. Liposomes having covalently bound PEG moieties on their external surface are described in European Patent No. \n \nEP 0 445 131 B1\n \n and \n \nWO 90/04384 to Fisher\n \n. Liposome compositions containing 1-20 mole percent of PE derivatized with PEG, and methods of use thereof, are described by \n \nWoodle et al. (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,013,556\n \n and \n \n5,356,633\n \n) and \n \nMartin et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,213,804\n \n and European Patent No. \n \nEP 0 496 813 B1\n \n). Liposomes comprising a number of other lipid-polymer conjugates are disclosed in \n \nWO 91/05545\n \n and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,225,212 (both to Martin et al.\n \n \n)\n and in \n \nWO 94/20073 (Zalipsky et al.\n \n) Liposomes comprising PEG-modified ceramide lipids are described in \n \nWO 96/10391 (Choi et al.\n \n)\n.\n \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,540,935 (Miyazaki et al\n \n.) and\n \n 5,556,948 (Tagawa et al.\n \n) describe PEG-containing liposomes that can be further derivatized with functional moieties on their surfaces.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternational Patent Publication No. \n \nWO 96/40062 to Thierry et al\n \n \n.\n refers to methods for encapsulating high molecular weight nucleic acids in liposomes. \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,264,221 to Tagawa et al\n \n \n.\n refers to protein-bonded liposomes and asserts that the contents of such liposomes may include an antisense RNA. \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,665,710 to Rahman et al\n \n \n.\n refers to certain methods of encapsulating oligodeoxynucleotides in liposomes. International Patent Publication No. \n \nWO 97/04787 to Love et al\n \n \n.\n refers to liposomes comprising antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the raf gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransfersomes are yet another type of liposome, and are highly deformable lipid aggregates which are attractive candidates for drug delivery vehicles. Transfersomes may be described as lipid droplets which are so highly deformable that they are easily able to penetrate through pores which are smaller than the droplet. Transfersomes are adaptable to the environment in which they are used, \ne.g.\n they are self-optimizing (adaptive to the shape of pores in the skin), self-repairing, frequently reach their targets without fragmenting, and often self-loading. To make transfersomes it is possible to add surface edge-activators, usually surfactants, to a standard liposomal composition. Transfersomes have been used to deliver serum albumin to the skin. The transfersome-mediated delivery of serum albumin has been shown to be as effective as subcutaneous injection of a solution containing serum albumin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurfactants find wide application in formulations such as emulsions (including microemulsions) and liposomes. The most common way of classifying and ranking the properties of the many different types of surfactants, both natural and synthetic, is by the use of the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB). The nature of the hydrophilic group (also known as the \"head\") provides the most useful means for categorizing the different surfactants used in formulations (\nRieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY, 1988, p. 285\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the surfactant molecule is not ionized, it is classified as a nonionic surfactant. Nonionic surfactants find wide application in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products and are usable over a wide range of pH values. In general their HLB values range from 2 to about 18 depending on their structure. Nonionic surfactants include nonionic esters such as ethylene glycol esters, propylene glycol esters, glyceryl esters, polyglyceryl esters, sorbitan esters, sucrose esters, and ethoxylated esters. Nonionic alkanolamides and ethers such as fatty alcohol ethoxylates, propoxylated alcohols, and ethoxylated/propoxylated block polymers are also included in this class. The polyoxyethylene surfactants are the most popular members of the nonionic surfactant class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the surfactant molecule carries a negative charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in water, the surfactant is classified as anionic. Anionic surfactants include carboxylates such as soaps, acyl lactylates, acyl amides of amino acids, esters of sulfuric acid such as alkyl sulfates and ethoxylated alkyl sulfates, sulfonates such as alkyl benzene sulfonates, acyl isethionates, acyl taurates and sulfosuccinates, and phosphates. The most important members of the anionic surfactant class are the alkyl sulfates and the soaps.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the surfactant molecule carries a positive charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in water, the surfactant is classified as cationic. Cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium salts and ethoxylated amines. The quaternary ammonium salts are the most used members of this class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the surfactant molecule has the ability to carry either a positive or negative charge, the surfactant is classified as amphoteric. Amphoteric surfactants include acrylic acid derivatives, substituted alkylamides, N-alkylbetaines and phosphatides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of surfactants in drug products, formulations and in emulsions has been reviewed (\nRieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY, 1988, p. 285\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the present invention employs various penetration enhancers to effect the efficient delivery of nucleic acids, particularly oligonucleotides, to the skin of animals. Most drugs are present in solution in both ionized and nonionized forms. However, usually only lipid soluble or lipophilic drugs readily cross cell membranes. It has been discovered that even non-lipophilic drugs may cross cell membranes if the membrane to be crossed is treated with a penetration enhancer. In addition to aiding the diffusion of non-lipophilic drugs across cell membranes, penetration enhancers also enhance the permeability of lipophilic drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther agents may be utilized to enhance the penetration of the administered nucleic acids, including glycols such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, pyrrols such as 2-pyrrol, azones, and terpenes such as limonene and menthone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulations and compositions of the present invention may also include surfactants. The use of surfactants in drug products, formulations and in emulsions is well known in the art. Surfactants and their uses are further described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,287,860\n \n, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of skill in the art will recognize that formulations are routinely designed according to their intended use, i.e., route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred formulations for topical administration include those in which the oligonucleotides of the invention are in admixture with a topical delivery agent such as lipids, liposomes, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, steroids, chelating agents and surfactants. Preferred lipids and liposomes include neutral (e.g. dioleoylphosphatidyl DOPE ethanolamine, dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline DMPC, distearolyphosphatidyl choline) negative (e.g. dimyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol DMPG) and cationic (e.g. dioleoyltetramethylaminopropyl DOTAP and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine DOTMA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical or other administration, oligonucleotides of the invention may be encapsulated within liposomes or may form complexes thereto, in particular to cationic liposomes. Alternatively, oligonucleotides may be complexed to lipids, in particular to cationic lipids.

Preferred bile acids/salts and fatty acids and their uses are further described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,287,860\n \n, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Also preferred are combinations of penetration enhancers, for example, fatty acids/salts in combination with bile acids/salts. A particularly preferred combination is the sodium salt of lauric acid, capric acid and UDCA. Further penetration enhancers include polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether. Oligonucleotides of the invention may be delivered orally, in granular form including sprayed dried particles, or complexed to form micro or nanoparticles.

Parenteral formulations include intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SC), intraperitoneal (IP), intravitreal and intramuscular (IM) formulations, as well as formulations for delivery via pulmonary inhalation, intranasal administration, topical administration, etc. Non-parenteral formulations include formulations for delivery via the alimentary canal, e.g. oral administration, rectal administration, intrajejunal instillation, etc. Rectal administration includes administration as an enema or a suppository. Oral administration includes administration as a capsule, a gel capsule, a pill, an elixir, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also be administered by pulsatile delivery. \"Pulsatile delivery\" refers to a pharmaceutical formulation that delivers a first pulse of drug (e.g. an antisense compound) combined with a penetration enhancer and a second pulse of penetration enhancer to promote absorption of drug which is not absorbed upon release with the first pulse of penetration enhancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a delayed release oral formulation for enhanced intestinal drug absorption, comprising:\n\n \n \n \n(a) a first population of carrier particles comprising said drug and a penetration enhancer, wherein said drug and said penetration enhancer are released at a first location in the intestine; and\n \n(b) a second population of carrier particles comprising a penetration enhancer and a delayed release coating or matrix, wherein the penetration enhancer is released at a second location in the intestine downstream from the first location, whereby absorption of the drug is enhanced when the drug reaches the second location.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAlternatively, the penetration enhancer in (a) and (b) is different. This enhancement is obtained by encapsulating at least two populations of carrier particles. The first population of carrier particles comprises a biologically active substance and a penetration enhancer, and the second (and optionally additional) population of carrier particles comprises a penetration enhancer and a delayed release coating or matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"first pass effect\" that applies to orally administered drugs is degradation due to the action of gastric acid and various digestive enzymes. One means of ameliorating first pass clearance effects is to increase the dose of administered drug, thereby compensating for proportion of drug lost to first pass clearance. This may be readily achieved with i.v. administration by, for example, simply providing more of the drug to an animal. However, other factors influence the bioavailability of drugs administered via non-parenteral means. For example, a drug may be enzymatically or chemically degraded in the alimentary canal or blood stream and/or may be impermeable or semipermeable to various mucosal membranes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese pharmaceutical compositions are capable of enhancing absorption of biologically active substances when administered via the rectal, vaginal, nasal or pulmonary routes. Release of the biologically active substance can be achieved in any part of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid pharmaceutical compositions of oligonucleotide can be prepared by combining the oligonucleotide with a suitable vehicle, for example sterile pyrogen free water, or saline solution. Other therapeutic compounds may optionally be included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also contemplates the use of solid particulate compositions. Such compositions preferably comprise particles of oligonucleotide that are of respirable size. Such particles can be prepared by, for example, grinding dry oligonucleotide by conventional means, fore example with a mortar and pestle, and then passing the resulting powder composition through a 400 mesh screen to segregate large particles and agglomerates. A solid particulate composition comprised of an active oligonucleotide can optionally contain a dispersant which serves to facilitate the formation of an aerosol, for example lactose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, oligonucleotide compositions can be aerosolized. Aerosolization of liquid particles can be produced by any suitable means, such as with a nebulizer. See, for example, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,501,729\n \n. Nebulizers are commercially available devices which transform solutions or suspensions into a therapeutic aerosol mist either by means of acceleration of a compressed gas, typically air or oxygen, through a narrow venturi orifice or by means of ultrasonic agitation. Suitable nebulizers include those sold by Blairex\n®\n under the name PARI LC PLUS, PARI DURA-NEB 2000, PARI-BABY Size, PARI PRONEB Compressor with LC PLUS, PARI WALKHALER Compressor/Nebulizer System, PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer, and PARI LC Jet+ \n®\nNebulizer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for use in nebulizers may consist of an oligonucleotide in a liquid, such as sterile, pyragen free water, or saline solution, wherein the oligonucleotide comprises up to about 40% w/w of the formulation. Preferably, the oligonucleotide comprises less than 20% w/w. If desired, further additives such as preservatives (for example, methyl hydroxybenzoate) antioxidants, and flavoring agents can be added to the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid particles comprising an oligonucleotide can also be aerosolized using any solid particulate medicament aerosol generator known in the art. Such aerosol generators produce respirable particles, as described above, and further produce reproducible metered dose per unit volume of aerosol. Suitable solid particulate aerosol generators include insufflators and metered dose inhalers. Metered dose inhalers are used in the art and are useful in the present invention. Preferably, liquid or solid aerosols are produced at a rate of from about 10 to 150 liters per minute, more preferably from about 30 to 150 liters per minute, and most preferably about 60 liters per minute.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced bioavailability of biologically active substances is also achieved via the oral administration of the compositions and methods of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention may additionally contain other adjunct components conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions, at their art-established usage levels. Thus, for example, the compositions may contain additional, compatible, pharmaceutically-active materials such as, for example, antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory agents, or may contain additional materials useful in physically formulating various dosage forms of the compositions of the present invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opacifiers, thickening agents and stabilizers. However, such materials, when added, should not unduly interfere with the biological activities of the components of the compositions of the present invention. The formulations can be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents, \ne.g.,\n lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously interact with the nucleic acid(s) of the formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran. The suspension may also contain stabilizers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain embodiments of the invention provide pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more oligomeric compounds and one or more other chemotherapeutic agents which function by a non-antisense mechanism. Examples of such chemotherapeutic agents include but are not limited to cancer chemotherapeutic drugs such as daunorubicin, daunomycin, dactinomycin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, esorubicin, bleomycin, mafosfamide, ifosfamide, cytosine arabinoside, bis-chloroethylnitrosurea, busulfan, mitomycin C, actinomycin D, mithramycin, prednisone, hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, tamoxifen, dacarbazine, procarbazine, hexamethylmelamine, pentamethylmelamine, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, chlorambucil, methylcyclohexylnitrosurea, nitrogen mustards, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-azacytidine, hydroxyurea, deoxycoformycin, 4-hydroxyperoxycyclophosphoramide, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FUdR), methotrexate (MTX), colchicine, taxol, vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide (VP-16), trimetrexate, irinotecan, topotecan, gemcitabine, teniposide, cisplatin and diethylstilbestrol (DES). When used with the compounds of the invention, such chemotherapeutic agents may be used individually (\ne.g.,\n 5-FU and oligonucleotide), sequentially (\ne.g.,\n 5-FU and oligonucleotide for a period of time followed by MTX and oligonucleotide), or in combination with one or more other such chemotherapeutic agents (\ne.g.\n, 5-FU, MTX and oligonucleotide, or 5-FU, radiotherapy and oligonucleotide). Anti-inflammatory drugs, including but not limited to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids, and antiviral drugs, including but not limited to ribivirin, vidarabine, acyclovir and ganciclovir, may also be combined in compositions of the invention. Combinations of antisense compounds and other non-antisense drugs are also within the scope of this invention. Two or more combined compounds may be used together or sequentially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another related embodiment, compositions of the invention may contain one or more antisense compounds, particularly oligonucleotides, targeted to a first nucleic acid and one or more additional antisense compounds targeted to a second nucleic acid target. Alternatively, compositions of the invention may contain two or more antisense compounds targeted to different regions of the same nucleic acid target. Numerous examples of antisense compounds are known in the art. Two or more combined compounds may be used together or sequentially.\n\n\n \n\n\nH. Dosing\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe formulation of therapeutic compositions and their subsequent administration (dosing) is believed to be within the skill of those in the art. Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease state to be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient. Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates. Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual oligonucleotides, and can generally be estimated based on EC\n50\ns found to be effective in in vitro and in vivo animal models. In general, dosage is from 0.01 µg to 100 g per kg of body weight, from 0.1 µg to 10 g per kg of body weight, from 1.0 µg to 1 g per kg of body weight, from 10.0 µg to 100 mg per kg of body weight, from 100 µg to 10 mg per kg of body weight, or from 1 mg to 5 mg per kg of body weight, and may be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, or even once every 2 to 20 years. Persons of ordinary skill in the art can easily estimate repetition rates for dosing based on measured residence times and concentrations of the drug in bodily fluids or tissues. Following successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state, wherein the oligonucleotide is administered in maintenance doses, ranging from 0.01 ug to 100 g per kg of body weight, once or more daily, to once every 20 years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effects of treatments with therapeutic compositions can be assessed following collection of tissues or fluids from a patient or subject receiving said treatments. It is known in the art that a biopsy sample can be procured from certain tissues without resulting in detrimental effects to a patient or subject. In certain embodiments, a tissue and its constituent cells comprise, but are not limited to, blood (e.g., hematopoietic cells, such as human hematopoietic progenitor cells, human hematopoietic stem cells, CD34\n+\n cells CD4\n+\n cells), lymphocytes and other blood lineage cells, bone marrow, breast, cervix, colon, esophagus, lymph node, muscle, peripheral blood, oral mucosa and skin. In other embodiments, a fluid and its constituent cells comprise, but are not limited to, blood, urine, semen, synovial fluid, lymphatic fluid and cerebro-spinal fluid. Tissues or fluids procured from patients can be evaluated for expression levels of the target mRNA or protein. Additionally, the mRNA or protein expression levels of other genes known or suspected to be associated with the specific disease state, condition or phenotype can be assessed. mRNA levels can be measured or evaluated by real-time PCR, Northern blot, in situ hybridization or DNA array analysis. Protein levels can be measured or evaluated by ELISA, immunoblotting, quantitative protein assays, protein activity assays (for example, caspase activity assays) immunohistochemistry or immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, the effects of treatment can be assessed by measuring biomarkers associated with the disease or condition in the aforementioned tissues and fluids, collected from a patient or subject receiving treatment, by routine clinical methods known in the art. These biomarkers include but are not limited to: glucose, cholesterol, lipoproteins, triglycerides, free fatty acids and other markers of glucose and lipid metabolism; lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) or apolipoprotein B; liver transaminases, bilirubin, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatine and other markers of kidney and liver function; interleukins, tumor necrosis factors, intracellular adhesion molecules, C-reactive protein and other markers of inflammation; testosterone, estrogen and other hormones; tumor markers; vitamins, minerals and electrolytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the present invention has been described with specificity in accordance with certain of its preferred embodiments, the following examples serve only to illustrate the invention and are not intended to limit the same.

Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors including, for example, Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or alternatively be employed. It is well known to use similar techniques to prepare oligonucleotides such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOligonucleotides: Unsubstituted and substituted phosphodiester (P=O) oligonucleotides are synthesized on an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 394) using standard phosphoramidite chemistry with oxidation by iodine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhosphorothioates (P=S) are synthesized similar to phosphodiester oligonucleotides with the following exceptions: thiation was effected by utilizing a 10% w/v solution of 3,H-1,2-benzodithiole-3-one 1,1-dioxide in acetonitrile for the oxidation of the phosphite linkages. The thiation reaction step time was increased to 180 sec and preceded by the normal capping step. After cleavage from the CPG column and deblocking in concentrated ammonium hydroxide at 55°C (12-16 hr), the oligonucleotides were recovered by precipitating with >3 volumes of ethanol from a 1 M NH\n4\nOAc solution.

Although one of ordinary skill in the art will understand the use of protecting groups in organic synthesis, a useful class of protecting groups includes silyl ethers. In particular bulky silyl ethers are used to protect the 5'-hydroxyl in combination with an acid-labile orthoester protecting group on the 2'-hydroxyl. This set of protecting groups is then used with standard solid-phase synthesis technology. It is important to lastly remove the acid labile orthoester protecting group after all other synthetic steps. Moreover, the early use of the silyl protecting groups during synthesis ensures facile removal when desired, without undesired deprotection of 2' hydroxyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing this procedure for the sequential protection of the 5'-hydroxyl in combination with protection of the 2'-hydroxyl by protecting groups that are differentially removed and are differentially chemically labile, RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA oligonucleotides are synthesized in a stepwise fashion. Each nucleotide is added sequentially (3'- to 5'-direction) to a solid support-bound oligonucleotide. The first nucleoside at the 3'-end of the chain is covalently attached to a solid support. The nucleotide precursor, a ribonucleoside phosphoramidite, and activator are added, coupling the second base onto the 5'-end of the first nucleoside. The support is washed and any unreacted 5'-hydroxyl groups are capped with acetic anhydride to yield 5'-acetyl moieties. The linkage is then oxidized to the more stable and ultimately desired P(V) linkage. At the end of the nucleotide addition cycle, the 5'-silyl group is cleaved with fluoride. The cycle is repeated for each subsequent nucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing synthesis, the methyl protecting groups on the phosphates are cleaved in 30 minutes utilizing 1 M disodium-2-carbamoyl-2-cyanoethylene-1,1-dithiolate trihydrate (S\n2\nNa\n2\n) in DMF. The deprotection solution is washed from the solid support-bound oligonucleotide using water. The support is then treated with 40% methylamine in water for 10 minutes at 55°C. This releases the RNA oligonucleotides into solution, deprotects the exocyclic amines, and modifies the 2'- groups. The oligonucleotides can be analyzed by anion exchange HPLC at this stage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 2'-orthoester groups are the last protecting groups to be removed. The ethylene glycol monoacetate orthoester protecting group developed by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO), is one example of a useful orthoester protecting group which, has the following important properties. It is stable to the conditions of nucleoside phosphoramidite synthesis and oligonucleotide synthesis. However, after oligonucleotide synthesis the oligonucleotide is treated with methylamine which not only cleaves the oligonucleotide from the solid support but also removes the acetyl groups from the orthoesters. The resulting 2-ethyl-hydroxyl substituents on the orthoester are less electron withdrawing than the acetylated precursor. As a result, the modified orthoester becomes more labile to acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Specifically, the rate of cleavage is approximately 10 times faster after the acetyl groups are removed. Therefore, this orthoester possesses sufficient stability in order to be compatible with oligonucleotide synthesis and yet, when subsequently modified, permits deprotection to be carried out under relatively mild aqueous conditions compatible with the final RNA oligonucleotide product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, methods of RNA synthesis are well known in the art (\nScaringe, S. A. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Colorado, 1996\n; \nScaringe, S. A., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1998, 120, 11820-11821\n; \nMatteucci, M. D. and Caruthers, M. H. J. Am. Chem.

E., et al., Tetrahedron, 1967, 23, 2315-2331\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA antisense compounds (RNA oligonucleotides) of the present invention can be synthesized by the methods herein or purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc (Lafayette, CO). Once synthesized, complementary RNA antisense compounds can then be annealed by methods known in the art to form double stranded (duplexed) antisense compounds. For example, duplexes can be formed by combining 30 µl of each of the complementary strands of RNA oligonucleotides (50 µM RNA oligonucleotide solution) and 15 µl of 5X annealing buffer (100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 2 mM magnesium acetate) followed by heating for 1 minute at 90°C, then 1 hour at 37°C. The resulting duplexed antisense compounds can be used in kits, assays, screens, or other methods to investigate the role of a target nucleic acid, or for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis of Chimeric Compounds\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nChimeric oligonucleotides, oligonucleosides or mixed oligonucleotides/oligonucleosides of the invention can be of several different types. These include a first type wherein the \"gap\" segment of linked nucleosides is positioned between 5' and 3' \"wing\" segments of linked nucleosides and a second \"open end\" type wherein the \"gap\" segment is located at either the 3' or the 5' terminus of the oligomeric compound. Oligonucleotides of the first type are also known in the art as \"gapmers\" or gapped oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides of the second type are also known in the art as \"hemimers\" or \"wingmers\".\n\n\n \n\n\n[2'-O-Me]--[2'-deoxy]--[2'-O-Me] Chimeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhosphorothioate Oligonucleotides\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nChimeric oligonucleotides having 2'-O-alkyl phosphorothioate and 2'-deoxy phosphorothioate oligonucleotide segments are synthesized using an Applied Biosystems automated DNA synthesizer Model 394, as above. Oligonucleotides are synthesized using the automated synthesizer and 2'-deoxy-5'-dimethoxytrityl-3'-O-phosphoramidite for the DNA portion and 5'-dimethoxytrityl-2'-O-methyl-3'-O-phosphoramidite for 5' and 3' wings. The standard synthesis cycle is modified by incorporating coupling steps with increased reaction times for the 5'-dimethoxytrityl-2'-O-methyl-3'-O-phosphoramidite. The fully protected oligonucleotide is cleaved from the support and deprotected in concentrated ammonia (NH\n4\nOH for 12-16 hr at 55°C. The deprotected oligo is then recovered by an appropriate method (precipitation, column chromatography, volume reduced \nin vacuo\n and analyzed spectrophotometrically for yield and for purity by capillary electrophoresis and by mass spectrometry).\n\n\n \n\n\n[2'-O-(2-Methoxyethyl)]--[2'-deoxy]--[2'-O-(Methoxyethyl)] Chimeric Phosphorothioate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOligonucleotides\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n[2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl)]--[2`-deoxy]--[-2'-O-(methoxyethyl)] chimeric phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were prepared as per the procedure above for the 2'-O-methyl chimeric oligonucleotide, with the substitution of 2'-O-(methoxyethyl) amidites for the 2'-O-methyl amidites.\n\n\n \n\n\n[2'-O-(2-Methoxyethyl)Phosphodiester]--[2'-deoxy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhosphorothioate]--[2'-O-(2-Methoxyethyl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhosphodiester] Chimeric Oligonucleotides\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n[2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl phosphodiester]--[2'-deoxy phosphorothioate]--C2'-O-(methoxyethyl) phosphodiester] chimeric oligonucleotides are prepared as per the above procedure for the 2'-O-methyl chimeric oligonucleotide with the substitution of 2'-O-(methoxyethyl) amidites for the 2'-O-methyl amidites, oxidation with iodine to generate the phosphodiester internucleotide linkages within the wing portions of the chimeric structures and sulfurization utilizing 3,H-1,2 benzodithiole-3-one 1,1 dioxide (Beaucage Reagent) to generate the phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages for the center gap.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther chimeric oligonucleotides, chimeric oligonucleosides and mixed chimeric oligonucleotides/oligonucleosides are synthesized according to United States Patent No. \n \n5,623,065\n \n, herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign and screening of duplexed antisense compounds targeting diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, a series of nucleic acid duplexes, also known as double-strand RNAs (dsRNAs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), comprising the antisense compounds of the present invention and their complements can be designed to target diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2. The nucleobase sequence of the antisense strand of the duplex comprises at least an 8-nucleobase portion of an oligonucleotide in Table 1. The ends of the strands may be modified by the addition of one or more natural or modified nucleobases to form an overhang. The sense strand of the dsRNA is then designed and synthesized as the complement of the antisense strand and may also contain modifications or additions to either terminus. For example, in one embodiment, both strands of the dsRNA duplex would be complementary over the central nucleobases, each having overhangs at one or both termini. The antisense and sense strands of the duplex comprise from about 17 to 25 nucleotides, or from about 19 to 23 nucleotides. Alternatively, the antisense and sense strands comprise 20, 21 or 22 nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a duplex comprising an antisense strand having the sequence CGAGAGGCGGACGGGACCG (SEQ ID NO: 489) and having a two-nucleobase overhang of deoxythymidine(dT) has the following structure (Antisense SEQ ID NO: 490 and Complement SEQ ID NO: 491):\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverhangs can range from 1 to 6 nucleobases and these nucleobases may or may not be complementary to the target nucleic acid. One of skill in the art will understand that the overhang may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 nucleobases in length. In another embodiment, the duplexes may have an overhang on only one terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a duplex comprising an antisense strand having the same sequence CGAGAGGCGGACGGGACCG (SEQ ID NO: 489) may be prepared with blunt ends (no single stranded overhang) as shown (Antisense SEQ ID NO: 489 and Complement SEQ ID NO: 492):\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe RNA duplex can be unimolecular or bimolecular; i.e., the two strands can be part of a single molecule or may be separate molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA strands of the duplex can be synthesized by methods disclosed herein or purchased from Dharmacon Research Inc., (Lafayette, CO). Once synthesized, the complementary strands are annealed. The single strands are aliquoted and diluted to a concentration of 50 µM. Once diluted, 30 µL of each strand is combined with 15 µL of a 5X solution of annealing buffer. The final concentration of said buffer is 100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, and 2 mM magnesium acetate. The final volume is 75 µL. This solution is incubated for 1 minute at 90°C and then centrifuged for 15 seconds. The tube is allowed to sit for 1 hour at 37°C at which time the dsRNA duplexes are used in experimentation. The final concentration of the dsRNA duplex is 20 µM. This solution can be stored frozen (-20°C) and freeze-thawed up to 5 times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce prepared, the duplexed antisense compounds are evaluated for their ability to modulate diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen cells reached 80% confluency, they are treated with duplexed antisense compounds of the invention. For cells grown in 96-well plates, wells are washed once with 200 µL OPTI-MEM-1 reduced-serum medium (Gibco BRL) and then treated with 130 µL of OPTI-MEM-1 containing 12 µg/mL LIPOFECTIN™ reagent (Gibco BRL) and the desired duplex antisense compound at a final concentration of 200 nM. After 5 hours of treatment, the medium is replaced with fresh medium. Cells are harvested 16 hours after treatment, at which time RNA is isolated and target reduction measured by RT-PCR.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOligonucleotide Isolation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAfter cleavage from the controlled pore glass solid support and deblocking in concentrated ammonium hydroxide at 55°C for 12-16 hours, the oligonucleotides or oligonucleosides are recovered by precipitation out of 1 M NH\n4\nOAc with >3 volumes of ethanol. Synthesized oligonucleotides were analyzed by electrospray mass spectroscopy (molecular weight determination) and by capillary gel electrophoresis and judged to be at least 70% full-length material. The relative amounts of phosphorothioate and phosphodiester linkages obtained in the synthesis was determined by the ratio of correct molecular weight relative to the -16 amu product (+/-32 +/-48). For some studies oligonucleotides were purified by HPLC, as described by \nChiang et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1991, 266, 18162-18171\n. Results obtained with HPLC-purified material were similar to those obtained with non-HPLC purified material.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOligonucleotide Synthesis - 96 Well Plate Format\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOligonucleotides were synthesized via solid phase P(III) phosphoramidite chemistry on an automated synthesizer capable of assembling 96 sequences simultaneously in a 96-well format. Phosphodiester internucleotide linkages were afforded by oxidation with aqueous iodine. Phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages were generated by sulfurization utilizing 3,H-1,2 benzodithiole-3-one 1,1 dioxide (Beaucage Reagent) in anhydrous acetonitrile. Standard base-protected beta-cyanoethyl-diiso-propyl phosphoramidites were purchased from commercial vendors (e.g. PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, or Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). Non-standard nucleosides are synthesized as per standard or patented methods. They are utilized as base protected beta-cyanoethyldiisopropyl phosphoramidites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOligonucleotides were cleaved from support and deprotected with concentrated NH\n4\nOH at elevated temperature (55-60°C) for 12-16 hours and the released product then dried \nin vacuo.\n The dried product was then re-suspended in sterile water to afford a master plate from which all analytical and test plate samples are then diluted utilizing robotic pipettors.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOligonucleotide Analysis - 96-Well Plate Format\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe concentration of oligonucleotide in each well was assessed by dilution of samples and UV absorption spectroscopy. The full-length integrity of the individual products was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (CE) in either the 96-well format (Beckman P/ACE™ MDQ apparatus) or, for individually prepared samples, on a commercial CE apparatus (e.g., Beckman P/ACE™ 5000, ABI 270 apparatus). Base and backbone composition was confirmed by mass analysis of the compounds utilizing electrospray-mass spectroscopy. All assay test plates were diluted from the master plate using single and multi-channel robotic pipettors. Plates were judged to be acceptable if at least 85% of the compounds on the plate were at least 85% full length.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell culture and oligonucleotide treatment\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of antisense compounds on target nucleic acid expression can be tested in any of a variety of cell types provided that the target nucleic acid is present at measurable levels. This can be routinely determined using, for example, PCR or Northern blot analysis. The following cell types are provided for illustrative purposes, but other cell types can be routinely used, provided that the target is expressed in the cell type chosen. This can be readily determined by methods routine in the art, for example Northern blot analysis, ribonuclease protection assays, or real-time PCR.\n\n\n \nT-24 cells:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe human transitional cell bladder carcinoma cell line T-24 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). T-24 cells were routinely cultured in complete McCoy's 5A basal media (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA), penicillin 100 units per mL, and streptomycin 100 micrograms per mL (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were routinely passaged by trypsinization and dilution when they reached 90% confluence. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (Falcon-Primaria #353872) at a density of 7000 cells/well for use in RT-PCR analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor Northern blotting or other analysis, cells may be seeded onto 100 mm or other standard tissue culture plates and treated similarly, using appropriate volumes of medium and oligonucleotide.\n\n\n \nA549 cells:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe human lung carcinoma cell line A549 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). A549 cells were routinely cultured in DMEM basal media (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA), penicillin 100 units per mL, and streptomycin 100 micrograms per mL (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were routinely passaged by trypsinization and dilution when they reached 90% confluence.\n\n\n \nNHDF cells:\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman neonatal dermal fibroblast (NHDF) were obtained from the Clonetics Corporation (Walkersville, MD). NHDFs were routinely maintained in Fibroblast Growth Medium (Clonetics Corporation, Walkersville, MD) supplemented as recommended by the supplier. Cells were maintained for up to 10 passages as recommended by the supplier.\n\n\n \nHEK cells:\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman embryonic keratinocytes (HEK) were obtained from the Clonetics Corporation (Walkersville, MD). HEKs were routinely maintained in Keratinocyte Growth Medium (Clonetics Corporation, Walkersville, MD) formulated as recommended by the supplier. Cells were routinely maintained for up to 10 passages as recommended by the supplier.\n\n\n \n3T3-L1 cells:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe mouse embryonic adipocyte-like cell line 3T3-L1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). 3T3-L1 cells were routinely cultured in DMEM, high glucose (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were routinely passaged by trypsinization and dilution when they reached 80% confluence. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (Falcon-Primaria #3872) at a density of 4000 cells/well for use in RT-PCR analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor Northern blotting or other analyses, cells may be seeded onto 100 mm or other standard tissue culture plates and treated similarly, using appropriate volumes of medium and oligonucleotide.\n\n\n \nPrimary mouse hepatocytes:\n\n\n \n \n \nPrimary mouse hepatocytes were prepared from CD-1 mice purchased from Charles River Labs. Primary mouse hepatocytes were routinely cultured in Hepatocyte Attachment Media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum , 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% antibiotic-antimitotic (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and 10nM bovine insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (Falcon-Primaria #3872) coated with 0.1mg/ml collagen at a density of approximately 10,000 cells/well for use in oligomeric compound transfection experiments.\n\n\n \nTreatment with antisense compounds:\n\n\n \n \n \nWhen cells reached 65-75% confluency, they were treated with oligonucleotide. For cells grown in 96-well plates, wells were washed once with 100 µL OPTI-MEM™-1 reduced-serum medium (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) and then treated with 130 µL of the OPTI-MEM™-1 medium containing 2.5 or 3 µg/mL LIPOFECTIN™ reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) per 100 nM of oligonucleotide. Cells are treated and data are obtained in triplicate. After 4-7 hours of treatment at 37°C, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were harvested 16-24 hours after oligonucleotide treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of oligonucleotide used varies from cell line to cell line. To determine the optimal oligonucleotide concentration for a particular cell line, the cells are treated with a positive control oligonucleotide at a range of concentrations. For human cells the positive control oligonucleotide is selected from either ISIS 13920 (\nTCC\nGTCATCGCT\nCCTCAGGG\n, SEQ ID NO: 1) which is targeted to human H-ras, or ISIS 18078, (\nGTGCG\nCGCGAGCCCG\nAAATC\n, SEQ ID NO: 2) which is targeted to human Jun-N-terminal kinase-2 (JNK2). Both controls are 2'-O-methoxyethyl gapmers (2'-O-methoxyethyls shown in bold) with a phosphorothioate backbone. For mouse or rat cells the positive control oligonucleotide is ISIS 15770, \nATGCA\nTTCTGCCCCC\nAAGGA\n, SEQ ID NO: 3, a 2'-O-methoxyethyl gapmer (2'-O-methoxyethyls shown in bold) with a phosphorothioate backbone which is targeted to both mouse and rat c-raf. The concentration of positive control oligonucleotide that results in 80% inhibition of c-H-ras (for ISIS 13920), JNK2 (for ISIS 18078) or c-raf (for ISIS 15770) mRNA is then utilized as the screening concentration for new oligonucleotides in subsequent experiments for that cell line. If 80% inhibition is not achieved, the lowest concentration of positive control oligonucleotide that results in 60% inhibition of c-H-ras, JNK2 or c-raf mRNA is then utilized as the oligonucleotide screening concentration in subsequent experiments for that cell line. If 60% inhibition is not achieved, that particular cell line is deemed as unsuitable for oligonucleotide transfection experiments. The concentrations of antisense oligonucleotides used herein are from 50 nM to 300 nM.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of oligonucleotide inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAntisense modulation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression can be assayed in a variety of ways known in the art. For example, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 mRNA levels can be quantitated by, e.g., Northern blot analysis, competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or real-time PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR is presently preferred. RNA analysis can be performed on total cellular RNA or poly(A)+ mRNA. The preferred method of RNA analysis of the present invention is the use of total cellular RNA as described in other examples herein. Methods of RNA isolation are well known in the art. Northern blot analysis is also routine in the art. Real-time quantitative (PCR) can be conveniently accomplished using the commercially available ABI PRISM™ 7600, 7700, or 7900 Sequence Detection System, available from PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA and used according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein levels of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 can be quantitated in a variety of ways well known in the art, such as immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis (immunoblotting), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Antibodies directed to diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 can be identified and obtained from a variety of sources, such as the MSRS catalog of antibodies (Aerie Corporation, Birmingham, MI), or can be prepared via conventional monoclonal or polyclonal antibody generation methods well known in the art.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign of phenotypic assays for the use of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOnce diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 inhibitors have been identified by the methods disclosed herein, the compounds are further investigated in one or more phenotypic assays, each having measurable endpoints predictive of efficacy in the treatment of a particular disease state or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhenotypic assays, kits and reagents for their use are well known to those skilled in the art and are herein used to investigate the role and/or association of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in health and disease. Representative phenotypic assays, which can be purchased from any one of several commercial vendors, include those for determining cell viability, cytotoxicity, proliferation or cell survival (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; PerkinElmer, Boston, MA), protein-based assays including enzymatic assays (Panvera, LLC, Madison, WI; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ; Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA), cell regulation, signal transduction, inflammation, oxidative processes and apoptosis (Assay Designs Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), triglyceride accumulation (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), angiogenesis assays, tube formation assays, cytokine and hormone assays and metabolic assays (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one non-limiting example, cells determined to be appropriate for a particular phenotypic assay (i.e., MCF-7 cells selected for breast cancer studies; adipocytes for obesity studies) are treated with diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 inhibitors identified from the in vitro studies as well as control compounds at optimal concentrations which are determined by the methods described above. At the end of the treatment period, treated and untreated cells are analyzed by one or more methods specific for the assay to determine phenotypic outcomes and endpoints.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhenotypic endpoints include changes in cell morphology over time or treatment dose as well as changes in levels of cellular components such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, hormones, saccharides or metals. Measurements of cellular status which include pH, stage of the cell cycle, intake or excretion of biological indicators by the cell, are also endpoints of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of the expression of one or more genes in the cell after treatment is also used as an indicator of the efficacy or potency of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 inhibitors. Hallmark genes, or those genes suspected to be associated with a specific disease state, condition, or phenotype, are measured in both treated and untreated cells.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRNA Isolation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoly(A) + mRNA isolation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPoly(A) + mRNA was isolated according to \nMiura et al., (Clin. Chem., 1996, 42, 1758-1764\n). Other methods for poly(A)+ mRNA isolation are routine in the art. Briefly, for cells grown on 96-well plates, growth medium was removed from the cells and each well was washed with 200 µL cold PBS. 60 µL lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 20 mM vanadyl-ribonucleoside complex) was added to each well, the plate was gently agitated and then incubated at room temperature for five minutes. 55 µL of lysate was transferred to Oligo d(T) coated 96-well plates (AGCT Inc., Irvine CA). Plates were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, washed 3 times with 200 µL of wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 M NaCl). After the final wash, the plate was blotted on paper towels to remove excess wash buffer and then air-dried for 5 minutes. 60 µL of elution buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6), preheated to 70°C, was added to each well, the plate was incubated on a 90°C hot plate for 5 minutes, and the eluate was then transferred to a fresh 96-well plate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells grown on 100 mm or other standard plates may be treated similarly, using appropriate volumes of all solutions.\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal RNA Isolation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal RNA was isolated using an RNEASY™ 96 kit and buffers purchased from Qiagen, Inc. (Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's recommended procedures. Briefly, for cells grown on 96-well plates, growth medium was removed from the cells and each well was washed with 200 µL cold PBS. 150 µL Buffer RLT was added to each well and the plate vigorously agitated for 20 seconds. 150 µL of 70% ethanol was then added to each well and the contents mixed by pipetting three times up and down. The samples were then transferred to the RNEASY™ 96 well plate attached to a QIAVAC™ manifold fitted with a waste collection tray and attached to a vacuum source. Vacuum was applied for 1 minute. 500 µL of Buffer RW1 was added to each well of the RNEASY™ 96 plate and incubated for 15 minutes and the vacuum was again applied for 1 minute. An additional 500 µL of Buffer RW1 was added to each well of the RNEASY™ 96 plate and the vacuum was applied for 2 minutes. 1 mL of Buffer RPE was then added to each well of the RNEASY™ 96 plate and the vacuum applied for a period of 90 seconds. The Buffer RPE wash was then repeated and the vacuum was applied for an additional 3 minutes. The plate was then removed from the QTAVAC™ manifold and blotted dry on paper towels. The plate was then re-attached to the QIAVAC™ manifold fitted with a collection tube rack containing 1.2 mL collection tubes. RNA was then eluted by pipetting 140 µL of RNase free water into each well, incubating 1 minute, and then applying the vacuum for 3 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe repetitive pipetting and elution steps may be automated using a QIAGEN® Bio-Robot™ 9604 instrument (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia CA). Essentially, after lysing of the cells on the culture plate, the plate is transferred to the robot deck where the pipetting, DNase treatment and elution steps are carried out.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-time Quantitative PCR Analysis of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 mRNA Levels\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nQuantitation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 mRNA levels was accomplished by real-time quantitative PCR using the ABI PRISM™ 7600, 7700, or 7900 Sequence Detection System (PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. This is a closed-tube, non-gel-based, fluorescence detection system which allows high-throughput quantitation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products in real-time. As opposed to standard PCR in which amplification products are quantitated after the PCR is completed, products in real-time quantitative PCR are quantitated as they accumulate. This is accomplished by including in the PCR reaction an oligonucleotide probe that anneals specifically between the forward and reverse PCR primers, and contains two fluorescent dyes. A reporter dye (e.g., FAM or JOE, obtained from either PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, Operon Technologies Inc., Alameda, CA or Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA) is attached to the 5' end of the probe and a quencher dye (e.g., TAMRA, obtained from either PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, Operon Technologies Inc., Alameda, CA or Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA) is attached to the 3' end of the probe. When the probe and dyes are intact, reporter dye emission is quenched by the proximity of the 3' quencher dye. During amplification, annealing of the probe to the target sequence creates a substrate that can be cleaved by the 5'-exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase. During the extension phase of the PCR amplification cycle, cleavage of the probe by Taq polymerase releases the reporter dye from the remainder of the probe (and hence from the quencher moiety) and a sequence-specific fluorescent signal is generated. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, and the fluorescence intensity is monitored at regular intervals by laser optics built into the ABI PRISM™ Sequence Detection System. In each assay, a series of parallel reactions containing serial dilutions of mRNA from untreated control samples generates a standard curve that is used to quantitate the percent inhibition after antisense oligonucleotide treatment of test samples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to quantitative PCR analysis, primer-probe sets specific to the target gene being measured are evaluated for their ability to be \"multiplexed\" with a GAPDH amplification reaction. In multiplexing, both the target gene and the internal standard gene GAPDH are amplified concurrently in a single sample. In this analysis, mRNA isolated from untreated cells is serially diluted. Each dilution is amplified in the presence of primer-probe sets specific for GAPDH only, target gene only (\"single-plexing\"), or both (multiplexing). Following PCR amplification, standard curves of GAPDH and target mRNA signal as a function of dilution are generated from both the single-plexed and multiplexed samples. If both the slope and correlation coefficient of the GAPDH and target signals generated from the multiplexed samples fall within 10% of their corresponding values generated from the single-plexed samples, the primer-probe set specific for that target is deemed multiplexable. Other methods of PCR are also known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene target quantities are obtained by real-time PCR. Prior to the real-time PCR, isolated RNA is subjected to a reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction, for the purpose of generating complementary DNA (cDNA). The real-time PCR is then performed on the resulting cDNA. Reverse transcriptase and PCR reagents were obtained from Invitrogen Corporation, (Carlsbad, CA). RT, real-time PCR reactions were carried out by adding 20 µL PCR cocktail (2.5x PCR buffer minus MgCl\n2\n, 6.6 mM MgCl\n2\n, 375 µM each of dATP, dCTP, dCTP and dGTP, 375 nM each of forward primer and reverse primer, 125 nM of probe, 4 Units RNase inhibitor, 1.25 Units PLATINUM® Taq polymerase, 5 Units MuLV reverse transcriptase, and 2.5x ROX dye) to 96-well plates containing 30 µL total RNA solution (20-200 ng). The RT reaction was carried out by incubation for 30 minutes at 48°C. Following a 10 minute incubation at 95°C to activate the PLATINUM® Taq polymerase, 40 cycles of a two-step PCR protocol were carried out: 95°C for 15 seconds (denaturation) followed by 60°C for 1.5 minutes (annealing/extension). The method of obtaining gene target quantities by RT, real-time PCR is often referred to as simply real-time PCR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene target quantities obtained by real-time PCR are normalized using either the expression level of GAPDH, a gene whose expression is constant, or by quantifying total RNA using the RIBOGREEN™ reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR). GAPDH expression is quantified by real time real-time PCR, by being run simultaneously with the target, multiplexing, or separately. Total RNA is quantified using RIBOGREEN™ RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR). Methods of RNA quantification by the RIBOGREEN™ reagent are taught in \nJones, L.J., et al, (Analytical Biochemistry, 1998, 265, 368-374\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this assay, 170 µL of RiboGreen™ working reagent (the RIBOGREEN™ reagent diluted 1:350 in 10mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) was pipetted into a 96-well plate containing 30 µL purified, cellular RNA. The plate was read in a CytoFluor 4000 apparatus (PE Applied Biosystems) with excitation at 485nm and emission at 530nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProbes and primers to human diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 were designed to hybridize to a human diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 sequence, using published sequence information (GENBANK® accession number NM_032564.2, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 4). For human diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 the PCR primers were: forward primer: CATACGGCCTTACCTGGCTACA (SEQ ID NO: 5) reverse primer: CAGACATCAGGTACTCCCTCAACA (SEQ ID NO: 6) and the PCR probe was: FAM-TGGCAGGCAACTTCCGAATGCC-TAMRA (SEQ ID NO: 7) where FAM is the fluorescent dye and TAMRA is the quencher dye.

Total RNA was prepared following manufacturer's recommended protocols. Twenty micrograms of total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through 1.2% agarose gels containing 1.1% formaldehyde using a MOPS buffer system (AMRESCO, Inc. Solon, OH). RNA was transferred from the gel to HYBOND™-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) by overnight capillary transfer using a Northern/Southern Transfer buffer system (TEL-TEST \"B\" Inc., Friendswood, TX). RNA transfer was confirmed by UV visualization. Membranes were fixed by UV cross-linking using a STRATAZINKER™ UV Crosslinker 2400 instrument (Stratagene, Inc, La Jolla, CA) and then probed using QUICKHYB™ hybridization solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using manufacturer's recommendations for stringent conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo detect human diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, a human diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 specific probe was prepared by PCR using the forward primer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCATACGGCCTTACCTGGCTACA (SEQ ID NO: 5) and the reverse primer CAGACATCAGGTACTCCCTCAACA (SEQ ID NO: 6).

142 demonstrated at least 35% inhibition of mouse diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression in this experiment and are therefore preferred. More preferred are SEQ ID Nos: 142, 109 and 121. The target regions to which these preferred sequences are complementary are herein referred to as \"preferred target segments\" and are therefore preferred for targeting by compounds of the present invention. These preferred target segments are shown in Table 3. These sequences are shown to contain thymine (T) but one of skill in the art will appreciate that thymine (T) is generally replaced by uracil (U) in RNA sequences. The sequences represent the reverse complement of the preferred antisense compounds shown in Tables 1 and 2. \"Target site\" indicates the first (5'-most) nucleotide number on the particular target nucleic acid to which the oligonucleotide binds. Also shown in Table 3 is the species in which each of the preferred target segments was found.\n\n \n \nTable 3\n \n \n \n \n \nSequence and position of preferred target segments identified in

\"preferred target segments\" have been found by experimentation to be open to, and accessible for, hybridization with the antisense compounds of the present invention, one of skill in the art will recognize or be able to ascertain, using no more than routine experimentation, further embodiments of the invention that encompass other compounds that specifically hybridize to these preferred target segments and consequently inhibit the expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention, antisense compounds include antisense oligomeric compounds, antisense oligonucleotides, siRNAs, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, alternate splicers, and other short oligomeric compounds which hybridize to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern blot analysis of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 protein levels\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWestern blot analysis (immunoblot analysis) is carried out using standard methods. Cells are harvested 16-20 h after oligonucleotide treatment, washed once with PBS, suspended in Laemmli buffer (100 ul/well), boiled for 5 minutes and loaded on a 16% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels are run for 1.5 hours at 150 V, and transferred to membrane for western blotting. Appropriate primary antibody directed to diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 is used, with a radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled secondary antibody directed against the primary antibody species. Bands are visualized using a PHOSPHORIMAGER™ instrument (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale CA).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of antisense inhibition on diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 levels: in vivo studies in a diet-induced model of obesity\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe C57BL/6 mouse strain is reported to be susceptible to hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerotic plaque formation. Accordingly, these mice were fed a high-fat diet and used in the following studies to evaluate the effects of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 antisense oligonucleotides on mRNA expression in a model of diet-induced obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMale C57BL/6 mice at 6 weeks of age were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Ben Harbor, ME). Mice were fed regular rodent chow (#8604, Harlan-Teklad, Madison, WI) for 5 days and were subsequently placed on a high-fat diet containing 60% calories from fat (Research Diet D12492, Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ). After 8 weeks on the high-fat diet, mice were divided into one of three treatment groups of eight animals each, based on body weight. One group received subcutaneous injections of ISIS 217376 (SEQ ID No: 142) at a dose of 25 mg/kg twice per week for 7 weeks. The second group received subcutaneous injections of control oligonucleotide ISIS 141923 (CCTTCCCTGAAGGTTCCTCC, SEQ ID NO: 229) at a dose of 25 mg/kg twice per week for 7 weeks. Oligonucleotides were dissolved in 0.9% saline for injection. The third group received subcutaneous injections of saline twice weekly for 7 weeks. This saline-injected group served as the control group to which the oligonucleotide-treated groups were compared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA group of 8 C57Bl/6 mice, fed regular rodent chow and treated with saline, was used as a normal, lean group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nISIS 141923, which is not complementary to any known gene, is a chimeric oligonucleotide (\"gapmer\") 20 nucleotides in length, composed of a central \"gap\" region consisting of ten 2'-deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on both sides (5' and 3' directions) by five-nucleotide \"wings\". The wings are composed of 2'-O-methoxyethyl (2'-MOE) nucleotides. The internucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphorothioate (P=S) throughout the oligonucleotide. All cytidine residues are 5-methylcytidines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the 7 week treatment period, the mice were sacrificed and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) mRNA levels were evaluated in liver, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT). In addition, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) mRNA levels were measured in these tissues. mRNA expression levels were quantitated by real-time PCR as described in other examples herein. The results are presented in Table 4 and are expressed as percent inhibition relative to saline-treated mice receiving a high fat diet. A \"+\" preceding the number indicates that gene expression was increased, rather than inhibited.\n\n \n \nTable 4\n \n \n \n \n \nAntisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression in liver, brown adipose and white adipose tissues from diet-induced obese mice\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n% Inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase mRNAs\n \n \n \n \n \nISIS #\n \n \n \nLiver\n \n \n \nWAT\n \n \n \nBAT\n \n \n \n \n \nDGAT 2\n \n \n \nDGAT 1\n \n \n \nDGAT 2\n \n \n \nDGAT 1\n \n \n \nDGAT 2\n \n \n \nDGAT 1\n \n \n \n \n \n141923\n \n2\n \n7\n \n+26\n \n+23\n \n25\n \n33\n \n \n \n217376\n \n80\n \n47\n \n87\n \n0\n \n78\n \n21\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data demonstrate that diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment can effectively inhibit target mRNA expression in liver, brown adipose and white adipose tissue. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 expression levels were lowered in liver and brown adipose tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBody weight and food intake were monitored throughout the study. Metabolic rate was measured using indirect calorimetry in a metabolic chamber (Oxymax System, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Adipose tissue weight was also measured at the end of the study. Body weight, adipose tissue weight, food intake and metabolic rate were not changed in diet-induced obese mice treated with ISIS 217376.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a similar study, animals received twice weekly, subcutaneous injections of saline, 25 mg/kg ISIS 217376 or 25 mg/kg ISIS 141923, for a period of 5 weeks. In these mice, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 mRNA was reduced by approximately 90% in liver and white adipose fat tissues.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of antisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 on markers of lipid and glucose metabolism\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, ISIS 217376 (SEQ ID NO: 142) was tested for its ability to affect lipid and glucose metabolism in the diet-induced obese mice that received antisense oligonucleotide treatment, as described in Example 18. These mice were further evaluated at the end of the 7 week treatment period for levels of serum free fatty acids, which were measured using a NEFA C assay kit (part #994-75409, Wako Chemicals, GmbH, Germany). Also measured at the end of the 7 week treatment period were triglycerides (TRIG), cholesterol, including total cholesterol (CHOL) and high (HDL) and low (LDL) density lipoprotein cholesterol, all of which were measured using the Hitachi 717® analyzer instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The data, expressed as percent reduction relative to the saline control, are presented in Table 5.\n\n \n \nTable 5\n \n \n \n \n \nEffects of antisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 on serum cholesterol and lipids in dietinduced obese mice\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPercent Reduction in\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSerum Lipids\n \n \n \nCholesterol\n \n \n \n \n \nISIS #\n \n \n \nFree Fatty Acids\n \n \n \nTRIG\n \n \n \nTotal CHOL\n \n \n \nHDL CHOL\n \n \n \nLDL CHOL\n \n \n \n \n \n \n141923\n \n \n17\n \n13\n \n13\n \n11\n \n30\n \n \n \n \n217376\n \n \n33\n \n41\n \n31\n \n28\n \n24\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results demonstrate that antisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression, which was presented in Example 18, leads to significant reductions in of 335, 41% and 31% in serum free fatty acids, serum triglycerides and total cholesterol, respectively. Furthermore, HDL cholesterol was reduced. No significant change was observed in LDL cholesterol levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma glucose concentrations (n=8 mice) were measured at 0 (beginning of study), 3 and 7 (end of study) weeks of treatment by routine clinical analysis using a YSI2700 Select™ Biochemistry Analyzer (YSI Inc., Yellow Spring, Ohio). Plasma insulin levels (n=6 to 8 mice) were measured in the fed state at 0, 3 and 7 weeks and following a 4-hour fast at 4 weeks, using an insulin ELISA kit (#10-1137-10, ALPCO Diagnostics, Windham, NH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 4 weeks of treatment, an insulin tolerance test (n=8 mice) was performed after a 3-hour fast. After 5 weeks of treatment, a glucose tolerance test (n=8 mice) was performed after an overnight fast. For the tolerance tests, a baseline tail blood glucose measurement was obtained, after which 1.0 g/kg glucose or 0.5 units/kg insulin was administered intraperitoneally. Tail blood glucose levels were measured at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes following the challenge with glucose or insulin, using a Glucometer® instrument (Abbott Laboratories, Bedford, MA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment with an antisense oligonucleotide targeted to diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 reduced plasma insulin levels by 50% in the fasted state at 4 weeks and by 69% in the fed state at the 7 weeks. Plasma glucose levels were unchanged by treatment with ISIS 217376 in diet-induced obese mice. Neither insulin sensitivity nor glucose tolerance was improved by treatment with ISIS 217376.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of antisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 on hepatic triglycerides and steatosis in diet-induced obese mice\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, ISIS 217376 (SEQ ID NO: 142) was tested for its ability to affect triglyceride and glycogen content in the livers of diet-induced obese mice. The diet-induced obese mice that received antisense oligonucleotide treatment, as described in Example 18, were further evaluated at the end of the 7 week treatment period for hepatic triglycerides and glycogen content. Hepatic triglyceride content, which is evaluated by biochemical analysis of liver triglyceride concentration and histological examination of liver tissue, was used to assess hepatic steatosis, or accumulation of lipids in the liver. To measure liver tissue triglyceride concentration, triglycerides were extracted from liver tissue in HPLC-grade acetone, using a weight:volume ratio of 1:20. Triglycerides were measured using an Infinity Triglycerides Reagent Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Liver and muscle glycogen concentrations were measured as described by \nDesai, et al. (Diabetes, 2001, 50, 2287-2295\n). To measure glycogen concentrations, liver and muscle tissue were homogenized in 0.03 N HCl (to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL). 100 µL of homogenate was mixed with 400 µL of 1.25 N HCl and heated for 1 hour at 100°C. Following centrifugation of the samples at 14,000 rpm, 10 µL of the supernatant was mixed with 1 mL of glucose oxidase reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After a 10 minute incubation at 37°C, the absorbance was read at 505 nm. A standard curve was generated using glycogen type II from rabbit liver and used to determine the glycogen concentrations. The data for hepatic lipid and glycogen content (n=8 mice) are shown in Table 6 and are expressed as percent reduction relative to saline-treated, high-fat diet mice.\n\n \n \nTable 6\n \n \n \n \n \nEffects of antisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 on hepatic lipid and glycogen content\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPercent reduction in\n \n \n \n \n \nISIS #\n \n \n \nHepatic Triglycerides\n \n \n \nHepatic Glycogen\n \n \n \n \n \n \n141923\n \n \n30\n \n5\n \n \n \n \n217376\n \n \n56\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results in Table 6 demonstrate that 7 weeks of treatment with antisense oligonucleotide targeted to diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 yields a marked reduction of 56% in hepatic triglyceride content compared to saline- and control oligonucleotide-treated mice, indicating an improvement in hepatic steatosis. Hepatic glycogen content at 7 weeks, shown in Table 6, was unchanged by ISIS 217376 treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the 5-week study, hepatic triglyceride content was lowered by 62% at the end of the treatment period. Muscle glycogen content after 5 weeks of treatment was unchanged by ISIS 217376 treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reduction in hepatic triglycerides was also evaluated by histological examination of liver tissue (n=4 mice). Liver tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Multiple adjacent 4-um sections were cut and mounted on glass slides. After dehydration, the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, which stain nuclei and cytoplasm, respectively. This histological analysis revealed a marked improvement in hepatic steatosis following 7 weeks of treatment with ISIS 217376, as compared to saline-treated or ISIS 141923-treated mice. Thus, an improvement in hepatic steatosis was demonstrated by both histological and biochemical methods.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of antisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 on hepatic lipogenic and gluconeogenic genes\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, ISIS 217376 (SEQ ID NO: 142) was tested for its ability to affect the expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and glucose metabolism. The diet-induced obese mice that received antisense oligonucleotide treatment, as described in Example 18, were further evaluated at the end of the 7 week treatment period for expression levels of genes that participate in lipid metabolism, gluconeogenesis and glucose metabolism. mRNA levels in liver and white adipose tissue were quantitated by real-time PCR as described in other examples herein, using primer-probe sets that were generated using the GenBank® accession numbers provided in Table 7.

For example, in liver, decreases were observed in the expression of genes involved in triglyceride synthesis (e.g., glycerol kinase), de novo fatty acid synthesis (e.g., ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 and fatty acid synthase) fatty acid oxidation (e.g., carnitine palmitoyltransferase I), fatty acid desaturation (e.g., stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1) and cholesterol synthesis (e.g., HMG-CoA reductase). Furthermore, the expression of glycogen phosphorylase, which participates in glycogen metabolism, was reduced following ISIS 217376 treatment of diet-induced obese mice. Lipoprotein lipase, which participates in fatty acid storage in adipose tissue, exhibited reduced expression as well. The expression of sterol regulatory binding element protein 1, which functions as a hepatic transcription factor in the context of lipid metabolism, was lowered in diet-induced mice treated with ISIS 217376, as compared to control groups. The expression levels of genes related to gluconeogenesis (e.g., glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1), glucose uptake in both liver and fat (e.g., glucose transporter type 2 and glucose transporter type 4) and lipid homeostasis in fat (e.g., hormone sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase) were not significantly lowered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese data demonstrate that antisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 results in the down-regulation of genes in the lipogenic pathway.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of antisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in the ob/ob mouse model of obesity\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nLeptin is a hormone produced by fat that regulates appetite. Deficiencies in this hormone in both humans and non-human animals leads to obesity. ob/ob mice have a mutation in the leptin gene which results in obesity and hyperglycemia. As such, these mice are a useful model for the investigation of obesity and treatments designed to reduce obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, the effects of antisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 were investigated in the ob/ob mouse model of obesity. Male ob/ob (C57B1/6J-Lep\nob\n/Lep\nob\n) mice at 6-7 weeks of age were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). During a 1 week acclimation period and throughout the study, mice were fed a diet with a fat content of 10-15% (Labdiets #5015, Purina, St. Louis, MO). After the 1 week acclimation period, mice were placed into treatment groups based on body weight, as well as tail blood glucose, which was measured using a Glucometer® instrument (Abbott Laboratories, Bedford, MA) as described herein. For a period of 4 weeks, mice received subcutaneous, twice-weekly injections of ISIS 217376 (SEQ ID NO: 142) or ISIS 116847 (CTGCTAGCCTCTGGATTTGA, SEQ ID NO: 230) at a dose of 25 mg/kg. ISIS 116847 does not target the diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 gene and was used as a control. A group of saline-injected mice served as the control group to which the oligonucleotide-treated animals were compared.

Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 mRNA levels were also measured in these tissues. mRNA expression levels were quantitated by real-time PCR as described in other examples herein. In addition, liver triglycerides (n = 6 mice) and plasma glucose (n = 8 mice) were measured as described herein. The results are presented in Table 10 and are expressed as percent inhibition (for mRNA expression) or reduction (for glucose and triglycerides) relative to saline treated mice. An increase in gene expression or liver triglycerides is indicated by a \"+\" preceding the number.

The compounds are shown in Tables 14 and 15. \"Target site\" indicates the first (5'-most) nucleotide number on the particular target sequence to which the compound binds. All compounds in Tables 14 and 15 are chimeric oligonucleotides (\"gapmers\") 20 nucleotides in length. The compounds in Table 14 are composed of a central \"gap\" region consisting of ten 2'-deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on both sides (5' and 3' directions) by five-nucleotide \"wings\". The wings are composed of 2'-O-methoxyethyl (2'-MOE) nucleotides. The compounds in Table 15 are composed of a central \"gap\" region consisting of sixteen 2'-deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on both sides (5' and 3' directions) by two-nucleotide \"wings\". The wings are composed of 2'-O-methoxyethyl (2'-MOE) nucleotides. In all compounds the internucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphorothioate (P=S) throughout the oligonucleotides. All cytidine residues are 5-methylcytidines.\n\n \n \nTable 14\n \n \n \n \n \nChimeric phosphorothioate oligonucleotides having 5-nucleotide 2'-MOE wings and a 10-nucleotide deoxy gap targeted to

mouse diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, an antisense compound ISIS 337205 (ATGCACTCAAGAACTCGGTA, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 485) was designed to target the 3' UTR region of the mouse diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 RNA, using published sequence data (SEQ ID NO: 11). ISIS 337205 is a chimeric oligonucleotide (\"gapmer\") 20 nucleotides in length, composed of a central \"gap\" region consisting of 14 2'-deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on both sides (5' and 3' directions) by 3-nucleotide \"wings\". The wings are composed of 2'-O-methoxyethyl (2'-MOE) nucleotides. The internucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphorothioate (P=S) throughout the oligonucleotide. All cytidine residues are 5-methylcytidines.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 32\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of antisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 on triglyceride synthesis in primary rodent hepatocytes\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDiacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, which is abundantly expressed in the liver and white adipose tissues, participates in triglyceride synthesis and its activity is also tightly linked to the endogenous fatty acid synthesis pathway. Thus, it was of interest to determine whether antisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 would affect triglyceride synthesis in hepatocytes. In a further embodiment, rat and mouse hepatocytes were isolated and treated with ISIS 217357 (SEQ ID NO: 123) and ISIS 217376 (SEQ ID NO: 142), respectively. ISIS 217357 is a cross species oligonucleotide which exhibits 100% complementarity to rat diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary hepatocytes were isolated from C57BL/6J mice or Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). The animals were anesthetized according to routine procedures. The livers were perfused via the portal vein, first with Ca\n2+\n/Mg\n2+\n-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10 mM Hepes and 0.5 mM EGTA (pH 7.4) for approximately 3 minutes and subsequently with digestion buffer (William Medium E, 10 mM Hepes, 2 mM glutamine acid, 0.63 mg/ml collagenase B from Roche, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamycin) for approximately 5 minutes. Perfused livers were removed from the mice or rats and dissociated in ice-cold wash buffer (above digestion buffer with no collagenase but with addition of 10% fetal bovine serum) by agitation. Parenchymal cells were separated from non-parenchymal cells by spinning the harvested cells at 500 rpm for 4 min in a CR412™ centrifuge (Jouan Inc, Winchester, VA). Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS. The parenchymal hepatocytes with > 85% viability, as assessed by staining with trypan blue, were seeded onto 60-mm culture plates coated with collagen type I (BD Biosciences) at 1,000,000 cells per plate in culture medium (William Medium E with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 nm insulin) and cultured overnight at 37°C and 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor transfection with antisense oligonucleotides, the culture medium was aspirated and the hepatocytes were washed once with PBS, and subsequently incubated for 4-6 hr with 1 ml transfection mixture, which contained 150 nM of antisense oligonucleotide and 4.5 µg/mL LIPOFECTIN™ reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) in Williams' Medium E. The mixture was then aspirated and replaced with the culture medium for approximately 24 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTriglyceride synthesis in transfected hepatocytes was determined by measuring the incorporation of tritiated glycerol ([\n3\nH]glycerol) into triglycerides. Approximately 24 hours following transfection, the culture medium was replaced with 1 ml of high glucose DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (medium and supplements from Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) and 10 uCi of [\n3\nH]glycerol with or without 0.5 mM oleate. As oleate is a free fatty acid, and free fatty acids are incorporated into triglycerides during triglyceride synthesis, oleate was added to the culture medium of some cells to provide an additional supply of fatty acids and to stimulate triglyceride synthesis. Insulin, present in the culture medium, is also known to stimulate triglyceride synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter continued culture overnight, the cells were harvested. One small fraction of the harvested cells was used for RNA extraction and gene expression analysis; the remaining fraction was used for lipid extraction with hexane:isopropanol (3:2 in volume) mixture. The extracted lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography by methods routine in the art. The amount of incorporated [\n3\nH]glycerol into triglyceride was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Data are normalized to untreated control cells and are presented as disintegrations per minute (DPM) per mg in the cultured cell sample. Tables 17a and 17b show the effects of antisense inhibition of diacylglyercol acyltransferase 2 in rat primary hepatocytes and in mouse primary hepatocytes, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReal-time PCR quantitation was performed to measure diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 mRNA levels. Mouse primers and probe used were SEQ ID NOs: 12, 13 and 14. For rat diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, probes and primers were designed to hybridize to a rat diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 sequence, using published sequence information (SEQ ID NO: XM_341887.1, SEQ ID NO: 412). For rat diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 the PCR primers were:\n\n \n \n \nforward primer: GGAACCGCAAAGGCTTTGTA (SEQ ID NO: 486)\n \nreverse primer: AATAGGTGGGAACCAGATCAGC (SEQ ID NO: 487) and\n \nthe PCR probe was: FAM-AGCTGGCCCTGCGCCATGG-TAMRA (SEQ ID NO: 488) where FAM is the fluorescent reporter dye and TAMRA is the quencher dye.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nTarget expression was normalized to that in cells treated with the control oligonucleotide ISIS 141923.\n\n \n \nTable 17a\n \n \n \n \n \nTriglyceride synthesis in primary rat hepatocytes\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISIS #\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO\n \n \n \nTarget mRNA expression (% of ISIS 141923)\n \n \n \nMean incorporation of [\n3\nH]glycerol into triglycerides DPM x 10\n3\n/mg protein\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWithout oleate\n \n \n \n141923\n \n \n229\n \n100\n \n40\n \n \n \n \n217357\n \n \n123\n \n27\n \n8\n \n \n \n \nWith oleate\n \n \n \n141923\n \n \n229\n \n100\n \n581\n \n \n \n \n217357\n \n \n123\n \n23\n \n193\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nTable 17b\n \n \n \n \n \nTriglyceride synthesis in primary mouse hepatocytes\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISIS #\n \n \n \nSEQ ID\n \n \n \nTarget mRNA expression NO (% of ISIS 141923)\n \n \n \nMean incorporation of [\n3\nH]glycerol into triglycerides DPM x 10\n3\n/mg protein\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWithout oleate\n \n \n \n141923\n \n \n229\n \n100\n \n28\n \n \n \n \n217376\n \n \n142\n \n25\n \n11\n \n \n \n \nWith oleate\n \n \n \n141923\n \n \n229\n \n100\n \n506\n \n \n \n \n217376\n \n \n142\n \n2\n \n94\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese data reveal that the inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in rat hepatocytes dramatically reduced triglyceride synthesis by 5-fold and 3-fold in the absence and presence of oleate, respectively.

The obesity in \nfa\n/\nfa\n animals is correlated with excessive eating, decreased energy expenditure, compromised thermoregulatory heat production, hyperinsulinemia (overproduction of insulin), and hypercorticosteronemia (overproduction of corticosteroids). The fa mutation has been identified as an amino acid substitution in the extracellular domain of the receptor for leptin. As a consequence, the \nfa\n/\nfa\n animal has elevated plasma leptin levels and is resistant to exogenous leptin administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, the effects of antisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 are evaluated in the Zucker fa/fa rat model of obesity. Male Zucker fa/fa rats, 6 weeks of age, are purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Rats are maintained on a normal rodent diet. Animals are placed into treatments groups of 6 animals each. The control group receives twice weekly, subcutaneous injections of sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The oligonucleotide-treated groups receive twice weekly, subcutaneous injections of an antisense oligonucleotide targeted to rat diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2. By way of example, rats are treated with 25, 37.5 or 50 mg/kg of ISIS 217357 (SEQ ID NO: 123). Rats receive a total of 16 to 20 doses over an 8 week period. The rats are sacrificed at the end of the treatment period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBody weight and food intake are measured at the start of the treatment period and weekly thereafter. Body composition is measured approximately 3 days prior to the start of the treatment period and during weeks 2, 4 and 5 of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum is collected 2 days prior to the first dose, and every two weeks thereafter. The serum samples, analyzed as described herein, are subjected to measurements of: the liver transaminases ALT and AST, using an Olympus Clinical Lab Automation System (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY); triglycerides and cholesterol, using the Hitachi 717® analyzer instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN); free fatty acids, using a NEFA C assay kit (part #994-75409 from Wako Chemicals, GmbH, Germany); and glucose, using a YSI2700 Select™ Biochemistry Analyzer (YSI Inc., Yellow Spring, Ohio). Insulin levels are measured using a rat-specific ELISA kit (ALPCO Diagnostics, Windham, NH).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assess the effects of oligonucleotide treatment on glucose tolerance, an oral glucose tolerance test is administered during week 5 and is performed as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the end of the study, liver tissue and epididymal fat tissue are collected for RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase mRNA levels in these tissues are measured as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiver tissue and epididymal fat tissue are also collected for routine histological analysis. The tissues are first fixed in neutral-buffered formalin and are subsequently dehydrated, embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned and stained. Hematoxylin and eosin are used to stain nuclei and cytoplasm, respectively, and oil red O is used to visualize lipids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiver, spleen, epididymal fat and brown adipose fat tissues are weighed at the end of the study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression levels of genes involved in lipogenic and gluconeogenic pathways in liver and fat tissue are measured using quantitative real-time PCR. For example, the genes measured are involved in triglyceride synthesis (e.g., glycerol kinase), de novo fatty acid synthesis (e.g., ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 and fatty acid synthase) fatty acid oxidation (e.g., carnitine palmitoyltransferase I), fatty acid desaturation (e.g., stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1) and cholesterol synthesis (e.g., HMG-CoA reductase). Furthermore, the expression levels of genes that participate in glycogen metabolism, for example, glycogen phosphorylase, are measured. In addition, genes that participate in fatty acid storage, for example, lipoprotein lipase, are measured. Changes in the expression of hepatic transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory binding element protein 1, are also measured. The expression levels of genes related to gluconeogenesis (e.g., glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1), glucose uptake in both liver and fat (e.g., glucose transporter type 2 and glucose transporter type 4) and lipid homeostasis in fat (e.g., hormone sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase) are also measured.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntisense inhibition of rat diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in primary hepatocytes: dose response\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, oligonucleotides targeted to rat diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 were selected for dose response studies in primary rat hepatocytes. The oligonucleotides tested were ISIS 217320, ISIS 217336, ISIS 217353, ISIS 217354, ISIS 217356, ISIS 217357 and ISIS 217376.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary rat hepatocytes were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) and were cultured in Williams Medium E supplemented with 10% fetal bovine, 1% penicillin/ streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and .01 M HEPES (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (Falcon-Primaria #3872) coated with 0.1 mg/ml collagen at a density of approximately 10,000 cells/well for use in oligonucleotide transfection experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells were treated with 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200 nM of antisense oligonucleotide, as described herein. Rat diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 mRNA expression in oligonucleotide-treated cells was measured using quantitative real-time PCR. The data from the 25, 50, 100 and 200 nM treatments are averaged from 3 experiments and are shown as percent inhibition, relative to untreated control cells, in Table 24. The 5 and 10 nM treatments did not inhibit rat diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression.\n\n \n \nTable 24\n \n \n \n \n \nAntisense inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in rat primary hepatocytes: dose response\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n% Inhibition\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDose of oligonucleotide (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \nISIS #\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO\n \n \n \n25\n \n \n \n50\n \n \n \n100\n \n \n \n200\n \n \n \n \n \n217320\n \n29\n \n0\n \n42\n \n45\n \n27\n \n \n \n217336\n \n40\n \n17\n \n46\n \n63\n \n72\n \n \n \n217353\n \n50\n \n6\n \n60\n \n76\n \n73\n \n \n \n217354\n \n51\n \n34\n \n64\n \n66\n \n63\n \n \n \n217356\n \n122\n \n0\n \n47\n \n65\n \n69\n \n \n \n217357\n \n123\n \n24\n \n61\n \n75\n \n85\n \n \n \n217376\n \n142\n \n0\n \n43\n \n70\n \n81\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 24, the oligonucleotides tested in this assay inhibited rat diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression in primary hepatocytes.
