The invention also relates to the use of the innovative proteins in therapeutic applications to treat atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia and other cholesterol related diseases. The invention further relates to cells comprising such proteins, polynucleotides encoding such proteins or fragments thereof, and to vectors comprising the polynucleotides encoding the innovative proteins.\n\n\n \nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAtherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries responsible for coronary heart disease (CHD) that underlies most deaths in industrialized countries (Lusis (2000)). Several risk factors for CHD have now been well established: dyslipidemias, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, poor diet, inactivity and stress. The most clinically relevant and common dyslipidemias are characterized by an increase in low density lipoprotein and very low density lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL) with hypercholesterolemia in the absence or presence of hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson et al. (1967)). An isolated elevation of LDL cholesterol is one of the most common risk factors for CHD. PCSK9 (also referred to as HCHOLA3, NARC-1, or FH3) is a protease belonging to the proteinase K subfamily of the secretory subtilase family (Naureckiene et al., \nArch. Biochem. Biophy., \n420:55-57 (2003)). PCSK9 has been shown to be a key regulator of cholesterol homeostasis and circulating low density lipoprotein levels. Circulating PCSK9 protein controls LDL metabolism by directly binding to the LDL receptor and promoting its degradation in hepatocytes. PCSK9-mediated down-regulation of LDL receptor protein and activity leads to reduced clearance of LDL from the circulation and higher LDL levels. Several mutant forms of PCSK9 are known, including S127R, N157K, F216L, R218S, and D374Y, with S127R, F216L, and D374Y being linked to autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH). It is believed that wild-type PCSK9 increases the turnover rate of the LDL receptor causing lower LDL clearance (Maxwell et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci., \n102(6):2069-2074 (2005); Benjannet et al. and Lalanne et al.), while PCSK9 loss of function mutations result in increased levels of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), increased clearance of circulating LDL, and a corresponding decrease in plasma cholesterol levels (Rashid et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci., \n102(15):5374-5379 (2005)). As such, PCSK9 is a potential target for the treatment of atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia and other cholesterol related diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFibronectin based scaffolds are a family of proteins capable of evolving to bind any compound of interest. These proteins, which generally make use of a scaffold derived from a fibronectin type III (Fn3) or Fn3-like domain, function in a manner characteristic of natural or engineered antibodies (that is, polyclonal, monoclonal, or single-chain antibodies) and, in addition, possess structural advantages. Specifically, the structure of these antibody mimics has been designed for optimal folding, stability, and solubility, even under conditions that normally lead to the loss of structure and function in antibodies. An example of fibronectin-based scaffold proteins is Adnectins (Adnexus, a Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D Company).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFibronectin type III (Fn3) domains comprise, in order from N-terminus to C-terminus, a beta or beta-like strand, A; a loop, AB; a beta or beta-like strand, B; a loop, BC; a beta or beta-like strand C; a loop CD; a beta or beta-like strand D; a loop DE; a beta or beta-like strand, E; a loop, EF; a beta or beta-like strand F; a loop FG; and a beta or beta-like strand G. Any or all of loops AB, BC, CD, DE, EF and FG may participate in target binding. The BC, DE, and FG loops are both structurally and functionally analogous to the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from immunoglobulins. U.S. Pat. No. 7,115,396 describes Fn3 domain proteins wherein alterations to the BC, DE, and FG loops result in high affinity TNFα binders. U.S. Publication No. 2007/0148126 describes Fn3 domain proteins wherein alterations to the BC, DE, and FG loops result in high affinity VEGFR2 binders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt would be advantageous to obtain improved fibronectin domain scaffold proteins that bind PCSK9 for the therapeutic treatment of atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia and other cholesterol related diseases.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe application provides Adnectins against human PCSK9.

Polypeptides can include natural amino acids and non-natural amino acids such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,559,126, incorporated herein by reference. Polypeptides can also be modified in any of a variety of standard chemical ways (e.g., an amino acid can be modified with a protecting group; the carboxy-terminal amino acid can be made into a terminal amide group; the amino-terminal residue can be modified with groups to, e.g., enhance lipophilicity; or the polypeptide can be chemically glycosylated or otherwise modified to increase stability or in vivo half-life). Polypeptide modifications can include the attachment of another structure such as a cyclic compound or other molecule to the polypeptide and can also include polypeptides that contain one or more amino acids in an altered configuration (i.e., R or S; or, L or D). The peptides of the invention are proteins derived from the tenth type III domain of fibronectin that have been modified to bind specifically to PCSK9 and are referred to herein as, “anti-PCSK9 Adnectin” or “PCSK9 Adnectin”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “PK” is an acronym for “pharmacokinetic” and encompasses properties of a compound including, by way of example, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination by a subject. A “PK modulation protein” or “PK moiety” refers to any protein, peptide, or moiety that affects the pharmacokinetic properties of a biologically active molecule when fused to or administered together with the biologically active molecule. Examples of a PK modulation protein or PK moiety include PEG, human serum albumin (HSA) binders (as disclosed in U.S. Publication Nos. 2005/0287153 and 2007/0003549, PCT Publication Nos. WO 2009/083804 and WO 2009/133208, and SABA molecules as described herein), human serum albumin, Fc or Fc fragments and variants thereof, and sugars (e.g., sialic acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity” herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in a selected sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR®) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “isolated” polypeptide is one that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of polypeptide as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing condition using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated polypeptide includes the polypeptide in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the polypeptide's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe notations “mpk”, “mg/kg”, or “mg per kg” refer to milligrams per kilogram. All notations are used interchangeably throughout the present disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “half-life” of an amino acid sequence or compound can generally be defined as the time taken for the serum concentration of the polypeptide to be reduced by 50%, in vivo, for example due to degradation of the sequence or compound and/or clearance or sequestration of the sequence or compound by natural mechanisms. The half-life can be determined in any manner known per se, such as by pharmacokinetic analysis. Suitable techniques will be clear to the person skilled in the art, and may for example generally involve the steps of suitably administering to the primate a suitable dose of the amino acid sequence or compound of the invention; collecting blood samples or other samples from said primate at regular intervals; determining the level or concentration of the amino acid sequence or compound of the invention in said blood sample; and calculating, from (a plot of) the data thus obtained, the time until the level or concentration of the amino acid sequence or compound of the invention has been reduced by 50% compared to the initial level upon dosing. Reference is, for example, made to the standard handbooks, such as Kenneth, A. et al., \nChemical Stability of Pharmaceuticals: A Handbook for Pharmacists \nand in Peters et al., \nPharmacokinete Analysis: A Practical Approach \n(1996). Reference is also made to Gibaldi, M. et al., \nPharmacokinetics, \n2nd Rev. Edition, Marcel Dekker (1982).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHalf-life can be expressed using parameters such as the t\n1/2\n-alpha, t\n1/2\n-beta, HL_Lambda_z, and the area under the curve (AUC). In the present specification, an “increase in half-life” refers to an increase in any one of these parameters, any two of these parameters, any three of these parameters or all four of these parameters. An “increase in half-life” in particular refers to an increase in the t\n1/2\n-beta and/or HL_Lambda_z, either with or without an increase in the t\n1/2\n-alpha and/or the AUC or both.\n\n\n \nOverview\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application provides Adnectins against human PCSK9. In order to identify PCSK9 specific antagonists, PCSK9 was presented to large synthetic libraries of Adnectins. Adnectins that bound to PCSK9 were screened for PCSK9 binding, for biophysical properties, and for PCSK9 inhibitory activity. The anti-PCSK9 Adnectins were mutated and subjected to further selective pressure by lowering the target concentration and selecting for anti-PCSK9 Adnectins with slow off-rates. From this optimization process, a family of Adnectins was identified as PCSK9 specific inhibitors with favorable biochemical and biophysical properties.\n\n\n \nFibronectin Based Scaffolds\n\n\n \n \n \nOne aspect of the application provides for polypeptides comprising Fn3 domain in which one or more of the solvent accessible loops has been randomized or mutated. In some embodiments, the Fn3 domain is an Fn3 domain derived from the wild-type tenth module of the human fibronectin type III domain (\n10\nFn3): VSDVPRDLEVVAATPTSLLI\nSWDAPAVTVR\nYYRITYGETGGNSPVQEFTV\nPGSKS T\nATISGLKPGVDYTITVYAV\nTGRGDSPASSKP\nISINYRT (SEQ ID NO: 1). In the \n10\nFn3 sequence, the BC, DE and FG loops are underlined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described herein, non-ligand binding sequences of \n10\nFn3, i.e., the “\n10\nFn3 scaffold”, may be altered provided that the \n10\nFn3 retains ligand binding function and/or structural stability. A variety of mutant \n10\nFn3 scaffolds have been reported. In one aspect, one or more of \nAsp\n 7, Glu 9, and Asp 23 is replaced by another amino acid, such as, for example, a non-negatively charged amino acid residue (e.g., Asn, Lys, etc.). These mutations have been reported to have the effect of promoting greater stability of the mutant \n10\nFn3 at neutral pH as compared to the wild-type form (See, PCT Publication No. WO 02/04523). A variety of additional alterations in the \n10\nFn3 scaffold that are either beneficial or neutral have been disclosed. See, for example, Batori et al., \nProtein Eng., \n15(12):1015-1020 (December 2002); Koide et al., \nBiochemistry, \n40(34):10326-10333 (Aug. 28, 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth variant and wild-type \n10\nFn3 proteins are characterized by the same structure, namely seven beta-strand domain sequences designated A through G and six loop regions (AB loop, BC loop, CD loop, DE loop, EF loop, and FG loop) which connect the seven beta-strand domain sequences. The beta strands positioned closest to the N- and C-termini may adopt a beta-like conformation in solution. In SEQ ID NO:1, the AB loop corresponds to residues 15-16, the BC loop corresponds to residues 21-30, the CD loop corresponds to residues 39-45, the DE loop corresponds to residues 51-56, the EF loop corresponds to residues 60-66, and the FG loop corresponds to residues 76-87 (Xu et al., \nChemistry \n& \nBiology, \n9:933-942 (2002)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the \n10\nFn3 polypeptide may be at least 40%, 50%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, or 90% identical to the human \n10\nFn3 domain, shown in SEQ ID NO:1. Much of the variability will generally occur in one or more of the loops. Each of the beta or beta-like strands of a \n10\nFn3 polypeptide may consist essentially of an amino acid sequence that is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100% identical to the sequence of a corresponding beta or beta-like strand of SEQ ID NO:1, provided that such variation does not disrupt the stability of the polypeptide in physiological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the disclosure provides polypeptides comprising a tenth fibronectin type III (\n10\nFn3) domain, wherein the \n10\nFn3 domain comprises a loop, AB; a loop, BC; a loop, CD; a loop, DE; a loop EF; and a loop FG; and has at least one loop selected from loop BC, DE, and FG with an altered amino acid sequence relative to the sequence of the corresponding loop of the human \n10\nFn3 domain. In some embodiments, the BC and FG loops are altered, and in some embodiments, the BC, DE, and FG loops are altered, i.e., the Fn3 domains comprise non-naturally occurring loops. In some embodiments, the AB, CD and/or the EF loops are altered. By “altered” is meant one or more amino acid sequence alterations relative to a template sequence (corresponding human fibronectin domain) and includes amino acid additions, deletions, and substitutions. Altering an amino acid sequence may be accomplished through intentional, blind, or spontaneous sequence variation, generally of a nucleic acid coding sequence, and may occur by any technique, for example, PCR, error-prone PCR, or chemical DNA synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more loops selected from BC, DE, and FG may be extended or shortened in length relative to the corresponding human fibronectin loop.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the length of the loop may be extended by 2-25 amino acids. In some embodiments, the length of the loop may be decreased by 1-11 amino acids. To optimize antigen binding, therefore, the length of a loop of \n10\nFn3 may be altered in length as well as in sequence to obtain the greatest possible flexibility and affinity in antigen binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises a Fn3 domain that comprises an amino acid sequence at least 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, 99 or 100% identical to the non-loop regions of SEQ ID NO:1, wherein at least one loop selected from BC, DE, and FG is altered. In some embodiments, the altered BC loop has up to 10 amino acid substitutions, up to 4 amino acid deletions, up to 10 amino acid insertions, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the altered DE loop has up to 6 amino acid substitutions, up to 4 amino acid deletions, up to 13 amino acid insertions or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the FG loop has up to 12 amino acid substitutions, up to 11 amino acid deletions, up to 25 amino acid insertions or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, amino acid residues corresponding to residues 21-30, 51-56, and 76-87 of SEQ ID NO: 1 define the BC, DE, and FG loops, respectively. However, it should be understood that not every residue within the loop region needs to be modified in order to achieve a \n10\nFn3 binder having strong affinity for a desired target (e.g., PCSK9).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, residues 21 (S) and 22 (W) of the BC loop as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 do not need to be modified for binding PCSK9. That is, \n10\nFn3 domains with high affinity binding to PCSK9 may be obtained by modifying only residues 23-30 of loop BC as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. This is demonstrated in the BC loops exemplified in Table 3, which indicates that only the residues spanning the shaded positions were altered. Therefore, in some embodiments, a BC loop according to this designation comprises the shaded portion of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 2-17, 106-135, and 301-303 as shown in Table 3. For example, in one embodiment, a BC loop may comprise the sequence PPPSHGYG (residues 3-10 of SEQ ID NO: 2), DAPAHAYG (residues 3-10 of SEQ ID NO: 5), EPFSRLPGGGE (residues 3-13 of SEQ ID NO: 106), or DAPADGGYG (residues 3-11 of SEQ ID NO: 107).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, positions 51 (P) and 56 (T) of loop DE as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 do not need to be modified for binding PCSK9. That is, \n10\nFn3 domains with high affinity binding to PCSK9 may be obtained by modifying only residues 52-55 of loop DE as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. This is demonstrated in the DE loops exemplified in Table 3, which indicates that only the residues spanning the shaded positions were altered. Therefore, in some embodiments, a DE loop according to this designation comprises the shaded portion of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 18-27 and 136-141, as shown in Table 3. For example, in one embodiment, a DE loop may comprise the sequence PGKG (residues 2-5 of SEQ ID NO: 18), VGVG (residues 2-5 SEQ ID NO: 27), or VSKS (residues 2-5 of SEQ ID NO: 137).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, position 87 (P) of the FG loop as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 does not need to be modified for binding PCSK9. That is, \n10\nFn3 domains with high affinity binding to PCSK9 may be obtained by modifying only residues 76-86 of the FG loop as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. This is demonstrated in the FG loops exemplified in Table 3, which indicates that only the residues spanning the shaded positions were altered. Therefore, in some embodiments, an FG loop according to this designation comprises the shaded portion of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 28-38 and 142-172, as shown in Table 3. For example, in one embodiment, an FG loop may comprise the sequence EYPYKHSGYYHR (residues 1-12 in SEQ ID NO: 28), EYPYDYSGYYHR (residues 1-12 in SEQ ID NO: 142), or EFDFVGAGYYHR (residues 1-12 in SEQ ID NO: 167).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the present application demonstrates that the BC, DE, and FG loop regions can be generally described according to consensus sequences. For example, the BC loop can be generally defined by the consensus sequence SW(X\n1\n)\nZ\nX\n2\nG (SEQ ID NO: 323) where X\n1 \nis any amino acid, Z is a number from 6-9, and X\n2 \nis Y or H. This consensus sequence is exemplified by BC loops shown in Table 3 except for the BC loop defined by SEQ ID NO: 106. In other embodiments, Z is a number selected from 2-5. In certain embodiments, Z is a number selected from 10-15. In some embodiments, X\n2 \nis any aromatic residue (i.e., Y, F, W, or H).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the DE loop can be generally defined by the consensus sequence PX\n1\nX\n1\nX\n1\nX\n3\nT, (SEQ ID NO: 324) where X\n1 \nis any amino acid and X\n3 \nis G or S. This consensus is exemplified by the DE loops shown in Table 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the FG loop can be generally defined by the consensus sequence EX\n4\nX\n1\nX\n5\nX\n1\nX\n1\nX\n6\nGYX\n4\nHRP (SEQ ID NO: 325), where X\n1 \nis any amino acid; X\n4 \nis Y or F; X\n5 \nis Y, F, or W; and X\n6 \nis S or A. In certain embodiments, X\n4 \nand X\n5 \nare aromatic residues, each independently selected from Y, F, W, or H. This consensus is exemplified by the FG loops shown in Table 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides a PCSK9 binding Adnectin comprising a BC loop having the sequence SW(X\n1\n)\nZ\nX\n2\nG (SEQ ID NO: 323), a DE loop having the sequence PX\n1\nX\n1\nX\n1\nX\n3\nT (SEQ ID NO: 324), and an FG loop having the sequence EX\n4\nX\n1\nX\n5\nX\n1\nX\n1\nX\n6\nGYX\n4\nHRP (SEQ ID NO: 325), as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a PCSK9 binding Adnectin comprising a BC loop having the sequence SWEPFSRLPGGGE (SEQ ID NO: 106), a DE loop having the sequence PX\n1\nX\n1\nX\n1\nX\n3\nT (SEQ ID NO: 324), and an FG loop having the sequence EX\n4\nX\n1\nX\n5\nX\n1\nX\n1\nX\n6\nGYX\n4\nHRP (SEQ ID NO: 325), as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a BC loop can be generally defined by the consensus sequence (X\n1\n)\nZ\nX\n2\nG (SEQ ID NO: 449) where X\n1 \nis any amino acid, Z is a number from 6-9, and X\n2 \nis Y or H. This consensus sequence is exemplified by BC loops shown in Table 3 except for the BC loop defined by SEQ ID NO: 106. In other embodiments, Z is a number selected from 2-5. In certain embodiments, Z is a number selected from 10-15. In some embodiments, X\n2 \nis any aromatic residue (i.e., Y, F, W, or H).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the DE loop can be generally defined by the consensus sequence X\n1\nX\n1\nX\n1\nX\n3\n, (SEQ ID NO: 450) where X\n1 \nis any amino acid and X\n3 \nis G or S.

In some embodiments, the protein of the invention comprises a BC, DE and FG loop amino acid sequence at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, 99 or 100% identical to of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 2-38, 106-172, 301-303. In other embodiments, the protein of the invention comprises a BC, DE and FG loop amino acid sequence at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, 99 or 100% identical to the shaded portion of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 2-38, 106-172, 301-303 as shown in Table 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin comprises the amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 39-76, 173-290, and 304-309. In some embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin comprises the Fn3 domain amino acid sequence from position 3-96 of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 39-76, 173-290, and 304-309. In some embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin comprises an amino acid sequence at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, 99 or 100% identical to any one of SEQ ID NOS:39-76, 173-290, and 304-309.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFibronectin naturally binds certain types of integrins through its integrin-binding motif, “arginine-glycine˜aspartic acid” (RGD). In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises a \n10\nFn3 domain that lacks the (RGD) integrin binding motif. The integrin binding domain may be removed by altering the RGD sequence by amino acid substitution, deletion or insertion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin molecules of the present invention may be modified to comprise an N-terminal extension sequence and/or a C-terminal extension. For example, an MG sequence may be placed at the N-terminus of the \n10\nFn3 defined by SEQ ID NO: 1. The M will usually be cleaved off, leaving a G at the N-terminus. Alternatively, the first 10 amino acids of the anti-PCSK9 Adnectins shown in Table 4 may be replaced with an alternative N-terminal sequence, referred to herein as N-terminal extensions, as shown in Table 6 (i.e., SEQ ID NOs: 371-379). In addition, an M, G or MG may also be placed N-terminal to any of the N-terminal extensions having SEQ ID NOs: 371-379. The anti-PCSK9 Adnectins described herein may also comprise alternative C-terminal tail sequences, referred to herein as C-terminal extension sequences. For example, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin sequences shown in Table 4 may be truncated at the threonine corresponding to T94 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (i.e., truncated after the INYRT (SEQ ID NO: 636) portion of the sequence). Such truncated version may be used as therapeutic molecules in the truncated form, or alternative C-terminal extensions may be added after the threonine residue. Exemplary C-terminal extension sequences are shown in Table 6 as SEQ ID NOs: 380-395. Exemplary anti-PCSK9 Adnectins comprising C-terminal extension sequences are shown in Table 4. For example, SEQ ID NO: 49 (clone 1813E02) comprises the naturally occurring C-terminal extension EIDKPSQ (SEQ ID NO: 380) followed by a His6 tag (SEQ ID NO: 637). However, it should be understood that the His6 tag is completely optional.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the C-terminal extension sequences (also called “tails”), comprise E and D residues, and may be between 8 and 50, 10 and 30, 10 and 20, 5 and 10, and 2 and 4 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, tail sequences include ED-based linkers in which the sequence comprises tandem repeats of ED. In exemplary embodiments, the tail sequence comprises 2-10, 2-7, 2-5, 3-10, 3-7, 3-5, 3, 4 or 5 ED repeats. In certain embodiments, the ED-based tail sequences may also include additional amino acid residues, such as, for example: EI (SEQ ID NO: 385), EID, ES, EC, EGS, and EGC. Such sequences are based, in part, on known Adnectin tail sequences, such as EIDKPSQ (SEQ ID NO: 380), in which residues D and K have been removed. In exemplary embodiments, the ED-based tail comprises an E, I or EI (SEQ ID NO: 385) residues before the ED repeats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the N- or C-terminal sequences may be combined with other known linker sequences (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 396-419 in Table 6) as necessary when designing an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin fusion molecule. Exemplary anti-PCSK9 Adnectin comprising linker sequences are shown in Table 4 (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 53, 55, and 57). In some embodiments, sequences may be placed at the C-terminus of the \n10\nFn3 domain to facilitate attachment of a pharmacokinetic moiety. For example, a cysteine containing linker such as GSGC (SEQ ID NO:77) may be added to the C-terminus to facilitate site directed PEGylation on the cysteine residue.\n\n\n \nPharmacokinetic Moieties\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the application provides for anti-PCSK9 Adnectins further comprising a pharmacokinetic (PK) moiety. Improved pharmacokinetics may be assessed according to the perceived therapeutic need. Often it is desirable to increase bioavailability and/or increase the time between doses, possibly by increasing the time that a protein remains available in the serum after dosing. In some instances, it is desirable to improve the continuity of the serum concentration of the protein over time (e.g., decrease the difference in serum concentration of the protein shortly after administration and shortly before the next administration). The anti-PCSK9 Adnectin may be attached to a moiety that reduces the clearance rate of the polypeptide in a mammal (e.g., mouse, rat, or human) by greater than three-fold relative to the unmodified anti-PCSK9 Adnectin. Other measures of improved pharmacokinetics may include serum half-life, which is often divided into an alpha phase and a beta phase. Either or both phases may be improved significantly by addition of an appropriate moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoieties that tend to slow clearance of a protein from the blood, herein referred to as “PK moieties”, include polyoxyalkylene moieties, e.g., polyethylene glycol, sugars (e.g., sialic acid), and well-tolerated protein moieties (e.g., Fc and fragments and variants thereof, transferrin, or serum albumin). The anti-PCSK9 Adnectin may be fused to albumin or a fragment (portion) or variant of albumin as described in U.S. Publication No. 2007/0048282. In some embodiments, the PCSK9 Adnectin may be fused to one or more serum albumin binding Adnectin, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the PK moiety is a serum albumin binding protein such as those described in U.S. Publication Nos. 2007/0178082 and 2007/0269422.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the PK moiety is a serum immunoglobulin binding protein such as those described in U.S. Publication No. 2007/0178082\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin comprises polyethylene glycol (PEG). One or more PEG molecules may be attached at different positions on the protein, and such attachment may be achieved by reaction with amines, thiols or other suitable reactive groups. The amine moiety may be, for example, a primary amine found at the N-terminus of a polypeptide or an amine group present in an amino acid, such as lysine or arginine. In some embodiments, the PEG moiety is attached at a position on the polypeptide selected from the group consisting of: a) the N-terminus; b) between the N-terminus and the most N-terminal beta strand or beta-like strand; c) a loop positioned on a face of the polypeptide opposite the target-binding site; d) between the C-terminus and the most C-terminal beta strand or beta-like strand; and e) at the C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPegylation may be achieved by site-directed pegylation, wherein a suitable reactive group is introduced into the protein to create a site where pegylation preferentially occurs. In some embodiments, the protein is modified to introduce a cysteine residue at a desired position, permitting site directed pegylation on the cysteine. PEG may vary widely in molecular weight and may be branched or linear. In one embodiment the PEG has two branches. In another embodiment the PEG has four branches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin is fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain, or a fragment or variant thereof. In an exemplary embodiment, the Fc domain is derived from an IgG1 subclass, however, other subclasses (e.g., IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) may also be used. Shown below is the sequence of a human IgG1 immunoglobulin Fc domain, and the relative position of each region within the Fc domain are indicated based on the EU numbering format:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 315)\n \n \n \n \n \n \nASTKGPSVFPLAPSSKSTSGGTAALGCLVKDYFPEPVTVSWNSGALTSGV\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHTFPAVLQSSGLYSLSSVVTVPSSSLGTQTYICNVNHKPSNTKVDKKVEP\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKSC\n \nDKTHTCPPCPAPELLG\nGPSVFLFPPKPKDTLMISRTPEVTCVVVDVS\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHEDPEVKFNWYVDGVEVHNAKTKPREEQYNSTYRVVSVLTVLHQDWLNGK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEYKCKVSNKALPAPIEKTISKAKGQPREPQVYTLPPSRDELTKNQVSLTC\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLVKGFYPSDIAVEWESNGQPENNYKTTPPVLDSDGSFFLYSKLTVDKSRW\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nQQGNVFSCSVMHEALHNHYTQKSLSLSPGK\n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe core hinge sequence is underlined, and the CH1 region is italicized; the CH2 and CH3 regions are in regular text.

In certain embodiments, the Fc and anti-PCSK9 Adnectin are fused via a linker. Exemplary linker sequences include AGGGGSG (SEQ ID NO: 310), GSGSGSGSGSGS (SEQ ID NO: 311), QPDEPGGS (SEQ ID NO: 312), ELQLEESAAEAQDGELD (SEQ ID NO: 313), TVAAPS (SEQ ID NO: 314), KAGGGGSG (SEQ ID NO: 620), KGSGSGSGSGSGS (SEQ ID NO: 621), KQPDEPGGS (SEQ ID NO: 622), KELQLEESAAEAQDGELD (SEQ ID NO: 623), KTVAAPS (SEQ ID NO: 624), KAGGGGSGG (SEQ ID NO: 625), KGSGSGSGSGSGSG (SEQ ID NO: 626), KQPDEPGGSG (SEQ ID NO: 627), KELQLEESAAEAQDGELDG (SEQ ID NO: 628), KTVAAPSG (SEQ ID NO: 629) AGGGGSGG (SEQ ID NO: 630), GSGSGSGSGSGSG (SEQ ID NO: 631), QPDEPGGSG (SEQ ID NO: 632), ELQLEESAAEAQDGELDG (SEQ ID NO: 633), and TVAAPSG (SEQ ID NO: 634).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the Fc region used in the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin fusion comprises the hinge region of an Fc molecule. As used herein, the “hinge” region comprises the core hinge residues spanning positions 104-119 of SEQ ID NO: 315 (DKTHTCPPCPAPELLG; SEQ ID NO: 316) of IgG1, which corresponds to positions 221-236 according to EU numbering. In certain embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin-Fc fusion adopts a multimeric structure (e.g., dimer) owing, in part, to the cysteine residues at positions 109 and 112 of SEQ ID NO: 315 (EU numbering 226 and 229, respectively) within the hinge region. In other embodiments, the hinge region as used herein, may further include residues derived from the CH1 and CH2 regions that flank the core hinge sequence, as shown in SEQ ID NO: 315.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the hinge sequence, may include substitutions that confer desirable pharmacokinetic, biophysical, and/or biological properties. Some exemplary hinge sequences include EPKSS\nDKTHTCPPCPAPELLG\nGPS (SEQ ID NO: 317; core hinge region underlined), EPKSS\nDKTHTCPPCPAPELLG\nGSS (SEQ ID NO: 318; core hinge region underlined), EPKSS\nGSTHTCPPCPAPELLG\nGSS (SEQ ID NO: 319; core hinge region underlined), \nDKTHTCPPCPAPELLG\nGPS (SEQ ID NO: 320; core hinge region underlined), and \nDKTHTCPPCPAPELLG\nGSS (SEQ ID NO: 321, core hinge region underlined). In one embodiment, the residue P at position 122 (EU numbering 238) of SEQ ID NO: 315 has been replaced with S to ablate Fc effector function; this replacement is exemplified in hinges having any one of SEQ ID NOs: 318, 319, and 321. In another embodiment, the residues DK at positions 104-105 of SEQ ID NO: 315 (EU numbering 221-222) have been replaced with GS to remove a potential clip site; this replacement is exemplified in SEQ ID NO: 319. In another embodiment, the C at \nposition\n 103 of SEQ ID NO: 315 (EU numbering 220) has been replaced with S to prevent improper cystine bond formation in the absence of a light chain; this replacement is exemplified in SEQ ID NOs: 317-319.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an antiPCSK9 Adnectin-Fc fusion may have the following configurations: 1) anti-PCSK9 Adnectin-hinge-Fc or 2) hinge-Fc-anti-PCSK9 Adnectin. Therefore, any anti-PCSK9 Adnectin of the present invention can be fused to an Fc region comprising a hinge sequence according to these configurations. In some embodiments, a linker may be used to join the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin to the hinge-Fc moiety, for example, an exemplary fusion protein may have the configuration hinge-anti-PCSK9 Adnectin-linker-Fc. Additionally, depending on the system in which the fusion polypeptide is produced, a leader sequence may placed at the N-terminus of the fusion polypeptide. For example, if the fusion is produced in a mammalian system, a leader sequence such as METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTG (SEQ ID NO: 326) may be added to the N-terminus of the fusion molecule. If the fusion is produced in \nE. coli\n, the fusion sequence will be preceded by a methionine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following sequence exemplifies an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin-hinge-Fc construct produced in a mammalian system: METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTGGVSDVPRDLEVVAATPTSLLISWVPPSDDYGYYRIT YGETGGNSPVQEFTVPIGKGTATISGLKPGVDYTITVYAVEFPWPHAGYYHRPISINYRT EI\nEPKSSGSTHTCPPCPAPELLGGSS\nVFLFPPKPKDTLMISRTPEVTCVVVDVSHED PEVKFNWYVDGVEVHNAKTKPREEQYNSTYRVVSVLTVLHQDWLNGKEYKCK VSNKALPAPIEKTISKAKGQPREPQVYTLPPSRDELTKNQVSLTCLVKGFYPSDIA VEWESNGQPENNYKTTPPVLDSDGSFFLYSKLTVDKSRWQQGNVFSCSVMHEAL HNHYTQKSLSLSPGK (SEQ ID NO: 322).

In some embodiments, the PK moiety is transferrin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the PK moiety is another Adnectin specific for a serum protein, e.g., HSA. The present application provides specific serum albumin binding Adnectin molecules (or SABA), as described herein.

Proteins that have been pegylated are indicated by asterisk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNucleic Acid-Protein Fusion Technology\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the application provides an Adnectin comprising fibronectin type III domains that binds PCSK9. One way to rapidly make and test Fn3 domains with specific binding properties is the nucleic acid-protein fusion technology of Adnexus, a Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D Company. This disclosure utilizes the in vitro expression and tagging technology, termed PROfusion' which exploits nucleic acid-protein fusions (RNA- and DNA-protein fusions) to identify novel polypeptides and amino acid motifs that are important for binding to proteins. Nucleic acid-protein fusion technology is a technology that covalently couples a protein to its encoding genetic information. For a detailed description of the RNA-protein fusion technology and fibronectin-based scaffold protein library screening methods see Szostak et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,258,558, 6,261,804, 6,214,553, 6,281,344, 6,207,446, 6,518,018 and 6,818,418; and Roberts et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci., \n94:12297-12302 (1997), herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \nVectors and Polynucleotide Embodiments\n\n\n \n \n \nNucleic acids encoding any of the various proteins or polypeptides disclosed herein may be synthesized chemically. Codon usage may be selected so as to improve expression in a cell. Such codon usage will depend on the cell type selected. Specialized codon usage patterns have been developed for \nE. coli \nand other bacteria, as well as mammalian ceils, plant cells, yeast cells and insect cells. See for example: Mayfield et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n100(2):438-442 (Jan. 21, 2003); Sinclair et al., \nProtein Expr. Purif., \n26(I):96-105 (October 2002); Connell, N.D., \nCurr. Opin. Biotechnol., \n12(5):446-449 (October 2001); Makrides et al., \nMicrobiol. Rev., \n60(3):512-538 (September 1996); and Sharp et al., \nYeast, \n7(7):657-678 (October 1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneral techniques for nucleic acid manipulation are described for example in Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, \n2nd Edition, Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989), or Ausubel, F. et al., \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, Green Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York (1987) and periodic updates, herein incorporated by reference. Generally, the DNA encoding the polypeptide is operably linked to suitable transcriptional or translational regulatory elements derived from mammalian, viral, or insect genes. Such regulatory elements include a transcriptional promoter, an optional operator sequence to control transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites, and sequences that control the termination of transcription and translation. The ability to replicate in a host, usually conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection gene to facilitate recognition of transformants is additionally incorporated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proteins described herein may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which is preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. An exemplary N-terminal leader sequence for production of polypeptides in a mammalian system is METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTG (SEQ ID NO: 326), which is removed by the host cell following expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process a native signal sequence, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, 1 pp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, a factor leader (including \nSaccharomyces \nand \nKluyveromyces \nalpha-factor leaders), or acid phosphatase leader, the \nC. albicans \nglucoamylase leader, or the signal described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,144. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available. The DNA for such precursor regions may be ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2 micron plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the protein of the invention, e.g., a fibronectin-based scaffold protein. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter, beta-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, and hybrid promoters such as the tan promoter. However, other known bacterial promoters are suitable. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the protein of the invention. Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3′ end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tall to the 3′ end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscription from vectors in mammalian host cells can be controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscription of a DNA encoding proteins of the invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, α-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, \nNature, \n297:17-18 (1982) on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a \nposition\n 5′ or 3′ to the peptide-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a \nsite\n 5′ from the promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (e.g., yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5′ and, occasionally 3′, untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of mRNA encoding the protein of the invention. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO 94/11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant DNA can also include any type of protein tag sequence that may be useful for purifying the protein. Examples of protein tags include but are not limited to a histidine tag, a FLAG tag, a myc tag, an HA tag, or a GST tag. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts can be found in \nCloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual\n, (Elsevier, New York (1985)), the relevant disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression construct is introduced into the host cell using a method appropriate to the host cell, as will be apparent to one of skill in the art. A variety of methods for introducing nucleic acids into host cells are known in the art, including, but not limited to, electroporation; transfection employing calcium chloride, rubidium chloride, calcium phosphate, DEAE-dextran, or other substances; microprojectile bombardment; lipofection; and infection (where the vector is an infectious agent).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable host cells include prokaryotes, yeast, mammalian cells, or bacterial cells. Suitable bacteria include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for example, \nE. coli \nor \nBacillus \nspp. Yeast, preferably from the \nSaccharomyces \nspecies, such as \nS. cerevisiae\n, may also be used for production of polypeptides. Various mammalian or insect cell culture systems can also be employed to express recombinant proteins. Baculovirus systems for production of heterologous proteins in insect cells are reviewed by Luckow et al. (\nBio/Technology, \n6:47 (1988)). Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include endothelial cells, COS-7 monkey kidney cells, CV-1, L cells, C127, 3T3, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), human embryonic kidney ceils, HeLa, 293, 293T, and BHK cell lines. Purified polypeptides are prepared by culturing suitable host/vector systems to express the recombinant proteins. For many applications, the small size of many of the polypeptides disclosed herein would make expression in \nE. coli \nas the preferred method for expression. The protein is then purified from culture media or cell extracts.\n\n\n \nProtein Production\n\n\n \n \n \nHost cells are transformed with the herein-described expression or cloning vectors for protein production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences. In the examples shown here, the host cells used for high-throughput protein production (HTPP) and mid-scale production was the HMS174-bacterial strain. The host cells used to produce the proteins of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma)), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma)) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, may of the media described in Ham et al., \nMeth. Enzymol., \n58:44 (1979), Barites et al., \nAnal. Biochem., \n102:255 (1980), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,704, 4,657,866, 4,927,762, 4,560,655, 5,122,469, 6,048,728, 5,672,502, or U.S. Pat. No. RE 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as Gentamycin drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProteins disclosed herein can also be produced using cell-translation systems. For such purposes the nucleic acids encoding the polypeptide must be modified to allow in vitro transcription to produce mRNA and to allow cell-free translation of the mRNA in the particular cell-free system being utilized (eukaryotic such as a mammalian or yeast cell-free translation system or prokaryotic such as a bacterial ceil-free translation system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProteins of the invention can also be produced by chemical synthesis (e.g., by the methods described in \nSolid Phase Peptide Synthesis, \n2nd Edition, The Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill. (1984)). Modifications to the protein can also be produced by chemical synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proteins of the present invention can be purified by isolation/purification methods for proteins generally known in the field of protein chemistry. Non-limiting examples include extraction, recrystallization, salting out (e.g., with ammonium sulfate or sodium sulfate), centrifugation, dialysis, ultrafiltration, adsorption chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, normal phase chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography, get filtration, gel permeation chromatography, affinity chromatography, electrophoresis, countercurrant distribution or any combinations of these. After purification, polypeptides may be exchanged into different buffers and/or concentrated by any of a variety of methods known to the art, including, but not limited to, filtration and dialysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe purified polypeptide is preferably at least 85% pure, or preferably at least 95% pure, and most preferably at least 98% pure. Regardless of the exact numerical value of the purity, the polypeptide is sufficiently pure for use as a pharmaceutical product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA platform manufacturing process was used to prepare anti-PCSK9 Adnectin. The anti-PCSK9 Adnectin is produced in \nEscherichia coli \n(\nE. coli\n). \nE. coli \nBLR (DE3) cells were transformed with expression vector (pET9d/ATI001173) which produces the protein in a soluble form intracellularly. The recombinant strain is grown in stirred tank fermentors. At the end of fermentation the cells are collected, lysed, and clarified in preparation for purification. AT1001173 is a non-his tagged version of ATI001114. The purified anti-PCSK9 Adnectin is conjugated to a 40 kDa branched methoxyPEG using a maleimide linker. The conjugated material is subsequently repurified to remove free PEG, free anti-PCSK9 Adnectin and product related impurities. Quality control testing is performed on the bulk drug substance.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic In Vivo Uses\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the application provides anti-PCSK9 Adnectin useful in the treatment of atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia and other cholesterol related diseases. The application also provides methods for administering anti-PCSK9 Adnectin to a subject. In some embodiments, the subject is a human. In some embodiments, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin are pharmaceutically acceptable to a mammal, in particular a human. A “pharmaceutically acceptable” polypeptide refers to a polypeptide that is administered to an animal without significant adverse medical consequences, such as essentially endotoxin free, or very low endotoxin levels.\n\n\n \nFormulation and Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe application further provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions comprising the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin or fusion proteins thereof described herein, wherein the composition is essentially endotoxin free. Therapeutic formulations comprising anti-PCSK9 Adnectin or fusions thereof are prepared for storage by mixing the described polypeptide having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Osol, A., \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n16th Edition (1980)), in the form of aqueous solutions, lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrans; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as Tween, PLURONIC® or polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled artisan will understand that the dosage of each therapeutic agent will be dependent on the identity of the agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor therapeutic applications, the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin or a fusion protein comprising an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin is administered to a subject, in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. They can be administered intravenously as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, or by subcutaneous routes. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, and excipients are well known and can be determined by those of skill in the art as the clinical situation warrants. Examples of suitable carriers, diluents and/or excipients include: (1) Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline, (2) 0.9% saline (0.9% w/v NaCl), and (3) 5% (w/v) dextrose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method of the present invention can be practiced in vitro, in vivo, or ex vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of anti-PCSK9 Adnectin or a fusion thereof, and one or more additional therapeutic agents, whether co-administered or administered sequentially, may occur as described above for therapeutic applications. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, and excipients for co-administration will be understood by the skilled artisan to depend on the identity of the particular therapeutic agent being administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen present in an aqueous dosage form, rather than being lyophilized, the protein typically will be formulated at a concentration of about 0.1 mg/ml to 100 mg/ml, although wide variation outside of these ranges is permitted. For the treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of anti-PCSK9 Adnectin or a fusion thereof will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the severity and course of the disease, whether the protein is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, the course of previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the protein, and the discretion of the attending physician. The protein is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments.\n\n\n \nFusions of Serum Albumin Binding Adnectin (SABA)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain aspects, the application provides fusion proteins comprising anti-PCSK9 Adnectin fused to a \n10\nFn3 domains that binds to human serum albumin (a Serum Albumin Binding Adnectin (\n10\nFn3 domain) or SABA). Such fusion proteins have extended serum half lives in the presence of albumin relative to the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin alone (e.g., not conjugated to a PK moiety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n10\nFn3 domains are cleared rapidly from circulation via renal filtration and degradation due to their small size of ˜10 kDa (t\n1/2\n=15-45 minutes in mice; 1-3 hours in monkeys). Fusion of a \n10\nFn3 domain, such as an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin, to a second polypeptide comprising a \n10\nFn3 domain that binds specifically to serum albumin, e.g., human serum albumin (HSA), may be used to prolong the t\n1/2 \nof the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the serum half-life of the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin fused to the SABA is increased relative to the serum half-life of the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin when not conjugated to the SABA. In certain embodiments, the serum half-life of the SABA fusion is at least 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500, 1800, 1900, 2000, 2500, or 3000% longer relative to the serum half-life of the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin when not fused to the SABA. In other embodiments, the serum half-life of the SABA fusion is at least 1.5-fold, 2-fold, 2.5-fold, 3-fold, 3.5 fold, 4-fold, 4.5-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 10-fold, 12-fold, 13-fold, 15-fold, 17-fold, 20-fold, 22-fold, 25-fold, 27-fold, 30-fold, 35-fold, 40-fold, or 50-fold greater than the serum half-life of the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin when not fused to the SABA. In some embodiments, the serum half-life of the SABA fusion is at least 10 hours, 15 hours, 20 hours, 25 hours, 30 hours, 35 hours, 40 hours, 50 hours, 60 hours, 70 hours, 80 hours, 90 hours, 100 hours, 110 hours, 120 hours, 130 hours, 135 hours, 140 hours, 150 hours, 160 hours, or 200 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the serum albumin binding portion of the SABA fusion protein binds to HSA with a K\nD \nof less than 3 uM, 2.5 uM, 2 uM, 1.5 uM, 1 uM, 500 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 500 pM, 100 pM. 100 pM, 50 pM or 10 pM. In certain embodiments, the serum albumin binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins bind to HSA with a K\nD \nof less than 3 uM, 2.5 uM, 2 uM, 1.5 uM, 1 uM, 500 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 500 pM, 100 pM. 100 pM, 50 pM or 10 pM at a pH range of 5.5 to 7.4 at 25° C. or 37° C. In some embodiments, the serum albumin binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins bind more tightly to HSA at a pH less than 7.4 as compared to binding at pH 7.4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the SABA fusion molecules described herein are useful for increasing the half-life of anti-PCSK9 Adnectin by creating a fusion between anti-PCSK9 Adnectin and the SABA. Such fusion molecules may be used to treat conditions which respond to the biological activity of PCSK9. The present invention contemplates the use of the SABA fusion molecules in diseases caused by the dysregulation of PCSK9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion may be formed by attaching anti-PCSK9 Adnectin to either end of the SABA molecule, i.e., SABA-anti-PCSK9 Adnectin or anti-PCSK9 Adnectin-SABA arrangements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHSA has a serum concentration of 600 μM and a t\n1/2 \nof 19 days in humans. The extended t\n1/2 \nof HSA has been attributed, in part, to its recycling via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). HSA binds FcRn in a pH-dependent manner after endosomal uptake into endothelial cells; this interaction recycles HSA back into the bloodstream, thereby shunting it away from lysosomal degradation. FcRn is widely expressed and the recycling pathway is thought to be constitutive. In the majority of cell types, most FcRn resides in the intracellular sorting endosome. HSA is readily internalized by a nonspecific mechanism of fluid-phase pinocytosis and rescued from degradation in the lysosome by FcRn. At the acidic pH found in the endosome, HSA's affinity for FcRn increases (5 μM at pH 6.0). Once bound to FcRn, HSA is shunted away from the lysosomal degradation pathway, transcytosed to and released at the cell surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the serum albumin binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins described herein may also bind serum albumin from one or more of monkey, rat, or mouse. In certain embodiments, the HSA binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins described herein bind to rhesus serum albumin (RhSA) or cynomolgous monkey serum albumin (CySA) with a K\nD \nof less than 3 uM, 2.5 uM, 2 uM, 1.5 uM, 1 uM, 500 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 500 pM or 100 pM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the serum albumin binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins described herein bind to domain I and/or domain II of HSA. In one embodiment, the HSA binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins described herein do not bind to domain III of HSA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the serum albumin binding portion of the SABA fusion proteins comprises a sequence having at least 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80% or 85% identity to the wild-type \n10\nFn3 domain (SEQ ID NO: 1). In one embodiment, at least one of the BC, DE, or FG loops is modified relative to the wild-type \n10\nFn3 domain. In another embodiment, at least two of the BC, DE, or FG loops are modified relative to the wild-type \n10\nFn3 domain. In another embodiment, all three of the BC, DE, and FG loops are modified relative to the wild-type \n10\nFn3 domain. In other embodiments, a SABA comprises a sequence having at least 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% identity to any one of the 26 core SABA sequences shown in Table 6 (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 334, 338, 342, 346, and 348-370) or any one of the extended SABA sequences shown in Table 6 (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 420-447, minus the 6×HIS tag).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the serum binding Adnectins based on the \n10\nFn3 scaffold can be defined generally by the following sequence:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 328)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVVAAT(X)\na\nSLLI(X)\nx\nYYRITYGE(X)\nb\nQEFTV(X)\ny\nATI(X)\nc\nDYTI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTVYAV(X)\nz\nISINYRT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the serum binding Adnectins based on the \n10\nFn3 scaffold can be defined generally by the sequence:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 329)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVVAATPTSLLI(X)\nx\nYYRITYGETGGNSPVQEFTV(X)\ny\nATISGLKPGV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDYTITVYAV(X)\nz\nISINYRT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described herein for anti-PCSK9 Adnectins, SEQ ID NOs: 328 and 329 can be defined and applied to SABA molecules in the same way. In exemplary embodiments, the BC, DE, and FG loops as represented by (X)\nx\n, (X)\ny\n, and (X)\nz\n, respectively, are replaced with polypeptides comprising the BC, DE and FG loop sequences from any of the HSA binders shown in Table 6 below (i.e., SEQ ID NOs: 330, 334, 338, 342, 346, and 348-370 in Table 6). In certain embodiments, the BC, DE, or FG loop sequences shown in Table 6 may contain one or more additional residues flanking the N- and/or C-termini. In particular, the BC loop may contain an SW at the N-terminus of the BC loop sequences shown in Table 6 when replacing (X)\nx \nin SEQ ID NO: 328. Similarly, the DE loop may contain a P preceding loop DE and the residue T following loop DE when replacing (X)\ny \nin SEQ ID NO: 328. The FG loop may contain a P following the FG loop when replacing (X)\nz \nin SEQ ID NO: 328. For example, SEQ ID NO: 330 indicates that the BC, DE, and FG loops comprise HSYYEQNS (SEQ ID NO: 638), YSQT (SEQ ID NO: 639), and YGSKYYY (SEQ ID NO: 640), respectively. However, when replacing (X)\nx\n, (X)\ny\n, and (X)\nz \nin SEQ ID NO: 328, i.e., the BC, DE and FG loops, the (X)\nx \nsequence may be SWHSYYEQNS (SEQ ID NO: 641), the (X)\ny \nsequence may be PYSQTT (SEQ ID NO: 642), and the (X)\nz \nsequence may be YGSKYYYP (SEQ ID NO: 643).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a SABA for use in a fusion as described herein may comprise the sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 328 or 329, wherein the BC, DE, and FG loops as represented by (X)\nx\n, (X)\ny\n, and (X)\nz\n, respectively, are replaced with a respective set of specified BC, DE, and FG loops from any of the 26 core SABA sequences (i.e., SEQ ID NOs: 330, 334, 338, 342, 346, and 348-370 in Table 6), or sequences at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to the BC, DE and FG loop sequences of the 26 core SABA sequences. In exemplary embodiments, a SABA as described herein is defined by SEQ ID NO: 329 and has a set of BC, DE and FG loop sequences from any of the 26 core SABA sequences (i.e., SEQ ID NOs: 330, 334, 338, 342, 346, and 348-370 in Table 6), optionally with the N- and/or C-terminal additions to the loop sequences as described above. For example, SABA1 has the core sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 330 and comprises BC, DE, and FG loops as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 331-333, respectively. Therefore, a SABA based on the SABA1 core may comprise SEQ ID NO: 328 or 329, wherein (X)\nx \ncomprises SEQ ID NO: 331, (X)\ny \ncomprises SEQ ID NO: 332, and (X)\nz \ncomprises SEQ ID NO: 333. In some embodiments, the sequences that replace (X)\nx\n, (X)\ny\n, and (X)\nz \ncomprise additional residue(s) on either or both ends of the loops as described above. Similar constructs are contemplated utilizing the set of BC, DE and FG loops from the other SABA core sequences. The scaffold regions of such SABA may comprise anywhere from 0 to 20, from 0 to 15, from 0 to 10, from 0 to 8, from 0 to 6, from 0 to 5, from 0 to 4, from 0 to 3, from 0 to 2, or from 0 to 1 substitutions, conservative substitutions, deletions or additions relative to the scaffold amino acids residues of SEQ ID NO: 1. Such scaffold modifications may be made, so long as the SABA is capable of binding serum albumin, e.g., HSA, with a desired K\nD\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a SABA (e.g., a SABA core sequence or a sequence based thereon as described above) may be modified to comprise an N-terminal extension sequence and/or a C-terminal extension sequence. Exemplary extension sequences are shown in Table 6. For example, SEQ ID NO: 420 designated as SABA1.1 comprises the \ncore SABA\n 1 sequence (SEQ ID NO: 330) with an N-terminal sequence MGVSDVPRDLE (SEQ ID NO: 371, designated as AdNT1), and a C-terminal sequence EIDKPSQ (SEQ ID NO: 380, designated as AdCT1). SABA1.1 further comprises a His6 tag at the C-terminus, however, it should be understood that the His6 tag is completely optional and may be placed anywhere within the N- or C-terminal extension sequences, or may be absent from the sequence all together. Further, any of the exemplary N- or C-terminal extension sequences provided in Table 6 (SEQ ID NO: 371-395), and any variants thereof, can be used to modify any given SABA core sequence provided in Table 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the C-terminal extension sequences (also called “tails”), comprise E and D residues, and may be between 8 and 50, 10 and 30, 10 and 20, 5 and 10, and 2 and 4 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, tail sequences include ED-based linkers in which the sequence comprises tandem repeats of ED. In exemplary embodiments, the tail sequence comprises 2-10, 2-7, 2-5, 3-10, 3-7, 3-5, 3, 4 or 5 ED repeats. In certain embodiments, the ED-based tail sequences may also include additional amino acid residues, such as, for example: EI, EID, ES, EC, EGS, and EGC. Such sequences are based, in part, on known Adnectin tail sequences, such as EIDKPSQ (SEQ ID NO: 380), in which residues D and K have been removed. In exemplary embodiments, the ED-based tail comprises an E, I or EI residues before the ED repeats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the tail sequences may be combined with other known linker sequences (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 396-419 in Table 6) as necessary when designing a SABA fusion molecule.\n\n\n \nConjugation/Linkers\n\n\n \n \n \nSABA fusions may be covalently or non-covalently linked. In some embodiments, a serum albumin binding \n10\nFn3 may be directly or indirectly linked to an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin via a polypeptide linker. Suitable linkers for joining Fn3 domains are those which allow the separate domains to fold independently of each other forming a three dimensional structure that permits high affinity binding to a target molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosure provides a number of suitable linkers that meet these requirements, including glycine-serine based linkers, glycine-proline based linkers, as well as the linker having the amino acid sequence PSTSTST (SEQ ID NO: 416). The Examples described herein demonstrate that Fn3 domains joined via polypeptide linkers retain their target binding function. In some embodiments, the linker is a glycine-serine based linker. These linkers comprise glycine and serine residues and may be between 8 and 50, 10 and 30, and 10 and 20 amino acids in length. Examples include linkers having an amino acid sequence (GS)\n7 \n(SEQ ID NO: 403), G(GS)\n6 \n(SEQ ID NO: 398), and G(GS)\n7\nG (SEQ ID NO: 400). Other linkers contain glutamic acid, and include, for example, (GSE)\n5 \n(SEQ ID NO: 405) and GGSE GGSE (SEQ ID NO: 409). Other exemplary glycine-serine linkers include (GS)\n4 \n(SEQ ID NO: 402), (GGGGS)\n7 \n(SEQ ID NO: 411), (GGGGS)\n5 \n(SEQ ID NO: 412), and (GGGGS)\n3\nG (SEQ ID NO: 413). In some embodiments, the linker is a glycine-proline based linker. These linkers comprise glycine and proline residues and may be between 3 and 30, 10 and 30, and 3 and 20 amino acids in length. Examples include linkers having an amino acid sequence (GP)\n3\nG (SEQ ID NO: 414), (GP)\n5\nG (SEQ ID NO: 415), and GPG. In other embodiments, the linker may be a proline-alanine based linker having between 3 and 30, 10 and 30, and 3 and 20 amino acids in length. Examples of proline alanine based linkers include, for example, (PA)\n3 \n(SEQ ID NO: 417), (PA)\n6 \n(SEQ ID NO: 418) and (PA)\n9 \n(SEQ ID NO: 419). It is contemplated, that the optimal linker length and amino acid composition may be determined by routine experimentation in view of the teachings provided herein. In some embodiments, an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin is linked to a SABA via a polypeptide linker having a protease site that is cleavable by a protease in the blood or target tissue. Such embodiments can be used to release an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin for better delivery or therapeutic properties or more efficient production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional linkers or spacers, may be introduced at the C-terminus of a Fn3 domain between the Fn3 domain and the polypeptide linker. Additional linkers or spacers may be introduced at the N-terminus of a Fn3 domain between the Fn3 domain and the polypeptide linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin may be directly or indirectly linked to a SABA via a polymeric linker. Polymeric linkers can be used to optimally vary the distance between each component of the fusion to create a protein fusion with one or more of the following characteristics: 1) reduced or increased steric hindrance of binding of one or more protein domains when binding to a protein of interest, 2) increased protein stability or solubility, 3) decreased protein aggregation, and 4) increased overall avidity or affinity of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin is linked to a SABA via a biocompatible polymer such as a polymeric sugar. The polymeric sugar can include an enzymatic cleavage site that is cleavable by an enzyme in the blood or target tissue. Such embodiments can be used to release an anti-PCSK9 Adnectin for better delivery or therapeutic properties or more efficient production.\n\n\n \nSummary of Sequences\n\n\n \n \n \nMany of the sequences referenced in “Fusions of Serum Albumin Binding Adnectin (SABA)” and “Conjugation/Linkers” sections above are summarized in Table 6 below. Unless otherwise specified, all N-terminal extensions are indicated with a single underline, all C-terminal tails/extensions are indicated with a double underline, and linker sequences are boxed. Loop regions BC, DE and FG are shaded for each core SABA sequence. As described further above, the modification sequences (e.g., N or C terminal extensions and linkers) can also be used to modify anti-PCSK9 Adnectin molecules.\n\n\n \n

grown at 37° C. overnight. Fresh 5 ml LB medium (50 μg/mL kanamycin) cultures were prepared for inducible expression by \naspiration\n 200 μl from the overnight culture and dispensing it into the appropriate well. The cultures were grown at 37° C. until A\n600 \n0.6-0.9. After induction with 1 mM isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside (IPTG) the culture was expressed for 6 hours at 30° C. and harvested by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 2750 g at 4° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell pellets (in 24-well format) were lysed by resuspension in 450 μl of Lysis buffer (50 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail-EDTA free (Roche), 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM CHAPS, 40 mM Imidazole, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 30 ug/ml DNAse, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, pH 8.0) and shaken at room temperature for 1-3 hours. Lysates were clarified and re-racked into a 96-well format by transfer into a 96-well Whatman GF/D UNIFILTER® fitted with a 96-well, 1.2 ml catch plate and filtered by positive pressure. The clarified lysates were transferred to a 96-well Ni-Chelating Plate that had been equilibrated with equilibration buffer (50 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 40 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0) and was incubated for 5 min. Unbound material was removed by vacuum. The resin was washed 2×0.3 ml/well with Wash buffer #1 (50 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM CHAPS, 40 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0) with each wash removed by vacuum. Prior to elution each well was washed with 50 μl Elution buffer (PBS+20 mM EDTA), incubated for 5 min and this wash was discarded by vacuum. Protein was eluted by applying an additional 100 μl of Elution buffer to each well. After a 30 minute incubation at room temperature the plate(s) were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 200 g and eluted protein is collected in 96-well catch plates containing 5 μl of 0.5M MgCl\n2 \nadded to the bottom of elution catch plate prior to elution.

After induction with 1 mM isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside (IPTG) the culture is grown for 4 hours at 30° C. and is harvested by centrifugation for 30 minutes at ≧10,000 g at 4° C. Cell pellets are frozen at −80° C.

The insoluble fraction is separated by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 23,300 g at 4° C. The insoluble pellet recovered from centrifugation of the lysate is washed with 20 mM sodiumphosphate/500 mM NaCl, pH7.4. The pellet is resolubilized in 6.0M guanidine hydrochloride in 20 mM sodium phosphate/500M NaCl pH 7.4 with sonication followed by incubation at 37 degrees for 1-2 hours. The resolubilized pellet is filtered to 0.45 μm and loaded onto a Histrap column equilibrated with the 20 mM sodium phosphate/500M NaCl/6.0M guanidine pH 7.4 buffer. After loading, the column is washed for an additional 25 CV with the same buffer. Bound protein is eluted with 50 mM Imidazole in 20 mM sodium phosphate/500 mM NaCl/6.0M guan-HCl pH7.4.

The soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 23,300 g at 4° C. The supernatant was clarified via 0.45 μm filter. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a Histrap column (GE) pre-equilibrated with the 20 mM sodium phosphate/500M NaCl pH 7.4. The column was then washed with 25 column volumes of the same buffer, followed by 20 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate/500M NaCl/25 mM Imidazole, pH 7.4 and then 35 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate/500M NaCl/40 mM Imidazole, pH 7.4. Protein was eluted with 15 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate/500M NaCl/500 mM Imidazole, pH 7.4, fractions were pooled based on absorbance at A\n280 \nand were dialyzed against 1×PBS, 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl. pH 8.5 or 50 mM NaOAc; 150 mM NaCl; pH4.5.

Human PCSK9 and Cynomolgus PCSK9 were immobilized on separate channels on one dimension of a ProteOn XPR (Bio-Rad) chip surfaces and exposed to 6 different concentrations of 2013E01 in the other dimension of the same SPR chip surface. This allowed kinetic determination in the absence of regeneration. Duplicate chips were used for kinetic determinations of the Human and Cynomolgus PCSK9 at 25° C. Evaluation of the kinetic parameters was performed using the Langmuir interaction model and constant parameter fitting with the ProteOn Manager software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnder these conditions, anti-PCSK9 Adnectins bound to human PCSK9 with dissociation constants (K\nD\n) ranging from 80 pM to 1.6 nM and to the cyno PCSK9 with dissociation constants (K\nD\n) ranging from 8 nM to 24 nM (Table 7). Association rates were approximately 10\n5 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, coupled with dissociations that were typically 10\n−3\n-10\n−5 \ns\n−1\n. For some Adnectins, the off-rates from human PCSK9 were slow (on the order of 10\n−5 \ns\n1\n), which is close to the limit of detection for SPR technologies so it is possible that these dissociation constant measurements from human PCSK9 are under-estimates.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPR-Determined Kinetic Parameters for Anti-PCSK9 Adnectins\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgainst Directly Immobilized Human and Cyno PCSK9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPCSK9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone ID\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\nk\non \n(M\n−1 \ns\n−1\n)\n\n\nk\noff \n(s\n−1\n)\n\n\nK\nD \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1459D05\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n1.13E+05\n\n\n1.80E−04\n\n\n 1.58 ± 0.176\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013E01\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n7.03 ± 0.1E+05\n\n\n2.42 ± 0.3E−05\n\n\n0.292 ± 0.008\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013E01\n\n\ncyno\n\n\n2.19E+05\n\n\n1.77E−03\n\n\n8.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1922G04\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n5.41E+05\n\n\n5.08E−05\n\n\n0.094 ± 0.009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1922G04\n\n\ncyno\n\n\n4.65E+05\n\n\n7.00E−03\n\n\n15.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2011H05\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n1.18E+05\n\n\n9.76E−06\n\n\n0.079 ± 0.038\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2011H05\n\n\ncyno\n\n\n1.90E+05\n\n\n4.40E−03\n\n\n23.1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2012A04\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n2.59E+05\n\n\n6.47E−05\n\n\n0.251 ± 0.011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2012A04\n\n\ncyno\n\n\n1.95E+05\n\n\n4.75E−03\n\n\n24.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nK\nD \nby BLI\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding characteristics of Adnectins and human PCSK9 were also determined by Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI). Biotinylated human PCSK9 was immobilized onto superstreptavidin sensor tips which were subsequently immersed into wells containing diluted Adnectin for the duration of the association phase. Tips were then immersed into a buffer-only well for observation of Adnectin dissociation. Experiments were performed in a temperature controlled environment at either 25 or 37° C., and the oscillation speed was set at 1500 rpm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding interaction analysis was performed using proprietary software from Fortebio (Fortebio Data Analysis Software version 6.3.0.36). Global fits were performed for all samples, using a 1:1 binding model. The nature of these global fits constrained all values of concentration to a single pair of association and dissociation rates that were themselves constrained to each other. Affinities (K\nD\n), association and dissociation rates were averaged over the various loading levels used in the analysis. Under these conditions, Adnectins bound human PCSK9 with affinities ranging from 200 pM to 7.5 nM, as shown in Table 8 below. Association rates ranged from 10\n4\n-10\n5 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, and coupled with dissociations that were typically 10\n−3\n-10\n−5 \ns\n−1\n.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBLI-Determined Kinetic Parameters for PCSK9 Adnectins\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgainst Human PCSK9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone ID or\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI#\n\n\nk\non \n(M\n−1 \ns\n−1\n)\n\n\nk\noff \n(s\n−1\n)\n\n\nK\nD \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381D04\n\n\n2.66E+05 ± 6.4E+04\n\n\n6.90E−05 ± 6.9E−05\n\n\n0.237 ±\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382D09\n\n\n5.33E+05\n\n\n1.64E−04\n\n\n0.304\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382D05\n\n\n5.05E+05 ± 2.0E+05\n\n\n1.57E−04 ± 4.2E−05\n\n\n0.314 ±\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381B04\n\n\n3.09E+05 ± 2.1E+04\n\n\n1.60E−04 ± 1.6E−04\n\n\n0.527 ±\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382E05\n\n\n4.36E+05 ± 1.6E+05\n\n\n2.50E−04 ± 1.1E−05\n\n\n0.604 ±\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382B09\n\n\n4.51E+05 ± 4.7E+04\n\n\n2.91E−04 ± 4.0E−05\n\n\n0.656 ±\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382H03\n\n\n4.71E+05 ± 1.4E+05\n\n\n5.57E−04 ± 2.3E−04\n\n\n0.677 ±\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382C09\n\n\n3.49E+05\n\n\n2.33E−04\n\n\n0.757\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2971A03\n\n\n5.74E+05\n\n\n4.20E−04\n\n\n0.806\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382G04\n\n\n4.19E+05\n\n\n4.64E−04\n\n\n1.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381G09\n\n\n2.71E+05\n\n\n2.91E−04\n\n\n1.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2451C06\n\n\n3.47E+05 ± 5.4E+04\n\n\n4.35E−04 ± 5.4E+04\n\n\n1.27 ±\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382H10\n\n\n2.88E+05\n\n\n3.82E−04\n\n\n1.40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013E01\n\n\n5.46E+05\n\n\n8.37E−04\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382D03\n\n\n3.54E+05\n\n\n6.63E−04\n\n\n1.53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381F11\n\n\n3.23E+05\n\n\n5.22E−04\n\n\n1.59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2971E02\n\n\n3.55E+05\n\n\n5.55E−04\n\n\n1.78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382H09\n\n\n2.51E+05\n\n\n4.83E−04\n\n\n1.86\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2451H07\n\n\n4.48E+05\n\n\n9.40E−04\n\n\n2.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382B10\n\n\n3.94E+05\n\n\n9.77E−04\n\n\n2.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382C05\n\n\n3.68E+05\n\n\n8.79E−04\n\n\n2.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2971A09\n\n\n3.99E+05\n\n\n1.05E−03\n\n\n2.79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382E03\n\n\n2.20E+05\n\n\n5.96E−04\n\n\n2.94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381H09\n\n\n1.36E+05\n\n\n4.60E−04\n\n\n3.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381B02\n\n\n2.65E+05\n\n\n8.31E−04\n\n\n3.29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381B08\n\n\n2.13E+05\n\n\n9.40E−04\n\n\n4.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382F05\n\n\n2.44E+05\n\n\n1.09E−03\n\n\n4.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1459D05\n\n\n1.49E+05 ± 2.5E+04\n\n\n2.02E−03 ± 2.0E−03\n\n\n14.4 ± 0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI 1091\n\n\n2.863E+05 \n\n\n8.201E−05 \n\n\n0.293\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI001117\n\n\n1.451E+05 \n\n\n5.074E−05 \n\n\n0.554\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI001057\n\n\n5.325E+05 \n\n\n1.403E−04 \n\n\n0.255\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI001119\n\n\n8.190E+04 \n\n\n4.450E−04 \n\n\n5.296\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI001168\n1\n \n\n\n5.829E+05 \n\n\n3.335E−04 \n\n\n0.586\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI001175\n2\n \n\n\n6.558E+05 \n\n\n3.522E−04 \n\n\n0.543\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI 1081\n\n\n8.29E+05 ± 8.1E+05\n\n\n3.49E−04 ± 3E−04  \n\n\n0.479 ±\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI891\n\n\n1.08E+05\n\n\n4.03E−04\n\n\n3.56\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI1114\n\n\n8.072E+04 \n\n\n3.952E−04 \n\n\n4.876\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI1174\n\n\n1.265E+05 \n\n\n9.012E−04 \n\n\n7.397\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nATI001168 is a deimmunized version of 1922G04 having an R23E substitution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2\nATI001175 is a deimmunized version of 1922G04 having an R23D substitution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSolution Phase Affinity\n\n\nKinExA\n\n\n \n \n \nThe solution affinities of ATI001081 and AT1001174 for human PCSK9 were measured using a Kinetic Exclusion Assay (KinExA).

The difference in observed enthalpies (−3.3 kcal/mol) for the two Adnectins suggests that ATI001174 incurs an order of magnitude reduction in its affinity for PCSK9 due to PEGylation that is at least partially offset by the corresponding difference in entropy (−10.4 cal/mol·K).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nΔS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStoichi-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(cal/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nometry\n\n\nK\nA\n \n\n\nK\nD\n \n\n\nΔH\n\n\nmol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdnectin\n\n\n(N)\n\n\n(M\n−1\n)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(kcal/mol)\n\n\n° C.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI001081\n\n\n0.926\n\n\n7.1E8 ± 2.1E8\n\n\n1.4 ± 0.4\n\n\n−26.6 ± 0.2\n\n\n−45.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(±30%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI001174*\n\n\n0.857\n\n\n7.5E8 ± 1.5E8\n\n\n1.3 ± 0.2\n\n\n−29.9 ± 0.1\n\n\n−55.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Average of 3 experiments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThree FRET based assays were developed to determine the binding affinity and potency of PCSK9-binding Adnectins, adapted from the general method described previously by Maio et al. (See, Miao, B. et al., \nMeth. Enzymol., \n357:180-188 (2002)). The PCSK9:EGFA FRET assay (\nFIGS. 2 and 3\n) measured the inhibition of PCSK9 binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain (EGFA domain), using recombinant human PCSK9 expressed in baculovirus and a synthetic 40-mer EGFA peptide (biotinylated). EGFA has been shown to represent the key interacting domain of LDLR with PCSK9 (Kwon, H. J. et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n105(6):1820-1825 (2008)). This assay used a PCSK9 C-terminal domain binding mAb (mAb 4H5) labeled with Eu-chelate to provide FRET interaction with biotinylated EGFA through the streptavidin/allophycocyanin fluorophore complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo other related, PCSK9-dependent FRET assays were also constructed. In one of these assays, competitive displacement by Adnectins of biotinylated Adnectins-AT1000972 or AT1001125 is quantified (AT1000972 results shown in \nFIG. 4\n). AT1000972 is a biotinylated version of 1459D05 and AT1001125 is a biotinylated version of ATI001081. In another assay, direct binding of an Adnectin (his-tagged) to PCSK9 is assayed using anti-his6 antibody (\nFIG. 5\n). In each of the FRET assays, human PCSK9 concentration was either 1 or 5 nM. In some cases cynomolgus monkey PCSK9 replaced hPCSK9. Table 11 summarizes the overall data from these three FRET assays.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Adnectin Testing Data for 3 FRET Assays Using Human PCSK9 and 1 Assay for Cyno PCSK9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDirect binding\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhPCSK9:EGFA\n\n\nhPCSK9:ATI000972\n\n\nhPCSK9:ATI001125\n\n\nhPCSK9\n\n\ncPCSK9:EGFA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone ID\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1459D05\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n14\n\n\nnd\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n2300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1784F03\n\n\n2\n\n\n1.9\n\n\nnd\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n106\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1813E02\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n2.4\n\n\nnd\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n118\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1923B02\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n3.2\n\n\nnd\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n53.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1922G04\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n2.0\n\n\nnd\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n26.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2012A04\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n1.2\n\n\nnd\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n70.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2011H05\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n1.4\n\n\nnd\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n17.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013E01\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n1.8\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.90\n\n\n12.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1922G04 (R25D)\n\n\n2.5\n\n\nnd\n\n\nnd\n\n\nnd\n\n\n48.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1922G04 (R25E)\n\n\n3.5\n\n\nnd\n\n\nnd\n\n\nnd\n\n\n58.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382E03\n\n\n2.4\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n10.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382E05\n\n\n2.8\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n12.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381B08\n\n\n2.6\n\n\nnd\n\n\n1\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n27.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381B02\n\n\n2.5\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n8.4\n\n\n9.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381B04\n\n\n2.4\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n17.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2451H07\n\n\n0.2\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n13.2\n\n\n27.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381D04\n\n\n2.9\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381F11\n\n\n4\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n<1\n\n\n26.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381G09\n\n\n3.1\n\n\nnd\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n25.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2381H09\n\n\n3.4\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n20.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382B09\n\n\n3.8\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n37.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382B10\n\n\n3\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n18.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382C05\n\n\n4\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n27.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382C09\n\n\n3.5\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n23.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382D03\n\n\n3.3\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n11.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382D09\n\n\n2.6\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n13.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382F05\n\n\n2.4\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n14.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382G04\n\n\n2.9\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n20.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382H03\n\n\n3.4\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n19.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382H09\n\n\n0.9\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n17.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382H10\n\n\n2.6\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n18.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2382D02\n\n\n4.5\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n5.3\n\n\n57.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2451C06\n\n\n1.2\n\n\nnd\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n24.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCell-Based Inhibition of PCSK9 Activity by PCSK9 Adnectins\n\n\nDiI-LDL Uptake Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nCell culture methods were developed to assay the ability of Adnectins to inhibit PCSK9 activity on the LDLR. An effective means of measuring cellular LDLR activity is through an assay for uptake of labeled LDL, as shown by Lagace, T. A. et al. (\nJ. Clin. Invest., \n116(11):2995-3005 (2006)). The work further adapted a method for LDLR functional activity using fluorescent-labeled LDL (DiI-LDL) uptake adapted from a method originally shown by Teupser et al. (\nBiochim. Biophys. Acta, \n1303(3):193-198 (1996)). Cells were first preincubated with recombinant human PCSK9 protein (10 ug/mL, 135 nM) in the presence and absence of Adnectins as shown. After 2 hours, the remaining LDLR activity was assayed by incubation with DiI-LDL (5 ug) for 2 hours followed by an assessment of accumulated DiI-LDL inside the cells using high content fluorescent micrscopy and image analysis (Cellomics). \nFIG. 6\n shows the effect of several Adnectins to inhibit PCSK9 activity and restore LDLR functional activity in HepG2 cells. In this assay, the Adnectins inhibited PCSK9 and restored DiI-LDL uptake with the following EC\n50 \nvalues: 1459D05, EC\n50\n=190 nM; 1784F03, 210 nM; 2012A04, 130 nM; 2013E01, 160 nM.\n\n\n \nLDLR Depletion Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nHepG2 cells were grown in complete media, Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, ATCC®) with 10% FBS (Hyclone), and split twice a week with Trypsin 0.25% (Invitrogen). To induce upregulation of the LDL receptor, cells were incubated overnight in LPDS media [RPMI (ATCC) with 5% lipoprotein deficient serum (Intracel), 100 nM superstation (BMS) and 50 uM Sodium Mevalonate (Sigma)]. The following day, cells were trypsinized briefly with Trypsin 0.05% (Invitrogen) and resuspended at 2×10̂6 cells per ml then aliquoted at 100 ul per well in a V-bottom 96 well plate. In the meantime, Adnectins were pre-incubated with PCSK9 in LPDS media for an hour at 37° C. After an hour, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 100 ul of Adnectin/PCSK9 mix and incubated overnight at 37° C. The following day cells were labeled with an antibody for LDL receptor (BAF 2148 from R&D), followed by a phycoerythrin (PE)-streptavidin conjugated secondary antibody (BD554061 from BD Pharmingen) and analyzed by FACS on the FACS Cantoll (BD).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n10 nM of PCSK9 was pre-incubated for an hour with increasing concentration of Adnectin candidates before being added to HepG2 cells. After overnight incubation LDLR level were measured by FACS and the percentage of inhibition of PCSK9-induced LDLR depletion was graphed and EC50 determined using PRISM. 1459D05 appears to be the least potent candidate among those tested and did not reach the maximum inhibition whereas the other clones reach 150-200% maximum inhibition of PCSK9 (\nFIG. 7\n).

One mouse model overexpresses human PCSK9 levels markedly and exhibits hypercholesterolemia as a result (Lagace, T. A. et al., J. Clin. Invest., 116(11):2995-3005 (2006)). The other mouse model is a genomic hPCSK9 transgenic (BAC-transgenic) which is regulated in liver similarly to mouse PCSK9 and which expresses near human-normal levels of hPCSK9 in plasma. For these studies, ELISA assays using species-specific, site-specific labeled antibodies and Adnectins were developed to measure plasma unbound human PCSK9 levels (i.e., hPCSK9 not complexed with the administered Adnectin) as an index of target engagement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle doses of PCSK9 Adnectins in PEGylated form were injected intraperitoneally into the overexpresser hPCSK9 transgenic mouse model at the doses shown in \nFIGS. 8-9\n. PBS or dialysate samples were also injected as controls. Adnectin 1459D05-PEG (100 mg/kg intraperitoneal) treatment rapidly decreased plasma total cholesterol (\nFIG. 8A\n) and LDL-C (not shown) to >35% below baseline in 4 hr. Cholesterol levels in Adnectin treated mice remained below control levels throughout the 48 hr test period. This was accompanied by a sharp decrease in circulating levels of unbound hPCSK9 in the Adnectin treated transgenic mice (\nFIG. 8B\n). Western blots of liver taken at 6 hours in parallel studies showed that LDLR protein levels were increased ˜2-fold in Adnectin-treated mice (not shown). In further studies in this transgenic mouse model, ATI001114 was administered at 10 or 60 mg/kg. A marked, dose-dependent, rapid lowering of plasma cholesterol was seen, concomitant with a dose-related reduction in unbound hPCSK9 levels (\nFIG. 9\n). These studies represent in vivo proof-of-concept for PCSK9 Adnectins as effective cholesterol lowering agents in a hypercholesterolemic human transgenic PCSK9 mouse model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo studies were conducted in the normal expresser hPCSK9 transgenic mouse model. Injection of single doses of 1459D05-PEG or ATI001114 (5 mg/kg) resulted in rapid and strong decreases in unbound hPCSK9 levels in plasma (\nFIG. 10\n). This pharmacodynamic effect on unbound hPCSK9 was more pronounced following ATI001114 compared to 1459D05-PEG, with greater magnitude and duration of effect observed for the higher affinity/potency Adnectin. A further study of dose dependency revealed that that the 50% inhibitory dose (ED50) was less than 0.1 mg/kg for ATI001114 at time points from 3 to 48 hours post-dose, as seen in \nFIG. 11\n. These findings in a normal expresser transgenic mouse model show that PCSK9 inhibitory Adnectins exhibit marked, affinity-dependent and dose-dependent effects on pharmacodynamic endpoints which are correlated with LDLR regulation and LDL cholesterol lowering.\n\n\n \nCynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\n \n \n \nA pharmacodynamic study was conducted in normal lean cynomolgus monkeys. Adnectin ATI001114 was administered to cynos intravenously at 5 mg/kg, and plasma samples were collected at time intervals for LDL-C assay and pharmacokinetic assessment. A single dose of ATI001114 rapidly lowered plasma LDL-C levels to >50% vs. baseline (or vs. PBS control group) within 48 hours (\nFIG. 12\n). The duration of effect on LDL-C continued for more than a week with eventual return to baseline by 3 wk. This effect was observed with both two-branched and four-branched 40 kDa PEGylated forms of the anti-PCSK9 Adnectin (ATI001114 and ATI001211, respectively). ATI001211 is ATI001081 with a 40 kDa 4-branched NOF PEG moiety. Total cholesterol showed a similar pattern but no effect on HDL or other metabolic parameter was observed (not shown). Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the plasma half-life was approximately 80-120 hrs, consistent with the pharmacodynamics of LDL lowering in the cynos. These findings indicate that a PCSK9 Adnectin is efficacious and fast-acting with rapid, robust, specific effects on LDL-C lowering in cynomolgus monkey model.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nIn Vitro and In Vivo Pharmacological Evaluation of the PCSK9 Adnectin-Fc Fusion Protein, PRD460\n\n\nProduction of PRD460\n\n\n \n \n \nA vector encoding PRD460 was transfected into HEK-293 6E cells using polyethylenimine (PEI). The cells were grown at 37° C. for 5 days with 80% humidification and 5% CO\n2\n. The cells were then pelleted, the supernatant was passed through a 0.22 um filter and then loaded onto to a ProteinA column. The column was washed with PBS and the protein was eluted with 20 mM Gylcine, 150 mM NaCl pH 2.8. The eluted protein was concentrated and passed over a superdex200 column in 50 mM MES, 100 mM NaCl pH 5.8.\n\n\n \nPRD460 K\nD \nby SPR\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding characteristics were characterized by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Anti-human antibody was immobilized on a BIACORE® chip, and PRD460 (sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 322) was captured on the chip surface. Varying concentrations of hPCSK9 were placed into the flow solution using MgCl\n2 \n(3 M) for chip regeneration between cycles. For comparison, ATI-1081 was captured on an anti-His antibody immobilized on a BIACORE® chip. Duplicate experiments for PRD460 were performed on different days. Kinetic determinations were performed at 25° C. Evaluation of the kinetic parameters was performed using the 1:1 Binding algorithm on the BIACORE® Evaluation software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnder these conditions, ATI-1081 bound to human PCSK9 with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 6.7 nM at 25° C. and PRD460 bound to human PCSK9 with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 3.29+/−0.55 nM at 25° C. (Table 13). The off-rate determinations using this assay format may be artificially limited by the off-rate of the captured ligand from the immobilized capture antibody, thus the assay format using direct immobilization of PCSK9 is a more accurate reflection of dissociation constant (K\nD\n) for ATI-1081.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKinetic Parameters for PRD460 and ATI-1081\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgainst Captured Human PCSK9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nka (1/Ms)\n\n\nkd (1/s)\n\n\nKD (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRD460\n\n\n3.75 +/− 0.7E+04\n\n\n1.21 +/− 0.05E−04\n\n\n3.29 +/− 0.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI-1081\n\n\n3.65E+04\n\n\n2.45E−04\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPCSK9 Binding FRET Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based assays were used to determine the competitive binding potency of PRD460 and other Adnectins to hPCSK9. The PCSK9:EGFA FRET assay measures the binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR, using a soluble epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain-A (EGFA) peptide and recombinant human PCSK9. The PCSK9:ATI972 FRET assay measures competitive displacement by Adnectins of the biotinylated Adnectin, ATI-972, from PCSK9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the PCSK9:EGFA FRET assay (at 5 nM PCSK9), PRD460 completely and potently displaced EGFA from the PCSK9 binding site with EC50=0.7 nM (\nFIG. 1\n, left panel). PRD460 was more potent in this assay than either ATI-1174 (EC50=1.9 nM) or ATI-1081 (EC50=3.7 nM) (\nFIG. 14\n). The greater apparent potency of PRD460 in this assay may be explained by bivalent (2:1) binding of Adnectin PRD460 to PCSK9 (theoretically) compared to monovalent (1:1) binding by ATI-1081 and ATI-1174.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the PCSK9:ATI-972 FRET assay (at 5 nM human PCSK9), PRD460 inhibited with EC50=0.3 nM, compared to 0.8 nM for ATI-1114 and 2.8 nm for ATI-1081 (\nFIG. 15\n). These findings indicate that PRD460 potently displaced the biotinylated Adnectin ATI-972 from its binding site on PCSK9. The higher potency of PRD460 relative to ATI-1081 and ATI-1174 is consistent with bivalent binding by PRD460.\n\n\n \nInhibition of PCSK9-Induced LDLR Depletion in HepG2 Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman PCSK9 promotes the depletion of LDLR from the surface of HepG2 cells. Pre-incubation of PCSK9 with PCSK9 Adnectins inhibits PCSK9 binding to LDLR and prevents the depletion of LDLR from the cell surface. This assay was used to measure the potency of ATI-1081, ATI-1174 and PRD460 to inhibit PCSK9 induced depletion of LDLR from the cell surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA dilution series of PCSK9 Adnectins were pre-incubated with 10 nM human PCSK9 for 1 hr at 37 degrees, the pre-incubated mixture was added to HepG2 cells, and the cells were incubated for 24 hours. Following this incubation, the level of LDLR on HepG2 cells was measured using FACS analysis. The percentage of inhibition of PCSK9-induced LDLR depletion was calculated and graphed (\nFIG. 15\n). In this assay ATI-1081, ATI-1174, and PRD460 inhibited PCSK9 with comparable EC50's (9 nM, 8 nM and 6 nM respectively) although a leftward-shift of the response curve was consistently observed for PRD460. These EC50's represent the limit of the assay.\n\n\n \nPCSK9 Cell Entry Assay in HepG2 Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nPCSK9 binding to the LDLR on the surface of hepatocytes results in co-internalization of the LDLR-PCSK9 complex during LDLR endocytosis, leading to enhanced degradation of the LDLR. A cell-based assay was developed to measure LDLR-dependent cellular entry of fluorescent PCSK9. Human PCSK9 was covalently labeled using the fluorophore ALEXA FLUOR®-647(AF647). PCSK9-AF647 was incubated with HepG2 cells with or without PCSK9-Adnectins and the intracellular fluorescence was quantified by high content fluorescent microscopy and image analysis (Cellomics). Dependence of PCSK9-AF647 cell entry on LDLR endocytosis was established in preliminary experiments. HepG2 cells were incubated with 10 nM PCSK9-AF647 and varying levels of Adnectins for 4 hrs at 37 degrees. In this assay, potent inhibition of PCSK9-AF647 intracellular fluorescence was observed for PRD460 (EC50=6 nM) as well as for ATI-1174 (EC50=10 nM) (\nFIG. 16\n). These findings indicate that Adnectin PRD460 and ATI-1174 effectively blocked the binding of PCSK9 to cell surface LDLR in a human hepatic-derived cell line in culture, thereby reducing the internalization of PCSK9-AF647 during LDLR endocytosis.\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Transgenic Mouse Study\n\n\n \n \n \nIn vivo studies were conducted in the normal expresser hPCSK9 transgenic mouse model. Binding of Adnectins to PCSK9 in the plasma is predicted to result in a decrease in the measured amount of unbound (free) circulating PCSK9. The decrease in unbound PCSK9 is the initial pharmacodynamic event which results in inhibition of the PCSK9-LDLR interaction and in LDL cholesterol lowering. Administration of single doses of PRD460 (i.p. doses from 0.6 to 18 mg/kg) to the transgenic mice resulted in rapid, strong decreases in plasma unbound hPCSK9 levels (\nFIG. 17\n). Dose-dependent decreases in unbound PCSK9 were observed with ED50<0.6 mg/kg at the 3 hr time point. These findings in the normal expresser human PCSK9 transgenic mouse model show that PRD460 binds strongly and potently to circulating hPCSK9 in vivo.\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Pharmacodynamics in Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmacodynamic effects of PCSK9 Adnectin PRD460 were evaluated in normal lean cynomolgus monkeys. PRD460 was administered to monkeys by i.v. dosing at 15 mg/kg, and plasma samples were collected at time intervals over 4 wks for the assay of LDL-C and free PCSK9 levels. A single dose of PRD460 rapidly lowered plasma LDL-C levels in the monkeys, reaching an average maximum effect of 42% of baseline LDL-C (58% reduction; n=3 monkeys) by \nday\n 3 after dosing (\nFIG. 18\n). LDL-C levels were reduced by 50% or more for a week at this dose, remaining significantly below baseline for 3 wks and returning to baseline by 4 wks. Total cholesterol showed a similar pattern but no effect on HDL was observed (not shown). Treatment with PRD460 caused an immediate drop to near zero (below the lower limit of quantitation) in the unbound, free form of plasma PCSK9 (\nFIG. 18\n). The free PCSK9 levels remained near the lower limits of detection for several days then gradually returned to baseline levels by the end of 4 wks, consistent with a cause/effect relationship with plasma LDL-C. The data indicate that plasma LDL lowering mirrored the drop in free PCSK9 levels, consistent with PCSK9 inhibition regulating LDLR function following treatment with PRD460 in vivo. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the plasma half-life of Adnectin PRD460 was approximately 70 hrs in this cynomolgus monkey study. These findings indicate that a PCSK9 Adnectin-Fc fusion protein is highly efficacious and fast-acting with robust, specific, and long-lasting effects on LDL-C lowering in the cynomolgus monkey model.\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Pharmacological Evaluation of the Unmodified PCSK9 Adnectin, ATI-1081\n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition to modified Adnectins containing a PK moiety (e.g., PEGylated and Fc-fusion Adnectins), an unmodified (“naked”) PCSK9 Adnectin can also be administered. Strategies for unmodified PCSK9 Adnectin treatment include more frequent dosing to accommodate the shorter PK half-life, or using an extended release subcutaneous formulation to increase the length of the absorption phase and extend the pharmacodynamic effect. Many such formulations can be envisioned including, as a simple example, propylene glycol/PBS solutions to delay the rate of absorption and increase the time of exposure to the Adnectin in the circulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe unmodified Adnectin ATI-1081 was administered to cynomolgus monkeys i.v. at 10 mg/kg in PBS vehicle. ATI-1114 (PEGylated version of the same Adnectin) was also administered at 1 mg/kg in PBS as a comparator. ATI-1081 elicited a rapid, transient inhibition of unbound circulating PCSK9 levels. Within 30 minutes the extent of initial inhibition approached 100% (below the limits of quantitation) before returning to baseline several hours later (\nFIG. 19\n). Concurrently, a trend to lower LDL-C levels was observed over the first 24 hrs in the ATI-1081 treated monkeys (\nFIG. 20\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe unmodified Adnectin ATI-1081 was also administered to the normal expresser hPCSK9 transgenic mice in a simple extended release subcutaneous formulation using 50:50 propylene glycol:PBS vehicle (PG vehicle) compared to PBS vehicle. This formulation is expected to modestly delay the rate of Adnectin absorption and increase the exposure time to ATI-1081 in the circulation, thus improving the pharmacodynamic response. Administration (intraperitoneal) of ATI-1081 at 1 mg/kg in PBS vehicle resulted in ˜50% lowering of unbound plasma PCSK9 at 3 hr, compared to >85% lowering for ATI-1114 at 0.3 mg/kg (\nFIG. 21\n). In a second experiment in the transgenic mice, ATI-1081 administered by subcutaneous injection in PG vehicle resulted in nearly equivalent decreases in unbound LDL compared to ATI-1174, with an improved duration of effect over the first 6 hrs of the study (\nFIG. 22\n). These findings indicate that the unmodified PCSK9 Adnectin ATI-1081 when administered subcutaneously in a simple extended release vehicle bound to the target human PCSK9 in vivo and elicited the initial pharmacodynamic response. The time dependency of the response was consistent with extended release prolonging the duration of effect for the unmodified PCSK9 Adnectin.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nSerum Albumin-Binding Adnectins (SABA)\n\n\nExample 5A\n\n\nScreening and Selection of Candidate Serum Albumin-Binding Adnectin\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n \n \n \nA selection technique known as PROfusion (see e.g., Roberts et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n94(23):12297-12302 (1997) and WO 2008/066752) was applied to a DNA library with variable regions designed into the BC, DE and FG loops of \n10\nFn3. A random library of greater than 10\n13 \nmolecules was created from this design, and selection pressure was applied against a biotinylated form of HSA to isolate candidate serum albumin-binding Adnectin (SABA) with desirable binding properties.\n\n\n \nHigh Throughput Protein Production (HTTP) Process\n\n\n \n \n \nThe various HSA binding Adnectins were purified using a high throughput protein production process (HTPP). Selected binders were cloned into pET9d vector containing a HIS6 tag and transformed into \nE. coli \nBL21(DE3)\np\nLysS cells. Transformed cells were inoculated in 5 ml LB medium containing 50 μg/mL Kanamycin in a 24-well format and grown at 37° C. overnight. Fresh 5 ml LB medium (50 μg/mL Kanamycin) cultures were prepared for inducible expression by aspirating 200 μl from the overnight culture and dispensing it into the appropriate well. The cultures were grown at 37° C. until A\n600 \n0.6-0.9. After induction with 1 mM isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside (IPTG), the culture was grown for another 4 hours at 30° C. and harvested by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 3220×g at 4° C. Cell Pellets were frozen at −80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell pellets (in 24-well format) were lysed by resuspension in 450 μl of Lysis buffer (50 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail-EDTA free (Roche), 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM CHAPS, 40 mM Imidazole, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 30 ug/ml DNAse, 2 ug/ml aprotonin, pH 8.0) and shaken at room temperature for 1 hour. Lysates were clarified and re-racked into a 96-well format by transfer into a 96-well Whatman GF/D UNIFILTER® fitted with a 96-well, 650 μl catch plate and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 200×g. The clarified lysates were transferred to a 96-well Ni-Chelating Plate that had been equilibrated with equilibration buffer (50 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM CHAPS, 40 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0) and incubated for 5 min. Unbound material was removed. The resin was washed 2×0.3 ml/well with Wash buffer #1 (50 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM CHAPS, 40 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0). Next the resin was washed with 3×0.3 ml/well with PBS. Prior to elution each well was washed with 50 μl Elution buffer (PBS+20 mM EDTA), incubated for 5 min and this wash discarded by vacuum. Protein was eluted by applying an additional 100 ul of Elution buffer to each well. After 30 minute incubation at room temperature the plate(s) were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 200×g and eluted protein collected in 96-well catch plates containing 5 μl of 0.5M MgCl\n2 \naffixed to the bottom of the Ni-plates. Eluted protein was quantified using a BCA Protein assay with SGE (control Adnectin) as the protein standard. The SGE Adnectin is a wild-type \n10\nFn3 domain (SEQ ID NO: 1) in which integrin binding domain (amino acids RGD at positions 78-80) have been replaced with SGE.\n\n\n \nHSA, RhSA and MuSA Direct Binding ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nFor assaying direct binders to HSA, MaxiSorp plates (Nunc International, Rochester, N.Y.) were coated with 10 ug/mL HSA (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) in PBS at 4° C. overnight followed by blocking in casein block buffer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) for 1-3 hours at room temperature. For single-point screening assays, purified HTPP Adnectin were diluted 1:20 in casein block buffer and allowed to bind to HSA in each well for 1 hour at room temperature. For dose response assays, concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM up to 1 μM were used. After washing in PBST to remove unbound Adnectins, anti-His mAb-HRP conjugate (R&D Systems, MN) diluted 1:2500 in casein block buffer was added to the bound His-tagged Adnectin for 1 hour at room temperature. Excess conjugate was removed by washing with PBST and bound Adnectins detected using TMB detection reagents (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \nAggregation Measurement by Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography\n\n\n \n \n \nSize exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on the SABAs resulting from the HTPP. SEC of HTPP derived material was performed using a \nSUPERDEX®\n 200 5/150 or \nSUPERDEX®\n 75 5/150 column (GE Healthcare) on an Agilent 1100 or 1200 HPLC system with UV detection at A\n214 \nnm and A\n280 \nnm and with fluorescence detection (excitation=280 nm, emission=350 nm). A buffer of 100 mM sodium sulfate, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.8 at appropriate flow rate of the SEC column employed. Gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) were used for molecular weight calibration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the SEC on the HTPP purified SABAs were shown to be predominantly monomeric and eluted in the approximate range of 10 kDa vs. globular Gel Filtration standards (BioRad).\n\n\n \nIdentification of Candidate Serum Albumin-Binding Adnectin (SABA)\n\n\n \n \n \nAs a result of the screening for HSA/RhSA/MuSA binding and biophysical criteria, four unique serum albumin-binding Adnectins (SABA) were identified and chosen to have their half-lives evaluated in mice. In order to carry out in vitro and in vivo characterization, midscales were undertaken for the four SABAs. Table 6 provides the sequences of twenty-six unique SABA core sequences identified from PROfusion, designated as SABA 1-26. SABA4 had a scaffold mutation that was fixed prior to midscaling. The scaffold-perfect version of SABA4 is SABAS. SABA4 and SABAS have identical sequences in the BC, DE, and FG loops.\n\n\n \nExample 5B\n\n\nProduction and Formulation of Candidate SABAs Midscale Protein Production of SABAs\n\n\n \n \n \nThe selected SABAs described in Example 5A, followed by the His\n6\ntag, were cloned into a pET 9d vector and expressed in \nE. coli \nBL21(DE3)pLysS cells (see Table 6 for each His-tagged SABA sequence designated SABA1.1, SABA2.1, SABA3.1, and SABA5.1). 20 ml of an inoculum culture (generated from a single plated colony) was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 μg/mL Kanamycin. The culture was grown at 37° C. until A\n600 \n0.6-1.0. After induction with 1 mM isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside (IPTG) the culture was grown for another 4 hours at 30° C. and harvested by centrifugation for 30 minutes at ≧10,000×g at 4° C. Cell Pellets were frozen at −80° C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 mL of lysis buffer (20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail-EDTA free (Roche), pH 7.4) using an ULTRA-TURRAX® homogenizer (IKA works) on ice. Cell lysis was achieved by high pressure homogenization (≧18,000 psi) using a Model M-110S MICROFLUIDIZER®(Microfluidics). The soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 23,300×g at 4° C. The supernatant was clarified via 0.45 μm filter. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a HISTRAP® column (GE) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4. The column was then washed with 25 column volumes of 20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4, followed by 20 column volumes of 20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 25 mM imidazole pH 7.4, and then 35 column volumes of 20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 40 mM imidazole pH 7.4. Protein was eluted with 15 column volumes of 20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 500 mM imidazole pH 7.4, fractions pooled based on absorbance at A\n280 \nand dialyzed against 1×PBS, 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl pH 8.5 or 50 mM NaOAc; 150 mM NaCl; pH 4.5. Any precipitate was removed by filtering at 0.22 μm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMidscale expression and purification yielded highly pure and active Adnectins that were expressed in a soluble form and purified from the soluble fraction of the bacterial cytosol. SEC analysis on a \nSUPERDEX®\n 200 or \nSUPERDEX®\n 75 10/30GL in a mobile phase of 100 mM NaPO\n4\n, 100 mM NaSO\n4\n, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.8 (GE Healthcare) demonstrated predominantly monomeric Adnectins.\n\n\n \nFormulation of SABA1.2\n\n\n \n \n \nOne specific SABA, SABA1.2 (SEQ ID NO: 411), was chosen for a preliminary formulation screen. SABA1.2 comprises an (ED)\n5 \nextension on the “\ncore\n 1” sequence of \n10\nFn3 (see SEQ ID NO: 421 in Table 6). For SABA1.2, a stable formulation of 10 mM succinic acid, 8% sorbitol, 5% glycine at pH 6.0 and at a product concentration of 5 mg/mL was identified. In this formulation the protein melting temperature was 75° C. as determined by Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a protein concentration of 1.25 mg/mL. The formulation provided satisfactory physical and chemical stability at 4° C. and 25° C., with an initial aggregate level at 1.2%. After one month of stability, the level of aggregation was very low (1.6% at 4° C. and 3.8% at 25° C.). The protein was also stable in this formulation after five cycles of freeze-thaw as transitioned from −80° C. and −20° C. to ambient temperature. In addition, in this formulation SABA1.2 was soluble to at least 20 mg/mL protein concentration at 4° C. and ambient temperature with no precipitation or increase in aggregation.\n\n\n \nExample 5C\n\n\nBiophysical Characterization of Candidate SABAs\n\n\nSize Exclusion Chromatography\n\n\n \n \n \nStandard size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on the candidate SABAs resulting from the midscale process. SEC of midscaled material was performed using a \nSUPERDEX®\n 200 10/30 or on a \nSUPERDEX®\n 75 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) on an Agilent 1100 or 1200 HPLC system with UV detection at A\n214 \nnm and A\n280 \nnm and with fluorescence detection (excitation=280 nm, emission=350 nm). A buffer of 100 mM sodium sulfate, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.8 at appropriate flow rate of the SEC column employed. Gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) were used for molecular weight calibration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the SEC on the midscaled purified SABAs showed predominantly monomeric Adnectin and elution in the approximate range of 10 kDa vs. globular Gel Filtration standards (BioRad) as showed.\n\n\n \nThermostability\n\n\n \n \n \nDifferential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses of the midscaled SABAs were performed to determine their respective T\nm\n's. A 1 mg/ml solution was scanned in a N-DSC II calorimeter (calorimetry Sciences Corp) by ramping the temperature from 5° C. to 95° C. at a rate of 1 degree per minute under 3 atm pressure. The data was analyzed vs. a control run of the appropriate buffer using a best fit using Orgin Software (OrginLab Corp).

In addition, binding to albumin was carried out under various pH conditions ranging from pH 5.5 to pH 7.4. HSA-binding Adnectins SABA2.1, SABA3.1, SABA4.1, and SABA1.1 cross reacted with RhSA but did not cross react with MuSA. SABA2 and SABA4 binding is pH sensitive whereas clone SABA3 demonstrated pH resistance binding to HSA down to pH 6.0. SABA1.1 fits biochemical criteria for pH resistance and affinity/kinetics down to pH 5.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDomain mapping was determined by BIACORE®. Selected SABA clones purified from HTPP and/or midscaled material were determined by capturing HSA or a construct consisting of just HSA-domain I & II or HSA-domain III on the surface of a Biasensor CMS chip and flowing a concentration series of the SABAs over both the reference flow cell and the captured albumins. Clones SABA2 & SABA1 bound to HSA and the HSA-domain I-II construct but not the HSA-domain III construct.

HSA was injected into the tail vein of approximately 6 week old Ncr nude female mice at a 20 mg/kg (\nFIG. 23A\n) and 50 mg/kg dose (\nFIG. 23B\n), and the concentration of HSA in blood samples taken at intervals post-injection was determined by ELISA. The t\n1/2 \nof HSA injected into mice at 20 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg were determined to be ˜24 hrs and ˜20 hrs, respectively.\n\n\n \nHalf-Life Determination of SABA1-4 in Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nOne liter \nE. coli \ngrowth of HSA binding clones SABA1.1, SABA2.1, SABA3.1, and SABA4.1 were prepared, purified and endotoxin removed. Each SABA variant was injected into the tail vein of mice, and the concentration in blood samples taken at intervals post-injection was determined by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profiles of each SABA were compared in the presence or absence of HSA in approximately 6 week old Ncr nude female mice. The mice that were co-injected with HSA had the HSA premixed with each SABA (HSA in a 3-4 molar excess) because the binding clone was selective for HSA and RhSA and did not bind the mouse serum albumin. The half-life of SABA1.1 (clone 1318H04) in mice plasma was 0.56 hours whereas the half-life of SABA1.1 co-injected with HSA was 5.6 hours, a \n˜\n10-fold increase in half life (\nFIG. 24A\n). The half-life of SABA2.1 in mice plasma was 0.24 hours whereas the half-life of SABA2.1 co-injected with HSA was 2.8 hours, a \n˜\n12-fold increase in half life (\nFIG. 24B\n). The half-life of SABA3.1 (clone 1245H07) in mice plasma was 0.28 hours whereas the half-life of SABA3.1 co-injected with HSA was 0.53 hours, a \n˜\n2-fold increase in half life (\nFIG. 24C\n).

The pharmacokinetics were evaluated using a quantitative ELISA-based assay that was developed to detect the Adnectin in plasma samples.

For rhesus serum albumin (RhSA), the measured average association rate constant was 6.6E+03 M\n−i\ns\n−1\n, and the dissociation rate constant was 3.78E-03 s\n−1\n, giving a calculated average K\nd \nof 580 nM. No measurable interaction between SABA1.2 and mouse or rat serum albumin could be observed up to 1 μM (Table 18 and \nFIG. 27\n).

For this study, SABA1.1, a “\ncore\n 1” \n10\nFn3 comprising a His6 extension (SEQ ID NO: 420 in Table 6), was used. HSA (10 μl per injection of 115 μM protein solution) was injected into the calorimetric cell containing SABA1.1 at a concentration of 8.1 μM. The experiment was performed at 37° C. in PBS buffer pH 7.4. \nFIG. 28\n shows that SABA1.1 binds to HSA with 1:1 stoichiometry.\n\n\n \nSABA1.2 Binds Potently to HSA at Low pH\n\n\n \n \n \nThe long half-life of albumins (e.g., t\n1/2 \nof HSA is 19 days) is due in large part to the fact that they are recycled from an endocytic pathway by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor, FcRn, under the low pH conditions that exist inside the endosome. As shown in Table 19 SABA1.2 potently bound HSA at the endosomal pH of 5.5, suggesting that the t\n1/2 \nof SABA1, once bound to HSA, would also benefit from the FcRn recycling mechanism.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of Albumin Binding Kinetics at pH 7.4 and 5.5,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin MES Buffer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nalbumin\n\n\npH\n\n\nka (1/Ms)\n\n\nkd (1/s)\n\n\nKD (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman\n\n\n7.4\n\n\n9.26E+03\n\n\n3.88E−04\n\n\n41.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.5\n\n\n9.44E+03\n\n\n2.70E−04\n\n\n28.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRhesus\n\n\n7.4\n\n\n6.16E+03\n\n\n2.95E−03\n\n\n479\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.5\n\n\n7.57E+03\n\n\n2.72E−03\n\n\n359\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSABA1.2 Binds to Domains I and II of HSA, but not Domain III\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding site SABA1.2 on albumin was mapped to the N-terminal domains I or II using recombinant HSA fragments and has no detectable binding to domain III (\nFIG. 29\n). Because domain III is the domain of HSA that primarily interacts with FcRn, it is less likely that SABA1.2 would compete for HSA binding to FcRn, again increasing the possibility of fully leveraging the recycling mechanism for enhanced half-life.\n\n\n \nExample 5G\n\n\nIn Vivo Pharmacology of SABA1.2\n\n\n \n \n \nA four week single dose pre-toxicology study of SABA1.2 was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys to assess pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity at two different dose levels. The pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity were also evaluated in a three-week, single-dose pre-toxicology study that included both intravenous and subcutaneous administration arms. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of SABA1.2 was evaluated in two separate, single dose pre-toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys using a quantitative ELISA-based assay that was developed to detect SABA1.2 in plasma samples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSABA1.2 was administered to monkeys at 1 mpk and 10 mpk IV. Non-compartmental analyses using WINNONLIN® software were performed to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters. As shown in \nFIG. 30\n and the parameters described below, SABA1.2 exhibited dose-dependent pharmacokinetics in this study as determined by area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) evaluation. The clearance (CL) for SABA1.2 at 10 mpk was 0.15 ml/hr/kg, the beta phase half-life (t\n1/2\n) was 143 hours, the volume of distribution (Vz) was 30 mL/kg, and total drug exposure (AUCall) was 5,609,457 hr*nmol/L (Table 20). The clearance (CL) for SABA1.2 at 1 mpk was 0.4 ml/hr/kg, the half-life (t\n1/2\n) was 124 hours, the volume of distribution (Vz) was 72 mL/kg, and total drug exposure (AUCall) was 214,636 hr*nmol/L (Table 20).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter SC or IV administration of SABA1.2, the beta-phase pharmacokinetic profiles were similar (\nFIG. 31\n). The clearance (CL) for SABA1.2 at 1 mpk IV was 0.22 ml/hr/kg, the beta phase half-life (t\n1/2\n) was 125 hours, the volume of distribution (Vz) was 40 mL/kg, and total drug exposure (AUCall) was 357,993 hr*nmol/L (Table 20). The clearance (CL) for SABA1.2 at 1 mpk SC was 0.32 ml/hr/kg, the beta phase half-life (t\n1/2\n) was 134 hours, the volume of distribution (Vz) was 62 mL/kg, and total drug exposure (AUCall) was 251,339 hr*nmol/L (Table 20).

Since the discovery of melanoma antigen (MAGE) family as the first example of TAAs, many other TAAs have been discovered through immunological approaches (NPL 1/Boon T, Int J Cancer 1993 May 8, 54(2): 177-80; NPL 2/Boon T & van der Bruggen P, J Exp Med 1996 Mar. 1, 183(3): 725-9), and some of the TAAs are now in the process of clinical development as immunotherapeutic targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdentification of new TAAs, which induce potent and specific anti-tumor immune responses, warrants further development of clinical application of peptide vaccination strategy in various types of cancer (NPL 3/Harris CC, J Natl Cancer Inst 1996 Oct. 16, 88(20): 1442-55; NPL 4/Butterfield L H et al., Cancer Res 1999 Jul. 1, 59(13): 3134-42; NPL 5/Vissers J L et al., Cancer Res 1999 Nov. 1, 59(21): 5554-9; NPL 6/van der Burg S H et al., J Immunol 1996 May 1, 156(9): 3308-14; NPL 7/Tanaka F et al., Cancer Res 1997 Oct. 15, 57(20): 4465-8; NPL 8/Fujie T et al., Int J Cancer 1999 Jan. 18, 80(2): 169-72; NPL 9/Kikuchi M et al., Int J Cancer 1999 May 5, 81(3): 459-66; NPL 10/Oiso M et al., Int J Cancer 1999 May 5, 81(3): 387-94). Until now, several clinical trials using these tumor-associated antigen derived peptides have been reported. Unfortunately, only a low objective response rate could be observed in these cancer vaccine trials so far (NPL 11/Belli F et al., J Clin Oncol 2002 Oct. 15, 20(20): 4169-80; NPL 12/Coulie P G et al., Immunol Rev 2002 October, 188: 33-42; NPL 13/Rosenberg S A et al., Nat Med 2004 September, 10(9): 909-15).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFavorable TAA is indispensable for proliferation and survival of cancer cells, as a target for immunotherapy, because the use of such TAAs may minimize the well-described risk of immune escape of cancer cells attributable to deletion, mutation, or down-regulation of TAAs as a consequence of therapeutically driven immune selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, Nei endonuclease VIII-like 3 (NEIL3) has been isolated as a member belonging to a class of DNA glycosylases homologous to the bacterial Fpg/Nei family (\nNPL\n 14/Bandaru et al., DNA Repair (Amst). 2002 Jul. 17; 1(7):517-29). These glycosylases initiate the first step in base excision repair by cleaving bases damaged by reactive oxygen species and introducing a DNA strand break via the associated lyase reaction. NEIL3 is likely to play a role in DNA repair mechanism, however, its relationship with carcinogenesis has not been elucidated.\n\n\n \nCITATION LIST\n\n\nNon Patent Literature\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n[NPL 1] Boon T, Int J Cancer 1993 May 8, 54(2): 177-80\n\n\n[NPL 2] Boon T & van der Bruggen P, J Exp Med 1996 Mar. 1, 183(3): 725-9\n\n\n[NPL 3] Harris C C, J Natl Cancer Inst 1996 Oct. 16, 88(20): 1442-55\n\n\n[NPL 4] Butterfield L H et al., Cancer Res 1999 Jul. 1, 59(13): 3134-42\n\n\n[NPL 5] Vissers J L et al., Cancer Res 1999 Nov. 1, 59(21): 5554-9\n\n\n[NPL 6] van der Burg S H et al., J Immunol 1996 May 1, 156(9): 3308-14\n\n\n[NPL 7] Tanaka F et al., Cancer Res 1997 Oct. 15, 57(20): 4465-8\n\n\n[NPL 8] Fujie T et al., Int J Cancer 1999 Jan. 18, 80(2): 169-72\n\n\n[NPL 9] Kikuchi M et al., Int J Cancer 1999 May 5, 81(3): 459-66\n\n\n[NPL 10] Oiso M et al., Int J Cancer 1999 May 5, 81(3): 387-94\n\n\n[NPL 11] Belli F et al., J Clin Oncol 2002 Oct. 15, 20(20): 4169-80\n\n\n[NPL 12] Coulie P G et al., Immunol Rev 2002 October, 188: 33-42\n\n\n[NPL 13] Rosenberg S A et al., Nat Med 2004 September, 10(9): 909-15\n\n\n[NPL 14] Bandaru et al., DNA Repair (Amst). 2002 Jul. 17; 1(7):517-29\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of the applicable targets of immunotherapy. Because TAAs are generally perceived by the immune system as “self” and therefore often have no immunogenicity, the discovery of appropriate targets is of extreme importance. As noted above, NEIL3 (SEQ ID NO: 45 encoded by the gene of GenBank Accession No. NM\n—\n018248 (for example, SEQ ID NO: 44)) has been identified as up-regulated in cancers, such as bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), soft tissue tumor, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Thus, NEIL3 is a candidate for the target of cancer/tumor immunotherapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is based, at least in part, on the identification of specific epitope peptides of the gene products of NEIL3 which possess the ability to induce CTLs specific to NEIL3. As discussed in detail below, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from a healthy donor were stimulated using HLA-A*2402 or HLA-A*0201 binding candidate peptides derived from NEIL3. CTL lines were then established with specific cytotoxicity against the HLA-A24 or HLA-A2 positive target cells pulsed with each of candidate peptides. These results demonstrate that these peptides are HLA-A24 or HLA-A2 restricted epitope peptides that may induce potent and specific immune responses against cells expressing NEIL3. Further, it indicated that NEIL3 is strongly immunogenic and the epitopes thereof are effective targets for cancer/tumor immunotherapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention provides isolated peptides binding to HLA antigen which consists of NEIL3 (SEQ ID NO: 45) or the immunologically active fragments thereof. These peptides are expected to have CTL inducibility and can be used to induce CTL ex vivo or to be administered to a subject for inducing immune responses against cancers such as bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, endometriosis, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, SCLC and AML. Preferably, those peptides are nonapeptide or decapeptide, and more preferably, consisting of the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 43. In particular, the peptides consisting of the amino sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43 showed strong CTL inducibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the present invention encompass those wherein one, two or more amino acids are substituted deleted or added, so long as the modified peptides retain the original CTL inducibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the present invention provides isolated polynucleotides encoding any peptides of the present invention. These polynucleotides can be used for inducing or preparing APCs with CTL inducibility or to be administered to a subject for inducing immune responses against cancers as well as the present peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen administered to a subject, the present peptides are presented on the surface of APCs and then induce CTLs targeting the respective peptides. Therefore, according to an aspect of the present invention, compositions or substances including any peptides or polynucleotides of the present invention for inducing CTLs are also provided. Furthermore, compositions or substances including any peptides or polynucleotides can be used to treating and/or prophylaxis of cancers, such as bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML, and/or preventing postoperative recurrence thereof. Thus, the present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions or substances for treating and/or prophylaxis of cancers, and/or preventing postoperative recurrence thereof, which includes any peptides or polynucleotides of the present invention. The present pharmaceutical compositions or substances may include APCs or exosomes which present any of the present peptides instead of/in addition to the present peptides or polynucleotides as active ingredients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides or polynucleotides of the present invention can induce APCs which present on their surface a complex of an HLA antigen and the present peptide, for example, by contacting APCs derived from a subject with the peptide or introducing a polynucleotide encoding a peptide of the present invention into APCs. Such APCs have high CTL inducibility against target peptides and find use in cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, the present invention encompasses the methods for inducing APCs with CTL inducibility and the APCs obtained by the methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method for inducing CTL, which includes the step of co-culturing CD8 positive cells with APCs or exosomes presenting the peptide of the present invention on its surface or the step of introducing a gene that includes a polynucleotide encoding a T cell receptor (TCR) subunit polypeptide binding to the present peptide. The CTLs obtained by the methods can find use for treating and/or preventing cancers, such as bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML. Therefore, the present invention encompasses the CTLs obtained by the present methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the present invention provides methods for inducing immune response against cancers, which methods include the step of administering compositions or substances including the NEIL3 polypeptides or immunologically active fragments thereof, polynucleotides encoding NEIL3 polypeptides, exosomes or the APCs presenting NEIL3 polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method of diagnosing cancer, including, but not limited to, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention may be applied to any diseases relating to NEIL3 overexpression, such as cancer, exemplary cancers include bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 11\n depicts photographs showing the results of IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay on CTLs that were induced with peptides derived from NEIL3.

Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo demonstrate that peptides derived from NEIL3 function as an antigen recognized by CTLs, peptides derived from NEIL3 (SEQ ID NO: 45) were analyzed to determine whether they were antigen epitopes restricted by HLA-A24 or A2 which are commonly encountered HLA alleles (Date Y et al., Tissue Antigens 47: 93-101, 1996; Kondo A et al., J Immunol 155: 4307-12, 1995; Kubo R T et al., J Immunol 152: 3913-24, 1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCandidates of HLA-A2 binding peptides derived from NEIL3 were identified using the information on their binding affinities to HLA-A2. The candidate peptide is the peptides selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 23.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, after in vitro stimulation of T-cells by dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed (loaded) with these peptides, CTLs were successfully established using each of the following peptides;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNEIL3-A2-9-585 (SEQ ID NO: 3),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNEIL3-A2-9-127 (SEQ ID NO: 4),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNEIL3-A2-9-416 (SEQ ID NO: 5),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNEIL3-A2-9-71 (SEQ ID NO: 6),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNEIL3-A2-9-271 (SEQ ID NO: 11),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNEIL3-A2-10-198 (SEQ ID NO: 15),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNEIL3-A2-10-340 (SEQ ID NO: 17),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNEIL3-A2-10-590 (SEQ ID NO: 21), and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNEIL3-A2-10-378 (SEQ ID NO: 22).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCandidates of HLA-A24 binding peptides derived from NEIL3 were identified based on their binding affinities to HLA-A24. The candidate peptide is the peptides selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 24 to 43.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, after in vitro stimulation of T-cells by dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed (loaded) with these peptides, CTLs were successfully established using each of the following peptides;\n\n\n \nNEIL3-A24-9-545 (SEQ ID NO: 24),\n\n\nNEIL3-A24-9-362 (SEQ ID NO: 33),\n\n\nNEIL3-A24-10-320 (SEQ ID NO: 35),\n\n\nNEIL3-A24-10-544 (SEQ ID NO: 41), and\n\n\nNEIL3-A24-10-87 (SEQ ID NO: 43).\n\n\n \n \n \nThese established CTLs showed potent specific CTL activity against target cells pulsed with respective peptides. These results demonstrate that NEIL3 is an antigen recognized by CTLs and that the peptides tested are epitope peptides of NEIL3 restricted by HLA-A24 or HLA-A2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the NEIL3 gene is over expressed in cancer cells such as bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML and not expressed in most normal organs, it is a good target for cancer immunotherapy. Thus, the present invention provides nonapeptides (peptides consisting of nine amino acid residues) and decapeptides (peptides consisting of ten amino acid residues) of CTL-recognized epitopes from NEIL3. Alternatively, the present invention provides isolated peptides which bind to HLA antigens and induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), wherein the peptide consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 45 or is an immunologically active fragment thereof. More specifically, in some embodiments, the present invention provides peptides consisting of the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, software programs now available, for example, on the Internet, such as those described in Parker K C et al., J Immunol 1994 Jan. 1, 152(1): 163-75 and Nielsen M et al., Protein Sci 2003; 12: 1007-17 can be used to calculate the binding affinities between various peptides and HLA antigens in silico. Binding affinity with HLA antigens can be measured as described, for example, in Parker K C et al., J Immunol 1994 Jan. 1, 152(1): 163-75, Kuzushima K et al., Blood 2001, 98(6): 1872-81, Larsen M V et al. BMC Bioinformatics. 2007 Oct. 31; 8: 424, Buus S et al. Tissue Antigens., 62:378-84, 2003, Nielsen M et al., Protein Sci 2003; 12: 1007-17, and Nielsen M et al. PLoS ONE 2007; 2: e796, which are summarized in, e.g., Lafuente E M et al., Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2009, 15, 3209-3220. The methods for determining binding affinity is described, for example, in; Journal of Immunological Methods, 1995, 185: 181-190; Protein Science, 2000, 9: 1838-1846. Therefore, one can select fragments derived from NEIL3, which have high binding affinity with HLA antigens using such software programs. Thus, the present invention encompasses peptides consisting of any fragments derived from NEIL3, which would be determined to bind with HLA antigens by such known programs. Furthermore, such peptides may include the peptide consisting of the full length of NEIL3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the present invention may be flanked with additional amino acid residues so long as the peptides retain their CTL inducibility. The additional amino acid residues may be composed of any kind of amino acids so long as they do not impair the CTL inducibility of the original peptide. Thus, the present invention encompasses peptides with binding affinity to HLA antigens, including peptides derived from NEIL3. Such peptides are, for example, less than about 40 amino acids, often less than about 20 amino acids, usually less than about 15 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, it is known that modifications of one or more amino acids in a peptide do not influence the function of the peptide, or in some cases even enhance the desired function of the original protein. In fact, modified peptides (i.e., peptides composed of an amino acid sequence modified by substituting deleting or adding one, two or several amino acid residues to an original reference sequence) have been known to retain the biological activity of the original peptide (Mark et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1984, 81: 5662-6; Zoller and Smith, Nucleic Acids Res 1982, 10: 6487-500; Dalbadie-McFarland et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1982, 79: 6409-13). Thus, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the peptide having CTL inducibility of the present invention may be composed of the peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43, wherein one, two or even more amino acids are added, deleted and/or substituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of skill in the art will recognize that individual additions deletions or substitutions to an amino acid sequence which alters a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids results in the conservation of the properties of the original amino acid side-chain; it is thus referred to as “conservative substitution” or “conservative modification”, wherein the alteration of a protein results in a protein with similar functions. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Examples of properties of amino acid side chains are hydrophobic amino acids (A, I, L, M, F, P, W, Y, V), hydrophilic amino acids (R, D, N, C, E, Q, G, H, K, S, T), and side chains having the following functional groups or characteristics in common: an aliphatic side-chain (G, A, V, L, I, P); a hydroxyl group containing side-chain (S, T, Y); a sulfur atom containing side-chain (C, M); a carboxylic acid and amide containing side-chain (D, N, E, Q); a base containing side-chain (R, K, H); and an aromatic group containing side-chain (H, F, Y, W). In addition, the following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3) Aspargine (N), Glutamine (Q);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n7) Serine (S), Threonine (T); and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n8) Cysteine (C), Methionine (M) (see, e.g., Creighton, Proteins 1984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch conservatively modified peptides are also considered to be peptides of the present invention. However, the peptide of the present invention is not restricted thereto and may include non-conservative modifications, so long as the peptide retains the CTL inducibility. Furthermore, the modified peptides do not exclude CTL inducible peptides of polymorphic variants, interspecies homologues, and alleles of NEIL3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo retain the requisite CTL inducibility one can modify (add or substitute) a small number (for example, 1, 2 or several) or a small percentage of amino acids. Herein, the term “several” means 5 or fewer amino acids, for example, 3 or fewer. The percentage of amino acids to be modified may be 20% or less, for example, 15% of less, for example 10% or 1 to 5%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the peptides may be substituted or added by such of the amino acid residues to achieve a higher binding affinity. When used in cancer immunotherapy, the present peptides are presented on the surface of a cell or exosome as a complex with an HLA antigen. In addition to peptides that are naturally displayed, since the regularity of the sequences of peptides displayed by binding to HLA antigens has already been known (J Immunol 1994, 152: 3913; Immunogenetics 1995, 41: 178; J Immunol 1994, 155: 4307), modifications based on such regularity may be introduced into the immunogenic peptides of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, peptides showing high HLA-A2 binding affinity have their second amino acid from the N-terminus substituted with leucine or methionine, and peptides whose amino acid at the C-terminus is substituted with valine or leucine can also be favorably used. Thus, peptides having the amino acid sequences selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21 and 22 wherein the second amino acid from the N-terminus of the amino acid sequence of the SEQ ID NO is substituted with leucine or methionine, and peptides, and/or wherein the C-terminus of the amino acid sequence of the SEQ ID NO is substituted with valine or leucine are encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, peptides possessing high HLA-A24 binding affinity have their second amino acid from the N-terminus substituted with phenylalanine, tyrosine, methionine, or tryptophan, and the amino acid at the C-terminus is substituted with phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, tryptophan, or methionine. Thus, peptides having the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43 wherein the second amino acid from the N-terminus is substituted with phenylalanine, tyrosine, methionine, or tryptophan, and/or wherein the C-terminus is substituted with phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, tryptophan, or methionine are encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitutions may be introduced not only at the terminal amino acids but also at the position of potential T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptides. Several studies have demonstrated that a peptide with amino acid substitutions may have equal to or better function than that of the original, for example, CAP1, p53\n(264-272)\n, Her-2/neu\n(369-377) \nor gp 100\n(209-217) \n(Zaremba et al. Cancer Res. 57, 4570-4577, 1997, T. K. Hoffmann et al. J. Immunol. (2002) February 1; 168(3):1338-47., S. O. Dionne et al. Cancer Immunol immunother. (2003) 52: 199-206 and S. O. Dionne et al. Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2004) 53, 307-314).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, one, two or several amino acids may also be added to the N and/or C-terminus of the present peptides. Such modified peptides with high HLA antigen binding affinity and retained CTL inducibility are also included in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, when the peptide sequence is identical to a portion of the amino acid sequence of an endogenous or exogenous protein having a different function, side effects such as autoimmune disorders or allergic symptoms against specific substances may be induced. Therefore, one can perform homology searches using available databases to avoid situations in which the sequence of the peptide matches the amino acid sequence of another protein. When it becomes clear from the homology searches that there exists not even a peptide with 1 or 2 amino acids difference to the objective peptide, the objective peptide may be modified in order to increase its binding affinity with HLA antigens, and/or increase its CTL inducibility without any danger of such side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough peptides having high binding affinity to the HLA antigens as described above are expected to be highly effective, the candidate peptides, which are selected according to the presence of high binding affinity as an indicator, are further examined for the presence of CTL inducibility. Herein, the phrase “CTL inducibility” indicates the ability of the peptide to induce CTLs when presented on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Further, “CTL inducibility” includes the ability of the peptide to induce CTL activation, CTL proliferation, promote CTL lysis of target cells, and to increase CTL IFN-gamma production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConfirmation of CTL inducibility is accomplished by inducing APCs carrying human MHC antigens (for example, B-lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs)), or more specifically DCs derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes, and after stimulation with the peptides, mixing with CD8 positive cells, and then measuring the IFN-gamma produced and released by CTL against the target cells. As the reaction system, transgenic animals that have been produced to express a human HLA antigen (for example, those described in BenMohamed L, Krishnan R, Longmate J, Auge C, Low L, Primus J, Diamond D J, \nHum Immunol\n 2000 August, 61(8): 764-79, Related Articles, Books, Linkout Induction of CTL response by a minimal epitope vaccine in HLA A*0201/DR1 transgenic mice: dependent on MHC (HLA) class II restricted T(H) response) can be used. For example, the target cells may be radiolabeled with \n51\nCr and such, and cytotoxic activity may be calculated from radioactivity released from the target cells. Alternatively, it may be examined by measuring IFN-gamma produced and released by CTL in the presence of APCs that carry immobilized peptides, and visualizing the inhibition zone on the media using anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result of examining the CTL inducibility of the peptides as described above, nonapeptides or decapeptides selected from peptides consisting of the amino acid sequences indicated by SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43 showed particularly high CTL inducibility as well as high binding affinity to an HLA antigen. Thus, these peptides are exemplified embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the result of homology analysis showed that those peptides do not have significant homology with peptides derived from any other known human gene products. This lowers the possibility of unknown or undesired immune responses when used for immunotherapy. Therefore, also from this aspect, these peptides find use for eliciting immunity in cancer patients against NEIL3. Thus, the peptides of the present invention, preferably, peptides consisting of the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to modification of the present peptides, discussed above, the peptides of the present invention may be linked to other peptides, so long as they retain the CTL inducibility. Exemplified other peptides include: the peptides of the present invention or the CTL inducible peptides derived from other TAAs. The linkers between the peptides are well known in the art, for example, AAY (P. M. Daftarian et al., J Trans Med 2007, 5:26), AAA, NKRK (R. P. M. Sutmuller et al., J. Immunol. 2000, 165: 7308-7315) or K (S. Ota et al., Can Res. 62, 1471-1476, K. S. Kawamura et al., J. Immunol. 2002, 168: 5709-5715).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, non-NEIL3 tumor associated antigen peptides also can be used substantially simultaneously to increase immune response via HLA class I and/or class II. It is well established that cancer cells can express more than one tumor associated gene. It is within the scope of routine experimentation for one of ordinary skill in the art to determine whether a particular subject expresses additional tumor associated genes, and then to include HLA class I and/or HLA class II binding peptides derived from expression products of such genes in NEIL3 compositions or vaccines according to the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of HLA class I and HLA class II binding peptides will be known to one of ordinary skill in the art (for example, see Coulie, Stem Cells 13:393-403, 1995), and can be used in the invention in a like manner as those disclosed herein. One of ordinary skill in the art can prepare polypeptides including one or more NEIL3 peptides and one or more of the non-NEIL3 peptides, or nucleic acids encoding such polypeptides, according to standard procedures of molecular biology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, such “polytopes” are groups of two or more potentially immunogenic or immune response stimulating peptides which can be joined together in various arrangements (e.g., concatenated, overlapping). The polytope (or nucleic acid encoding the polytope) can be administered in a standard immunization protocol, e.g., to animals, to test the effectiveness of the polytope in stimulating, enhancing and/or provoking an immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides can be joined together directly or via the use of flanking sequences to form polytopes, and the use of polytopes as vaccines is well known in the art (see, e.g., Thomson et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92(13):5845-5849, 1995; Gilbert et al., Nature Biotechnol. 15(12):1280-1284, 1997; Thomson et al., J. Immunol. 157(2):822-826, 1996; Tarn et al., J. Exp. Med. 171(1):299-306, 1990). Polytopes containing various numbers and combinations of epitopes can be prepared and tested for recognition by CTLs and for efficacy in increasing an immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the peptides of the present invention may be further linked to other substances, so long as they retain the CTL inducibility. Such substances may include: peptides, lipids, sugar and sugar chains, acetyl groups, natural and synthetic polymers, etc. The peptides may contain modifications such as glycosylation, side chain oxidation, or phosphorylation; so long as the modifications do not destroy the biological activity of the peptides as described herein. These kinds of modifications may be performed to confer additional functions (e.g., targeting function, and delivery function) or to stabilize the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, to increase the in vivo stability of a polypeptide, it is known in the art to introduce D-amino acids, amino acid mimetics or unnatural amino acids; this concept may also be adopted for the present polypeptides. The stability of a polypeptide may be assayed in a number of ways. For instance, peptidases and various biological media, such as human plasma and serum, can be used to test stability (see, e.g., Verhoef et al., Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokin 1986, 11: 291-302).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, as noted above, among the modified peptides that are substituted, deleted or added by one, two or several amino acid residues, those having same or higher activity as compared to original peptides can be screened for or selected. The present invention, therefore, also provides the method of screening for or selecting modified peptides having same or higher activity as compared to originals. For example, the method may include steps of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \na: substituting, deleting or adding at least one amino acid residue of a peptide of the present invention,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb: determining the activity of the peptide, and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc: selecting the peptide having same or higher activity as compared to the original.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHerein, the activity may include MHC binding activity, APC or CTL inducibility and cytotoxic activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHerein, the peptides of the present invention may also be described as “NEIL3 peptide(s)” or “NEIL3 polypeptide(s)”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIII. Preparation of NEIL3 Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the present invention may be prepared using well known techniques. For example, the peptides may be prepared synthetically, by recombinant DNA technology or chemical synthesis. The peptides of the present invention may be synthesized individually or as longer polypeptides including two or more peptides. The peptides may be isolated, i.e., purified or isolated substantially free from other naturally occurring host cell proteins and fragments thereof, or any other chemical substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the present invention may contain modifications, such as glycosylation, side chain oxidation, or phosphorylation; so long as the modifications do not destroy the biological activity of the peptides as described herein. Other modifications include incorporation of D-amino acids or other amino acid mimetics that may be used, for example, to increase the serum half life of the peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA peptide of the present invention may be obtained through chemical synthesis based on the selected amino acid sequence. For example, conventional peptide synthesis methods that may be adopted for the synthesis include:\n\n \n \n \n(i) Peptide Synthesis, Interscience, New York, 1966;\n \n(ii) The Proteins, Vol. 2, Academic Press, New York, 1976;\n \n(iii) Peptide Synthesis (in Japanese), Maruzen Co., 1975;\n \n(iv) Basics and Experiment of Peptide Synthesis (in Japanese), Maruzen Co., 1985;\n \n(v) Development of Pharmaceuticals (second volume) (in Japanese), Vol. 14 (peptide synthesis), Hirokawa, 1991;\n \n(vi) WO99/67288; and\n \n(vii) Barany G. & Merrifield R. B., Peptides Vol. 2, “Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis”, Academic Press, New York, 1980, 100-118.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAlternatively, the present peptides may be obtained adopting any known genetic engineering methods for producing peptides (e.g., Morrison J, J Bacteriology 1977, 132: 349-51; Clark-Curtiss & Curtiss, Methods in Enzymology (eds. Wu et al.) 1983, 101: 347-62). For example, first, a suitable vector harboring a polynucleotide encoding the objective peptide in an expressible form (e.g., downstream of a regulatory sequence corresponding to a promoter sequence) is prepared and transformed into a suitable host cell. Such vectors and host cells are also provided by the present invention. The host cell is then cultured to produce the peptide of interest. The peptide may also be produced in vitro adopting an in vitro translation system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIV. Polynucleotides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides polynucleotides which encode any of the aforementioned peptides of the present invention. These include polynucleotides derived from the natural occurring NEIL3 gene (GenBank Accession No. NM\n—\n018248 (for example, SEQ ID NO: 44)) and those having a conservatively modified nucleotide sequences thereof. Herein, the phrase “conservatively modified nucleotide sequence” refers to sequences which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG, and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon may be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are “silent variations,” which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a peptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill in the art will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) may be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid that encodes a peptide is implicitly described in each disclosed sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polynucleotide of the present invention may be composed of DNA, RNA, or derivatives thereof. As is well known in the art, a DNA molecule is composed of bases such as the naturally occurring bases A, T, C, and G, and T is replaced by U in an RNA. One of skill will recognize that non-naturally occurring bases be included in polynucleotides, as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polynucleotide of the present invention may encode multiple peptides of the present invention with or without intervening amino acid sequences. For example, the intervening amino acid sequence may provide a cleavage site (e.g., enzyme recognition sequence) of the polynucleotide or the translated peptides. Furthermore, the polynucleotide may include any additional sequences to the coding sequence encoding the peptide of the present invention. For example, the polynucleotide may be a recombinant polynucleotide that includes regulatory sequences required for the expression of the peptide or may be an expression vector (plasmid) with marker genes and such. In general, such recombinant polynucleotides may be prepared by the manipulation of polynucleotides through conventional recombinant techniques using, for example, polymerases and endonucleases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth recombinant and chemical synthesis techniques may be used to produce the polynucleotides of the present invention. For example, a polynucleotide may be produced by insertion into an appropriate vector, which may be expressed when transfected into a competent cell. Alternatively, a polynucleotide may be amplified using PCR techniques or expression in suitable hosts (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, 1989). Alternatively, a polynucleotide may be synthesized using the solid phase techniques, as described in Beaucage S L & Iyer R P, Tetrahedron 1992, 48: 2223-311; Matthes et al., EMBO J. 1984, 3: 801-5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nV. Exosomes\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides intracellular vesicles called exosomes, which present complexes formed between the peptides of the present invention and HLA antigens on their surface. Exosomes may be prepared, for example by using the methods detailed in Japanese Patent Application Kohyo Publications No. Hei 11-510507 and WO99/03499, and may be prepared using APCs obtained from patients who are subject to treatment and/or prevention. The exosomes of the present invention may be inoculated as vaccines, similarly to the peptides of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe type of HLA antigens included in the complexes must match that of the subject requiring treatment and/or prevention. For example, for Japanese, HLA-A24 and HLA-A2, particularly HLA-A*2402 and HLA-A*0201 and HLA-A*0206 are often appropriate. The use of A24 type or the A2 type that is highly expressed among the Japanese and Caucasian is favorable for obtaining effective results, and subtypes such as A*2402, A*0201 and A*0206 find use. Typically, in the clinic, the type of HLA antigen of the patient requiring treatment is investigated in advance, which enables appropriate selection of peptides having high levels of binding affinity to this antigen, or having CTL inducibility by antigen presentation. Furthermore, in order to obtain peptides showing high binding affinity and CTL inducibility, substitution, deletion, or addition of 1, 2, or several amino acids may be performed based on the amino acid sequence of the naturally occurring NEIL3 partial peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn case of using A2 type HLA antigen for the exosome of the present invention, the peptides including the sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21 and 22 find use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, in case of using the A24 type HLA antigen for the exosome of the present invention, the peptides having a sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43 and 61 find use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVI. Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides isolated APCs that present complexes formed with HLA antigens and the peptides of the present invention on its surface. The APCs may be derived from patients who are subject to treatment and/or prevention, and may be administered as vaccines by themselves or in combination with other drugs including the peptides of the present invention, exosomes, or CTLs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe APCs are not limited to a particular kind of cells and include DCs, Langerhans cells, macrophages, B cells, and activated T cells, which are known to present proteinaceous antigens on their cell surface so as to be recognized by lymphocytes. Since DC is a representative APC having the strongest CTL inducing activity among APCs, DCs find use as the APCs of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the APCs of the present invention may be obtained by inducing DCs from peripheral blood monocytes and then contacting (stimulating) them with the peptides of the present invention in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo. When the peptides of the present invention are administered to the subjects, APCs that present the peptides of the present invention are induced in the body of the subject. Therefore, the APCs of the present invention may be obtained by collecting the APCs from the subject after administering the peptides of the present invention to the subject. Alternatively, the APCs of the present invention may be obtained by contacting APCs collected from a subject with the peptide of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe APCs of the present invention may be administered to a subject for inducing immune response against cancer in the subject by themselves or in combination with other drugs including the peptides, exosomes or CTLs of the present invention. For example, the ex vivo administration may include steps of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \na: collecting APCs from a first subject,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb: contacting with the APCs of step a, with the peptide, and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc: administering the APCs of step b to a second subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe first subject and the second subject may be the same individual, or may be different individuals. The APCs obtained by step b may be a vaccine for treating and/or preventing cancer, such as bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to an aspect of the present invention, the APCs have a high level of CTL inducibility. In the term of “high level of CTL inducibility”, the high level is relative to the level of that by APC contacting with no peptide or peptides which may not induce the CTL. Such APCs having a high level of CTL inducibility may be prepared by a method which includes the step of transferring a polynucleotide encoding the peptide of the present invention to APCs in vitro as well as the method mentioned above. The introduced genes may be in the form of DNAs or RNAs. Examples of methods for introduction include, without particular limitations, various methods conventionally performed in this field, such as lipofection, electroporation, or calcium phosphate method may be used. More specifically, it may be performed as described in Cancer Res 1996, 56: 5672-7; J Immunol 1998, 161: 5607-13; J Exp Med 1996, 184: 465-72; Published Japanese Translation of International Publication No. 2000-509281. By transferring the gene into APCs, the gene undergoes transcription, translation, and such in the cell, and then the obtained protein is processed by MHC Class I or Class II, and proceeds through a presentation pathway to present partial peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVII. Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA CTL induced against any of the peptides of the present invention strengthens the immune response targeting cancer cells in vivo and thus may be used as vaccines similar to the peptides. Thus, the present invention provides isolated CTLs that are specifically induced or activated by any of the present peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch CTLs may be obtained by (1) administering the peptide(s) of the present invention to a subject or (2) contacting (stimulating) subject-derived APCs, and CD8 positive cells, or peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes in vitro with the peptide(s) of the present invention or (3) contacting CD8 positive cells or peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes in vitro with the APCs or exosomes presenting a complex of an HLA antigen and the peptide on its surface or (4) introducing a gene that includes a polynucleotide encoding a T cell receptor (TCR) subunit binding to the peptide of the present invention. Such APCs or exosomes may be prepared by the methods described above and details of the method of (4) is described bellow in section “VIII. T cell receptor (TCR)”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CTLs of the present invention may be derived from patients who are subject to treatment and/or prevention, and may be administered by themselves or in combination with other drugs including the peptides of the present invention or exosomes for the purpose of regulating effects. The obtained CTLs act specifically against target cells presenting the peptides of the present invention, for example, the same peptides used for induction. The target cells may be cells that endogenously express NEIL3, such as cancer cells, or cells that are transfected with the NEIL3 gene; and cells that present a peptide of the present invention on the cell surface due to stimulation by the peptide may also serve as targets of activated CTL attack.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVIII. T Cell Receptor (TCR)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a composition including nucleic acids encoding polypeptides that are capable of forming a subunit of a T cell receptor (TCR), and methods of using the same. The TCR subunits have the ability to form TCRs that confer specificity to T cells against tumor cells presenting NEIL3. By using the known methods in the art, the nucleic acids of alpha- and beta-chains as the TCR subunits of the CTL induced with one or more peptides of the present invention may be identified (WO2007/032255 and Morgan et al., J Immunol, 171, 3288 (2003)). For example, the PCR method is preferred to analyze the TCR. The PCR primers for the analysis can be, for example, 5′-R primers (5′-gtctaccaggcattcgcttcat-3′) as 5′ side primers (SEQ ID NO: 48) and 3-TRa-C primers (5′-tcagctggaccacagccgcagcgt-3′) specific to TCR alpha chain C region (SEQ ID NO: 49), 3-TRb-C1 primers (5′-tcagaaatcctttctcttgac-3′) specific to TCR beta chain C1 region (SEQ ID NO: 50) or 3-TRbeta-C2 primers (5′-ctagcctctggaatcctttctctt-3′) specific to TCR beta chain C2 region (SEQ ID NO: 51) as 3′ side primers, but not limited thereto. The derivative TCRs may bind target cells displaying the NEIL3 peptide with high avidity, and optionally mediate efficient killing of target cells presenting the NEIL3 peptide in vivo and in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acids encoding the TCR subunits may be incorporated into suitable vectors, e.g., retroviral vectors. These vectors are well known in the art. The nucleic acids or the vectors including them usefully may be transferred into a T cell, for example, a T cell from a patient. Advantageously, the present invention provides an off-the-shelf composition allowing rapid modification of a patient's own T cells (or those of another mammal) to rapidly and easily produce modified T cells having excellent cancer cell killing properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific TCR is a receptor capable of specifically recognizing a complex of a peptide of the present invention and HLA molecule, giving a T cell specific activity against the target cell when the TCR is presented on the surface of the T cell. A specific recognition of the above complex may be confirmed by any known methods, and preferred methods include, for example, HLA multimer staining analysis using HLA molecules and peptides of the present invention, and ELISPOT assay. By performing the ELISPOT assay, it can be confirmed that a T cell expressing the TCR on the cell surface recognizes a cell by the TCR, and that the signal is transmitted intracellularly. The confirmation that the above-mentioned complex can give a T cell cytotoxic activity when the complex exists on the T cell surface may also be carried out by a known method. A preferred method includes, for example, the determination of cytotoxic activity against an HLA positive target cell, such as chromium release assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the present invention provides CTLs which are prepared by transduction with the nucleic acids encoding the TCR subunits polypeptides that bind to the NEIL3 peptide of, e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21 and 22 in the context of HLA-A2, and also the peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43 in the context of HLA-A24.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe transduced CTLs are capable of homing to cancer cells in vivo, and may be expanded by well known culturing methods in vitro (e.g., Kawakami et al., J. Immunol., 142, 3452-3461 (1989)). The CTLs of the present invention may be used to form an immunogenic composition useful in treating or the prevention of cancer in a patient in need of therapy or protection (WO2006/031221).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIX. Pharmaceutical Substances or Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrevention and prophylaxis include any activity which reduces the burden of mortality or morbidity from disease. Prevention and prophylaxis can occur “at primary, secondary and tertiary prevention levels.” While primary prevention and prophylaxis avoid the development of a disease, secondary and tertiary levels of prevention and prophylaxis encompass activities aimed at the prevention and prophylaxis of the progression of a disease and the emergence of symptoms as well as reducing the negative impact of an already established disease by restoring function and reducing disease-related complications. Alternatively, prevention and prophylaxis include a wide range of prophylactic therapies aimed at alleviating the severity of the particular disorder, e.g., reducing the proliferation and metastasis of tumors, reducing angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreating for the prophylaxis of cancer and/or the prevention of postoperative recurrence thereof include(s) any of the following steps, such as surgical removal of cancer cells, inhibition of the growth of cancerous cells, involution or regression of a tumor, induction of remission and suppression of occurrence of cancer, tumor regression, and reduction or inhibition of metastasis. Effectively treating and/or the prophylaxis of cancer decreases mortality and improves the prognosis of individuals having cancer, decreases the levels of tumor markers in the blood, and alleviates detectable symptoms accompanying cancer. For example, reduction or improvement of symptoms constitutes effectively treating and/or the prophylaxis include 10%, 20%, 30% or more reduction, or stable disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince NEIL3 expression is specifically elevated in cancer such as bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML compared with normal tissue, the peptides of or polynucleotides of the present invention may be used for treating and/or for the prophylaxis of cancer, and/or prevention of postoperative recurrence thereof. Thus, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical substance or composition for treating and/or for the prophylaxis of cancer, and/or prevention of postoperative recurrence thereof, which includes one or more of the peptides, or polynucleotides of the present invention as an active ingredient. Alternatively, the present peptides may be expressed on the surface of any of the foregoing exosomes or cells, such as APCs for the use as pharmaceutical substances or compositions. In addition, the aforementioned CTLs which target any of the peptides of the present invention may also be used as the active ingredient of the present pharmaceutical substances or compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present pharmaceutical substances or compositions find use as a vaccine. In the present invention, the phrase “vaccine” (also referred to as an immunogenic composition) refers to a substance that has the function to induce anti-tumor immunity upon inoculation into animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical agents or compositions of the present invention can be used to treat and/or prevent cancers, and/or prevention of postoperative recurrence thereof in subjects or patients including human and any other mammal including, but not limited to, mouse, rat, guinea-pig, rabbit, cat, dog, sheep, goat, pig, cattle, horse, monkey, baboon, and chimpanzee, particularly a commercially important animal or a domesticated animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention also provides the use of an active ingredient selected from among:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) a peptide of the present invention;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) a nucleic acid encoding such a peptide as disclosed herein in an expressible form;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) an APC or an exosome presenting a peptide of the present invention on its surface; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(d) a cytotoxic T cell of the present invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nin manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition or substance for treating or preventing cancer or tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the present invention further provides an active ingredient selected from among:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) a peptide of the present invention;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) a nucleic acid encoding such a peptide as disclosed herein in an expressible form;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) an APC or an exosome presenting a peptide of the present invention on its surface; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(d) a cytotoxic T cell of the present invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nfor use in treating or preventing cancer of tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the present invention further provides a method or process for manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition or substance for treating or preventing cancer or tumor, wherein the method or process includes the step of formulating a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carrier with an active ingredient selected from among:\n\n\n \n \n(a) a peptide of the present invention;\n\n\n(b) a nucleic acid encoding such a peptide as disclosed herein in an expressible form;\n\n\n(c) an APC or an exosome presenting a peptide of the present invention on its surface; and\n\n\n(d) a cytotoxic T cell of the present invention\n\n\nas active ingredients.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention also provides a method or process for manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition or substance for treating or preventing cancer or tumor, wherein the method or process includes the steps of admixing an active ingredient with a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carrier, wherein the active ingredient is selected from among:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) a peptide of the present invention;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) a nucleic acid encoding such a peptide as disclosed herein in an expressible form;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) an APC or an exosome presenting a peptide of the present invention on its surface; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(d) a cytotoxic T cell of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention, peptides including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43 have been found to be HLA-A24 or HLA-A2. restricted epitope peptides or the candidates that may induce potent and specific immune response. Therefore, the present pharmaceutical substances or compositions which include any of these peptides with the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43 are particularly suited for the administration to subjects whose HLA antigen is HLA-A24 or HLA-A2. The same applies to pharmaceutical substances or compositions which include polynucleotides encoding any of these peptides (i.e., the polynucleotides of the present invention).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancers to be treated by the pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention are not limited and include any cancer in which NEIL3 is involved (e.g., is overexpressed), for example, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present pharmaceutical substances or compositions may contain in addition to the aforementioned active ingredients, other peptides which have the ability to induce CTLs against cancerous cells, other polynucleotides encoding the other peptides, other cells that present the other peptides, or such. Herein, the other peptides that have the ability to induce CTLs against cancerous cells are exemplified by cancer specific antigens (e.g., identified TAAs), but are not limited thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf needed, the pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention may optionally include other therapeutic substances as an active ingredient, so long as the substance does not inhibit the antitumoral effect of the active ingredient, e.g., any of the present peptides. For example, formulations may include anti-inflammatory substances or compositions, pain killers, chemotherapeutics, and the like. In addition to other therapeutic substances in the medicament itself, the medicaments of the present invention may also be administered sequentially or concurrently with the one or more other pharmacologic substances or compositions. The amounts of medicament and pharmacologic substance or composition depend, for example, on what type of pharmacologic substance(s) or composition(s) is/are used, the disease being treated, and the scheduling and routes of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned herein, the pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention may include other substances or compositions conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the present pharmaceutical substances or compositions may be included in articles of manufacture and kits containing materials useful for treating the pathological conditions of the disease to be treated, e.g., cancer. The article of manufacture may include a container of any of the present pharmaceutical substances or compositions with a label. Suitable containers include bottles, vials, and test tubes. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials, such as glass or plastic. The label on the container should indicate the substance or composition is used for treating or prevention of one or more conditions of the disease. The label may also indicate directions for administration and so on.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the container described above, a kit including a pharmaceutical substance or composition of the present invention may optionally further include a second container housing a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts with instructions for use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions can, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which can contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack can, for example, include metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device can be accompanied by instructions for administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) Pharmaceutical Substances or Compositions Containing the Peptides as the Active Ingredient The peptides of the present invention can be administered directly as a pharmaceutical substance or composition, or if necessary, that has been formulated by conventional formulation methods. In the latter case, in addition to the peptides of the present invention, carriers, excipients, and such that are ordinarily used for drugs can be included as appropriate without particular limitations. Examples of such carriers are sterilized water, physiological saline, phosphate buffer, culture fluid and such. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical substances or compositions can contain as necessary, stabilizers, suspensions, preservatives, surfactants and such. The pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention can be used for anticancer purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the present invention can be prepared in combination, which includes two or more of peptides of the present invention, to induce CTL in vivo. The peptides can be in a cocktail or can be conjugated to each other using standard techniques. For example, the peptides can be chemically linked or expressed as a single fusion polypeptide sequence that may have one or several amino acid(s) as a linker (e.g., Lysine linker: K. S. Kawamura et al. J. Immunol. 2002, 168: 5709-5715). The peptides in the combination can be the same or different. By administering the peptides of the present invention, the peptides are presented in high density by the HLA antigens on APCs, then CTLs that specifically react toward the complex formed between the displayed peptide and the HLA antigen are induced. Alternatively, APCs (e.g., DCs) are removed from subjects and then stimulated by the peptides of the present invention to obtain APCs that present any of the peptides of the present invention on their cell surface. These APCs are readministered to the subjects to induce CTLs in the subjects, and as a result, aggressiveness towards the tumor-associated endothelium can be increased.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical substances or compositions for treatment and/or prevention of cancer, which include any of the peptides of the present invention as the active ingredient, can include an adjuvant so that cellular immunity will be established effectively, or they can be administered with other active ingredients, and they can be administered by formulation into granules. An adjuvant refers to any compound, substance or composition that enhances the immune response against the protein when administered together (or successively) with the protein having immunological activity. An adjuvant that can be applied includes those described in the literature (Clin Microbiol Rev 1994, 7: 277-89). Exemplary adjuvants include aluminum phosphate, aluminum hydroxide, alum, cholera toxin, \nsalmonella \ntoxin, Incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), ISCOMatrix, GM-CSF, CpG, O/W emulsion, and such, but are not limited thereto.\n\n\n \n \nFurthermore, liposome formulations, granular formulations in which the peptide is bound to few-micrometers diameter beads, and formulations in which a lipid is bound to the peptide may be conveniently used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, the peptides of the present invention may also be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Preferable examples of the salts include salts with an alkali metal, salts with a metal, salts with an organic base, salts with an organic acid and salts with an inorganic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention include a component which primes CTL. Lipids have been identified as substances or compositions capable of priming CTL in vivo against viral antigens. For example, palmitic acid residues can be attached to the epsilon- and alpha-amino groups of a lysine residue and then linked to a peptide of the present invention. The lipidated peptide can then be administered either directly in a micelle or particle, incorporated into a liposome, or emulsified in an adjuvant. As another example of lipid priming of CTL responses, \nE. coli \nlipoproteins, such as tripalmitoylS-glycerylcysteinyl-seryl-serine (P3CSS) can be used to prime CTL when covalently attached to an appropriate peptide (see, e.g., Deres et al., Nature 1989, 342: 561-4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method of administration can be oral, intradermal, subcutaneous, intravenous injection, or such, and systemic administration or local administration to the vicinity of the targeted sites. The administration can be performed by single administration or boosted by multiple administrations. The dose of the peptides of the present invention can be adjusted appropriately according to the disease to be treated, age of the patient, weight, method of administration, and such, and is ordinarily 0.001 mg to 1,000 mg, for example, 0.001 mg to 1,000 mg, for example, 0.1 mg to 10 mg, and can be administered once in a few days to few months. One skilled in the art can appropriately select a suitable dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) Pharmaceutical Substances or Compositions Containing Polynucleotides as Active Ingredient\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention can also include nucleic acids encoding the peptide(s) disclosed herein in an expressible form. Herein, the phrase “in an expressible form” means that the polynucleotide, when introduced into a cell, will be expressed in vivo as a polypeptide that induces anti-tumor immunity. In an exemplified embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence of the polynucleotide of interest includes regulatory elements necessary for expression of the polynucleotide. The polynucleotide(s) can be equipped so to achieve stable insertion into the genome of the target cell (see, e.g., Thomas K R & Capecchi M R, Cell 1987, 51: 503-12 for a description of homologous recombination cassette vectors. See also, e.g., Wolff et al., Science 1990, 247: 1465-8; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,580,859; 5,589,466; 5,804,566; 5,739,118; 5,736,524; 5,679,647; and WO 98/04720). Examples of DNA-based delivery technologies include “naked DNA”, facilitated (bupivacaine, polymers, peptide-mediated) delivery, cationic lipid complexes, and particle-mediated (“gene gun”) or pressure-mediated delivery (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,687).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the present invention can also be expressed by viral or bacterial vectors. Examples of expression vectors include attenuated viral hosts, such as vaccinia or fowlpox. This approach involves the use of vaccinia virus, e.g., as a vector to express nucleotide sequences that encode the peptide. Upon introduction into a host, the recombinant vaccinia virus expresses the immunogenic peptide, and thereby elicits an immune response. Vaccinia vectors and methods useful in immunization protocols are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,722,848. Another vector is BCG (Bacille Calmette Guerin). BCG vectors are described in Stover et al., Nature 1991, 351: 456-60. A wide variety of other vectors useful for therapeutic administration or immunization, e.g., adeno and adeno-associated virus vectors, retroviral vectors, \nSalmonella typhi \nvectors, detoxified anthrax toxin vectors, and the like, will be apparent. See, e.g., Shata et al., \nMol Med Today\n 2000, 6: 66-71; Shedlock et al., \nJ Leukoc Biol\n 2000, 68: 793-806; Hipp et al., In \nVivo\n 2000, 14: 571-85.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery of a polynucleotide into a patient can be either direct, in which case the patient is directly exposed to a polynucleotide-carrying vector, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the polynucleotide of interest in vitro, then the cells are transplanted into the patient. Theses two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo and ex vivo gene therapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al., Clinical Pharmacy 1993, 12: 488-505; Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 1991, 3: 87-95; Tolstoshev, Ann Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 1993, 33: 573-96; Mulligan, Science 1993, 260: 926-32; Morgan & Anderson, Ann Rev Biochem 1993, 62: 191-217; Trends in Biotechnology 1993, 11(5): 155-215). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can also be used for the present invention are described in eds. Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY, 1993; and Krieger, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY, 1990.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method of administration can be oral, intradermal, subcutaneous, intravenous injection, or such, and systemic administration or local administration to the vicinity of the targeted sites finds use. The administration can be performed by single administration or boosted by multiple administrations. The dose of the polynucleotide in the suitable carrier or cells transformed with the polynucleotide encoding the peptides of the present invention can be adjusted appropriately according to the disease to be treated, age of the patient, weight, method of administration, and such, and is ordinarily 0.001 mg to 1000 mg, for example, 0.001 mg to 1000 mg, for example, 0.1 mg to 10 mg, and can be administered once every a few days to once every few months. One skilled in the art can appropriately select the suitable dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX. Methods Using the Peptides, Exosomes, APCs and CTLs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides and polynucleotides of the present invention can be used for preparing or inducing APCs and CTLs. The exosomes and APCs of the present invention can be also used for inducing CTLs. The peptides, polynucleotides, exosomes and APCs can be used in combination with any other compounds so long as the compounds do not inhibit their CTL inducibility. Thus, any of the aforementioned pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention can be used for inducing CTLs, and in addition thereto, those including the peptides and polynucleotides can be also be used for inducing APCs as explained below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) Method of Inducing Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods of inducing APCs with high CTL inducibility using the peptides or polynucleotides of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods of the present invention include the step of contacting APCs with the peptides of the present invention in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo. For example, the method contacting APCs with the peptides ex vivo can include steps of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \na: collecting APCs from a subject, and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb: contacting the APCs of step a with the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe APCs are not limited to a particular kind of cells and include DCs, Langerhans cells, macrophages, B cells, and activated T cells, which are known to present proteinaceous antigens on their cell surface so as to be recognized by lymphocytes. Preferably, DCs can be used since they have the strongest CTL inducibility among APCs. Any peptides of the present invention can be used by themselves or with other peptides of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hands, when the peptides of the present invention are administered to a subject, the APCs are contacted with the peptides in vivo, consequently, the APCs with high CTL inducibility are induced in the body of the subject. Thus, the present invention includes administering the peptides of the present invention to a subject. Similarly, when the polynucleotides of the present invention are administered to a subject in an expressible form, the peptides of the present invention are expressed and contacted with APCs in vivo, consequently, the APCs with high CTL inducibility are induced in the body of the subject. Thus, the present invention may also include administering the polynucleotides of the present invention to a subject. “Expressible form” is described above in section “IX. Pharmaceutical substances or compositions, (2) Pharmaceutical substances or compositions containing polynucleotides as the active ingredient”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the present invention may include introducing the polynucleotide of the present invention into an APCs to induce APCs with CTL inducibility. For example, the method can include steps of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \na: collecting APCs from a subject, and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb: introducing a polynucleotide encoding peptide of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep b can be performed as described above in section “VI. Antigen-presenting cells”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the present invention provides a method for preparing an antigen-presenting cell (APC) which specifically induces CTL activity against NEIL3, wherein the method can include one of the following steps:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) contacting an APC with a peptide of the present invention in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) introducing a polynucleotide encoding a peptide of the present invention into an APC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) Method of Inducing CTLs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the present invention provides methods for inducing CTLs using the peptides, polynucleotides, exosomes or APCs of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides methods for inducing CTLs using a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide that is capable of forming a T cell receptor (TCR) subunit recognizing a complex of the peptides of the present invention and HLA antigens. Preferably, the methods for inducing CTLs may include at least one step selected from the group consisting of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \na) contacting a CD8 positive T cell with an antigen-presenting cell and/or an exosome that presents on its surface a complex of an HLA antigen and a peptide of the preset invention; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb) introducing a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide that is capable of forming a TCR subunit recognizing a complex of a peptide of the present invention and an HLA antigen into a CD8 positive cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the peptides, the polynucleotides, APCs, or exosomes of the present invention are administered to a subject, CTLs are induced in the body of the subject, and the strength of the immune response targeting the cancer cells is enhanced. Thus, the methods of the present invention includes the step of administering the peptides, the polynucleotides, the APCs or exosomes of the present invention to a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, CTLs can be also induced by using them ex vivo, and after inducing CTL, the activated CTLs can be returned to the subject. For example, the method can include steps of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \na: collecting APCs from a subject;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb: contacting with the APCs of step a, with the peptide; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc: co-culturing the APCs of step b with CD8 positive cells.\n\n\n \n \nThe APCs to be co-cultured with the CD8 positive cells in above step c can also be prepared by transferring a gene that includes a polynucleotide of the present invention into APCs as described above in section “VI. Antigen-presenting cells”; but are not limited thereto, and any APCs which effectively present on its surface a complex of an HLA antigen and the peptide of the present invention can be used for the present method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInstead of such APCs, the exosomes that presents on its surface a complex of an HLA antigen and the peptide of the present invention can be also used. Namely, the present invention can include the step of co-culturing exosomes presenting on its surface a complex of an HLA antigen and the peptide of the present invention. Such exosomes can be prepared by the methods described above in section “V. Exosomes”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, CTL can be induced by introducing a gene that includes a polynucleotide encoding the TCR subunit binding to the peptide of the present invention into CD8 positive cells. Such transduction can be performed as described above in section “VIII. T cell receptor (TCR)”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the present invention provides a method or process for manufacturing a pharmaceutical substance or composition inducing CTLs, wherein the method includes the step of admixing or formulating the peptide of the present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) Method of Inducing Immune Response\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the present invention provides methods of inducing immune response against diseases related to NEIL3. Suitable diseases may include cancer, for example, but not limited to, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods may include the step of administering substance(s) or composition(s) containing any of the peptides of the present invention or polynucleotides encoding them. The present inventive method may also contemplate the administration of exosomes or APCs presenting any of the peptides of the present invention. For details, see the item of “IX. Pharmaceutical substances or compositions”, particularly the part describing the use of the pharmaceutical substances or compositions of the present invention as vaccines. In addition, the exosomes and APCs that can be employed for the present methods for inducing immune response are described in detail under the items of “V. Exosomes”, “VI. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs)”, and (1) and (2) of “X. Methods using the peptides, exosomes, APCs and CTLs”, supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method or process for manufacturing a pharmaceutical substance or composition inducing immune response, wherein the method may include the step of admixing or formulating the peptide of the present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \nAlternatively, the method of the present invention may include the step of administrating a vaccine or a pharmaceutical composition, which contains:\n\n\n(a) a peptide of the present invention;\n\n\n(b) a nucleic acid encoding such a peptide as disclosed herein in an expressible form;\n\n\n(c) an APC or an exosome presenting a peptide of the present invention on its surface; or\n\n\n(d) a cytotoxic T cell of the present invention.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present invention, cancer overexpressing NEIL3 can be treated with these active ingredients. The cancer includes, but is not limited to, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML. Accordingly, prior to the administration of the vaccines or pharmaceutical compositions including the active ingredients, it is preferable to confirm whether the expression level of NEIL3 in the cells or tissues to be treated is enhanced compared with normal cells of the same organ. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating cancer (over)expressing NEIL3, which method may include the steps of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \ni) determining the expression level of NEIL3 in cells or tissue(s) obtained from a subject with the cancer to be treated;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nii) comparing the expression level of NEIL3 with normal control; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \niii) administrating at least one component selected from the group consisting of (a) to\n\n\n \n \n(d) described above to a subject with cancer overexpressing NEIL3 compared with normal control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the present invention also provides a vaccine or pharmaceutical composition including at least one component selected from the group consisting of (a) to (d) described above, for use in administrating to a subject having cancer overexpressing NEIL3. In other words, the present invention further provides a method for identifying a subject to be treated with the NEIL3 polypeptide of the present invention, which method may include the step of determining an expression level of NEIL3 in subject-derived cells or tissue(s), wherein an increase of the level compared to a normal control level of the gene indicates that the subject may have cancer which may be treated with the NEIL3 polypeptide of the present invention. The method of treating cancer of the present invention will be described in more detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of the present invention, a control level determined from a biological sample that is known to be non-cancerous is referred to as a “normal control level”. On the other hand, if the control level is determined from a cancerous biological sample, it is referred to as a “cancerous control level”.\n\n\n \n \nA subject to be treated by the present method is preferably a mammal. Exemplary mammals include, but are not limited to, e.g., human, non-human primate, mouse, rat, dog, cat, horse, and cow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention, the expression level of NEIL3 in cells or tissues obtained from a subject may be determined. The expression level can be determined at the transcription (nucleic acid) product level, using methods known in the art. For example, the mRNA of NEIL3 may be quantified using probes by hybridization methods (e.g., Northern hybridization). The detection may be carried out on a chip, an array or as such. The use of an array may be preferable for detecting the expression level of NEIL3. Those skilled in the art can prepare such probes utilizing the sequence information of NEIL3. For example, the cDNA of NEIL3 may be used as the probes. If necessary, the probes may be labeled with a suitable label, such as dyes, fluorescent substances and isotopes, and the expression level of the gene may be detected as the intensity of the hybridized labels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the transcription product of NEIL3 (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 45) may be quantified using primers by amplification-based detection methods (e.g., RT-PCR). Such primers may be prepared based on the available sequence information of the gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, a probe or primer used for the present method hybridizes under stringent, moderately stringent, or low stringent conditions to the mRNA of NEIL3. As used herein, the phrase “stringent (hybridization) conditions” refers to conditions under which a probe or primer will hybridize to its target sequence, but not to other sequences. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different under different circumstances. Specific hybridization of longer sequences is observed at higher temperatures than shorter sequences. Generally, the temperature of a stringent condition is selected to be about 5 degrees C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for a specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The Tm is the temperature (under a defined ionic strength, pH and nucleic acid concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to their target sequence hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium. Since the target sequences are generally present at excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium. Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30 degrees C. for short probes or primers (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60 degrees C. for longer probes or primers. Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing substances, such as formamide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the translation product may be detected for the diagnosis of the present invention. For example, the quantity of NEIL3 protein (SEQ ID NO: 45) or the immunologically fragment thereof may be determined. Methods for determining the quantity of the protein as the translation product include immunoassay methods that use an antibody specifically recognizing the protein. The antibody may be monoclonal or polyclonal. Furthermore, any fragment or modification (e.g., chimeric antibody, scFv, Fab, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, etc.) of the antibody may be used for the detection, so long as the fragment or modified antibody retains the binding ability to the NEIL3 protein. Such antibodies against the peptides of the present invention and the fragments thereof are also provided by the present invention. Methods to prepare these kinds of antibodies for the detection of proteins are well known in the art, and any method may be employed in the present invention to prepare such antibodies and equivalents thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs another method to detect the expression level of NEIL3 gene based on its translation product, the intensity of staining may be measured via immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody against the NEIL3 protein. Namely, in this measurement, strong staining indicates increased presence/level of the protein and, at the same time, high expression level of NEIL3 gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression level of a target gene, e.g., the NEIL3 gene, in cancer cells can be determined to be increased if the level increases from the control level (e.g., the level in normal cells) of the target gene by, for example, 10%, 25%, or 50%; or increases to more than 1.1 fold, more than 1.5 fold, more than 2.0 fold, more than 5.0 fold, more than 10.0 fold, or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe control level may be determined at the same time with the cancer cells by using a sample(s) previously collected and stored from a subject(s) whose disease state(s) (cancerous or non-cancerous) is/are known. In addition, normal cells obtained from non-cancerous regions of an organ that has the cancer to be treated may be used as normal control. Alternatively, the control level may be determined by a statistical method based on the results obtained by analyzing previously determined expression level(s) of NEIL3 gene in samples from subjects whose disease states are known. Furthermore, the control level can be derived from a database of expression patterns from previously tested cells. Moreover, according to an aspect of the present invention, the expression level of NEIL3 gene in a biological sample may be compared to multiple control levels, which are determined from multiple reference samples. It is preferred to use a control level determined from a reference sample derived from a tissue type similar to that of the subject-derived biological sample. Moreover, it is preferred to use the standard value of the expression levels of NEIL3 gene in a population with a known disease state. The standard value may be obtained by any method known in the art. For example, a range of mean+/−2 S.D. or mean+/−3 S.D. may be used as the standard value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the expression level of NEIL3 gene is increased as compared to the normal control level, or is similar/equivalent to the cancerous control level, the subject may be diagnosed with cancer to be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore specifically, the present invention provides a method of (i) diagnosing whether a subject suspected to have cancer to be treated, and/or (ii) selecting a subject for cancer treatment, which method may include the steps of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \na) determining the expression level of NEIL3 in cells or tissue(s) obtained from a subject who is suspected to have the cancer to be treated;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb) comparing the expression level of NEIL3 with a normal control level;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc) diagnosing the subject as having the cancer to be treated, if the expression level of NEIL3 is increased as compared to the normal control level; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nd) selecting the subject for cancer treatment, if the subject is diagnosed as having the cancer to be treated, in step c).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, such a method may include the steps of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \na) determining the expression level of NEIL3 in cells or tissue(s) obtained from a subject who is suspected to have the cancer to be treated;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb) comparing the expression level of NEIL3 with a cancerous control level;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc) diagnosing the subject as having the cancer to be treated, if the expression level of NEIL3 is similar or equivalent to the cancerous control level; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nd) selecting the subject for cancer treatment, if the subject is diagnosed as having the cancer to be treated, in step c).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a diagnostic kit for diagnosing or determining a subject who is or is suspected to be suffering from cancer that can be treated with the NEIL3 polypeptide of the present invention, which may also find use in assessing and/or monitoring the efficacy or applicability of a cancer immunotherapy. Preferably, the cancer includes, but is not limited to, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML. More particularly, the kit preferably may include at least one reagent for detecting the expression of the NEIL3 gene in a subject-derived cell, which reagent may be selected from the group of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) a reagent for detecting mRNA of the NEIL3 gene;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) a reagent for detecting the NEIL3 protein or the immunologically fragment thereof; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) a reagent for detecting the biological activity of the NEIL3 protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable reagents for detecting mRNA of the NEIL3 gene may include nucleic acids that specifically bind to or identify the NEIL3 mRNA, such as oligonucleotides which have a complementary sequence to a portion of the NEIL3 mRNA. These kinds of oligonucleotides are exemplified by primers and probes that are specific to the NEIL3 mRNA. These kinds of oligonucleotides may be prepared based on methods well known in the art. If needed, the reagent for detecting the NEIL3 mRNA may be immobilized on a solid matrix. Moreover, more than one reagent for detecting the NEIL3 mRNA may be included in the kit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, suitable reagents for detecting the NEIL3 protein or the immunologically fragment thereof may include antibodies to the NEIL3 protein or the immunologically fragment thereof. The antibody may be monoclonal or polyclonal. Furthermore, any fragment or modification (e.g., chimeric antibody, scFv, Fab, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, etc.) of the antibody may be used as the reagent, so long as the fragment or modified antibody retains the binding ability to the NEIL3 protein or the immunologically fragment thereof. Methods to prepare these kinds of antibodies for the detection of proteins are well known in the art, and any method may be employed in the present invention to prepare such antibodies and equivalents thereof. Furthermore, the antibody may be labeled with signal generating molecules via direct linkage or an indirect labeling technique. Labels and methods for labeling antibodies and detecting the binding of the antibodies to their targets are well known in the art, and any labels and methods may be employed for the present invention. Moreover, more than one reagent for detecting the NEIL3 protein may be included in the kit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kit may contain more than one of the aforementioned reagents. For example, tissue samples obtained from subjects without cancer or suffering from cancer, may serve as useful control reagents. A kit of the present invention may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts (e.g., written, tape, CD-ROM, etc.) with instructions for use. These reagents and such may be retained in a container with a label. Suitable containers may include bottles, vials, and test tubes. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials, such as glass or plastic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the present invention, when the reagent is a probe against the NEIL3 mRNA, the reagent may be immobilized on a solid matrix, such as a porous strip, to form at least one detection site. The measurement or detection region of the porous strip may include a plurality of sites, each containing a nucleic acid (probe). A test strip may also contain sites for negative and/or positive controls. Alternatively, control sites may be located on a strip separated from the test strip. Optionally, the different detection sites may contain different amounts of immobilized nucleic acids, i.e., a higher amount in the first detection site and lesser amounts in subsequent sites. Upon the addition of a test sample, the number of sites displaying a detectable signal provides a quantitative indication of the amount of NEIL3 mRNA present in the sample. The detection sites may be configured in any suitably detectable shape and are typically in the shape of a bar or dot spanning the width of a test strip.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kit of the present invention may further include a positive control sample or NEIL3 standard sample. The positive control sample of the present invention may be prepared by collecting NEIL3 positive samples and then assaying their NEIL3 levels. Alternatively, a purified NEIL3 protein or polynucleotide may be added to cells that do not express NEIL3 to form the positive sample or the NEIL3 standard sample. In the present invention, purified NEIL3 may be a recombinant protein. The NEIL3 level of the positive control sample is, for example, more than the cut off value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the present invention further provides a diagnostic kit including, a protein or a partial protein thereof capable of specifically recognizing the antibody of the present invention or the fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of the partial peptide of the protein of the present invention include polypeptides consisting of at least 8, preferably 15, and more preferably 20 contiguous amino acids in the amino acid sequence of the protein of the present invention. Cancer can be diagnosed by detecting an antibody in a sample (e.g., blood, tissue) using a protein or a peptide (polypeptide) of the present invention. The method for preparing the protein of the present invention and peptides are as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiagnostic method for cancer can be done by determining the difference between the amount of anti-NEIL3 antibody and that in the corresponding control sample as describe above. The subject is suspected to be suffering from cancer, if cells or tissues of the subject contain antibodies against the expression products (NEIL3) of the gene and the quantity of the anti-NEIL3 antibody is determined to be more than the cut off value in level compared to that in normal control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a diagnostic kit of the present invention may include the peptide of the present invention and an HLA molecule binding thereto. The method for detecting antigen specific CTLs using antigenic peptides and HLA molecules has already been established (for example, Altman J D et al., Science. 1996, 274(5284): 94-6). Thus, the complex of the peptide of the present invention and the HLA molecule can be applied to the detection method to detect tumor antigen specific CTLs, thereby enabling earlier detection, recurrence and/or metastasis of cancer. Further, it can be employed for the selection of subjects applicable with the pharmaceuticals including the peptide of the present invention as an active ingredient, or the assessment of the treatment effect of the pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly, according to the known method (see, for example, Altman J D et al., Science. 1996, 274(5284): 94-6), the oligomer complex, such as tetramer, of the radiolabeled HLA molecule and the peptide of the present invention can be prepared. With using the complex, the diagnosis can be done, for example, by quantifying the antigen-peptide specific CTLs in the peripheral blood lymphocytes derived from the subject suspected to be suffering from cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a method or diagnostic agents for evaluating immunological response of subject by using peptide epitopes as described herein. In one embodiment of the invention, HLA restricted peptides as described herein may be used as reagents for evaluating or predicting an immune response of a subject. The immune response to be evaluated may be induced by contacting an immunogen with immunocompetent cells in vitro or in vivo. In some embodiments, any substances or compositions that may result in the production of antigen specific CTLs that recognize and bind to the peptide epitope(s) may be employed as the reagent. The peptide reagents may need not to be used as the immunogen. Assay systems that are used for such an analysis include relatively recent technical developments such as tetramers, staining for intracellular lymphokines and interferon release assays, or ELISPOT assays. In a preferred embodiment, immunocompetent cells to be contacted with peptide reagent may be antigen presenting cells including dendritic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, peptides of the present invention may be used in tetramer staining assays to assess peripheral blood mononuclear cells for the presence of antigen-specific CTLs following exposure to a tumor cell antigen or an immunogen. The HLA tetrameric complex may be used to directly visualize antigen specific CTLs (see, e.g., Ogg et al., Science 279: 2103-2106, 1998; and Altman et al, Science 174: 94-96, 1996) and determine the frequency of the antigen-specific CTL population in a sample of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A tetramer reagent using a peptide of the invention may be generated as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA peptide that binds to an HLA molecule is refolded in the presence of the corresponding HLA heavy chain and beta 2-microglobulin to generate a trimolecular complex. In the complex, carboxyl terminal of the heavy chain is biotinylated at a site that was previously engineered into the protein. Then, streptavidin is added to the complex to form tetramer consisting of the trimolecular complex and streptavidin. By means of fluorescently labeled streptavidin, the tetramer can be used to stain antigen specific cells. The cells can then be identified, for example, by flow cytometry. Such an analysis may be used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. Cells identified by the procedure can also be used for therapeutic purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides reagents to evaluate immune recall responses (see, e.g., Bertoni et al, J. Clin. Invest. 100: 503-513, 1997 and Penna et al., J. Exp. Med. 174: 1565-1570, 1991) including peptides of the present invention. For example, patient PBMC samples from individuals with cancer to be treated can be analyzed for the presence of antigen-specific CTLs using specific peptides. A blood sample containing mononuclear cells can be evaluated by cultivating the PBMCs and stimulating the cells with a peptide of the invention. After an appropriate cultivation period, the expanded cell population can be analyzed, for example, for CTL activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides may also be used as reagents to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine. PBMCs obtained from a patient vaccinated with an immunogen may be analyzed using, for example, either of the methods described above. The patient is HLA typed, and peptide epitope reagents that recognize the allele specific molecules present in the patient are selected for the analysis. The immunogenicity of the vaccine may be indicated by the presence of epitope-specific CTLs in the PBMC sample. The peptides of the invention may also be used to make antibodies, using techniques well known in the art (see, e.g., CURRENTPROTOCOLSINIMMUNOLOGY, Wiley/Greene, NY; and Antibodies A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Lane, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989), which may find use as reagents to diagnose, detect or monitor cancer. Such antibodies may include those that recognize a peptide in the context of an HLA molecule, i.e., antibodies that bind to a peptide-MHC complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the invention also provides a number of uses, some of which are described herein. For instance, the present invention provides a method for diagnosing or detecting a disorder characterized by expression of a NEIL3 immunogenic polypeptide. These methods involve determining expression of a NEIL3 HLA binding peptide, or a complex of a NEIL3 HLA binding peptide and an HLA class I molecule in a biological sample. The expression of a peptide or complex of peptide and HLA class I molecule can be determined or detected by assaying with a binding partner for the peptide or complex. In an preferred embodiment, a binding partner for the peptide or complex may be an antibody recognizes and specifically bind to the peptide. The expression of NEIL3 in a biological sample, such as a tumor biopsy, can also be tested by standard PCR amplification protocols using NEIL3 primers. An example of tumor expression is presented herein and further disclosure of exemplary conditions and primers for NEIL3 amplification can be found in WO2003/27322.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the diagnostic methods involve contacting a biological sample isolated from a subject with an agent specific for the NEIL3 HLA binding peptide to detect the presence of the NEIL3 HLA binding peptide in the biological sample. As used herein, “contacting” means placing the biological sample in sufficient proximity to the agent and under the appropriate conditions of, e.g., concentration, temperature, time, ionic strength, to allow the specific interaction between the agent and NEIL3 HLA binding peptide that are present in the biological sample. In general, the conditions for contacting the agent with the biological sample are conditions known by those of ordinary skill in the art to facilitate a specific interaction between a molecule and its cognate (e.g., a protein and its receptor cognate, an antibody and its protein antigen cognate, a nucleic acid and its complementary sequence cognate) in a biological sample. Exemplary conditions for facilitating a specific interaction between a molecule and its cognate are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,108,921, issued to Low et al.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diagnostic method of the present invention can be performed in either or both of in vivo and in vitro. Accordingly, biological sample can be located in vivo or in vitro in the present invention. For example, the biological sample can be a tissue in vivo and the agent specific for the NEIL3 immunogenic polypeptide can be used to detect the presence of such molecules in the tissue. Alternatively, the biological sample can be collected or isolated in vitro (e.g., a blood sample, tumor biopsy, tissue extract). In a particularly preferred embodiment, the biological sample can be a cell-containing sample, more preferably a sample containing tumor cells collected from a subject to be diagnosed or treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the diagnosis can be done, by a method which allows direct quantification of antigen-specific T cells by staining with Fluorescein-labeled HLA multimeric complexes (e.g., Altman, J. D. et al., 1996, Science 274: 94; Altman, J. D. et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 10330). Staining for intracellular lymphokines, and interferon-gamma release assays or ELISPOT assays also has been provided. Multimer staining, intracellular lymphokine staining and ELISPOT assays all appear to be at least 10-fold more sensitive than more conventional assays (Murali-Krishna, K. et al., 1998, Immunity 8: 177; Lalvani, A. et al., 1997, J. Exp. Med. 186: 859; Dunbar, P. R. et al., 1998, Curr. Biol. 8: 413). Pentamers (e.g., US 2004-209295A), dextramers (e.g., WO 02/072631), and streptamers (e.g., \nNature medicine\n 6. 631-637 (2002)) may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nXI. Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides antibodies that bind to the peptide of the present invention. Preferred antibodies specifically bind to the peptide of the present invention and will not bind (or will bind weakly) to non-peptide of the present invention. Alternatively, antibodies bind to the peptide of the invention as well as the homologs thereof. Antibodies against the peptide of the invention can find use in cancer diagnostic and prognostic assays, and imaging methodologies. Similarly, such antibodies can find use in the treatment, diagnosis, and/or prognosis of other cancers, to the extent NEIL3 is also expressed or overexpressed in cancer patient. Moreover, intracellularly expressed antibodies (e.g., single chain antibodies) may therapeutically find use in treating cancers in which the expression of NEIL3 is involved, such as, for example, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides various immunological assay for the detection and/or quantification of NEIL3 protein (SEQ ID NO: 45) or fragments thereof including polypeptide consisting of amino acid sequences selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43. Such assays may include one or more anti-NEIL3 antibodies capable of recognizing and binding a NEIL3 protein or fragments thereof, as appropriate. In the present invention, anti-NEIL3 antibodies binding to NEIL3 polypeptide preferably recognize polypeptide consisting of amino acid sequences selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43. A binding specificity of antibody can be confirmed with inhibition test. That is, when the binding between an antibody to be analyzed and full-length of NEIL3 polypeptide is inhibited under presence of any fragment polypeptides consisting of amino acid sequence of SEQ TD NOs: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43, it is shown that this antibody specifically binds to the fragment. In the present invention, such immunological assays are performed within various immunological assay formats well known in the art, including but not limited to, various types of radioimmunoassays, immuno-chromatograph technique, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), enzyme-linked immunofluorescent assays (ELIFA), and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelated immunological but non-antibody assays of the invention may also include T cell immunogenicity assays (inhibitory or stimulatory) as well as MHC binding assays. In addition, immunological imaging methods capable of detecting cancers expressing NEIL3 are also provided by the invention, including, but not limited to, radioscintigraphic imaging methods using labeled antibodies of the present invention. Such assays can clinically find use in the detection, monitoring, and prognosis of NEIL3 expressing cancers such as bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides an antibody that binds to the peptide of the invention. The antibody of the invention can be used in any form, such as monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, and include antiserum obtained by immunizing an animal such as a rabbit with the peptide of the invention, all classes of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, human antibodies and humanized antibodies produced by genetic recombination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA peptide of the invention used as an antigen to obtain an antibody may be derived from any animal species, but preferably is derived from a mammal such as a human, mouse, or rat, more preferably from a human. A human-derived peptide may be obtained from the nucleotide or amino acid sequences disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention, the peptide to be used as an immunization antigen may be a complete protein or a partial peptide of the protein. A partial peptide may include, for example, the amino (N)-terminal or carboxy (C)-terminal fragment of a peptide of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHerein, an antibody is defined as a protein that reacts with either the full length or a fragment of a NEIL3 peptide. In a preferred embodiment, antibody of the present invention can recognize fragment peptides of NEIL3 consisting of amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 33, 35, 41 and 43. Methods for synthesizing oligopeptide are well known in the arts. After the synthesis, peptides may be optionally purified prior to use as immunogen. In the present invention, the oligopeptide (e.g., 9- or 10mer) may be conjugated or linked with carriers to enhance the immunogenicity. Keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is well known as the carrier. Method for conjugating KLH and peptide are also well known in the arts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a gene encoding a peptide of the invention or fragment thereof may be inserted into a known expression vector, which is then used to transform a host cell as described herein. The desired peptide or fragment thereof may be recovered from the outside or inside of host cells by any standard method, and may subsequently be used as an antigen. Alternatively, whole cells expressing the peptide or their lysates or a chemically synthesized peptide may be used as the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny mammalian animal may be immunized with the antigen, but preferably the compatibility with parental cells used for cell fusion is taken into account. In general, animals of Rodentia, Lagomorpha or Primates may be used. Animals of Rodentia include, for example, mouse, rat and hamster. Animals of Lagomorpha include, for example, rabbit. Animals of Primates include, for example, a monkey of Catarrhini (old world monkey) such as \nMacaca fascicularis\n, rhesus monkey, sacred baboon and chimpanzees.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for immunizing animals with antigens are known in the art. Intraperitoneal injection or subcutaneous injection of antigens is a standard method for immunization of mammals. More specifically, antigens may be diluted and suspended in an appropriate amount of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), physiological saline, etc. If desired, the antigen suspension may be mixed with an appropriate amount of a standard adjuvant, such as Freund's complete adjuvant, made into emulsion and then administered to mammalian animals. Preferably, it is followed by several administrations of antigen mixed with an appropriately amount of Freund's incomplete adjuvant every 4 to 21 days. An appropriate carrier may also be used for immunization. After immunization as above, serum may be examined by a standard method for an increase in the amount of desired antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolyclonal antibodies against the peptides of the present invention may be prepared by collecting blood from the immunized mammal examined for the increase of desired antibodies in the serum, and by separating serum from the blood by any conventional method. Polyclonal antibodies include serum containing the polyclonal antibodies, as well as the fraction containing the polyclonal antibodies may be isolated from the serum. Immunoglobulin G or M can be prepared from a fraction which recognizes only the peptide of the present invention using, for example, an affinity column coupled with the peptide of the present invention, and further purifying this fraction using protein A or protein G column.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo prepare monoclonal antibodies, immune cells are collected from the mammal immunized with the antigen and checked for the increased level of desired antibodies in the serum as described above, and are subjected to cell fusion. The immune cells used for cell fusion may preferably be obtained from spleen. Other preferred parental cells to be fused with the above immunocyte include, for example, myeloma cells of mammalians, and more preferably myeloma cells having an acquired property for the selection of fused cells by drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above immunocyte and myeloma cells can be fused according to known methods, for example, the method of Milstein et al. (Galfre and Milstein, Methods Enzymol 73: 3-46 (1981)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResulting hybridomas obtained by the cell fusion may be selected by cultivating them in a standard selection medium, such as HAT medium (hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine containing medium). The cell culture is typically continued in the HAT medium for several days to several weeks, the time being sufficient to allow all the other cells, with the exception of the desired hybridoma (non-fused cells), to die. Then, the standard limiting dilution may be performed to screen and clone a hybridoma cell producing the desired antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the above method, in which a non-human animal is immunized with an antigen for preparing hybridoma, human lymphocytes such as those infected by EB virus may be immunized with a peptide, peptide expressing cells or their lysates in vitro. Then, the immunized lymphocytes are fused with human-derived myeloma cells that are capable of indefinitely dividing, such as U266, to yield a hybridoma producing a desired human antibody that is able to bind to the peptide can be obtained (Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application No. Sho 63-17688).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe obtained hybridomas are subsequently transplanted into the abdominal cavity of a mouse and the ascites are extracted. The obtained monoclonal antibodies can be purified by, for example, ammonium sulfate precipitation, a protein A or protein G column, DEAE ion exchange chromatography or an affinity column to which the peptide of the present invention is coupled. The antibody of the present invention can be used not only for purification and detection of the peptide of the present invention, but also as a candidate for agonists and antagonists of the peptide of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, an immune cell, such as an immunized lymphocyte, producing antibodies may be immortalized by an oncogene and used for preparing monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies thus obtained can be also recombinantly prepared using genetic engineering techniques (see, for example, Borrebaeck and Larrick, Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies, published in the United Kingdom by MacMillan Publishers LTD (1990)). For example, a DNA encoding an antibody may be cloned from an immune cell, such as a hybridoma or an immunized lymphocyte producing the antibody, inserted into an appropriate vector, and introduced into host cells to prepare a recombinant antibody. The present invention also provides recombinant antibodies prepared as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, an antibody of the present invention may be a fragment of an antibody or modified antibody, so long as it binds to one or more of the peptides of the invention. For instance, the antibody fragment may be Fab, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv or single chain Fv (scFv), in which Fv fragments from H and L chains are ligated by an appropriate linker (Huston et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 85: 5879-83 (1988)). More specifically, an antibody fragment may be generated by treating an antibody with an enzyme, such as papain or pepsin. Alternatively, a gene encoding the antibody fragment may be constructed, inserted into an expression vector and expressed in an appropriate host cell (see, for example, Co et al., J Immunol 152: 2968-76 (1994); Better and Horwitz, Methods Enzymol 178: 476-96 (1989); Pluckthun and Skerra, Methods Enzymol 178: 497-515 (1989); Lamoyi, Methods Enzymol 121: 652-63 (1986); Rousseaux et al., Methods Enzymol 121: 663-9 (1986); Bird and Walker, Trends Biotechnol 9: 132-7 (1991)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody may be modified by conjugation with a variety of molecules, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). The present invention provides for such modified antibodies. The modified antibody can be obtained by chemically modifying an antibody. These modification methods are conventional in the field.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, an antibody of the present invention may be obtained as a chimeric antibody, between a variable region derived from nonhuman antibody and the constant region derived from human antibody, or as a humanized antibody, including the complementarity determining region (CDR) derived from nonhuman antibody, the frame work region (FR) and the constant region derived from human antibody. Such antibodies can be prepared according to known technology. Humanization can be performed by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody (see, e.g., Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534-1536 (1988)). Accordingly, such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies, wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFully human antibodies including human variable regions in addition to human framework and constant regions can also be used. Such antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. For example, in vitro methods involve use of recombinant libraries of human antibody fragments displayed on bacteriophage (e.g., Hoogenboom & Winter, J. Mol. Biol. 227:381 (1991). Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing of human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. This approach is described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,150,584, 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies obtained as above may be purified to homogeneity. For example, the separation and purification of the antibody can be performed according to separation and purification methods used for general proteins. For example, the antibody may be separated and isolated by the appropriately selected and combined use of column chromatographies, such as affinity chromatography, filter, ultrafiltration, salting-out, dialysis, SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing (Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Ed Harlow and David Lane, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1988)), but are not limited thereto. A protein A column and protein G column can be used as the affinity column. Exemplary protein A columns to be used include, for example, Hyper D, POROS and Sepharose F. F. (Pharmacia).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary chromatography, with the exception of affinity includes, for example, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, gel filtration, reverse phase chromatography, adsorption chromatography and the like (Strategies for Protein Purification and Characterization: A Laboratory Course Manual. Ed Daniel R. Marshak et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1996)). The chromatographic procedures can be carried out by liquid-phase chromatography, such as HPLC and FPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, measurement of absorbance, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), enzyme immunoassay (EIA), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and/or immunofluorescence may be used to measure the antigen binding activity of the antibody of the invention. In ELISA, the antibody of the present invention is immobilized on a plate, a peptide of the invention is applied to the plate, and then a sample containing a desired antibody, such as culture supernatant of antibody producing cells or purified antibodies, is applied. Then, a secondary antibody that recognizes the primary antibody and is labeled with an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, is applied, and the plate is incubated. Next, after washing, an enzyme substrate, such as p-nitrophenyl phosphate, is added to the plate, and the absorbance is measured to evaluate the antigen binding activity of the sample. A fragment of the peptide, such as a C-terminal or N-terminal fragment, may be used as the antigen to evaluate the binding activity of the antibody. BIAcore (Pharmacia) may be used to evaluate the activity of the antibody according to the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above methods allow for the detection or measurement of the peptide of the invention, by exposing the antibody of the invention to a sample assumed to contain the peptide of the invention, and detecting or measuring the immune complex formed by the antibody and the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause the method of detection or measurement of the peptide according to the invention can specifically detect or measure a peptide, the method can find use in a variety of experiments in which the peptide is used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nXII. Vectors and Host Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a vector and host cell into which a nucleotide encoding the peptide of the present invention is introduced. A vector of the present invention can find use to keep a nucleotide, especially a DNA, of the present invention in host cell, to express the peptide of the present invention, or to administer the nucleotide of the present invention for gene therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen \nE. coli \nis a host cell and the vector is amplified and produced in a large amount in \nE. coli \n(e.g., JM109, DH5 alpha, HB101 or XL1Blue), the vector should have “ori” to be amplified in \nE. coli \nand a marker gene for selecting transformed \nE. coli \n(e.g., a drug-resistance gene selected by a drug such as ampicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin, chloramphenicol or the like). For example, M13-series vectors, pUC-series vectors, pBR322, pBluescript, pCR-Script, etc., can be used. In addition, pGEM-T, pDIRECT and pT7 can also be used for subcloning and extracting cDNA as well as the vectors described above. When a vector is used to produce the protein of the present invention, an expression vector can find use. For example, an expression vector to be expressed in \nE. coli \nshould have the above characteristics to be amplified in \nE. coli\n. When \nE. coli\n, such as JM109, DH5 alpha, HB1011 or XL1 Blue, are used as a host cell, the vector should have a promoter, for example, lacZ promoter (Ward et al., Nature 341: 544-6 (1989); FASEB J 6: 2422-7 (1992)), araB promoter (Better et al., Science 240: 1041-3 (1988)), T7 promoter or the like, that can efficiently express the desired gene in \nE. coli\n. In that respect, pGEX-5X-1 (Pharmacia), “QIAexpress system” (Qiagen), pEGFP and pET (in this case, the host is preferably BL21 which expresses T7 RNA polymerase), for example, can be used instead of the above vectors. Additionally, the vector may also contain a signal sequence for peptide secretion. An exemplary signal sequence that directs the peptide to be secreted to the periplasm of the \nE. coli \nis the pelB signal sequence (Lei et al., J Bacteriol 169: 4379 (1987)). Means for introducing of the vectors into the target host cells include, for example, the calcium chloride method, and the electroporation method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to \nE. coli\n, for example, expression vectors derived from mammals (for example, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pEGF-BOS (Nucleic Acids Res 18(17): 5322 (1990)), pEF, pCDM8), expression vectors derived from insect cells (for example, “Bac-to-BAC baculovirus expression system” (GIBCO BRL), pBacPAK8), expression vectors derived from plants (e.g., pMH1, pMH2), expression vectors derived from animal viruses (e.g., pHSV, pMV, pAdexLcw), expression vectors derived from retroviruses (e.g., pZIpneo), expression vector derived from yeast (e.g., “\nPichia \nExpression Kit” (Invitrogen), pNV11, SP-Q01) and expression vectors derived from \nBacillus subtilis \n(e.g., pPL608, pKTH50) can be used for producing the polypeptide of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to express the vector in animal cells, such as CHO, COS or N1H3T3 cells, the vector should have a promoter necessary for expression in such cells, for example, the SV40 promoter (Mulligan et al., Nature 277: 108 (1979)), the MMLV-LTR promoter, the EF1 alpha promoter (Mizushima et al., Nucleic Acids Res 18: 5322 (1990)), the CMV promoter and the like, and preferably a marker gene for selecting transformants (for example, a drug resistance gene selected by a drug (e.g., neomycin, G418)). Examples of known vectors with these characteristics include, for example, pMAM, pDR2, pBK-RSV, pBK-CMV, pOPRSV and pOP13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nXIII. A Method for Diagnosing Cancer:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method of diagnosing cancer. The expression of NEIL3 was found to be specifically elevated in several kinds of cancer cells (Table 1 and \nFIG. 5\n). Therefore, the genes identified herein as well as their transcription and translation products find diagnostic utility as markers for cancer and by measuring the expression of NEIL3 in a biological sample (e.g., a cell sample), cancer can be diagnosed. Specifically, the present invention provides a method for diagnosing cancer by determining the expression level of NEIL3 in the subject. Cancers that can be diagnosed by the present method include, but nor limited to, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML. Furthermore, NSCLC, including lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), can also be diagnosed or detected by the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention, an intermediate result for examining the condition of a subject may be provided. Such intermediate result may be combined with additional information to assist a doctor, nurse, or other practitioner to diagnose that a subject suffers from the disease. Alternatively, the present invention may be used to detect cancerous cells in a subject-derived tissue, and provide a doctor with useful information to diagnose that the subject suffers from the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, the present invention provides the following methods [1] to [10]:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[1] A method for diagnosing cancer, said method including the steps of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) detecting the expression level of the gene encoding the amino acid sequence of NEIL3 in a biological sample; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) correlating an increase in the expression level detected as compared to a normal control level of the gene to the presence of disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[2] The method of [1], wherein the expression level is at least 10% greater than the normal control level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[3] The method of [1], wherein the expression level is detected by a methods selected from among:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) detecting an mRNA including the sequence of NEIL3,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) detecting a protein including the amino acid sequence of NEIL3, and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) detecting a biological activity of a protein including the amino acid sequence of NEIL3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[4] The method of [1], wherein the cancer is selected from group of bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[5] The method of [3], wherein the expression level is determined by detecting hybridization of a probe to a gene transcript of the gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[6] The method of [3], wherein the expression level is determined by detecting the binding of an antibody against the protein encoded by a gene as the expression level of the gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[7] The method of [1], wherein the biological sample includes biopsy, sputum, blood, pleural effusion or urine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[8] The method of [1], wherein the subject-derived biological sample includes an epithelial cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[9] The method of [1], wherein the subject-derived biological sample includes a cancer cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[10] The method of [1], wherein the subject-derived biological sample includes a cancerous epithelial cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the present invention provides a method for detecting or identifying cancer cells in a subject-derived tissue sample, said method including the step of determining the expression level of the NEIL3 gene in a subject-derived biological sample, wherein an increase in said expression level as compared to a normal control level of said gene indicates the presence or suspicion of cancer cells in the tissue. Such result may be combined with additional information to assist a doctor, nurse, or other healthcare practitioner in diagnosing a subject as afflicted with the disease. In other words, the present invention may provide a doctor with useful information to diagnose a subject as afflicted with the disease. For example, according to the present invention, when there is doubt regarding the presence of cancer cells in the tissue obtained from a subject, clinical decisions can be reached by considering the expression level of the NEIL3 gene, plus a different aspect of the disease including tissue pathology, levels of known tumor marker(s) in blood, and clinical course of the subject, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, some well-known diagnostic bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML markers in blood are as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nbladder cancer; SCC, TPA, or IAP\n\n\n \n \n \n \nbreast cancer; BCA225, TPA, CEA, IAP, or CA15-3\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncervical cancer; SCC, TPA, or CA125\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncholangiocellular carcinoma; CA 19-9, or CEA\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncolorectal cancer; CEA\n\n\n \n \n \n \nendometriosis; CA125\n\n\n \n \n \n \nesophagus cancer; CEA, DUPAN-2, TAP, NSE, SCC, SLX, or Span-1\n\n\n \n \n \n \nliver cancer; AFP, or ICDH\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNSCLC; CEA\n\n\n \n \n \n \nosteosarcoma; ALP\n\n\n \n \n \n \npancreatic cancer; BFP, CA19-9, CA125, or CEA\n\n\n \n \n \n \nprostate cancer; PSA, or PAP\n\n\n \n \n \n \nrenal cell carcinoma; IAP\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSCLC; ProGRP or NSE\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAML; TK activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCML; TK activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNamely, in this particular embodiment of the present invention, the outcome of the gene expression analysis serves as an intermediate result for further diagnosis of a subject's disease state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for detecting a diagnostic marker of cancer, said method including the step of detecting the expression of the NEIL3 gene in a subject-derived biological sample as a diagnostic marker of bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, NSCLC, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal carcinoma, SCLC, soft tissue tumor, AML and CML, but not limited thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method of diagnosing cancer will be described in more detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA subject to be diagnosed by the present method is preferably a mammal. Exemplary mammals include, but are not limited to, e.g., human, non-human primate, mouse, rat, dog, cat, horse, and cow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is preferred to collect a biological sample from the subject to be diagnosed to perform the diagnosis. Any biological material can be used as the biological sample for the determination so long as it includes the objective transcription or translation product of NEIL3. The biological samples include, but are not limited to, bodily tissues and fluids, such as blood, sputum and urine. In some embodiments, the biological sample contains a cell population comprising an epithelial cell, more preferably a cancerous epithelial cell or an epithelial cell derived from tissue suspected to be cancerous. Further, if necessary, the cell may be purified from the obtained bodily tissues and fluids, and then used as the biological sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention, the expression level of NEIL3 in the subject-derived biological sample is determined. The expression level can be determined at the transcription (nucleic acid) product level, using methods known in the art. For example, the mRNA of NEIL3 may be quantified using probes by hybridization methods (e.g., Northern hybridization). The detection may be carried out on a chip or an array. The use of an array is preferable for detecting the expression level of a plurality of genes (e.g., various cancer specific genes) including NEIL3. Those skilled in the art can prepare such probes utilizing the sequence information of the NEIL3 (SEQ ID NO: 44; GenBank accession number: NM\n—\n018248). For example, the cDNA of NEIL3 may be used as the probes. If necessary, the probe may be labeled with a suitable label, such as dyes, fluorescent and isotopes, and the expression level of the gene may be detected as the intensity of the hybridized labels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the transcription product of NEIL3 may be quantified using primers by amplification-based detection methods (e.g., RT-PCR). Such primers can also be prepared based on the available sequence information of the gene. For example, the primers (SEQ ID NOs: 46 and 47) used in the Example may be employed for the detection by RT-PCR or Northern blot, but the present invention is not restricted thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, a probe or primer used for the present method hybridizes under stringent, moderately stringent, or low stringent conditions to the mRNA of NEIL3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the translation product may be detected for the diagnosis of the present invention. For example, the quantity of NEIL3 protein may be determined. A method for determining the quantity of the protein as the translation product includes immunoassay methods that use an antibody specifically recognizing the protein. The antibody may be monoclonal or polyclonal. Furthermore, any fragment or modification (e.g., chimeric antibody, scFv, Fab, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, etc.) of the antibody may be used for the detection, so long as the fragment retains the binding ability to NEIL3 protein. Methods to prepare these kinds of antibodies for the detection of proteins are well known in the art, and any method may be employed in the present invention to prepare such antibodies and equivalents thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs another method to detect the expression level of NEIL3 gene based on its translation product, the intensity of staining may be observed via immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody against NEIL3 protein. Namely, the observation of strong staining indicates increased presence of the protein and at the same time high expression level of NEIL3 gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, in addition to the expression level of NEIL3 gene, the expression level of other cancer-associated genes, for example, genes known to be differentially expressed in cancer may also be determined to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression level of cancer marker gene including NEIL3 gene in a biological sample can be considered to be increased if it increases from the control level of the corresponding cancer marker gene by, for example, 10%, 25%, or 50%; or increases to more than 1.1 fold, more than 1.5 fold, more than 2.0 fold, more than 5.0 fold, more than 10.0 fold, or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe control level may be determined at the same time with the test biological sample by using a sample(s) previously collected and stored from a subject/subjects whose disease state (cancerous or non-cancerous) is/are known. Alternatively, the control level may be determined by a statistical method based on the results obtained by analyzing previously determined expression level(s) of NEIL3 gene in samples from subjects whose disease state are known. Furthermore, the control level can be a database of expression patterns from previously tested cells. Moreover, according to an aspect of the present invention, the expression level of NEIL3 gene in a biological sample may be compared to multiple control levels, which control levels are determined from multiple reference samples. It is preferred to use a control level determined from a reference sample derived from a tissue type similar to that of the patient-derived biological sample. Moreover, it is preferred, to use the standard value of the expression levels of NEIL3 gene in a population with a known disease state. The standard value may be obtained by any method known in the art. For example, a range of mean+/−2 S.D. or mean+/−3 S.D. may be used as standard value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the expression level of NEIL3 gene is increased as compared to the normal control level or is similar to the cancerous control level, the subject may be diagnosed to be suffering from or at a risk of developing cancer. Furthermore, in the case where the expression levels of multiple cancer-related genes are compared, a similarity in the gene expression pattern between the sample and the reference which is cancerous indicates that the subject is suffering from or at a risk of developing cancer. Difference between the expression levels of a test biological sample and the control level can be normalized to the expression level of control nucleic acids, e.g., housekeeping genes, whose expression levels are known not to differ depending on the cancerous or non-cancerous state of the cell. Exemplary control genes include, but are not limited to, beta-actin, \nglyceraldehyde\n 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, and ribosomal protein P1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention will be further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nCell Lines\n\n\n \n \n \nT2 (HLA-A2), human B-lymphoblastoid cell line, COST and African green monkey kidney cell line, were purchased from ATCC and PSCCA0922 (HLA-*A0206) was purchased from Japan Health Sciences Foundation. TISI, HLA-A*2402-positive B-lymphoblastoid cell line, was purchased from the IHWG Cell and Gene Bank (Seattle, Wash.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCandidate Selection of Peptides Derived from NEIL3\n\n\n \n \n \n \n9-mer and 10-mer peptides derived from NEIL3 that bind to HLA-A*0201 molecule were predicted using binding prediction software “BIMAS” (www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/molbio/hla_bind) (Parker et al. (J Immunol 1994, 152(1): 163-75), Kuzushima et al. (Blood 2001, 98(6): 1872-81)). 9-mer and 10-mer peptides derived from NEIL3 that bind to HLA-A*2402 molecule were predicted using “NetMHC3.0” binding prediction server (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC/) (Buus et al. (Tissue Antigens., 62:378-84, 2003), Nielsen et al. (Protein Sci., 12:1007-17, 2003, Bioinformatics, 20(9):1388-97, 2004)). These peptides were synthesized by Biosynthesis Inc. (Lewisville, Tex.) according to a standard solid phase synthesis method and purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The purity (>90%) and the identity of the peptides were determined by analytical HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis, respectively. Peptides were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 20 mg/ml and stored at −80 degrees C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vitro CTL Induction\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were used as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against peptides presented on human leukocyte antigen (HLA). DCs were generated in vitro as described elsewhere (Nakahara S et al., Cancer Res 2003 Jul. 15, 63(14): 4112-8). Specifically, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from a normal volunteer (HLA-A*0201 or HLA-A*0206 positive) by Ficoll-Plaque (Pharmacia) solution were separated by adherence to a plastic tissue culture dish (Becton Dickinson) so as to enrich them as the monocyte fraction. The monocyte-enriched population was cultured in the presence of 1,000 U/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (R&D System) and 1,000 U/ml of interleukin (IL)-4 (R&D System) in AIM-V Medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% heat-inactivated autologous serum (AS). After 7 days of culture, the cytokine-induced DCs were pulsed with 20 micro-g/ml of each of the synthesized peptides in the presence of 3 micro-g/ml of beta 2-microglobulin for 3 hrs at 37 degrees C. in AIM-V Medium. The generated cells appeared to express DC-associated molecules, such as CD80, CD83, CD86 and HLA class II, on their cell surfaces (data not shown). These peptide-pulsed DCs were then inactivated by X-irradiated (20 Gy) and mixed at a 1:20 ratio with autologous CD8+ T cells, obtained by positive selection with CD8 Positive Isolation Kit (Dynal). These cultures were set up in 48-well plates (Corning); each well contained 1.5×10\n4 \npeptide-pulsed DCs, 3×10\n5 \nCD8+ T cells and 10 ng/ml of IL-7 (R&D System) in 0.5 ml of AIM-V/2% AS medium. Three days later, these cultures were supplemented with IL-2 (CHIRON) to a final concentration of 20 IU/ml. On \n \ndays\n \n 7 and 14, the T cells were further stimulated with the autologous peptide-pulsed DCs. The DCs were prepared each time by the same way described above. CTL was tested against peptide-pulsed T2 or PSCCA0922 cells after the 3rd round of peptide stimulation on day 21 (Tanaka H et al., Br J Cancer 2001 Jan. 5, 84(1): 94-9; Umano Y et al., Br J Cancer 2001 Apr. 20, 84(8): 1052-7; Uchida N et al., Clin Cancer Res 2004 Dec. 15, 10(24): 8577-86; Suda T et al., Cancer Sci 2006 May, 97(5): 411-9; Watanabe T et al., Cancer Sci 2005 August, 96(8): 498-506).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCTL Expansion Procedure\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCTLs were expanded in culture using the method similar to the one described by Riddell et al. (Walter E A et al., N Engl J Med 1995 Oct. 19, 333(16): 1038-44; Riddell S R et al., Nat Med 1996 February, 2(2): 216-23). A total of 5×10\n4 \nCTLs were suspended in 25 ml of AIM-V/5% AS medium with 2 kinds of human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, inactivated by MMC, in the presence of 40 ng/ml of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen). One day after initiating the cultures, 120 IU/ml of IL-2 were added to the cultures. The cultures were fed with fresh AIM-V/5% AS medium containing 30 I/ml of IL-2 on \n \ndays\n \n 5, 8 and 11 (Tanaka H et al., Br J Cancer 2001 Jan. 5, 84(1): 94-9; Umano Y et al., Br J Cancer 2001 Apr. 20, 84(8): 1052-7; Uchida N et al., Clin Cancer Res 2004 Dec. 15, 10(24): 8577-86; Suda T et al., Cancer Sci 2006 May, 97(5): 411-9; Watanabe T et al., Cancer Sci 2005 August, 96(8): 498-506).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEstablishment of CTL clones\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dilutions were made to have 0.3, 1, and 3 CTLs/well in 96 round-bottomed micro titer plate (Nalge Nunc International). CTLs were cultured with 1×10\n4 \ncells/well of 2 kinds of human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, 30 ng/ml of anti-CD3 antibody, and 125 U/ml of IL-2 in a total of 150 micro-Dwell of AIM-V Medium containing 5% AS. 50 micro-1/well of TL-2 were added to the medium 10 days later so to reach a final concentration of 125 U/ml IL-2. CTL activity was tested on the 14th day, and CTL clones were expanded using the same method as described above (Uchida N et al., Clin Cancer Res 2004 Dec. 15, 10(24): 8577-86; Suda T et al., Cancer Sci 2006 May, 97(5): 411-9; Watanabe T et al., Cancer Sci 2005 August, 96(8): 498-506).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific CTL Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo examine specific CTL activity, interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay and IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed. Specifically, peptide-pulsed T2 (1×10\n4\n/well) was prepared as stimulator cells. Cultured cells in 48 wells were used as responder cells. IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay and IFN-gamma ELISA assay were performed under manufacture procedure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasmid Transfection\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cDNA encoding an open reading frame of target genes, HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*0206 or HLA-A*2402 was amplified by PCR. The PCR-amplified product was cloned into a vector. The plasmids were transfected into COST, which is the target genes and HLA-A2- and A24-negative cell line, using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures. After 2 days from transfection, the transfected cells were harvested with versene (Invitrogen) and used as the target cells (5×10\n4 \ncells/well) for CTL activity assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSemi-Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTotal RNA was extracted with a Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen) or Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturers' protocols. Ten-microgram aliquots of total RNA were reversely transcribed for single-stranded cDNAs using poly dT\n12-18 \nprimer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). Each single-stranded cDNA preparation was diluted for subsequent PCR amplification by standard RT-PCR experiments carried out in 12 micro-1 volumes of PCR buffer (TAKARA). Amplification proceeded for 4 min at 94 degrees C. for denaturing, followed by 28 cycles of 94 degrees C. for 30 s, 60 degrees C. for 30 s, and 72 degrees C. for 60 s, in the GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, Calif.). Primer sequences were; for NEIL3: forward, 5′-TTGGTCCTCCTCT-GTTTCATAGA-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 46) and reverse, 5′-GCTTCTCCCCAGTTACAAGAGAC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 47).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced NEIL3 Expression in Cancers\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe global gene expression profile data obtained from various cancers using cDNA-microarray revealed that NEIL3 (GenBank Accession No. NM\n—\n018248; SEQ ID No: 44) expression was elevated. NEIL3 expression was validly elevated in 4 out of 20 AMLs, 5 out of 6 bladder cancers, 10 out of 11 breast cancers, 8 out of 8 cervical cancers, 1 out of 1 cholangiocellular carcinoma, 12 out of 12 CMLs, 3 out of 6 colorectal cancers, 1 out of 1 endometriosis, 4 out of 8 esophagus cancers, 6 out of 10 liver cancers, 7 out of 7 NSCLCs, 16 out of 16 osteosarcomas, 1 out of 1 pancreatic cancer, 10 out of 10 prostate cancers, 2 out of 2 renal carcinomas, 12 out of 12 SCLCs and 12 out of 12 soft tissue tumors as compared with corresponding normal tissue (Table 1).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatio of cases observed up-regulation of NEIL3 in cancerous\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntissue as compared with normal corresponding tissue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nCancers\n \n \nRatio\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAML\n \n \n \n \n\n\n 4/20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nBladder Cancer\n \n\n\n5/6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nBreast Cancer\n \n\n\n10/11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nCervical Cancer\n \n\n\n8/8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nCholangiocellular Carcinoma\n \n\n\n1/1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nCML\n \n\n\n12/12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nColorectal Cancer\n \n\n\n3/6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nEndometriosis\n \n\n\n1/1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nEsophagus Cancer\n \n\n\n4/8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nLiver cancer\n \n\n\n 6/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nNSCLC\n \n\n\n7/7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nOsteosarcoma\n \n\n\n16/16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nPancreatic Cancer\n \n\n\n1/1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nProstate Cancer\n \n\n\n10/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nRenal Carcinoma\n \n\n\n2/2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nSCLC\n \n\n\n12/12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nSoft Tissue Tumor\n \n\n\n12/12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExperimental 1\n\n\nPrediction of HLA-A2 Binding Peptides Derived from NEIL3\n\n\n \n \n \nTable 2 shows the HLA-A2 binding peptides of NEIL3 in the order of high binding affinity.

Peptide specific CTL activity was determined by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay (\nFIGS. 1\n \na\n-\nj\n). It showed that the \nwell number #\n8 stimulated with NEIL3-A2-9-585 (SEQ ID NO: 3) (a), #2 with NEIL3-A2-9-127 (SEQ ID NO: 4) (b), #4 and 5 with NEIL3-A2-9-416 (SEQ ID NO: 5) (c), #3 with NEIL3-A2-9-71 (SEQ ID NO: 6) (d), #1 with NEIL3-A2-9-271 (SEQ ID NO: 11) (e), #3 with NEIL3-A2-10-198 (SEQ ID NO: 15) (f), #1 with NEIL3-A2-10-340 (SEQ ID NO: 17) (g), #2 and 3 with NEIL3-A2-10-590 (SEQ ID NO: 21) (h) and #6 with NEIL3-A2-10-378 (SEQ ID NO: 22) (i) demonstrated potent IFN-gamma production as compared to the control wells. In addition, the \n \n \nwell number #\n \n \n9, 10, 12 and 13 with NEIL3-A2-9-416 (SEQ ID NO: 5) (j) demonstrated potent IFN-gamma production against peptide pulsed A0206 positive PSCCA0922 cells. Furthermore, the cells in the positive \nwell number #\n8 stimulated with NEIL3-A2-9-585 (SEQ ID NO: 3), #2 with NEIL3-A2-9-127 (SEQ ID NO: 4), #4 and 5 with NEIL3-A2-9-416 (SEQ ID NO: 5), #3 with NEIL3-A2-9-71 (SEQ ID NO: 6), #1 with NEIL3-A2-9-271 (SEQ ID NO: 11), #3 with NEIL3-A2-10-198 (SEQ ID NO: 15) and, #2 and 3 with NEIL3-A2-10-590 (SEQ ID NO: 21) were expanded and established CTL lines, and #10 and 12 with NEIL3-A2-9-416 for A0206 (SEQ ID NO: 5) were also expanded and established CTL lines. CTL activity of those CTL lines was determined by TEN-gamma ELISA assay (\nFIGS. 2\n \na\n-\nk\n). It showed that all CTL lines demonstrated potent IFN-gamma production against the target cells pulsed with corresponding peptide as compared to target cells without peptide pulse. On the other hand, no CTL lines could be established by stimulation with other peptides shown in Table 2, despite those peptide had possible binding activity with HLA-A*0201 (data not shown). As a result, it indicated that 7 peptides derived from NEIL3 were screened as the peptides could induce potent CTLs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEstablishment of CTL Clones Against NEIL3 Specific Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCTL clones were established by limiting dilution from CTL lines as described in “Materials and Methods”, and IFN-gamma production from CTL clones against target cells pulsed peptide were determined by IFN-gamma ELISA assay. Potent IFN-gamma productions were determined from CTL clones stimulated with SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 15 and SEQ ID NO: 21 in \nFIG. 3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific CTL Activity Against Target Cells Exogenously Expressing NEIL3 and HLA-A*0201 or HLA-A*0206\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe established CTL lines raised against these peptides were examined for their ability to recognize target cells that endogenously express NEIL3 and HLA-A*0201 or HLA-A*0206 molecule. Specific CTL activity against COS7 cells which transfected with both the full length of NEIL3 and HLA-A*0201 or HLA-A*0206 molecule gene (a specific model for the target cells that exogenously express NEIL3 and HLA-A*0201 or HLA-A*0206 gene) was tested using the CTL lines raised by corresponding peptide as the effecter cells. COS7 cells transfected with either full length of NEIL3, HLA-A* 0201 or HLA-A*0206gene were prepared as control. In \nFIG. 4\n, the CTLs stimulated with SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6 and SEQ ID NO: 15 showed potent CTL activity against COS7 cells expressing both NEIL3 and HLA-A* 0201, and the CTLs stimulated with SEQ ID NO: 5 also showed potent CTL activity against COS7 cells expressing both NEIL3 and HLA-A* 0206. On the other hand, no significant specific CTL activity was detected against the controls. Thus, these data clearly demonstrated that NEIL3-A2-9-416 (SEQ ID NO: 5), NEIL3-A2-9-71 (SEQ ID NO: 6) and NEIL3-A2-10-198 (SEQ ID NO: 15) were naturally expressed on the target cells with HLA-A*0201 molecule and were recognized by the CTLs, and NEIL3-A2-9-416 (SEQ ID NO: 5) was also naturally expressed on the target cells with HLA-A*0206 molecule and was recognized by the CTLs. These results indicated that these peptides derived from NEIL3 may be available to apply the cancer vaccines for patients with NEIL3 expressing tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHomology Analysis of Antigen Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CTLs stimulated with NEIL3-A2-9-585 (SEQ ID NO: 3), NEIL3-A2-9-127 (SEQ ID NO: 4), NEIL3-A2-9-416 (SEQ ID NO: 5), NEIL3-A2-9-71 (SEQ ID NO: 6), NEIL3-A2-9-271 (SEQ ID NO: 11), NEIL3-A2-10-198 (SEQ ID NO: 15), NEIL3-A2-10-340 (SEQ ID NO: 17), NEIL3-A2-10-590 (SEQ ID NO: 21) and NEIL3-A2-10-378 (SEQ ID NO: 22) showed significant and specific CTL activity. This result may be due to the fact that the sequences of NEIL3-A2-9-585 (SEQ ID NO: 3), NEIL3-A2-9-127 (SEQ ID NO: 4), NEIL3-A2-9-416 (SEQ ID NO: 5), NEIL3-A2-9-71 (SEQ ID NO: 6), NEIL3-A2-9-271 (SEQ ID NO: 11), NEIL3-A2-10-198 (SEQ ID NO: 15), NEIL3-A2-10-340 (SEQ ID NO: 17), NEIL3-A2-10-590 (SEQ ID NO: 21) and NEIL3-A2-10-378 (SEQ ID NO: 22) are homologous to peptides derived from other molecules that are known to sensitize the human immune system. To exclude this possibility, homology analyses were performed for these peptide sequences using as queries the BLAST algorithm (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi) which revealed no sequence with significant homology. The results of homology analyses indicate that the sequences of NEIL3-A2-9-585 (SEQ ID NO: 3), NEIL3-A2-9-127 (SEQ ID NO: 4), NEIL3-A2-9-416 (SEQ ID NO: 5), NEIL3-A2-9-71 (SEQ ID NO: 6), NEIL3-A2-9-271 (SEQ ID NO: 11), NEIL3-A2-10-198 (SEQ ID NO: 15), NEIL3-A2-10-340 (SEQ ID NO: 17), NEIL3-A2-10-590 (SEQ ID NO: 21) and NEIL3-A2-10-378 (SEQ ID NO: 22) are unique and thus, there is little possibility, to our best knowledge, that these molecules raise unintended immunologic response to some unrelated molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn conclusion, novel HLA-A2 epitope peptides derived from NEIL3 were identified.

Peptide specific CTL activity was determined by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay (\nFIGS. 6\n \na\n-\ne\n). It showed that the \nwell number #\n7 stimulated with NEIL3-A24-9-545 (SEQ ID NO: 24) (a), #6 stimulated with NEIL3-A24-9-362 (SEQ ID NO: 33) (b), #2 and #8 stimulated with NEIL3-A24-10-320 (SEQ ID NO: 35) (c), #8 stimulated with NEIL3-A24-10-544 (SEQ ID NO: 41) (d) and #1 and #4 stimulated with NEIL3-A24-10-87 (SEQ ID NO: 43) (e) demonstrated potent IFN-gamma production as compared to the control wells. On the other hand, no specific CTL activity was determined by stimulation with other peptides shown in Tables 3a and 3b, despite those peptide had possible binding activity with HLA-A*2402. For example, typical negative data of CTL response stimulated with NEIL3-A24-9-364 (SEQ ID NO: 25) against peptide-pulsed target cells (f). As a result, it indicated that 5 peptides derived from NEIL3 were screened as the peptides that could induce potent CTLs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEstablishment of CTL Lines and Clones Against NEIL3 Derived Peptide\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells that showed peptide specific CTL activity detected by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay in the \nwell number #\n7 with NEIL3-A24-9-545 (SEQ ID NO:24) (a), #6 with NEIL3-A24-9-362 (SEQ ID NO: 33) (b), #8 with NEIL3-A24-10-320 (SEQ ID NO: 35) (c), #8 with NEIL3-A24-10-544 (SEQ ID NO: 41) (d) and #1 with NEIL3-A24-10-87 (SEQ ID NO: 43) (e) were expanded and established CTL lines. CTL activity of those CTL lines was determined by IFN-gamma ELISA assay (\nFIGS. 7\n \na\n-\ne\n). It showed that all CTL lines demonstrated potent IFN-gamma production against the target cells pulsed with corresponding peptide as compared to target cells without peptide pulse. Furthermore, CTL clones were established by limiting dilution from the CTL lines, and IFN-gamma production from CTL clones against target cells pulsed peptide was determined by IFN-gamma ELISA assay. Potent IFN-gamma productions were determined from CTL clones stimulated with NEIL3-A24-9-545 (SEQ ID NO: 24) (a), NEIL3-A24-10-320 (SEQ ID NO: 35) (b) and NEIL3-A24-10-544 (SEQ ID NO: 41) (c) in \nFIG. 8\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific Ctl Activity Against Target Cells Exogenously Expressing NEIL3 and HLA-A*2402\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe established CTL lines and clones raised against each peptides were examined for their ability to recognize target cells that endogenously express NEIL3 and HLA-A*2402 gene. Specific CTL activity against COS7 cells which transfected with both the full length of NEIL3 and HLA-A*2402 gene (a specific model for the target cells that exogenously express NEIL3 and HLA-A*2402 gene) was tested using the CTL lines and clones raised by corresponding peptide as the effector cells. COS7 cells transfected with either full length of NEIL3 genes or HLA-A* 2402 were prepared as controls. In \nFIG. 9\n, the CTLs stimulated with NEIL3-A24-9-545 (SEQ ID NO: 24) showed potent CTL activity against COS7 cells expressing both NEIL3 and HLA-A*2402. On the other hand, no significant specific CTL activity was detected against the control. Thus, these data clearly demonstrated that NEIL3-A24-9-545 (SEQ ID NO: 24) was naturally expressed on the target cells with HLA-A*2402 molecule and were recognized by the CTLs. These results indicated that this peptide derived from NEIL3 may be available to apply the cancer vaccines for patients with NEIL3 expressing tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHomology Analysis of Antigen Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CTLs stimulated with NEIL3-A24-9-545 (SEQ ID NO: 24), NEIL3-A24-9-362 (SEQ ID NO: 33), NEIL3-A24-10-320 (SEQ ID NO: 35), NEIL3-A24-10-544 (SEQ ID NO: 41) and NEIL3-A24-10-87 (SEQ ID NO: 43) showed significant and specific CTL activity. This result may be due to the fact that the sequence of NEIL3-A24-9-545 (SEQ ID NO: 24), NEIL3-A24-9-362 (SEQ ID NO: 33), NEIL3-A24-10-320 (SEQ ID NO: 35), NEIL3-A24-10-544 (SEQ ID NO: 41) and NEIL3-A24-10-87 (SEQ ID NO: 43) are homologous to peptide derived from other molecules that are known to sensitize the human immune system. To exclude this possibility, homology analyses were performed for this peptide sequence using as queries the BLAST algorithm (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi) which revealed no sequence with significant homology. The results of homology analyses indicate that the sequence of NEIL3-A24-9-545 (SEQ ID NO: 24), NEIL3-A24-9-362 (SEQ ID NO: 33), NEIL3-A24-10-320 (SEQ ID NO: 35), NEIL3-A24-10-544 (SEQ ID NO: 41) and NEIL3-A24-10-87 (SEQ ID NO: 43) are unique and thus, there is little possibility, to our best knowledge, that this molecules raise unintended immunologic response to some unrelated molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn conclusion, novel HLA-A*2402 epitope peptide derived from NEIL3 are identified. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that NEIL3 may be applicable for cancer immunotherapy.\n\n\n \nINDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides new TAAs, particularly those derived from NEIL3 which may induce potent and specific anti-tumor immune responses and have applicability to a wide variety of cancer types. Such TAAs can find use in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer."
