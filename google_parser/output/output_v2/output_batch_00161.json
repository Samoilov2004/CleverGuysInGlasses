Description\n\n\n\n\nPRIORITY TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit of European Patent Application No. 10168688.9, filed Jul. 7, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe three main mammalian tachykinins, substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB) belong to the family of neuropeptides sharing the common COOH-terminal pentapeptide sequence of Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH\n2\n. As neurotransmitters, these peptides exert their biological activity via three distinct neurokinin (NK) receptors termed as NK-1, NK-2 and NK-3. SP binds preferentially to the NK-1 receptor, NKA to the NK-2 and NKB to the NK-3 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe NK-3 receptor is characterized by a predominant expression in CNS and its involvement in the modulation of the central monoaminergic system has been shown. These properties make the NK-3 receptor a potential target for central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and pain (\nNeurosci. Letters, \n2000, 283, 185-188\n; Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents \n2000, 10, 939-960\n; Neuroscience, \n1996, 74, 403-414\n; Neuropeptides, \n1998, 32, 481-488).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSchizophrenia is one of the major neuropsychiatric disorders, characterized by severe and chronic mental impairment. This devastating disease affects about 1% of the world's population. Symptoms begin in early adulthood and are followed by a period of interpersonal and social dysfunction. Schizophrenia manifests as auditory and visual hallucinations, paranoia, delusions (positive symptoms), blunted affect, depression, anhedonia, poverty of speech, memory and attention deficits as well as social withdrawal (negative symptoms).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor decades scientists and clinicians have made efforts with the aim of discovering an ideal agent for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia. However, the complexity of the disorders, due to a wide array of symptoms, has hampered those efforts. There are no specific focal characteristics for the diagnosis of schizophrenia and no single symptom is consistently present in all patients. Consequently, the diagnosis of schizophrenia as a single disorder or as a variety of different disorders has been discussed but not yet resolved. The major difficulty in the development of a new drug for schizophrenia is the lack of knowledge about the cause and nature of this disease. Some neurochemical hypotheses have been proposed on the basis of pharmacological studies to rationalize the development of a corresponding therapy: the dopamine, the serotonin and the glutamate hypotheses. But taking into account the complexity of schizophrenia, an appropriate multireceptor affinity profile might be required for efficacy against positive and negative signs and symptoms. Furthermore, an ideal drug against schizophrenia would preferably have a low dosage allowing once-per-day dosage, due to the low adherence of schizophrenic patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn recent years clinical studies with selective NK1 and NK2 receptor antagonists appeared in the literature showing results for the treatment of emesis, depression, anxiety, pain and migraine (NK1) and asthma (NK2 and NK1). The most exciting data were produced in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced emesis, nausea and depression with NK1 and in asthma with NK2-receptor antagonists. In contrast, no clinical data on NK3 receptor antagonists have appeared in the literature until 2000. Osanetant (SR 142,801) from Sanofi-Synthelabo was the first identified potent and selective non-peptide antagonist described for the NK3 tachykinin receptor for the potential treatment of schizophrenia, which was reported in the literature (\nCurrent Opinion in Investigational Drugs, \n2001, 2(7), 950-956 and \nPsychiatric Disorders Study \n4\n, Schizophrenia\n, June 2003, Decision Resources, Inc., Waltham, Mass.). The proposed drug SR 142,801 has been shown in a phase II trial as active on positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as altered behaviour, delusion, hallucinations, extreme emotions, excited motor activity and incoherent speech, but inactive in the treatment of negative symptoms, which are depression, anhedonia, social isolation or memory and attention deficits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe neurokinin-3 receptor antagonists have been described as useful in pain or inflammation, as well as in schizophrenia, \nExp.

A Standard Mitsunobu reaction with for example a phenol, pyridin-ol or pyrimidin-ol give the aryl-ether VI. Alternatively a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction with a substituted 2-fluoro or 2-chloro pyridine derivatives give as well the aryl ether VI. Selective N-debenzylation is then carried out using several known procedures which are compatible with the substitution patterns of the aromatic rings to afford VII. A coupling with a suitable acid chloride, carboxylic acid or carbamoyl chloride using known methods give I.\n\n\n \nABBREVIATIONS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nCH\n2\nCl\n2\n=dichloromethane;\n\n\nDMAP=dimethylaminopyridine;\n\n\nHOBt=1-hydroxy-benzotriazol hydrate;\n\n\nEDC=1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride;\n\n\nEt\n3\nN=triethylamine;\n\n\nEtOAc=ethyl acetate;\n\n\nH=hexane;\n\n\nRT=room temperature;\n\n\nPPh\n3\n=triphenylphosphine;\n\n\nDBAD=di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Procedure I\n\n\nAmid Coupling (Pyrrolidine VII and Carboxylic Acid)\n\n\n \n \n \nTo a stirred solution of a carboxylic acid derivative (commercially available or known in the literature) (1 mmol) in 10 mL of CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nwas added (1.3 mmol) of EDC, (1.3 mmol) of HOBt and Et\n3\nN (1.3 mmol).

(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nCGRP (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide) is a naturally occurring 37-amino acid peptide that is generated by tissue-specific alternate processing of calcitonin messenger RNA and is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous system. CGRP is localized predominantly in sensory afferent and central neurons and mediates several biological actions, including vasodilation. CGRP is expressed in alpha- and beta-forms that vary by one and three amino acids in the rat and human, respectively. CGRP-alpha and CGRP-beta display similar biological properties. When released from the cell, CGRP initiates its biological responses by binding to specific cell surface receptors that are predominantly coupled to the activation of adenylyl cyclase. CGRP receptors have been identified and pharmacologically evaluated in several tissues and cells, including those of brain, cardiovascular, endothelial, and smooth muscle origin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on pharmacological properties, these receptors are divided into at least two subtypes, denoted CGRP\n1 \nand CGRP\n2\n. Human α-CGRP-(8-37), a fragment of CGRP that lacks seven N-terminal amino acid residues, is a selective antagonist of CGRP\n1\n, whereas the linear analogue of CGRP, diacetoamido methyl cysteine CGRP ([Cys(ACM)2,7]CGRP), is a selective agonist of CGRP\n2\n. CGRP is a potent neuromodulator that has been implicated in the pathology of cerebrovascular disorders such as migraine and cluster headache. In clinical studies, elevated levels of CGRP in the jugular vein were found to occur during migraine attacks (Goadsby et al., Ann. Neurol., 1990, 28, 183-187), salivary levels of CGRP are elevated in migraine subjects between attacks (Bellamy et al., Headache, 2006, 46, 24-33), and CGRP itself has been shown to trigger migrainous headache (Lassen et al., Cephalalgia, 2002, 22, 54-61). In clinical trials, the CGRP antagonist BIBN4096BS has been shown to be effective in treating acute attacks of migraine (Olesen et al., New Engl. J. Med., 2004, 350, 1104-1110) and was able to prevent headache induced by CGRP infusion in a control group (Petersen et al., Clin. Pharmacol. Ther., 2005, 77, 202-213).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCGRP-mediated activation of the trigeminovascular system may play a key role in migraine pathogenesis. Additionally, CGRP activates receptors on the smooth muscle of intracranial vessels, leading to increased vasodilation, which is thought to contribute to headache pain during migraine attacks (Lance, Headache Pathogenesis: Monoamines, Neuropeptides, Purines and Nitric Oxide, Lippincott-Raven Publishers, 1997, 3-9). The middle meningeal artery, the principle artery in the dura mater, is innervated by sensory fibers from the trigeminal ganglion which contain several neuropeptides, including CGRP. Trigeminal ganglion stimulation in the cat resulted in increased levels of CGRP, and in humans, activation of the trigeminal system caused facial flushing and increased levels of CGRP in the external jugular vein (Goadsby et al., Ann. Neurol., 1988, 23, 193-196). Electrical stimulation of the dura mater in rats increased the diameter of the middle meningeal artery, an effect that was blocked by prior administration of CGRP(8-37), a peptide CGRP antagonist (Williamson et al., Cephalalgia, 1997, 17, 525-531). Trigeminal ganglion stimulation increased facial blood flow in the rat, which was inhibited by CGRP(8-37) (Escott et al., Brain Res. 1995, 669, 93-99). Electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion in marmoset produced an increase in facial blood flow that could be blocked by the non-peptide CGRP antagonist BIBN4096BS (Doods et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 2000, 129, 420-423). Thus the vascular effects of CGRP may be attenuated, prevented or reversed by a CGRP antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCGRP-mediated vasodilation of rat middle meningeal artery was shown to sensitize neurons of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Williamson et al., The CGRP Family: Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), Amylin, and Adrenomedullin, Landes Bioscience, 2000, 245-247). Similarly, distention of dural blood vessels during migraine headache may sensitize trigeminal neurons. Some of the associated symptoms of migraine, including extra-cranial pain and facial allodynia, may be the result of sensitized trigeminal neurons (Burstein et al., Ann. Neurol. 2000, 47, 614-624). A CGRP antagonist may be beneficial in attenuating, preventing or reversing the effects of neuronal sensitization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of the compounds of the present invention to act as CGRP antagonists makes them useful pharmacological agents for disorders that involve CGRP in humans and animals, but particularly in humans. Such disorders include migraine and cluster headache (Doods, Curr Opin Inves Drugs, 2001, 2 (9), 1261-1268; Edvinsson et al., Cephalalgia, 1994, 14, 320-327); chronic tension type headache (Ashina et al., Neurology, 2000, 14, 1335-1340); pain (Yu et al., Eur. J. Pharm., 1998, 347, 275-282); chronic pain (Hulsebosch et al., Pain, 2000, 86, 163-175); neurogenic inflammation and inflammatory pain (Holzer, Neurosci., 1988, 24, 739-768; Delay-Goyet et al., Acta Physiol. Scanda. 1992, 146, 537-538; Salmon et al., Nature Neurosci., 2001, 4(4), 357-358); eye pain (May et al. Cephalalgia, 2002, 22, 195-196), tooth pain (Awawdeh et al., Int. Endocrin.

Urology, 2001, 166, 1720-1723); allergic dermatitis (Wallengren, Contact Dermatitis, 2000, 43 (3), 137-143); psoriasis; encephalitis, brain trauma, ischaemia, stroke, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative diseases (Rohrenbeck et al., Neurobiol. of Disease 1999, 6, 15-34); skin diseases (Geppetti and Holzer, Eds., Neurogenic Inflammation, 1996, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla.), neurogenic cutaneous redness, skin rosaceousness and erythema; tinnitus (Herzog et al., J. Membrane Biology, 2002, 189(3), 225); inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, (Hoffman et al. Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology, 2002, 37(4) 414-422) and cystitis. Of particular importance is the acute or prophylactic treatment of headache, including migraine and cluster headache.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds that are useful as ligands for CGRP receptors, in particular antagonists for CGRP receptors, processes for their preparation, their use in therapy, pharmaceutical compositions comprising them and methods of therapy using them.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to compounds of the formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n(wherein variables A\n1\n, A\n2\n, A\n3\n, ring-B, m, n, J, E\n1\n, E\n2\n, E\n3\n, R\n5\n, R\nPG \nand Y are as described herein) which are antagonists of CGRP receptors and which are useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases in which the CGRP is involved, such as migraine.

For example, R\na \nis recited multiple times in formula I, and each R\na \nin formula I may independently be any of the substructures defined under R\na\n. The invention is not limited to structures and substructures wherein each R\na \nmust be the same for a given structure. The same is true with respect to any variable appearing multiple times in a structure or substructure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes compounds of formula I wherein on or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by deuterium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTautomers of compounds defined in any of formulas (I) to (VI) are also included within the scope of the present invention. For example, compounds including carbonyl —CH\n2\nC(O)— groups (keto forms) may undergo tautomerism to form hydroxyl —CH═C(OH)— groups (enol forms). Both keto and enol forms are included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, even where substituents are disclosed which may form a ring structure (for instance R\n6 \nmay form a ring with R\n7\n), not all combinations of substituents are susceptible to ring formation. Moreover, even those substituents capable of ring formation may or may not form a ring structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso as appreciated by those of skill in the art, halo or halogen as used herein are intended to include chloro, fluoro, bromo and iodo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “alkyl” is intended to mean linear and branched structures having no carbon-to-carbon double or triple bonds. Thus C\n1-6\nalkyl is defined to identify the group as having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbons in a linear or branched arrangement, such that C\n1-6\nalkyl specifically includes, but is not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl and hexyl. C\n0 \nor C\n0\nalkyl is defined to identify the presence of a direct covalent bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Cycloalkyl” is an alkyl, part or all of which forms a ring of three or more atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkenyl” means linear or branched structures and combinations thereof, of the indicated number of carbon atoms, having at least one carbon-to-carbon double bond, wherein hydrogen may be replaced by an additional carbon-to-carbon double bond. C\n2-6\nalkenyl, for example, includes ethenyl, propenyl, 1-methylethenyl, butenyl and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “aryl” is intended to mean any stable monocyclic or bicyclic carbon ring of up to 7 members in each ring, wherein at least one ring is aromatic.

All methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the process or condition of diseases. As used herein, the term “composition” is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, solutions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations.

The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the techniques described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. Oral tablets may also be formulated for immediate release, such as fast melt tablets or wafers, rapid dissolve tablets or fast dissolve films.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions.

Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions and the like, containing the compounds of the present invention are employed. Similarly, transdermal patches may also be used for topical administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition and method of the present invention may further comprise other therapeutically active compounds as noted herein which are usually applied in the treatment of the above mentioned pathological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the treatment, prevention, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of conditions which require antagonism of CGRP receptor activity an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 500 mg per kg patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage may be 0.05 to 0.5, 0.5 to 5 or 5 to 50 mg/kg per day. For oral administration, the compositions may be provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly about 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 750, 800, 900, and 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, or may be administered once or twice per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen treating, preventing, controlling, ameliorating, or reducing the risk of headache, migraine, cluster headache, or other diseases for which compounds of the present invention are indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 100 milligram per kilogram of animal body weight, given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1.0 milligrams to about 1000 milligrams, or from about 1 milligrams to about 50 milligrams. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 7 milligrams to about 350 milligrams. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.\n\n\n \nReaction Schemes\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be prepared readily according to the following Schemes and specific examples, or modifications thereof, using readily available starting materials, reagents and conventional synthesis procedures. In these reactions, it is also possible to make use of variants which are themselves known to those of ordinary skill in this art but are not mentioned in greater detail. The general procedures for making the compounds claimed in this invention can be readily understood and appreciated by one skilled in the art from viewing the following Schemes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimple modifications of these routes, including different protecting group strategies, application of well-precedented methodology, and the use of starting materials and reagents other than those described in the foregoing schemes, may be used to provide other intermediates and claimed compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases the final product may be further modified, for example, by manipulation of substituents. These manipulations may include, but are not limited to, reduction, oxidation, alkylation, acylation, and hydrolysis reactions which are commonly known to those skilled in the art. In some cases the order of carrying out the foregoing reactions schemes may be varied to facilitate the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA representative synthesis of a substituted piperazinone intermediate is shown in Scheme 1. N-Boc-cycloleucinal (1) may be reductively aminated with phenylalanine to produce intermediate 2. Intermediate 2 may then be deprotected and cyclized to form piperazinone 3 using a variety of amide bond forming reagents, including HATU in DMF. Other reagents which might be useful for this transformation include EDC, BOP, and pyClu. Further transformations can be executed on 3, for example reduction of the amide carbonyl with borane to produce piperazine 4. piperazinone 3 might also be protected and further functionalized by base catalyzed alkylation of the amide nitrogen, followed by deprotection to provide piperazinone 5. Those skilled in the art of organic synthesis will recognize that straightforward modifications of this methodology may be used to access other piperazinoneone intermediates. Additionally, use of alternative starting materials to 1 and phenylalanine may be used to provide different products.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of alternative heterocycles (but not limited to) are shown in Scheme 2. Readily available ketones and aldehydes may be converted to hydantoins under Bucherer-Bergs conditions, using ammonium carbonate and either sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide. Scheme 2 shows that the hydantoin 6 can be selectively alkylated at N-3 using potassium carbonate and 2-iodopropane, in DMF, to prepare 7.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA representative synthesis of a spiroazaoxindole intermediate is shown in Scheme 3. 7-Azaindole (8) may be protected with a variety of protecting groups, such as the 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl group shown in Scheme 3. Following the method of Marfat and Carter (\nTetrahedron Lett., \n1987, 28, 4027-4030), treatment of 9 with pyridine hydrobromide perbromide provides the dibromoazaoxindole 10, which may be reduced to the corresponding azaoxindole 11 by reaction with zinc. The key alkylation of 11 with 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)-4-nitrobenzene (12, Cava et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n2000, 65, 5413-5415) is carried out using cesium carbonate in DMF to afford the spiroazaoxindole 13. A variety of other bases and solvents may be employed in this alkylation reaction, and use of a different alkylating agent than the dibromide shown here can lead to other products. Reduction of the nitro compound 13, for example using hydrogenation over palladium, and a two-step deprotection affords the corresponding aniline 15. The methodology shown in Scheme 3 is not limited to azaoxindoles such as 11, but may be applied to a variety of suitably protected heterocyclic systems to give the corresponding spiro compounds.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpiroazaoxindole intermediates, such as those illustrated in Scheme 3, may be resolved to give pure enantiomers using techniques familiar to those skilled in the art. For example, chromatography of the protected intermediate 14 on a ChiralPak OD column can be used to provide the individual enantiomers (R)-14 and (S)-14, and these enantiomers may be converted to the corresponding anilines [(R)-15 and (S)-15] by the two-step deprotection. The methodology described herein may be applied to such enantiomerically pure aniline intermediates to give the individual enantiomers of the compounds of the present invention. Resolution may be effected by other methodologies, such as fractional crystallization of diastereomeric salts, and it may be carried out on other synthetic intermediates or on the final products. Alternatively, an asymmetric synthesis of a key intermediate could be used to provide an enantiomerically enriched final product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAniline intermediates, such as those described in Scheme 3, may be converted to a variety of other key intermediates that are useful in the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention. For example, Scheme 4 illustrates methodology for conversion of a representative aniline into several quinoline intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAniline 15 may be acylated with (E)-3-ethoxyaeryloyl chloride and treatment of the resulting amide with sulfuric acid leads to hydroxyquinoline 16, which can be converted to the corresponding chloride 17 by heating in phosphorus oxychloride. Condensation of aniline 15 with crotonaldehyde in the presence of acid and an oxidant affords the 2-methylquinoline 18. The use of other aldehydes under similar conditions can lead to alternatively substituted quinolines. Oxidation of quinoline 18 with selenium dioxide can provide either aldehyde 19 or carboxylic acid 20, depending on the amount of oxidant used and the duration of the reaction. Reduction of aldehyde 19 with sodium borohydride provides the corresponding alcohol, and treatment of this with thionyl chloride may be used to give the chloride 21. Intermediates such as 17, 19, 20 and 21 may be converted to compounds of the present invention using a variety of known methodology. While the methodology shown in Scheme 4 is exemplified using aniline 15, it is understood that it may be applied to a variety of aniline substrates, such as those described herein, in order to provide various quinoline intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methodology illustrated in the foregoing Schemes 34 describes the synthesis of some intermediates that are useful for making the compounds of the present invention. While the examples shown involve analogues of aniline 15, those skilled in the art will appreciate that such methodology may be extended to a variety of other anilines to give other useful intermediates. For example, Scheme 5 illustrates the synthesis of heterocyclic intermediates that are analogous to those in Scheme 4 but of a more general structure.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood by those skilled in the art that in some cases alternative reagents or conditions may be used to effect the transformations in Scheme 5. In some cases, additional chemical steps may be required to obtain the compounds of interest, or various protecting group strategies may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intermediates described in Schemes 4-5 may be used to synthesize the compounds of the present invention using a variety of known methodologies. Some of these methodologies are illustrated in Scheme 6. Standard reductive amination of an aldehyde like 26 with a suitable amine (RR′NH) may be used to obtain a final product of interest (29). Similarly, a standard coupling reaction may be used to convert carboxylic acid 27 to amide 30, which may be another example of the present invention when R and R′ are selected appropriately.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 6 also illustrates the coupling of chlorides 24 and 28 with a suitable partner (XH), usually under basic conditions, to give other compounds of the present invention (31 and 32). The precise nature of RR′NH or XH not only determines the identity of the final compound of interest, but also influences the choice of conditions under which the reaction is performed. For example, reductive amination of 26 may be performed using alternative conditions to those shown in Scheme 6, such as sodium cyanoborohydride in MeOH, depending on the exact natures of 26 and the amine. Similarly, the coupling of RR′NH and acid 27 may be carried out under a variety of known conditions, such as use of an alternative coupling reagent like PyBOP, or activation of the carboxylic acid as an acid anhydride or acid chloride. One skilled in the art will infer from precedent in the chemical literature, and from those examples given herein, suitable conditions for reaction of either 24 or 28 with XH, which is usually an amine, lactam or similar compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimple modifications of these routes, including different protecting group strategies, application of well-precedented methodology, and the use of starting materials and reagents other than those described in the foregoing schemes, may be used to provide other acids of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases the final product may be further modified, for example, by manipulation of substituents. These manipulations may include, but are not limited to, reduction, oxidation, alkylation, acylation, and hydrolysis reactions which are commonly known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are provided so that the invention might be more fully understood.

Inhibition of the binding of \n125\nI-CGRP to receptors and functional antagonism of CGRP receptors were determined as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNATIVE RECEPTOR BINDING ASSAY: The binding of \n125\nI-CGRP to receptors in SK-N-MC cell membranes was carried out essentially as described (Edvinsson et al. (2001) \nEur. J. Pharmacol. \n415, 39-44). Briefly, membranes (25 μg) were incubated in 1 mL of binding buffer [10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nand 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)] containing 10 pM \n125\nI-CGRP and antagonist. After incubation at room temperature for 3 h, the assay was terminated by filtration through GFB glass fibre filter plates (PerkinElmer) that had been blocked with 0.5% polyethyleneimine for 3 h. The filters were washed three times with ice-cold assay buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and 5 mM MgCl\n2\n), then the plates were air dried. Scintillation fluid (50 μL) was added and the radioactivity was counted on a Topcount (Packard Instrument). Data analysis was carried out by using Prism and the K\ni \nwas determined by using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng & Prusoff (1973) \nBiochem. Pharmacol. \n22, 3099-3108).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRECOMBINANT RECEPTOR: Human CL receptor (Genbank accession number L76380) was subcloned into the expression vector pIREShyg2 (BD Biosciences Clontech) as a 5′NheI and 3′ PmeI fragment. Human RAMP 1 (Genbank accession number AJ001014) was subcloned into the expression vector pIRESpuro2 (BD Biosciences Clontech) as a 5′NheI and 3′NotI fragment. HEK 293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells; ATCC #CRL-1573) were cultured in DMEM with 4.5 g/L glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and maintained at 37° C. and 95% humidity. Cells were subcultured by treatment with 0.25% trypsin with 0.1% EDTA in HBSS. Stable cell line generation was accomplished by co-transfecting 10 μg of DNA with 30 μg Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 75 cm\n2 \nflasks. CL receptor and RAMP1 expression constructs were co-transfected in equal amounts. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were diluted and selective medium (growth medium+300 μg/mL hygromycin and 1 μg/mL puromycin) was added the following day. A clonal cell line was generated by single cell deposition utilizing a FACS Vantage SE (Becton Dickinson). Growth medium was adjusted to 150 μg/mL hygromycin and 0.5 μg/mL puromycin for cell propagation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRECOMBINANT RECEPTOR BINDING ASSAY: Cells expressing recombinant human CL receptor/RAMP1 were washed with PBS and harvested in harvest buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche). The cell suspension was disrupted with a laboratory homogenizer and centrifuged at 48,000 g to isolate membranes. The pellets were resuspended in harvest buffer plus 250 mM sucrose and stored at −70° C. For binding assays, 20 μg of membranes were incubated in 1 ml binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, and 0.2% BSA) for 3 hours at room temperature containing 10 pM \n125\nI-hCGRP (GE Healthcare) and antagonist. The assay was terminated by filtration through 96-well GFB glass fiber filter plates (PerkinElmer) that had been blocked with 0.05% polyethyleneimine. The filters were washed 3 times with ice-cold assay buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and 5 mM MgCl\n2\n). Scintillation fluid was added and the plates were counted on a Topeount (Packard). Non-specific binding was determined and the data analysis was carried out with the apparent dissociation constant (K\ni\n) determined by using a non-linear least squares fitting the bound CPM data to the equation below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nobsd\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\nImin\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nmin\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nDrug\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nRadiolabel\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nWhere Y is observed CPM bound, Y\nmax \nis total bound counts, Y\nmin \nis non specific bound counts, (Y\nmax\n−Y\nmin\n) is specific bound counts, % I\nmax \nis the maximum percent inhibition, % I min is the minimum percent inhibition, radiolabel is the probe, and the K\nd \nis the apparent dissociation constant for the radioligand for the receptor as determined by Hot saturation experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRECOMBINANT RECEPTOR FUNCTIONAL ASSAY: Cells were plated in complete growth medium at 85,000 cells/well in 96-well poly-D-lysine coated plates (Corning) and cultured for ˜19 h before assay. Cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with inhibitor for 30 min at 37° C. and 95% humidity in Cellgro Complete Serum-Free/Low-Protein medium (Mediatech, Inc.) with L-glutamine and 1 g/L BSA. Isobutyl-methylxanthine was added to the cells at a concentration of 300 μM and incubated for 30 min at 37° C. Human α-CGRP was added to the cells at a concentration of 0.3 nM and allowed to incubate at 37° C. for 5 mM. After α-CGRP stimulation the cells were washed with PBS and processed for cAMP determination utilizing the two-stage assay procedure according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (cAMP SPA direct screening assay system; RPA 559; GE Healthcare). Dose response curves were plotted and IC\n50 \nvalues determined from a 4-parameter logistic fit as defined by the equation y=((a−d)/(1+(x/e)\nb\n) d, where y=response, x=dose, a=max response, d=min response, c=inflection point and b=slope.\n\n\n \n \nThe compounds of the invention were tested according to the foregoing recombinant receptor binding assay, and typically had activity as antagonists of the CGRP receptor in the aforementioned assays, with a K\ni \nvalue of less than 50,000 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamplary K\ni \nvalues in the recombinant receptor binding assay for exemplary compounds of the invention are provided in the table below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n87\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n64\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n95\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n84\n\n\n0.72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n88\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n76\n\n\n0.73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n69\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n184\n\n\n1700\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n147\n\n\n1100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n3800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n180\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n115\n\n\n7400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n114\n\n\n15000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n209\n\n\n85\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following abbreviations are used throughout the text:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMe: methyl\n \nEt: ethyl\n \nt-Bu: tert-butyl\n \nBu: butyl\n \niPr: isopropyl\n \nAr: aryl\n \nPh: phenyl\n \nBn: benzyl\n \nPy: pyridyl\n \nAc: acetylate\n \nOAc: acetate\n \nDCE: dichloroethene\n \nTFA: trifluoroacetic acid\n \nTEA: triethlamine\n \nBOC: t-butyloxycarbonyl\n \nBOP: Benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate\n \nDIEA: N,N-Diisopropyl-ethylamine\n \nHOBT: 1-Hydroxybenzotriazole\n \nEDC: 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethyllaminopropyl)carbodiimide\n \nPyCIU: chlorodipyrrolidinocarbenium\n \nn-BuLi: n-butyllithium\n \nHATU: 2-(1H-7-Azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate methanaminium\n \nEDTA: Ethylenediaminetetracetic acid\n \nDMF: dimethylformamide\n \nHMDS: hexamethyldisilazane\n \nTHF: tetrahydrofuran\n \nDMSO: dimethylsulfoxide\n \nSEMCl: 2-trimethylsilylethyoxymethyl chloride\n \nPBPB: pyridinium bromide perbromide\n \nDMEM: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (High Glucose)\n \nFBS: fetal bovine serum\n \nBSA: bovine serum albumin\n \nPBS: phosphate-buffered saline\n \nHEPES: N-(2-Hydroxyethyppiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic Acid\n \nrt: room temperature\n \nmin: minutes\n \nh: hours\n \naq: aqueous\n \nHPLC: high performance liquid chromatography\n \nLCMS: liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nWhile the invention has been described and illustrated with reference to certain particular embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various adaptations, changes, modifications, substitutions, deletions, or additions of procedures and protocols may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
