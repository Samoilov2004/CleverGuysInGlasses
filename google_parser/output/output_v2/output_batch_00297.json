Description\n\n\n\n\n Aryl- and heteroarylamid derivatives as PDE10A enzyme inhibitor Field of the Invention \n\n\n The invention provides compounds that are PDE10A enzyme inhibitors, and as such are useful to treat neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compound of the invention and methods of treating disorders using the compound of the invention. \n\n\nBackground of the Invention \n\n\nThroughout this application, various publications are referenced in full. The disclosures of these publications are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to describe more fully the state of the art to which this invention pertains. \n\n\nThe cyclic nucleotides cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) function as intracellular second messengers regulating a vast array of processes in neurons. Intracellular cAMP and cGMP are generated by adenyl and guanyl cyclases, and are degraded by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP are controlled by intracellular signaling, and stimulation/repression of adenyl and guanyl cyclases in response to GPCR activation is a well characterized way of controlling cyclic nucleotide concentrations (Antoni, F.A. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2000, 27, 103-132). cAMP and cGMP levels in turn control activity of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent kinases as well as other proteins with cyclic nucleotide response elements, which through subsequent phosphorylation of proteins and other processes regulate key neuronal functions such as synaptic transmission, neuronal differentiation and survival. \n\n\nPhosphodieasterase 10A (PDE10A) is a dual-specificity phosphodiesterase that can convert both cAMP to AMP and cGMP to GMP (Loughney, K. et al. Gene 1999, 234, 109-1 17; Fujishige, K. et al. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999, 266, 1 1 18-1 127 and Soderling, S. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999, 96, 7071 -7076). \n\n\nPDE10A is primarily expressed in the neurons in the striatum, n. accumbens and in the olfactory tubercle. \n\n PDE10A is expressed at high levels neurons in the striatum, by the medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the caudate nucleus, the accumbens nucleus and the corresponding neurons of the olfactory tubercle (Kotera, J. et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1999, 261, 551 -557 and Seeger, T.F. et al. Brain Research, 2003, 985, 1 13-126). These constitute the core of the basal ganglia system. The MSN has a key role in the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop, integrating convergent cortical/thalamic input, and sending this integrated information back to the cortex. MSN express two functional classes of neurons: the Di class expressing Di dopamine receptors and the D\n2\n class expressing D\n2\n dopamine receptors. The Di class of neurons is part of the 'direct' striatal output pathway, which broadly functions to facilitate behavioral responses. The D\n2\n class of neurons is part of the 'indirect' striatal output pathway, which functions to suppress behavioral responses that compete with those being facilitated by the 'direct' pathway. These competing pathways act like the brake and accelerator in a car. In the simplest view, the poverty of movement in Parkinson's disease results from over-activity of the 'indirect' pathway, whereas excess movement in disorders such as Huntington's disease represent over-activity of the direct pathway. PDE10A regulation of cAMP and/or cGMP signaling in the dendritic compartment of these neurons may be involved in filtering the cortico/thalamic input into the MSN. Furthermore, PDE10A may be involved in the regulation of GABA release in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus (Seeger, T.F. et al. Brain Research, 2003, 985, 1 13-126). \n\n\nDopamine D\n2\n receptor antagonism is well established in the treatment of schizophrenia. Since the 1950's, dopamine D\n2\n receptor antagonism has been the mainstay in psychosis treatment and all effective antipsychotic drugs antagonise D\n2\n receptors. The effects of D\n2\n are likely to be mediated primarily through neurons in the striatum, n. accumbens and olfactory tubercle, since these areas receive the densest dopaminergic projections and have the strongest expression of D\n2\n receptors (Konradi, C. and Heckers, S. Society of Biological Psychiatry, 2001 , 50, 729-742). Dopamine D\n2\n receptor agonism leads to decrease in cAMP levels in the cells where it is expressed through adenylate cyclase inhibition, and this is a component of D\n2\n signalling (Stoof, J. C; Kebabian J. W. Nature 1981 , 294, 366-368 and Neve, K. A. et al. Journal of Receptors and Signal Transduction 2004, 24, 165-205). Conversely, D\n2\n receptor \n\n antagonism effectively increases cAMP levels, and this effect could be mimicked by inhibition of cAMP degrading phosphodiesterases. \n\n\nMost of the 21 phosphodiesterase genes are widely expressed; therefore inhibition is likely to have side effects. Because PDE10A, in this context, has the desired expression profile with high and relatively specific expression in neurons in striatum, n. accumbens and olfactory tubercle, PDE10A inhibition is likely to have effects similar to D\n2\n receptor antagonism and therefore have antipsychotic effects. While PDE10A inhibition is expected to mimic D\n2\n receptor antagonism in part, it might be expected to have a different profile. The D\n2\n receptor has signalling components besides cAMP (Neve, K. A. et al. Journal of Receptors and Signal Transduction 2004, 24, 165-205), for which reason interference with cAMP through PDE10A inhibition may negatively modulate rather than directly antagonise dopamine signaling through D\n2\n receptors. This may reduce the risk of the extrapyrimidal side effects that are seen with strong D\n2\n antagonism. Conversely, PDE10A inhibition may have some effects not seen with D\n2\n receptor antagonism. PDE10A is also expressed in Di receptors expressing striatal neurons (Seeger, T. F. et al. Brain Research, 2003, 985, 1 13-126). Since Di receptor agonism leads to stimulation of adenylate cyclase and resulting increase in cAMP levels, PDE10A inhibition is likely to also have effects that mimic Di receptor agonism. Finally, PDE10A inhibition will not only increase cAMP in cells, but might also be expected to increase cGMP levels, since PDE10A is a dual specificity phosphodiesterase. cGMP activates a number of target protein in cells like cAMP and also interacts with the cAMP signalling pathways. In conclusion, PDE10A inhibition is likely to mimic D\n2\n receptor antagonism in part and therefore has antipsychotic effect, but the profile might differ from that observed with classical D\n2\n receptor antagonists. \n\n\nThe PDE10A inhibitor papaverine is shown to be active in several antipsychotic models. Papaverine potentiated the cataleptic effect of the D\n2\n receptor antagonist haloperidol in rats, but did not cause catalepsy on its own (WO 03/093499). Papaverine reduced hyperactivity in rats induced by PCP, while reduction of amphetamine induced hyperactivity was insignificant (WO 03/093499). These models suggest that PDE10A inhibition has the classic antipsychotic potential that would be expected from theoretical \n\n considerations. WO 03/093499 further discloses the use of selective PDE10 inhibitors for the treatment of associated neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, PDE10A inhibition reverses subchronic PCP-induced deficits in attentional set-shifting in rats (Rodefer et al. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005, 4, 1070-1076). This model suggests that PDE10A inhibition might alleviate cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. \n\n\nThe tissue distribution of PDE10A indicates that PDE10A inhibitors can be used to raise levels of cAMP and/or cGMP within cells that express the PDE10 enzyme, especially neurons that comprise the basal ganglia, and the PDE10A inhibitors of the invention would therefore be useful in treating a variety of associated neuropsychiatric conditions involving the basal ganglia such as neurological and psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and the like, and may have the benefit of not possessing unwanted side effects, which are associated with the current therapies on the market. \n\n\nFurthermore, recent publications (WO 2005/120514, WO 2005012485, Cantin et al, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 17 (2007) 2869-2873) suggest that PDE10A inhibitors may be useful for treatment of obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes. With respect to inhibitors of PDE10A, EP 1250923 discloses the use of selective PDE10 inhibitors in general, and papaverine in particular, for the treatment of certain neurologic and psychiatric disorders. \n\n\nWO09/152825 discloses phenylimidazole derivatives as PDE10A enzyme inhibitors useful for the treatment of various diseases, including CNS related diseases such as schizophrenia. \n\n\nPyrrolodihydroisoquinolines and variants thereof are disclosed as inhibitors of PDE10 in WO 05/03129 and WO 05/02579. Piperidinyl-substituted quinazolines and isoquinolines that serve as PDE10 inhibitors are disclosed in WO 05/82883. WO 06/1 1040 discloses substituted quinazoline and isoquinoline compounds that serve as inhibitors of PDE10. US 20050182079 discloses substituted tetrahydroisoquinolinyl derivatives of quinazoline and isoquinoline that serve as effective phosphodiesterase \n\n (PDE) inhibitors. In particular, US 20050182079 relates to said compounds, which are selective inhibitors of PDE10. Analogously, US 20060019975 discloses piperidine derivatives of quinazoline and isoquinoline that serve as effective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. US 20060019975 also relates to compounds that are selective inhibitors of PDE10. WO 06/028957 discloses cinnoline derivatives as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 10 for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological syndromes. However, these disclosures do not pertain to the compound of the invention, which are structurally unrelated to any of the known PDE10 inhibitors (Kehler, J. et al. Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 2007, 17, 147-158). \n\n\nThe compound of the invention proves to be efficient PDE10A enzyme inhibitors and an in vivo active compound that reverses the PCP induced hyperactivity and may thus offer alternatives to current marketed treatments for neurodegenerative and/or psychiatric disorders, which are not efficacious in all patients. Hence, there remains a need for alternative methods of treatment. \n\n\nSummary of the Invention \n\n\n The objective of the invention is to provide compounds that are selective PDE10A enzyme inhibitors. \n\n\nA further objective of the invention is to provide compounds that have such activity, and have good, preferably improved, solubility, metabolic stability and/or bioavailability compared to prior art compounds. Another objective of the invention is to provide an effective treatment, in particular long- term treatment, of a human patient, without causing the side effects typically associated with current therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders. \n\n\nFurther objectives of the invention will become apparent upon reading the specification.

Analytical chemical characterization of exemplified compounds \n\n\nPharmacological Testing PDE1 OA enzyme \n\n\n Active PDE10A enzyme is prepared in a number of ways for use in PDE assays (Loughney, K. et al. Gene 1999, 234, 109-1 17; Fujishige, K. et al. Eur J Biochem. 1999, 266, 1 1 18-1 127 and Soderling, S. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999, 96, 7071 -7076). PDE10A can be expressed as full-length proteins or as truncated proteins, as long as they express the catalytic domain. PDE10A can be prepared in different cell types, for example insect cells or E. coli. \n\n\n In the context of the present invention the catalytcally active PDE10 A enzymes were prepared the following way: The catalytic domain of human PDE10A (amino acids 440- 779 from the sequence with accession number NP 006652) was amplified from total human brain total RNA by standard RT-PCR and cloned into the BamH1 and Xho1 sites of the pET28a vector (Novagen). Expression in coli was performed according to standard protocols. Briefly, the expression plasmids were transformed into the \n\n BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain, and 50 ml_ cultures inoculated with the cells allowed to grow to an OD600 of 0.4-0.6 before protein expression was induced with 0.5mM IPTG. Following induction, the cells were incubated overnight at room temperature, after which the cells were collected by centrifugation. Cells expressing PDE10A were resuspended in 12 mL (50 mM TRIS-HCI-pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCI2 and protease inhibitors). The cells were lysed by sonication, and after all cells are lysed, TritonX100 is added according to Novagen protocols. PDE10A was partially purified on Q sepharose and the most active fractions were pooled. PDE10A inhibition assay \n\n\nIn the context of the invention the assay was performed in 60 uL assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.6; 10mM MgCI\n2\n; 0.02% Tween20) containing enough PDE10A to convert 20-25% of 10 nM \n3\nH-cAMP and varying amounts of inhibitors. Reactions were initiated by addition of the cyclic nucleotide substrate. Following 1 hour incubation at room temperature the reactions were terminated by addition of 15 uL 8 mg/mL yttrium silicate SPA beads (Amersham). The beads were allowed to settle for one hr in the dark before the plates were counted in a Wallac 1450 Microbeta counter. IC\n5\no values were calculated by non linear regression using XLfit (IDBS). \n\n\nResults of the experiments showed that the tested compounds of the invention inhibit the PDE10A enzyme with IC\n5\no value between around 15 nM to 400nM, see Table 2: \n\n\nCompound PDE10A \n\n\n IC50 (nM) \n\n\n N-Methyl-N-pyridin-4-yl-4-(quinolin-2-ylmethoxy)-benzamide 180 \n\n\n N-(benzo[d]thiazol-6-yl)-N-methyl-4-(quinolin-2-ylmethoxy)benzanriicle 15 \n\n\n N-(benzo[d]oxazol-6-yl)-N-methyl-4-(quinolin-2-ylmethoxy)benzanriide 93 \n\n\n N-(imidazo[1 ,2-a]pyridin-6-yl)-N-methyl-4-(quinolin-2- 130 \n\n\nylmethoxy)benzamide \n\n\n N-Methyl-4-(quinolin-2-ylmethoxy)-N-[1 ,2,4]triazolo[1 ,5-a]pyridii 240 \n\n\nbenzamide \n\n\n N-([1 ,2,4]triazolo[1 ,5-a]pyridin-7-yl)-N-methyl-4-(quinolin-2- 400 \n\n\nylmethoxy)benzamide \n\n\n 2-Pyridin-3-yl-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl-[4-(quinolin-2- 170 \n\n\nylmethoxy)-phenyl]-amide \n\n 2-Pyridin-4-yl-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl-[4-(quinolin-2- 88 \n\n\nylmethoxy)-phenyl]-amide \n\n\n 2-Pyridin-3-yl-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl-[4-(quinolin-2- 87 \n\n\nylmethoxy)-phenyl]-amide \n\n\n 5-Pyridin-2-yl-1 H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid methyl-[4-(quinolin-2- 30 \n\n\nylmethoxy)-phenyl]-amide \n\n\n 5-Pyridin-3-yl-1 H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid methyl-[4-(quinolin-2- 31 \n\n\nylmethoxy)-phenyl]-amide \n\n\n 5-Pyridin-4-yl-1 H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid methyl-[4-(quinolin-2- 100 \n\n\nylmethoxy)-phenyl]-amide \n\n\n Benzothiazole-6-carboxylic acid methyl-[4-(quinolin-2-ylmethoxy)- 31 \n\n\nphenyl]-amide \n\n\n Benzothiazole-6-carboxylic acid methyl-[4-(1-methyl-1 H- 61 \n\n\nbenzoimidazol-2-ylmethoxy)-phenyl]-anriide \n\n\n N-Methyl-N-[4-(quinolin-2-ylmethoxy)-phenyl]-isonicotinamide 250 \n\n\nTable 2: IC50 values for exemplified compounds of the invention \n\n\nPhencyclidine (PCP) induced hyperactivity \n\n\nMale mice (NMRI, Charles River) weighing 20-25g were used. Eight mice were used in each group receiving the test compound (5 mg/kg) plus PCP (2.3 mg/kg) including the parallel control groups receiving the vehicle of the test compound plus PCP or vehicle injections only. The injection volume was 10 ml/kg. The experiment was made in normal light conditions in an undisturbed room. The test substance was injected per oss 60 min before injection of PCP, which is administered subcutaneous. \n\n\nImmediately after injection of PCP the mice were placed individually in special designed test cage (20 cm x 32 cm). The activity was measured by 5X8 infrared light sources and photocells spaced by 4 cm. The light beams cross the cage 1 .8 cm above the bottom of the cage. Recording of a motility count requires interruption of adjacent light beams, thus avoiding counts induced by stationary movements of the mice. \n\n\nMotility was recorded in 5 min intervals for a period of 1 hour. The drug effect was calculated on the total counts during the 1 hour behavioral test period in the following manner: \n\n\n The mean motility induced by vehicle treatment in the absence of PCP was used as baseline. The 100 per cent effect of PCP was accordingly calculated to be total motility \n\n counts minus baseline. The response in groups receiving test compound was thus determined by the total motility counts minus baseline, expressed in per cent of the similar result recorded in the parallel PCP control group. The per cent responses were converted to per cent reversal of the PCP induced hyperactivity. \n\n\nResults of the experiments showed that compounds of the invention are in vivo active compounds that reverses the PCP induced hyperactivity for example N-Methyl-N- pyridin-4-yl-4-(quinolin-2-ylmethoxy)-benzamide has an ED50 of 10 mg/kg and the compound N-Methyl-N-[4-(quinolin-2-ylmethoxy)-phenyl]-isonicotinamide has an ED50 of 61 mg/kg."

The cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP act as second messengers of intracellular signal transduction in response to extracellular stimuli and are synthesized from ATP and GTP by the catalytic cyclization activity of enzymes adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases, respectively. PDEs play a very important role in signal transduction by regulating the cellular levels of these second messengers (cAMP/cGMP) in the way o f controlling their rates of degradation. \n\n\n Mammalian PDEs are composed of 21 genes and are categorized into 1 1 families (PDE 1 to PDE1 1 ), with each family typically having several different isoforms and splice variants, based on sequence homology, enzymatic properties, biochemical characteristics and sensitivity to inhibitors. These unique PDEs differ in their three-dimensional structures, kinetic properties, modes of regulation, intracellular localization, cellular expression patterns with different individual isozymes modulating distinct regulatory pathways in the cell. Furthermore, PDEs are di ferentially expressed throughout the body, including in the central nervous system, serving \n\n distinct physiological functions. Thus PDEs provide an unique opportunity of selective drug targets for the potential treatment of specific disease states. \n\n\n PDEs are also subclassified based on different substrate specificites into cAMP selective (PDE4, 7 and 8), cGMP selective (PDE5, 6 and 9) and cAMP and cGMP dual selective (PDEl , 2, 3, 10 and 1 1 ). The human PDEI OA family enzyme was reported essentially at the same time by two different groups (Fujishige K et al., J. Biol. Chem. vol. 274, p.18438- 1 8445, ( 1 999); Loughney K et al., Gene vol. 234, p. 109-1 17, ( 1999); Loughney K et al., WO 99/42596) based on the identification of cDNA fragments published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) database. To till date there is only one gene in this family, PDEI OA, although four variants PDE10A 1 -4 have been described. While PDEI OA was found to share homology with known PDEs, no function could be identified for PDEI O. PDE 10 has been identified as a unique family based on primary amino acid sequence and distinct enzymatic activity. The murine homologue has also been cloned [(Soderling, S. et al ., Proc. Natl. Acad. Set USA vol. 96 p. 7071 -7076, (1999)] and N-terminal splice variants of both the rat and human genes have been identified [Kotera, J. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. vol. 261 , p. 551 -557, (1999); Fujishige, K. et al., Eur. J. Biochem. vol. 266, p. 1 1 1 8- 1 1 27, ( 1999)] . There is a high degree of homology across species. The mouse PDEI OA 1 is a 779 amino acid protein that hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP to AMP and GMP, respectively. PDEI OA hydrolyzes cAMP with a Km of 0.05 μΜ and cGMP with a Km of 3 μΜ, suggesting that the affinity of PDEI OA for cAMP is higher than for cGMP. However, approximately 5-fold greater Vmax for cGMP over cAMP (Vmax ratio of cGMP/cAMP is 4.7) has lead to the suggestion that PDE 1 OA is a unique cAMP-inhibited cGMP phosphodiesterase [Soderling, S KI et al.\n'\n, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA vol. 96 p. 7071 -7076, ( 1 999); Fuj ishige et al ., J. Biol. Chem. vol. 274, p. 1 8438- 1 8445, (1999)]. \n\n\n The PDE I OA family of polypeptides shows a lower degree of sequence homology to previously identified PDE families. These low degrees of sequence homology of PDEI OA family of polypeptide make them insensitive to certain inhibitors that are known to be specific for other known PDE families (US 6,350,603, incorporated herein by reference). \n\n\n Regarding PDE I OA which is one of the PDE subtypes, the expression of its mR A has been identified in many tissues and organs such as striatum, testis, kidney, thyroid gland, \n\n pituitary gland, thalamus, cerebellum, heart, lungs and placenta, cells such as aortic smooth m-.iscle cells and aortic endothelial cells, cells of cancers such as lung small cell carcinoma, breast cancer and large bowel cancer. Accordingly, the possibility that PDE I OA is involved in diseases related to these cells, tissues and organs has been demonstrated [J. Biol. Chein. vol. 274, p. 1 8438 (1 999), Gene, vol. 234, p. 109 (1999) and WO 01/29199] . \n\n\n From the view points of strong expression of mRNA of PDE I OA and its enzymatic activity in the striatum, medium spiny striatal neuronal projections, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, pineal & pituitary glands of [Lakics V et al., Neuropharmacology, vol 59, p. 367-374, (201 1 )] this enzyme is suggested to be involved in, for example, onset or progression of various disorders and diseases related to striatal, basal ganglia related dysfunctions/disorders such as schizophrenia (positive, negative & cognitive symptoms), parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, obsessive compulsive disorders, sleep disorders and disorders of changed circardian rhythm [Siuciak JA et al., Neuropharmacology, vol 51 , p. 374-385, (2006); Threlfell S ef al ., JPET, vol 328, p. 785-795, (2009); Grauer SM et al., JPET, vol.33 1 , p.574-590, (2009): Spiwoks-Becker I et al ., Neuroendocrinology, (201 1 )DOI: 1 0.1 1 59/0003271 38] . It has been reported that PDE I OA mRNA expression in the striatum of Huntington disease mouse model is different from that in the striatum of normal mice (WO 01/24781) and chronic suppression of PDE I OA alters striatal expression of genes responsible for neurotransmitter synthesis, neurotransmission and signaling pathways implicated in Huntinton's disease [Kleiman R.1 et al .. JPET, vol .336, p.64-76, (201 1 )] . \n\n\n There are very few effective treatments for neurological disorders characterized by progressive cell loss, known as neurodegenerative diseases, as well as those involving acute cell loss, such as stroke and trauma. In addition, few effective treatments exist for neurological disorders such as psychosis which has been linked to altered striatal function relating to changes in expression of the enzyme PDE I OA [J. A. Siuciak, et al. Neuropharmacology, vol . 5 1 , p. 374- 385, (2006)]. Striatal dysfunction is implicated in a number of CNS disorders including psychosis, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorders, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. The results with PDE I OA knock-out mice provide evidence that PDE I OA functions to inhibit striatal output by reducing spiny medium neuron excitability. PDEI OA is selectively expressed in dopamine receptive medium spiny neurons, and considerable data suggests that \n\n cAMP and cGM\n'\nP signalling pathways play significant roles in the regulation of medium spiny neuron excitability. Additional studies with papaverine, a potent inhibitor of PDEI OA, confirm that PDEI OA regulates both cAMP and cGMP in vivo in rats [J. A. Siuciak, et al. Neuropharmacology, vol. 51 , p. 386-396, (2006)]. \n\n\n In view of the foregoing, PDEI OA inhibitors are useful for treating and/or preventing various diseases caused by enhanced activity of PDE I OA, possibly with reduced side effects (for example, a neural disease such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease or Alzheimer's disease, dyskinesia, hypogonadism, diabetes, an ischemic heart disease, hypertension, an inflammatory disease, a disease of the digestive system, an allergic disease, osteoporosis, pain or a malignant tumor). \n\n\n WO 2003/000269, WO 2003/0141 15, WO 2003/0141 16, WO 2003/0141 1 7, WO 2003/051 877, WO 2006/034491 and WO 2006/034512 describe PDE10 inhibitors for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, diabetes and its related disorders.

Deacetylation fol lowed by esterification in a one pot reaction under acidic conditions gives the phenolic ester of formula (1 0). Alkylation of compound of formula (10) with alkyl halide of formula ( 1 l a) (where L is halogen) under basic conditions or reaction of appropriate alcohol of formula ( l i b) under Mitsunobu reaction conditions gives intermediate ( 1 2). Base hydrolysis of the ester o f formula ( 12) results in the formation of the corresponding acrylic acid derivative ( 1 3) which on coupling with amine (4), using suitable coupling agent such as EDCJ or DCC gives the compound of formula (Ia-1). \n\n\nSynthetic scheme 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (8) (9) ( 10) \n\n\n Z-Y-L (1 1 a), base or \n\n\n Z-Y-OH (1 1 b), DEAD, PPh\n3\n \n\n\n \n\n Similarly, the regioiosmeric acrylamide of formula (ib-1 ) where X is an oxygen atom can be prepared as shown in Synthetic scheme 4.

Inhibition of PDE10 enzyme activity can be quantitated by using a two step radiometric assay procedure (see Sette, C, Iona, S. and Conti, M., J. Biol. Chein., 269 ( 1 2), 1 994, pp 9245-9252). In this assay, PDE10 enzyme converts H-cAMP/\n3\nH-cGMP to \n3\nH- 3 3 \n\n\n AMP/ H-GMP which is then converted to H-adenosine/ H-guanosine using snake venom nucleotidase. The radioactivity released in the supernatant liquid is quantitated as an indicator of PDE 1 0 enzyme activity. \n\n\nln-vitro screening assay of PDE10A inhibitors \n\n\n Test compounds or reference compounds such as Dipyridamole, IB MX (Calbiochem) and Papverine (Sigma) were dissolved in pure dimethylsul fox ide (DMSO) to prepare 1 .0 m M stock solution and diluted suitably to afford the desired concentration. Final concentration of DMSO in the assay was 3 % (v/v). Substrate mixture was prepared by mixing \n3\nH-cAMP (GE Healthcare) and 1 .0 mM cold cAMP (Sigma) in order to get 0.5 μθί / mL & 1 μΜ final concentrations of each respectively in the assay buffer. A 1.0 mg/mL of snake venom nucleotidase (Sigma) was prepared in D/w. Dowex (AG1 -X8 from Biorad) slurry was mixed with water and ethanol at 1 .0: 1 .0: 1 .0 ratios. The assay was carried out using suitably diluted PDE 1 0A enzyme preparation (BPS Biosciences) to get around 15-20% substrate hydrolysis to ensure linear reaction kinetics. \n\n\n PDE 1 0 assay was carried out in 200 reaction volume by addition of assay buffer containing 10.0 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 mM MgCl\n2\n, test compound at required concentration and diluted enzyme. Reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by heating the plate in boiling water bath for 5.0 min and then cooling on an ice bath for 1 5 min. This was followed by addition of 50 μΕ of Crotalus atrox snake venom 5 '-nucleotidase and incubation at 30 °C for 30 min. Thereafter 400 μΕ of Dowex was added and incubated on ice bath for 1 5 min. Reaction mixture was centrifuged and supernatant liquid was used for quantifying radioactivity in the samples. Reaction was measured as counts per minute (cpm) using a Packard Biosciences plate reader. An enzyme control without test compounds was run to quantitate maximum PDE10 reaction. Inhibition of enzyme activity was calculated as a percent \n\n of control reaction. The IC50 values were calculated from dose-response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using Graph Pad Prism software. \n\n\n The compounds prepared were tested using the above assay procedure and the results obtained are given in Table 4. Percentage inhibition of human PDE I OA enzyme at concentrations of 1 .0 μΜ and 10.0 μΜ are given in the table 4 along with IC50 (nM) for selected examples. The IC50 (nM) values of the compounds are set forth in Table 4 wherein \"A\" refers to an IC50 value of less than 20 nM, \"B\" refers to an IC50 value in range of 20.01 -50 nM, \"C\" refers to an IC50

P et al., JPET, 290\n;\n p. 1 393- 1 408. ( 1 999)]. The screening of the compounds can also be carried out by some other methods and procedures known to persons skilled in the art. \n\n\n Dizocilpine (MK-801 ) - induced model of Psychosis in female Sprague-Dawley rats: \n\n\nDizocilpine (MK-801), a highly selective non-competitive antagonist of NMD A (N-methyl-d- aspartate) receptor [an excitatory amino acid (glutamate, EAA) receptor] is known to produce psychosis both in rodents and humans. A dysfunction in the main excitatory neurotransmitter system of the brain through the EAA receptors has been well documented in psychoses. On the day of the experiment, rats were acclimatized for 15 min before the administration of 0.2 mg/kg of MK-801 by subcutaneous route, followed by a behavioural observation (three behaviours: locomotion, stereotyped sniffing and ataxia) scoring that started 1 5 min after injection and continued for 1 h (i.e. 15-75 min post MK-801 ) [Andine, P et al ., JPET, 290, p. 1 393- 1 408, ( 1 999)]. The test compounds were administered at appropriate time point prior to the MK-801 injection, based on the route of administration. \n\n\nExample No. 91 , at a dose of 30 mg/kg (p.o.), administered 60 min prior, potently blocked the MK-801 - induced psychoses in female SD rats as shown in Figure 1 . \n\n\nExample No. 177, at a dose of 30 mg/kg (i.p.), administered 5 min prior, moderately blocked the MK-801 - induced psychoses in female SD rats as shown in Figure 2."
