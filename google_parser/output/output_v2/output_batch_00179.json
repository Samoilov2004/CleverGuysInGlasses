The invention as herein before described. Description\n\n\n\n\n Pyrrolidine derivatives as NK3 receptor antagonists \n\n\nThe present invention relates to compounds of formula I \n\n\n \n\n wherein \n\n\n R\n1\n is hydrogen or lower alkyl; \n\n\n R\n2\n is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkyl substituted by halogen or is halogen or CN, and may be independently from each other if o is 2; \n\n\nAr\n1\n is aryl or heteroaryl; \n\n\nAr\n2\n is aryl or heteroaryl; \n\n\n RVR' ' are independently from each other hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen, C(O)- lower alkyl, cyano or lower alkyl substituted by halogen; \n\n\nm is 0, 1 , or 2 when n is 0; or \n\n\nm is 0 or 1 when n is 1 ; \n\n\nn is O or l; \n\n\no is 1 or 2; \n\n\nor to pharmaceutically active salts, racemic mixtures, enantiomers, optical isomers or to tautomeric forms thereof. \n\n\n The invention includes all sterio isomeric forms, including individual diastereoisomers and enantiomers of the compound of formula I as well as racemic and non-racemic mixtures thereof. \n\n It has been found that the present compounds are high potential NK-3 receptor antagonists for the treatment of depression, pain, psychosis, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \n\n\n The three main mammalian tachykinins, substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB) belong to the family of neuropeptides sharing the common COOH-terminal pentapeptide sequence of Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2. As neurotransmitters, these peptides exert their biological activity via three distinct neurokinin (NK) receptors termed as NK-I, NK-2 and NK-3. SP binds preferentially to the NK-I receptor, NKA to the NK-2 and NKB to the NK-3 receptor. \n\n\n The NK-3 receptor is characterized by a predominant expression in CNS and its involvement in the modulation of the central monoaminergic system has been shown. These properties make the NK-3 receptor a potential target for central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and pain (Neurosci. Letters, 2000, 283, 185 -188; Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 2000, 10, 939-960; Neuroscience, 1996, 74, 403-414; Neuropeptides, 1998, 32, 481-488). \n\n\n Schizophrenia is one of the major neuropsychiatric disorders, characterized by severe and chronic mental impairment. This devastating disease affects about 1 % of the world's population. Symptoms begin in early adulthood and are followed by a period of interpersonal and social dysfunction. Schizophrenia manifests as auditory and visual hallucinations, paranoia, delusions (positive symptoms), blunted affect, depression, anhedonia, poverty of speech, memory and attention deficits as well as social withdrawal (negative symptoms). \n\n\n For decades scientists and clinicians have made efforts with the aim of discovering an ideal agent for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia. However, the complexity of the disorders, due to a wide array of symptoms, has hampered those efforts. There are no specific focal characteristics for the diagnosis of schizophrenia and no single symptom is consistently present in all patients. Consequently, the diagnosis of schizophrenia as a single disorder or as a variety of different disorders has been discussed but not yet resolved. The major difficulty in the development of a new drug for schizophrenia is the lack of knowledge about the cause and nature of this disease. Some neurochemical hypotheses have been proposed on the basis of pharmacological studies to rationalize the development of a corresponding therapy: the dopamine, the serotonin and the glutamate hypotheses. But taking into account the complexity of schizophrenia, an appropriate multireceptor affinity profile might be required for efficacy against positive and negative signs and symptoms. Furthermore, an ideal drug against schizophrenia \n\n would preferably have a low dosage allowing once-per-day dosage, due to the low adherence of schizophrenic patients. \n\n\n In recent years clinical studies with selective NKl and NK2 receptor antagonists appeared in the literature showing results for the treatment of emesis, depression, anxiety, pain and migraine (NKl) and asthma (NK2 and NKl). The most exciting data were produced in the treatment of chemotherapy- induced emesis, nausea and depression with NKl and in asthma with NK2- receptor antagonists. In contrast, no clinical data on NK3 receptor antagonists have appeared in the literature until 2000. Osanetant (SR 142,801) from Sanofϊ-Synthelabo was the first identified potent and selective non-peptide antagonist described for the NK3 tachykinin receptor for the potential treatment of schizophrenia, which was reported in the literature\n\n\n{Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001,2(7), 950-956 and Psychiatric Disorders Study 4, Schizophrenia, June 2003, Decision Recources, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts) . The proposed drug SR 142,801 has been shown in a phase II trial as active on positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as altered behaviour, delusion, hallucinations, extreme emotions, excited motor activity and incoherent speech, but inactive in the treatment of negative symptoms, which are depression, anhedonia, social isolation or memory and attention deficits. \n\n\n The neurokinin-3 receptor antagonists have been described as useful in pain or inflammation, as well as in schizophrenia, Exp. Opinion.Ther. Patents (2000), 10(6), 939-960 and Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(7), 950-956956 and Psychiatric \n\n\nDisorders Study 4, Schizophrenia, June 2003, Decision Recources, Inc., Waltham, \n\n\nMassachusetts). \n\n\n Objects of the present invention are novel compounds of formula I, their manufacture, medicaments based on a compound in accordance with the invention and their production as well as the use of compounds of formula I in the control or prevention of illnesses such as depression, pain, bipolar disorders, psychosis, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \n\n\n The preferred indications using the compounds of the present invention are depression, psychosis, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \n\n\nThe following definitions of the general terms used in the present description apply irrespective of whether the terms in question appear alone or in combination. \n\n -A-\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"lower alkyl\" denotes a straight- or branched-chain alkyl group containing from 1-8 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, t-butyl and the like.

Reduction of the acetyl moiety using standard conditions for example LiAlH\n4\n yields the two diasteroisomers V-A and V-B which are subsequently separated by column chromatography. Each of the diastereoisomers is then separately converted to the final derivatives I-A and I-B in the same manner. For instance V-B is subjected to a standard Mitsunobu reaction with for example a phenol, pyridin-ol, pyrimidin-ol to give the aryl-ether VI-B. Selective N-debenzylation is then carried out using several known procedures which are compatible with the substitution patterns of the aromatic rings to afford VII-B. Final derivatives I-B are prepared via a coupling with a suitable acid chloride or carboxylic acid XIII using known methods, wherein Y is hydroxy or halogen, R\n1\n a methyl moiety and the other definitions are as described above. \n\n\nGeneral scheme II \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively the pyrrolidine VII-B can undergo a coupling with a carboxylic acid derivative which after selective Boc deprotection generated the intermediate VIII-B. Final derivatives I-B oupling with R' '-Ar -Z XIII using well known reactions and procedures (e.g. \n\n nucleophilic aromatic substitution, Buchwald coupling), wherein Z is halogen and the other definitions are as described above. \n\n\n In the same manner, the diastereomer VII-A can be converted to final derivatives I-A \n\n\nGeneral scheme III \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively to the Mitsunobu reaction shown scheme I, derivatives V-A and V-B can used in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction when the Ar moiety is a o-pyridinyl or a o- pyrimidinyl to yield respectively VI-B and VI-A. \n\n\nGeneral Scheme IV \n\n\n\n\n\n Rh(I) catalyst\n\n\n \n\n (S) Or (R)-BINAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative method for the preparation of intermediates IV (with R\n1\n is Me) is highlighted scheme 4. A 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between the commercially available but-3-yn-2-one IX and the azomethine ylide generated in situ from the N-(methoxymethyl)-N-(phenylmethyl)-N- (trimethylsilyl)methylamine III in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid, such as TFA afforded the dihydropyrrole derivative X. A 1,4-addition of a boronic acid catalysed by a Rh(I) \n\n catalyst such as the Rhacetylacetonatbis(ethylene) in a presence of of a chiral phosphine ligand such as the (R) or (S)-BINAP afforded the optically enriched disubstituted pyrrolidine IV. \n\n\nSimilar Rh-catalysed asymmetric 1 ,4-arylation have been reported earlier (Tet. Lett., 2004, 45(16), 3265) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe derivatives of the type I-C with Rl equal H where prepared via the following route (scheme 5). The 3,4-disubstituted pyrrolidines XII were prepared via a stereo specific 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between the (E)-3-substituted phenyl-acrylic acid ethyl ester derivatives XI and the azomethine ylide generated in situ from the N-(methoxymethyl)-N-(phenylmethyl)-N- (trimethylsilyl)methylamine III in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid, such as TFA. \n\n\nReduction of the ester moiety using standard conditions for example LiAlH\n4\n yielded the primary alcohol V-C. Standard Mitsunobu reaction with for example a phenol, pyridin-ol, pyrimidin-ol gave the aryl-ether VI-C. Selective N-debenzylation was then carried out using several known procedures which are compatible with the substitution patterns of the aromatic rings to afford \n\n VII-C. Final derivatives I-C were obtained via a coupling with a suitable acid chloride or carboxylic acide XIII using known methods. \n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n\n\n As mentioned earlier, the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable addition salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. It has been found that the \n\n\ncompounds of the present invention are antagonists of neurokinin 3 (NK-3) receptors. The compounds were investigated in accordance with the tests given hereinafter. \n\n\nExperimental procedure \n\n\nThe compounds were investigated in accordance with the tests given hereinafter. \n\n\n[\n3\nH]SR142801 competition binding assay \n\n\nhNK3 receptor binding experiment were performed using [ HJSR142801 (Catalog No. TRKl 035, specific activity: 74.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham, GE Healthcare UK limited, Buckinghamshire, UK) and membrane isolated from HEK293 cells transiently expressing recombinant human NK3 receptor. After thawing, the membrane homogenates were centrifuged at 48,000 X g for 10 min at 4 \n0\nC, the pellets were resuspended in the 50 mM Tris-HCl, 4 mM MnCl\n2\n, 1 μM \n\n\nphosphoramidon, 0.1 % BSA binding buffer at pH 7.4 to a final assay concentration of 5 μg protein/well. For inhibition experiments, membranes were incubated with [\n3\nH] SRl 42801 at a concentration equal to K\nD\n value of radioligand and 10 concentrations of the inhibitory compound (0.0003-10 μM) (in a total reaction volume of 500 μl) for 75 min at room temperature (RT). At the end of the incubation, membranes were filtered onto unitfilter (96-well white microplate with bonded GF/C filter preincubated 1 h in 0.3% PEI + 0.3% BSA, Packard BioScience, Meriden, CT) with a Filtermate 196 harvester (Packard BioScience) and washed 4 times with ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 buffer. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μM \n\n\nSB222200 for both radioligands. The radioactivity on the filter was counted (5 min) on a \n\n\n Packard Top-count microplate scintillation counter with quenching correction after addition of 45 μl of microscint 40 (Canberra Packard S.

The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions. \n\n\n The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc can be used as such excipients e.g. for tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. \n\n\n Suitable excipients for soft gelatine capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semisolid and liquid polyols etc. \n\n Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are e.g. water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose etc. \n\n\n Suitable excipients for injection solutions are e.g. water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils etc. \n\n\n Suitable excipients for suppositories are e.g. natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi- liquid or liquid polyols etc. \n\n\n Moreover, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances. \n\n\n The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily dosage of about 10 to 1000 mg per person of a compound of general formula I should be appropriate, although the above upper limit can also be exceeded when necessary. \n\n\nExample A \n\n\n Tablets of the following composition are manufactured in the usual manner: \n\n\n mg / tablet \n\n\n Active substance 5 \n\n\nLactose 45 \n\n\n Corn starch 15 \n\n\n Micro crystalline cellulose 34 \n\n\n Magnesium stearate 1 \n\n\n Tablet weight 100 \n\n\nExample B \n\n\n Capsules of the followin g composition are manufactured: \n\n\n mg / capsule \n\n\n Active substance 10 \n\n\nLactose 155 \n\n\n Corn starch 30 \n\n\n Talc 5 \n\n\n Capsule fill weight 200 \n\n The active substance, lactose and corn starch are firstly mixed in a mixer and then in a comminuting machine.
