Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 12/881,234 filed Sep. 14, 2010, which is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 12/141,228 filed Jun. 18, 2008 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/948,213 filed Jul. 6, 2007.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to non-basic melanin concentrating hormone receptor-1 (MCHR1) antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions containing MCHR1 antagonists and methods of treating diabetes, obesity and related diseases employing such MCHR1 antagonists.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nSeveral lines of pharmacological and genetic evidence support the role of Melanin Concentrating Hormone Receptor-1 (hereafter “MCHR1”) as a modulator of food intake and body weight. Central administration of melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) increases food intake and body weight both in rats and in mice. Chronic ICV infusion of MCH causes increased food intake and ultimately obesity in mice, while infusion of an MCH peptide antagonist blocks MCH-induced food intake and results in weight loss and decreased feeding in diet-induced obese mice.\n\n\nThe expression of both the MCH peptide and receptor are modulated by nutritional status. MCH mRNA is upregulated both in hyperphagic obese mice (ob/ob), and fasted animals. Targeted disruption of the gene for MCH peptide results in hypophagia and leanness. Disruption of the MCHR1 gene causes leanness, altered metabolism, and hyperlocomotion accompanied by mild hyperphagia. Conversely, over-expression of MCH peptide results in hyperphagia, obesity and diabetes. Small molecule MCHR1 antagonists have been shown to cause weight loss in rodent weight and feeding models after both oral and intraperitoneal administration; \nEur. J. Pharmacol., \n438:129-135 (2002), \nNat. Med., \n8:825-830 (2002), \nEur. J. Pharmacol., \n497:41-47 (2004).\n\n\nNumerous non-peptide MCHR1 antagonists have been disclosed. The scope of the genus for each reflects a common perception regarding the criteria required for ligand recognition as MCHR1 agonists. A recent review of MCHR1 patent disclosures emphasized the commonality of these structures by the following description; “Ubiquitous throughout the MCH patent literature are molecules consisting of a central scaffold to which linkers to an aryl or heteroaryl group and a basic amino functionality are attached.” (Kowalski, T. J. et al., \nExpert Opin. Investig. Drugs, \n13:1113-1122 (2004)). Pharmacophore models of these geni consistently envision a presumed prerequisite electrostatic interaction between a basic amine center of the antagonist ligand and aspartic acid 123 of the receptor which presumably is envisaged to emulate the mandatory interaction between arginine 14 of MCH peptide agonists with aspartic acid 123 of the MCHR1 receptor. (Ulven, T., \nJ. Med. Chem., \n48:5684-5697 (2005)) However, incorporation of this basic amine in a MCHR1 antagonist increases substantially the probability of binding to off-target ion-channels and biogenic amine receptors.\n\n\nIn accordance with the present invention, there is provided a series of novel high affinity selective MCHR1 antagonists for which binding affinity is not dependent upon inclusion of a basic amine functionality that is common to most of the disclosed MCHR antagonists. As a consequence, the absence of the basic center greatly reduces the probability of off-target interactions such as binding to other biogenic amine receptors as well as binding to ion channels such as the HERG receptor in the heart. The reduction abolition of affinity for the HERG receptor is especially important since ligand occupancy is associated with initiation of fatal arrhythmias.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, a compound of the Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is provided\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nis a phenylene ring or a heteroaryl ring which is a monocyclic ring or a bicyclic ring which contains one or two nitrogen atoms or one oxygen atom;\n\n\n\nR\n1 \nis Z—Y—X—, wherein\n\n \n \n \n \nX is O, S,\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nY is a bond, a 3- to 6-membered cycloalkyl, or an alkyl chain; and\n\n\nZ is aryl such as phenyl and naphthyl, or heteroaryl such as pyridinyl, pyridimidinyl, pyrazinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, or other “heteroaryl”;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n2 \nis -E-G-(J)\nm\n, with m being an integer from 1 to 3;\n\n\nE is O, S, or a bond;\n\n\nG is lower alkyl, phenylalkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, alkylcycloalkyl, cycloalkoxy, alkylcycloalkoxy, or cycloalkoxyalkyl;\n\n\neach J is independently hydrogen, hydroxyl, CN, —SO\n2\nR\n7\n, —SR\n7\n, —SOR\n7\n, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, CF\n3\n, CF\n3\nO—, —COOR\n5 \n(wherein R\n5 \nis H, C\n1-3 \nalkyl, or cycloalkyl), or —CO—NR\n5a\nR\n6 \nwherein R\n5a \nand R\n6 \nare each independently selected from H, alkyl, or cycloalkyl, or R\n5a \nand R\n6 \ntaken together can be propanediyl, butanediyl or pentanediyl to form with the N atom to which they are attached a 4-, 5- or 6-membered cyclic amine, such as azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, or piperazinyl, optionally substituted with substituents as set out for “heterocyclo”;\n\n\nR\n7 \nis lower alkyl;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis C\n1-6 \nalkyl, cycloalkyl, C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, halogen, hydrogen, —S—C\n1-6 \nalkyl, CN, CF\n3\nO, or CF\n3\n;\n\n\nand wherein R\n2 \nand R\n3 \ncan be taken together to form a 5- to 7-membered ring which is saturated, unsaturated, or partially unsaturated and may include an E heteroatom, which is O, or 0, 1 or 2 N atoms, which ring is substituted with one or two of —O-G-(J)\nm \ngroups, wherein at least one J is OH, and optionally other substituents as set out for “alkyl”, “aryl”, or “heteroaryl”, such as alkyl and/or OH;\n\n\nwith the proviso that where\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nis a phenylene ring, E-G and R\n3 \nare not identical unsubstituted lower alkoxy groups, and when G is lower alkyl and J is H, R\n3 \nis not hydrogen; and\n\n\n\nR\n8 \nand R\n9 \nare each independently hydrogen, halogen, or lower alkyl;\n\n\nincluding esters thereof, prodrugs thereof, solvates thereof, and all stereoisomers thereof.\n\n\nAny of the foregoing Z moieties may either be unsubstituted or substituted with 1, 2 or 3 of amino, halo, C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n1-3 \nalkylamino, di-C\n1-3 \nalkylamino, C\n1-3 \nalkoxy, C\n1-3 \nthioalkyl, C\n1-3 \ntrifluoroalkoxy, trifluoromethyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkoxy, or heteroaryl such as pyridyl or substituted with any of the substituents as set out for “aryl”, “heteroaryl”, or “alkyl”.\n\n\nExamples of substituents for the J group in the form of a cyclic amine include but are not limited to lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, OH, CF\n3\n, or CF\n3\nO, or other substituents as set out for “alkyl” and “heteroaryl”.\n\n\nIn a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which contains a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the invention Formula I as defined above, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\n\n\nThere is also provided a method for the treatment of diabetes, obesity and other related conditions involving the MCHR1 in a mammal (such as a human, dog or cat) in need thereof, which includes the steps of administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of Formula I of the invention as defined above.\n\n\nThe invention also sets forth one or more methods for making the compound of Formula I of the invention.

After stirring at 55 to 60° C. for 2 h, the reaction was transferred to a separatory funnel, diluted with EtOAc and 2N KHCO\n3 \nand extracted with EtOAc (2×). The combined organic layers were washed with 2N KHCO\n3 \nand water; whereupon, the combined aqueous layers were extracted with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. All of the organic layers were combined prior to drying over MgSO\n4 \nto afford 3-chloro-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)pyrazin-2(1H)-one (0.34 g, 59% yield). HPLC 2.33 min. LC MS 1.00 min (M+1=267/269). The chloropyrazinone was used in the subsequent steps without further purification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4-Chlorobenzylmercaptan (71 mg, 0.059 mL, 0.45 mmol) was added to a stirred THF (1.0 mL) suspension of sodium hydride (60% oil dispersion, 18 mg, 0.45 mmol), that had been previously washed with hexane 3×. The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature for 20 min until it became a solid mass; whereupon, the chloropyrazinone prepared in Part C (100 mg, 0.38 mmol) in THF (5 mL) was added resulting in gas evolution. After stirring at ambient temperature for 40 min, the reaction was diluted with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n/H\n2\nO, extracted with CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(2×) and dried over MgSO\n4 \nto afford 220 mg of crude product after evaporation of the solvent. The desired was purified by chromatography on silica gel (12 g) employing gradient elution (0-100% EtOAc/hexane over 12 min) to elute the desired 3-(4-chlorobenzylthio)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)pyrazin-2(1H)-one (130 mg, 89% yield).\n\n\nMethod 2\n\n\nA solution of the 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione prepared in Part B (67 mg, 0.27 mmol), diisopropylethyl amine (0.15 mL, 0.81 mmol), pyBOP (0.23 g, 0.46 mmol), and dimethylaminopyridine (13 mg) in DMF (1.2 mL) was stirred at ambient temperature for 15 min. After addition of 2-pyridylethyl mercaptan (28 mg, 0.40 mmol), the reaction was stirred at ambient temperature for 2.5 h prior to quenching by addition of H\n2\nO and extraction with EtOAc. The EtOAc extracts were washed with water (2×), brine, dried over MgSO\n4 \nand concentrated to yield 204 mg of crude product. Chromatography on silica employing a gradient elution with hexane/EtOAc afforded the desired product 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(2-(pyrazin-2-yl)ethylthio)pyrazin-2(1H)-one (17 mg, 17% yield).\n\n\nMethod 2a\n\n\nThe same procedure was employed as that described in Method 2 except that the reaction was run for 18 hr.\n\n\nMethod 3\n\n\nFollowing preparation of the oxalamide as described in Part A, ring closure can be effected by prolonged thermal heating in TFA/HOAc at 78° C. for 1d. In the case of 3-methoxy-4-(2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethoxy)aniline which contained a basic amine, the reaction was brought to pH 6 to 7 with saturated NaHCO\n3 \nand then evaporated in vacuo. The residue was absorbed on silica gel and purified by flash chromatography (5 to 15% 2N NH\n3 \nin MeOH/CH\n2\nCl\n2\n) to afford the desired 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione in 36% yield. This material was subsequently converted to final product following the procedure described in Method 2.\n\n\nMethod 4\n\n\nIf the oxalamide as described in Part A contained a primary or secondary alcohol, prolonged thermal heating in TFA/HOAc at 78° C. for 1 day not only effected ring closure but also converted the alcohol moiety to an acetate. The resulting 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione was converted to the desired 3-thio substituted-1-arylpyrazin-2-one employing Method 1. Following workup and purification as described in Method 1, the acetylated product was converted to the desired 3-thio substituted-1-arylpyrazin-2-one (19 mg, 0.041 mmol) bearing a free hydroxyl by dissolution in MeOH (1.0 mL) and H\n2\nO (0.1 mL) and stirring at ambient temperature for 1 h after addition of potassium carbonate (30 mg). The reaction was then diluted with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n/H\n2\nO prior to extraction with CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(2×). After drying the combined organic layers over MgSO\n4\n, concentration afforded the desired final product (16 mg, 93% yield).\n\n\nMethod 5\n\n\nFor weakly nucleophilic thiols more forcing conditions were required effect PyBOP mediated conversion of the 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione to a 3-thio substituted-1-arylpyrazin-2-ones. Accordingly, a DMF solution (0.4 mL) containing the 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione prepared in Part B (92 mg, 0.30 mmol), PyBOP (0.27 g, 0.53 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.16 mL, 0.9 mmol) was stirred for 3 h before addition of a DMF solution prepared by stirring 5-methoxybenzo[d]thiazole-2-thiol (296 mg, 1.502 mmol) with NaH (60.1 mg, 1.502 mmol, rinsed with hexane 2×) in DMF (0.2 mL) at ambient temperature for 10 min. After stirring at ambient temperature for 7 days, the reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and washed sequentially with water (2×) and brine prior to drying over MgSO\n4\n. After evaporation of the solvent, CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(10 mL) was added to the 0.30 g of crude product. Filtration to remove any residual solids followed by evaporation of the filtrate afforded 0.10 g crude product. Final purification required flash chromatography on 12 g silica gel using gradient elution (0 to 100% EtOAc/CH\n2\nCl\n2\n) followed by preparatory HPLC (YMC S5 ODS 20×100 mm, 20 mL/min, 30 to 100% B in A over 10 min, Solvent A=10% MeOH/H\n2\nO-0.1% TFA, Solvent B=90% MeOH/H\n2\nO−0.1% TFA) to afford pure desired product (6.3 mg, 4% yield).\n\n\nMethod 6\n\n\nGeneral Experimental Procedures for Preparation of 1-(4-(2-Hydroxy-2-methylpropoxy)-3-methylphenyl)-3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylthio)pyrazin-2(1H)-one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart A.

The compounds (parent and prodrug esters) were administered p.o. at 2.0 ml/kg as a suspension in 0.5% methyl cellulose, 0.1% Tween 80 in water at 10 mg/kg p.o. Blood samples were taken at 1, 2, 4 and 8 hr. After determination of parent concentration, an AUC was calculated for the eight hour study.\n\n\nAssessment of In Vivo MCHR1 Activity\n\n\nMale Sprague Dawley (CD, Charles River Breeding Laboratory) rats weighing approximately 240 grams were placed in individual plastic cages with AlphaDri bedding. The room was maintained at 72° F. and 50% humidity, and a 12/12 light dark cycle with lights out at 1600 hours. The rats were conditioned for 5 days prior to the start of the study to having a choice of foods. A normal chow (Harlan Teklad, 2018) that contains 18% protein, 5% fat and 73% carbohydrate and a high fat high sugar diet (Research Diets (D2327) that contains 20% protein, 40% fat and 40% carbohydrate where the carbohydrate is entirely sucrose and the fat is soybean and coconut oil. Studies have revealed that rats exhibit a high preference for the high fat/high sucrose diet (80% preference). Body weight and consumption of both kinds of food as well as water intake were measured daily. Water was available ad lib throughout the study. Food consumption is presented as daily caloric consumption which is the sum of grams of chow multiplied by the Kcal per gram (3.5) plus grams of high fat high sugar multiplied by Kcal per gram (4.59).\n\n\nBaseline body weight was measured prior to drug treatment on day 0 of the study. Baseline food consumption was the average of the 3 days prior to the first drug treatment. Drug was administered daily p.o. at 2.0 ml/kg at 1500 hours beginning on day 0 and continuing daily through day 4 as a suspension in 0.5% methyl cellulose, 0.1% Tween 80 in water at 3.0, 10 and 30 mg/kg p.o. All data were evaluated using ANOVA and Fishers PLSD statistics.\n\n\nBiological Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDose\n\n\nWeight Reduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\nversus Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n193\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n2.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n3.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n194\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n2.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n7.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n202\n\n\n30\n\n\n2.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n45\n\n\n4.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n113\n\n\n45\n\n\n4.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the invention has been described according to several embodiments, various modifications thereto, in addition to those described herein, may become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description.
