A1058725, A133292, GM46192 and MH0622961. Also, funding for developments of inventions herein was provided by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), No. SFP-1442 and the American Foundation for AIDS Research. The United States government, IAVI and the American Foundation for AIDS Research may have certain rights to the present invention.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to the structure of Fab 4E10, e.g., as a complex with herein identified peptide KGND, herein identified as a 4E10 mimetope on gp41, as determined by crystallographic techniques, and to the confirmation that peptide KGND has a functional relevant conformation, as well as to the determination of key residues on 4E10. The present invention thus provides a means for identifying or designing compounds, such as, but not limited to, peptides or derivatized peptides (e.g., N-acylated or N-alkylated peptides), that bind to the antibody. These compounds, when administered, elicit anti-HIV antibodies. The compounds may then be used in diagnostic, pharmaceutical, immunogenic, immunological or vaccine compositions. These compositions are useful in the detection or treatment and/or prevention of HIV infections, specifically Glade B infections, although variants may be effective against any one or more of clades A, C, D, or E. Further, antibodies elicited by such compounds also can be used in diagnostic or pharmaceutical, immunogenic, immunological or vaccine compositions. The invention also relates to the use of the structure of KGND, e.g., as determined by crystallographic techniques to identify further compounds or antibodies, which would bind to KGND, which compounds or antibodies are useful in diagnostic, pharmaceutical, immunogenic, immunological compositions, e.g., as such compounds or antibodies bind to HIV immunogens, antigens or epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to data storage media encoded with the structural data, e.g., coordinates of crystallized 4E10 or at least a functional portion thereof and/or KGND. Such data storage material is capable of displaying such structures, or their structural homologues, as a graphical three-dimensional representation on a computer screen. This invention also relates to methods of using the structure co-ordinates to solve the structure of compounds that similarly complex with 4E10, as well as compounds that complex with KGND. In addition, this invention relates to methods of using structure co-ordinates to screen and design compounds that bind to 4E10, as well as compounds that bind to KGND. The invention further relates to transmission of information concerning such compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther aspects of the invention are discussed in or are obvious from the text of this document.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe development of a vaccine is considered to be the best hope for controlling the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. A vaccine should elicit two components: neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CTL. This can be achieved by immunization with dead virus or immunogenic peptides or proteins from the infectious agent. However, in the case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), these approaches have not yet been successful. Protection against both intravenous and vaginal simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenges by neutralizing antibodies has been shown in macaques (Parren, 2001; Mascola, 2000; Shibata, 1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, an effective vaccine should elicit a broadly neutralizing antibody response, since a wide variety of strains of the virus exist. Broadly neutralizing antibodies recognize exposed conserved regions on gp120 and gp41 on envelope spikes on the surface of the virus. Their existence was demonstrated by the activity of certain HIV sera; and broadly neutralizing antibodies have been described (Burton, 1994; Conley, 1994; Burton, 1996; Zwick, 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HIV type 1 (HIV-1) transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 mediates viral fusion with host cells (Chan, 1998). Before fusion, gp41 exists as a trimeric complex associated with gp120, and has limited accessibility. The broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies 2F5 and 4E10 appear to recognize structures that are present to some degree even after binding of virus to the target cell (Binley, 2003). Their epitopes are close and are found in a region of gp41 proximal to the membrane (see \nFIG. 42\n). \nFIG. 42A\n provides the structure of gp41, and \nFIG. 42B\n depicts the current model wherein HIV gp41 undergoes major structural arrangements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe native state of the 120-gp41 complex is metastable and triggered by gp120 binding to CD4 and coreceptor (here CCR5). The 4E10 epitope on gp41 is represented as a pink helix parallel to the plane of the viral membrane and the epitope seems to be exposed and susceptible to antibody binding and virus neutralization in the metastable and receptor-bound states of gp41. Conformational changes of the Env proteins leading to the pre-hairpin intermediate cause gp120 dissociation of gp41 and insertion of the gp41 fusion peptide into the host cell membrane. For clarity, only one gp41 monomer is shown for the pre-hairpin state (N-terminal heptad repeat is a pink helix and C-terminal heptad repeat is a green helix). 4E10 binding to the extended pre-hairpin intermediate is a possibility to be still proved. The viral and cell membranes are brought into close proximity and the orientation of the helical gp41 membrane-proximal region parallel to the membranes with the Trp residues around the helical axis could aid in the disruption of both membranes. In the final stages of fusion, the C-terminal heptad repeat folds back onto the N-terminal heptad repeat to generate a trimer of hairpins also known as the 6-helix bundle structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferent routes have been explored to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. One of them consists of trying to generate immunogens that will induce a 2F5-like immune response. However, immunizations with peptides containing the 2F5 sequence have failed to elicit neutralizing antibodies, possibly because these peptides do not adopt the same conformation as gp41 during fusion. As a result, antibodies bind to the peptide epitope but do not neutralize.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnly a handful of potent and broadly cross-reactive human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have being identified to date against HIV-1 primary isolates and include MAbs b12, 2G12, 2F5, and 4E10. These rare MAbs have been derived from HIV-1 infected patients and target conserved, but distinct, epitopes on gp120 or gp41, the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoproteins responsible for mediating HIV entry into human cells (Weissenhorn et al., 1997; Chan et al., 1997; Kwong et al., 1998; Wyatt and Sodroski, 1998). MAb b12 binds to the recessed CD4 binding site on gp120 (Saphire et al., 2001), whereas MAb 2G12 recognizes a unique cluster of oligomannose sugars on the gp120 outer domain (Calarese et al., 2003). MAbs 4E10 and 2F5 both recognize adjacent and conserved contiguous epitopes in the C-terminal membrane-proximal region of gp41 (\nFIG. 37A\n), indicating that gp41 is not completely masked by gp120 from Ab recognition. The 2F5 epitope is centered around the sequence ELDKWA (SEQ ID NO: 76) (Muster et al., 1993; Zwick et al., 2001a; Barbato et al., 2003), whereas 4E10 recognizes an epitope containing the sequence NWF(D/N)IT (SEQ ID NO: 77) (Zwick et al., 2001b) in a Trp-rich region of gp41 immediately C-terminal to the 2F5 epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther reports that have identified neutralizing antibodies (such as 2F5 and 4E10) against human immunodeficiency virus glycoproteins, such as gp41 include, for instance, Stiegler et al., 2001; Ferrantelli et al., 2003; Ktabwalla et al., 2003; Ruprecht et al., 2003. Mention is also made of Schibli et al., 2001 that relates to the NMR structure of a peptide that shows a helical structure. Mention is also made of Barbato, G. et al. 2003, McGaughey, G. B., 2003, Biron, Z. et al., 2002, and Joyce, J. G. et al., 2002; which show there is controversy in the art as to the structure of peptides, such as gp41 and portions thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies have been done to elucidate the crystal structure of biologically significant proteins and modulators thereof, such as cytochrome P450 2C9, Beta-Site APP Cleaving Enzyme, ketopantoate reductase, ketopantoate hydroxymethyl transferase, pantothenate synetase; see, e.g., PCT Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 02/077270, WO 03/035693, WO 03/012089, WO 02/095035, WO 02/079490, WO 02/0222793.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt would thus be desirable to identify the structure of Fab 4E10, e.g., in complex with a herein identified peptide KGND, herein identified as a 4E10 mimetope on gp41, such as by way of crystallographic techniques, and confirm that peptide KGND has a functional relevant conformation. These techniques would also provide a determination of key residues on 4E10, to provide means for identifying or designing compounds, such as peptides or derivatized peptides (e.g., N-acylated or N-alkylated peptides), that bind to the antibody, and thus when administered elicit anti-HIV antibodies; the compounds may then be used in diagnostic, pharmaceutical, immunogenic, immunological or vaccine compositions, useful in the detection or treatment and/or prevention of HIV infections, and which antibodies can be used in diagnostic or pharmaceutical, immunogenic, immunological or vaccine compositions. Such compounds may also be made on synthetic backbones or scaffolds which would provide the correct spacing and distribution for the side chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the study of crystal structure and symmetry is developed (See, e.g., Cotton and Wilkinson, Inorganic Chemistry (John Wiley & Sons, Fourth Ed. 1980), especially Ch. 2). X-ray crystallography, or more generally crystallography, is an established, well-studied technique that provides what can best be described as a three-dimensional picture of what a molecule looks like in a crystal, and is useful for determining whether a compound that is not a known ligand of a target biomolecule can indeed bind as a ligand to a target biomolecule (see, e.g., WO 99/45379; U.S. Pat. No. 6,087,478; U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,672); and, there are additional techniques for identifying drug cores (see, e.g., WO 98/57155 regarding fragment-based screening). Mention is also made of U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,128,582, 6,153,579, 6,077,682, and 6,037,117 and PCT publications WO01/37194 and WO00/47763 for additional information on aspects of structure-based drug design and homology modelling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese techniques can be employed with the herein disclosed 4E10 crystals and proteins, to rationally design compounds that bind to or interact with 4E10; and, the use of these techniques, in combination with herein disclosed 4E10 crystals and proteins it is believed has not been heretofore taught or suggested in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs previously stated, simultaneous targeting of multiple conserved epitopes on HIV appears to be the best strategy for vaccine development to maximize the breadth of protection (Zwick et al., 2001b; Kitabwalla et al., 2003). As a single agent, 4E10 is the broadest neutralizing MAb described to date with activity against most isolates from HIV-1 clades, including A, B, C, D, E, and G, albeit sometimes with less potency compared to the other three more restricted MAbs described above. The breadth and potency of 4E10 was recently evaluated against a panel of 93 viruses in a pseudovirus assay (Binley et al. Manuscript in preparation). From this extensive analysis, 4E10 neutralizes viruses with a variety of substitutions in the NWF(D/N)IT (SEQ ID NO: 77) motif comprising the 4E10 epitope (\nFIG. 37B\n). The minimal epitope for 4E10 from this study was defined as WFXI, where X can be D, N, S, G, E, or T. However, several HIV isolates with the same 4E10 target epitope are differentially neutralized with orders of magnitude difference in potencies (Binley et al. Manuscript in preparation), implying that the 4E10 epitope is not constitutively exposed on all viruses, but differences in Env conformation or different infection kinetics might influence accessibility to the 4E10 epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBroadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to HIV-1 like 4E10 are invaluable tools for vaccine design and the description of the binding of 4E10 to its peptide epitope should assist in the design of immunogens able of eliciting 4E10-like neutralizing responses. The fact that the 4E10 epitope is contiguous and has a biologically-relevant helical conformation, makes the epitope a very good lead for structure-based design of a broadly effective HIV-1 vaccine. The importance of understanding why only a few antibodies can neutralize primary isolates of HIV-1 is of fundamental importance for the design of an HIV-1 vaccine and for generating a broad immune response that would be effective against the multiple isolates and clades of HIV-1 found worldwide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conserved C-terminal region of the 41 extracellular domain that encompasses the 4E10 and 2F5 epitopes is critical for Env-mediated membrane fusion and virus infectivity (Salzwedel et al., 1999; Munoz-Barroso et al., 1999). Alanine mutation of three of five conserved tryptophan residues (Trp\n666\n, Trp\n670\n, and Trp\n672\n; numbered according to the HXB2 isolate sequence) in this membrane-proximal gp41 region abolishes viral entry (Salzwedel et al., 1999). Moreover, the induction of membrane leakage by a peptide corresponding to this Trp-rich region (Suarez et al., 2000) implies that this region may be directly involved in membrane disruption during the fusion process. However, this notion has been challenged by another mutagenesis study which suggests that the membrane-proximal region instead provides a flexible arm to gp41 to allow membrane fusion (Dimitrov et al., 2003). Overall, the conserved membrane-proximal region of gp41 appears to be highly promising for vaccine development, especially since it is the target of two (4E10 and 2F5) of the four most broadly neutralizing HIV MAbs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe three-dimensional structure of the Trp-rich membrane-proximal region of gp41 was previously investigated by NMR spectroscopy using a synthetic peptide (KWASLWNWFNITNWLWYIK) (SEQ ID NO: 1; Schibli et al., 2001). In dodecylphosphocholine micelles, the Trp-rich region has a helical structure with the Trp residues forming a “collar” around the helix axis, parallel to the water-dodecylphosphocholine interface of the micelle. However, the precise orientation of this region in the natural context of the native gp120-gp41 trimer and how it might rearrange during the fusion process remain unknown. To examine the interaction of 4E10 with its epitope on gp41 at the atomic level, we determined the crystal structure of Fab 4E10 in complex with a soluble synthetic 13-residue peptide (KGWNWFDITNWGK) (SEQ ID NO: 2; Zwick et al., 2001a) that encompasses the 4E10 epitope and corresponds to the W670-W678 consensus group M sequence of gp160. The structure of this complex elucidates the epitope conformation recognized by 4E10, as well as its interaction with this neutralizing antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides also appear to be good candidates in the development of a vaccine against HIV. Carrier-conjugated synthetic peptides have advantages over protein-based systems because peptides can be modified and synthesized more easily than proteins, therefore they can be used more readily in a drug design process. Moreover, synthetic peptides, conjugated to the appropriate carrier elicit antibodies that often cross react with the native protein antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe success of immunoprophylaxis in animal models using HIV-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies suggests that, if neutralizing antibodies could be generated by an appropriate vaccine, they could provide substantial benefits (Gauduin et al., 1997; Parren et al., 2001; Ferrantelli et al., 2002; Ferrantelli et al., 2003; Mascola, 2003). However, the goal of designing immunogens which elicit antibodies that can neutralize multiple isolates of HIV-1 has been extraordinarily difficult to achieve. The vast majority of anti-HIV-1 antibodies elicited either by immunization or during natural infection have poor or no cross-neutralizing activity to other HIV-1 isolates and typically bind to epitopes that either vary from virus to virus or are poorly, or not, exposed on infectious virions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention identifies, designs and synthesizes peptides and peptidomimetics that would target more than one epitope present on gp41 using information on the structure of 4E10 and 2F5/peptide complexes that can ultimately be used in therapeutics or vaccines.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe structural features of antibody (Fab) 4E10, the broadest HIV nAB (neutralizing antibody), complexed with KGND, have been discovered from analysis of its crystal structure. It has also been discovered that the structure of KGND, 4E10 mimetope on gp41, has a functionally relevant conformation; that is, the structure of KGND—a helical structure—has been elucidated. This structure provides information on how compounds can bind to 4E10, as well as on how compounds may bind to KGND. Also, the interaction of key residues (e.g., Trp5, Phe6, Ile8, and Thr9) on 4E10/4E10 epitope have been determined. The atomic coordinates of the crystal structure are set forth in Table 1. The crystal features are: a C2 space group, cell parameters (in angstroms for a, b, c and degrees for Beta, rms deviations 0.5 angstroms, 1.0 degrees) of a: 157.3 angstroms, b: 45.1 angstroms, c: 198.6 angstroms, and Beta: 113.8 degrees. There are two dimers (i.e. Fab-peptide) per asymmetric unit. Other aspects of the crystal structure are provided in the Figures and Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention thus provides a Fab 4E10:KGND complex having the crystal structure herein described, e.g., a C2 space group, cell parameters (in angstroms for a, b, c and degrees for Beta, rms deviations 0.5 angstroms, 1.0 degrees) of a: 157.3 angstroms, b: 45.1 angstroms, c: 198.6 angstroms, and Beta: 113.8 degrees and/or having an X-ray diffraction pattern corresponding to or resulting from any or all of the foregoing and/or having an X-ray diffraction pattern corresponding to or resulting from any or all of the foregoing and/or a crystal having the structure defined by the coordinates of Table 1. Furthermore, one of skill in the art will recognize that using the coordinates of Table 1, it is possible to obtain multiple crystal structures which may crystallize in another space group with differing cell dimensions. The invention encompasses such other structures and uses thereof as herein discussed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a peptide which consists essentially of WFXIT (SEQ ID NO: 78), wherein X may be N, D, S, G or other amino acids, e.g., conservative substitutions thereof. WFXIT (SEQ ID NO: 78) has been identified as the key residues of 4E10. These residues may be flanked on either side, however the present invention does not encompass such sequences as known in the art, or which would alter the structure (from the helical structure elucidated as part of this invention). Furthermore, the invention encompasses a polypeptide having a sequence consisting essentially of DKWX\n1\nX\n2\nX\n3\nX\n4\nX\n5\nWFXIT (SEQ ID NO: 3), wherein X is as defined above, X\n1\n=A or a conservative substitution thereof, X\n2\n=N or a conservative substitution thereof, X\n3\n=L or a conservative substitution thereof, X\n4\n=W or a conservative substitution thereof, X\n5\n=N or a conservative substitution thereof, wherein the polypeptide has a helical structure, and it is not otherwise disclosed in the art.

As likewise discussed herein, the present invention thus provides a means for identifying or designing compounds, such as peptides or derivatized peptides (e.g., N-acylated or N-alkylated peptides, wherein carbon chains advantageously have up to 12, e.g., up to 6 carbons, and may be substituted, e.g., with one or more hetero-atoms such as N, S, or O), that bind to the antibody. Similarly, the present invention also provides a means for identifying or designing compounds that bind to the KGND binding domain in the antibody. The design of these compounds that act as an immunogen is based on the crystal structure described herein. These compounds, when administered, elicit anti-HIV antibodies. The compounds may then be used in diagnostic, pharmaceutical, immunogenic, immunological or vaccine compositions. These compositions are useful in the detection or treatment and/or prevention of HIV infections. And, antibodies elicited by such compounds also can be used in diagnostic or pharmaceutical, immunogenic, immunological or vaccine compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the invention pertains to the identification, design, synthesis and isolation of the polypeptide herein referred to as KGND, which has the sequence set forth in \nFIG. 9\n. The present invention also relates to homologues, derivatives and variants of KGND, wherein it is preferred that the homologue, derivative or variant have at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, and least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 93%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 98% or at least 99% homology or identity with the sequence of KGND. It is noted that within this specification, homology to KGND refers to the homology of the homologue, derivative or variant to the binding site of KGND. In this respect, when determining the percent homology of a compound that consisted essentially of a non-peptidic backbone containing side chains that were homologues, derivatives or variants of KGND, only the composition of the side chain would be used in determining the percent homology; the percent homology is determined solely for the portion of the compound which contains the equivalent of KGND's binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet further still, the invention relates to the conformational structure of KGND, as described herein. Furthermore, it is assumed that any homologues, derivatives and variants of KGND would encompass the conformational structure of KGND as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention still further relates to nucleic acid sequences expressing KGND, or homologues, variants or derivatives thereof. One of skill in the art will know, recognize and understand techniques used to create such. Additionally, one of skill in the art will be able to incorporate such a nucleic acid sequence into an appropriate vector, allowing for production of the amino acid sequence of KGND or a homologue, variant or derivative thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere used herein and unless specifically indicated otherwise, the following terms are intended to have the following meanings in addition to any broader (or narrower) meanings the terms might enjoy in the art:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “isolated” is used herein to indicate that the isolated moiety (e.g. peptide or compound) exists in a physical milieu distinct from that in which it occurs in nature. For example, the isolated peptide may be substantially isolated with respect to the complex cellular milieu in which it naturally occurs. The absolute level of purity is not critical, and those skilled in the art can readily determine appropriate levels of purity according to the use to which the peptide is to be put. The term “isolating” when used a step in a process is to be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn many circumstances, the isolated moiety will form part of a composition (for example a more or less crude extract containing many other molecules and substances), buffer system, matrix or excipient, which may for example contain other components (including proteins, such as albumin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other circumstances, the isolated moiety may be purified to essential homogeneity, for example as determined by PAGE or column chromatography (for example HPLC or mass spectrometry). In preferred embodiments, the isolated peptide or nucleic acid of the invention is essentially the sole peptide or nucleic acid in a given composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proteins and compounds of the invention need not be isolated in the sense defined above, however.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutical composition” is used herein to define a solid or liquid composition in a form, concentration and level of purity suitable for administration to a patient (e.g. a human patient) upon which administration it can elicit the desired physiological changes. The terms “immunogenic composition” and “immunological composition” and “immunogenic or immunological composition” cover any composition that elicits an immune response against the targeted pathogen, HIV. Terms such as “vaccinal composition” and “vaccine” and “vaccine composition” cover any composition that induces a protective immune response against the targeted pathogen or which efficaciously protects against the pathogen; for instance, after administration or injection, elicits a protective immune response against the targeted pathogen or provides efficacious protection against the pathogen. Accordingly, an immunogenic or immunological composition induces an immune response which can, but need not, be a protective immune response. An immunogenic or immunological composition can be used in the treatment of individuals infected with the pathogen, e.g., to stimulate an immune response against the pathogen, such as by stimulating antibodies against the pathogen. Thus, an immunogenic or immunological composition can be a pharmaceutical composition. Furthermore, when the text speaks of “immunogen, antigen or epitope”, an immunogen can be an antigen or an epitope of an antigen. A diagnostic composition is a composition containing a compound or antibody, e.g., a labeled compound or antibody, that is used for detecting the presence in a sample, such as a biological sample, e.g., blood, semen, vaginal fluid, etc, of an antibody that binds to the compound or an immunogen, antigen or epitope that binds to the antibody; for instance, an anti-HIV antibody or an HIV immunogen, antigen or epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “binding site” can be a site (such as an atom, a functional group of an amino acid residue or a plurality of such atoms and/or groups) in a binding cavity or region, which may bind to a compound such as a candidate immunogen, antigen or epitope, protein, peptide, derivatized protein or peptide, or compound. An “active site” can be a site (such as an atom, a functional group of an amino acid residue or a plurality of such atoms and/or groups) in a binding cavity or region, which is/are involved in binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “fitting”, is meant determining by automatic, or semi-automatic means, interactions between one or more atoms of a candidate molecule and at least one atom of a structure of the invention, and calculating the extent to which such interactions are stable. Interactions include attraction and repulsion, brought about by charge, steric considerations and the like. Various computer-based methods for fitting are described further herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “helix” or “helical”, is meant a helix as known in the art, including, but not limited to an alpha-helix. Additionally, the term helix or helical may also be used to indicate a c-terminal helical element with an N-terminal turn.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “root mean square (or rms) deviation”, we mean the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviations from the mean.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy a “computer system”, we mean the hardware means, software means and data storage means used to analyse atomic coordinate data. The minimum hardware means of the computer-based systems of the present invention typically comprises a central processing unit (CPU), input means, output means and data storage means. Desirably a monitor is provided to visualize structure data. The data storage means may be RAM or means for accessing computer readable media of the invention. Examples of such systems are microcomputer workstations available from Silicon Graphics Incorporated and Sun Microsystems running Unix based, Windows NT or IBM OS/2 operating systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “computer readable media”, we mean any medium or media, which can be read and accessed directly by a computer e.g. so that the media is suitable for use in the above-mentioned computer system. Such media include, but are not limited to: magnetic storage media such as floppy discs, hard disc storage medium and magnetic tape; optical storage media such as optical discs or CD-ROM; electrical storage media such as RAM and ROM; and hybrids of these categories such as magnetic/optical storage media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “conservative amino acid change” is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g. lysine, arginine and histidine), acidic side chains (e.g. aspartic acid and glutamic acid), non-charged amino acids or polar side chains (e.g. glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine and cysteine), non-polar side chains (e.g. alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine and tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g. threonine, valine and isoleucine), and aromatic side chains (e.g. tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and histidine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConservative substitutions may be made to relevant amino acid sequences of interest in accordance with the following chart:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nALIPHATIC\n\n\nNon-polar\n\n\nG A P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nI L V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPolar - uncharged\n\n\nC S T M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nN Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPolar - charged\n\n\nD E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAROMATIC\n\n\n \n\n\nH F W Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, references herein to proteins and peptides that are to some defined extent “identical” (or which share a defined extent of “identity”) with a reference protein or peptide may also optionally be interpreted to include proteins and peptides in which conservative amino acid changes are disregarded so that the original amino acid and its changed counterpart are regarded as identical for the purposes of sequence comparisons. Accordingly, the invention can comprehend proteins or peptides and the use thereof having conservative amino acid changes as to KGND, so long as the three dimensional structure, as defined herein, is maintained, e.g., so that there is binding/complexing with Fab 4E10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purposes of the present invention, sequence identity or homology is determined by comparing the amino acid sequences of the proteins when aligned so as to maximize overlap and identity while minimizing sequence gaps. In particular, sequence identity may be determined using any of a number of mathematical algorithms. A nonlimiting example of a mathematical algorithm used for comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 2264-2268, modified as in Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 5873-5877.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of a mathematical algorithm used for comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller (1988) CABIOS 4: 11-17. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used. Yet another useful algorithm for identifying regions of local sequence similarity and alignment is the FASTA algorithm as described in Pearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 2444-2448.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred for use according to the present invention is the WU-BLAST (Washington University BLAST) version 2.0 software. WU-BLAST version 2.0 executable programs for several UNIX platforms can be obtained from Washington University. This program is based on WU-BLAST version 1.4, which in turn is based on the public domain NCBI-BLAST version 1.4 (Altschul and Gish, 1996; Altschul et al., 1990; Gish and States, 1993; Karlin and Altschul, 1993; all of which are incorporated by reference herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn all search programs in the suite the gapped alignment routines are integral to the database search itself. Gapping can be turned off if desired. The default penalty (Q) for a gap of length one is Q=9 for proteins and BLASTP, and Q=10 for BLASTN, but may be changed to any integer. The default per-residue penalty for extending a gap (R) is R=2 for proteins and BLASTP, and R=10 for BLASTN, but may be changed to any integer. Any combination of values for Q and R can be used in order to align sequences so as to maximize overlap and identity while minimizing sequence gaps. The default amino acid comparison matrix is BLOSUM62, but other amino acid comparison matrices such as PAM can be utilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively or additionally, the term “homology” or “identity”, for instance, with respect to a nucleotide or amino acid sequence, can indicate a quantitative measure of homology between two sequences. The percent sequence homology can be calculated as (N\nref\n−N\ndif\n)*100/N\nref\n, wherein N\ndif \nis the total number of non-identical residues in the two sequences when aligned and wherein N\nref \nis the number of residues in one of the sequences. Hence, the DNA sequence AGTCAGTC will have a sequence identity of 75% with the sequence AATCAATC(N\nref\n=8; N\ndif\n=2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively or additionally, “homology” or “identity” with respect to sequences can refer to the number of positions with identical nucleotides or amino acids divided by the number of nucleotides or amino acids in the shorter of the two sequences wherein alignment of the two sequences can be determined in accordance with the Wilbur and Lipman algorithm (Wilbur and Lipman, 1983, incorporated herein by reference), for instance, using a window size of 20 nucleotides, a word length of 4 nucleotides, and a gap penalty of 4, and computer-assisted analysis and interpretation of the sequence data including alignment can be conveniently performed using commercially available programs (e.g., Intelligenetics™ Suite, Intelligenetics Inc. CA). When RNA sequences are said to be similar, or have a degree of sequence identity or homology with DNA sequences, thymidine (T) in the DNA sequence is considered equal to uracil (U) in the RNA sequence. Thus, RNA sequences are within the scope of the invention and can be derived from DNA sequences, by thymidine (T) in the DNA sequence being considered equal to uracil (U) in RNA sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnd, without undue experimentation, the skilled artisan can consult with many other programs or references for determining percent homology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthetic KGND polypeptide described herein may be chemically synthesized in whole or part using techniques that are well-known in the art (see, e.g., Kochendoerfer, G. G., 2001). Additionally, homologs and derivatives of the polypeptide may be also be synthesized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing nucleic acid molecules that encode the polypeptide or homologs or derivatives thereof under appropriate transcriptional/translational control signals, for expression. These methods include in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques and in vivo recombination/genetic recombination. See, for example, the techniques described in Maniatis et al., 1989. The Fab 4E10 antibody is obtained as described herein and in the literature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crystals of the invention can be obtained by conventional means as are well-known in the art of protein crystallography, including batch, liquid bridge, dialysis, vapor diffusion and hanging drop methods (see, e.g., McPherson, 1982; McPherson, 1990; Webber, 1991). Generally, the crystals of the invention are grown by dissolving substantially pure Fab 4E10 and compound (e.g., polypeptide KGND in example, but other compounds may be used to test if such compounds form crystals analogous to those disclosed herein) in an aqueous buffer containing a precipitant at a concentration just below that necessary to precipitate the protein. Water is removed by controlled evaporation to produce precipitating conditions, which are maintained until crystal growth ceases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crystals of the invention, and particularly the atomic structure co-ordinates obtained therefrom, have a wide variety of uses. The crystals and structure co-ordinates are particularly useful for identifying compounds that bind to Fab 4E10 and thus are useful to elicit anti-HIV antibodies. Such compounds are useful in eliciting clade B anti-HIV antibodies, however variants may be useful in eliciting clade A, C, D or E anti-HIV antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure co-ordinates described herein can be used as phasing models in determining the crystal structures of additional synthetic or mutated Fab, 4 E10 domains, as well as the structures of co-crystals of such domains with ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe provision of the crystal structure of Fab 4E10 complexed with KGND in Table 1 and the Figures provide the skilled artisan with a detailed insight into the mechanisms of action of Fab 4E10. This insight provides a means to design compounds that bind to Fab 4E10 and thus to certain anti-HIV antibodies, and therefore compounds that elicit anti-HIV antibodies, which are useful in diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of HIV in an individual in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe provision of the crystal structure of Fab 4E10 complexed with KGND allows a novel approach for drug or compound discovery, identification, and design for compounds that bind to to Fab 4E10 and thus to anti-HIV antibodies, and therefore compounds that elicit anti-HIV antibodies, which are useful in diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of HIV in an individual in need thereof. Accordingly, the invention provides a computer-based method of rational drug or compound design or identification which comprises: providing the structure of the Fab 4E10 complex as defined by the co-ordinates or the identifying co-ordinates in Table 1 and/or in the Figures; providing a structure of a candidate compound; and fitting the structure of the candidate to the structure of Fab 4E10 of Table 1 and the Figures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative aspect, the method may use the co-ordinates of atoms of interest of Fab 4E10 which are in the vicinity of the active site or binding region in order to model the pocket in which the substrate or ligand binds. These co-ordinates may be used to define a space which is then screened “in silico” against a candidate molecule. Thus, the invention provides a computer-based method of rational drug or compound design or identification which comprises: providing the co-ordinates of at least two atoms of Table 1 (“selected co-ordinates”); providing the structure of a candidate compound; and fitting the structure of the candidate to the selected coordinates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn practice, it may be desirable to model a sufficient number of atoms of Fab 4E10 as defined by the co-ordinates of Table 1 which represent the active site or binding region. Thus, there can be provided the co-ordinates of at least 5, advantageously at least 10, more advantageously at least 50 and even more advantageously at least 100 atoms of the structure. Accordingly, the methods of the invention can employ a sub-domain of interest of Fab 4E10 which is in the vicinity of the active site or binding region, and the invention can provide a computer-based method for identifying or rationally designing a compound or drug which comprises: providing the co-ordinates of at least a sub-domain of; providing the structure of a candidate modulator or inhibitor of Fab 4E10; and fitting the structure of the candidate to the coordinates of the Fab 4E10 sub-domain provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese methods can optionally include synthesizing the candidate and can optionally further include contacting the candidate with Fab 4E10 to test whether there is binding and/or inhibition and/or administering the compound to an animal capable of eliciting antibodies and testing whether the compound elicits anti-HIV antibodies. Compounds which elicit anti-HIV antibodies are useful for diagnostic purposes, as well as for immunogenic, immunological or even vaccine compositions, as well as pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Fitting” can mean determining, by automatic or semi-automatic means, interactions between at least one atom of the candidate and at least one atom of Fab 4E10 and calculating the extent to which such an interaction is stable. Interactions can include attraction, repulsion, brought about by charge, steric considerations, and the like. A “sub-domain” can mean at least one, e.g., one, two, three, or four, complete element(s) of secondary structure. Particular regions of Fab 4E10 include those identified in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe step of providing the structure of a candidate molecule may involve selecting the compound by computationally screening a database of compounds for interaction with the active site. For example, a 3-D descriptor for the potential modulator may be derived, the descriptor including geometric and functional constraints derived from the architecture and chemical nature of the active site. The descriptor may then be used to interrogate the compound database, a potential modulator being a compound that has a good match to the features of the descriptor. In effect, the descriptor can be a type of virtual pharmacophore.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any event, the determination of the three-dimensional structure of Fab 4E10 complex provides a basis for the design of new and specific compounds that bind to Fab 4E10 and are useful for eliciting an immune response. For example, from knowing the three-dimensional structure of Fab 4E10 complex, computer modelling programs may be used to design or identify different molecules expected to interact with possible or confirmed active sites such as binding sites or other structural or functional features of Fab 4E10. More specifically, a compound that potentially binds (“binder”) to Fab 4E10 activity can be examined through the use of computer modeling using a docking program such as GRAM, DOCK or AUTODOCK (see Walters et al. Drug Discovery Today, vol. 3, no. 4 (1998), 160-178, and Dunbrack et al. Folding and Design 2 (1997), 27-42). This procedure can include computer fitting of potential binders to FAB 4E10 to ascertain how well the shape and the chemical structure of the potential binder will bind to the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, computer-assisted, manual examination of the active site or binding site of Fab 4E10 may be performed. The use of programs such as GRID (P. Goodford, J. Med. Chem., 1985, 28, 849-57)—program that determines probable interaction sites between molecules with various functional groups and the antibody—may also be used to analyze the active site or binding site to predict partial structures of binding compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComputer programs can be employed to estimate the attraction, repulsion or steric hindrance of the two binding partners, e.g., Fab 4E10 and a candidate binder. Generally, the tighter the fit, the fewer the steric hindrances, and the greater the attractive forces, the more potent the potential binder, since these properties are consistent with a tighter binding constant. Furthermore, the more specificity in the design of a candidate binder, the more likely it is that it will not interact with other proteins as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the invention provides for a method for determining the structure of a binder of Fab 4E10 bound to Fab 4E10, said method comprising, (a) providing a crystal of Fab 4E10 according to the invention, (b) soaking the crystal or another crystal with said binder; and (c) determining the structure of said Fab 4E10-binder complex. Such other crystal may have essentially the same coordinates discussed herein, however due to minor alterations in the polypeptide or sequence, the crystal may form in a different space group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further involves, in place of or in addition to in silico methods, high throughput screening of compounds to select compounds with binding activity. Those compounds which show binding activity may be selected as possible candidate binders, and further crystallized with Fab 4E10, e.g., by co-crystallization or by soaking, for X-ray analysis. The resulting X-ray structure may be compared with that of Table 1 and the information in the Figures for a variety of purposes. For example, where the contacts made by such compounds overlap with those made by Fab 4E10, novel molecules comprising residues which contain contacts of Fab 4E10 and other compounds may be provided. Compounds of the present invention may comprise or consist essentially of polypeptides having a sequence consisting essentially of DKWX\n1\nX\n2\nX\n3\nX\n4\nX\n5\nWFXIT (SEQ ID NO: 3), wherein X is N, D, S, or G, X\n1\n=A or a conservative substitution thereof, X\n2\n=N or a conservative substitution thereof, X\n3\n=L or a conservative substitution thereof, X\n4\n=W or a conservative substitution thereof, X\n5\n=N, S or T or a conservative substitution thereof, wherein the polypeptide has a helical structure, and it is not otherwise disclosed in he art.

In one embodiment, these polypeptides may include Aib inserted between any two amino acids of WFXIT. In another embodiment, the polypeptides may be branched, including wherein WFXIT is branched. It is an aspect of the present invention that any branched chains may be sufficiently short in length, or circular or helical in structure such that the peptide is able to bind to Fab 4E10. In yet another aspect of the invention, the polypeptide comprises or consists essentially of a peptide as shown in Table 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another aspect, the invention also encompasses a polypeptide having a sequence consisting essentially of DKWX\n1\nX\n2\nX\n3\nX\n4\nX\n5\nWFXITXX\n6\nXW (SEQ ID NO: 4), wherein X=N, D, S, G, Q, C, T, M, E, K, R, A, P, I, L, V, O, Aib, or other natural or synthetic amino acids, including conservative substitutions thereof, X\n1\n=A, G, P, I, L, V, Aib, or other natural or synthetic amino acids, or a conservative substitution thereof; X\n2\n=N, Q, C, S, T, M, or other natural or synthetic amino acids, or a conservative substitution thereof; X\n3\n=L, I, V, G, A, P, or other natural or synthetic amino acids, or a conservative substitution thereof, X\n4\n=W, H, F, Y, K, C, Aib, or other natural or synthetic amino acids, or a conservative substitution thereof, X\n5\n=N, S, T, Q, C, M, E, A, or other natural or synthetic amino acids, or a conservative substitution thereof, X\n6\n=any natural or synthetic amino acids; and wherein the polypeptide has a helical structure.

In one embodiment, Aib may be inserted between any two amino acids of WFX\n1\nIT (SEQ ID NO: 79). Alternatively or additionally, WFX\n1 \nIT (SEQ ID NO: 79) can be branched. The branched chain can be of sufficient length and/or configuration that the polypeptide binds to Fab 4E10. In another embodiment, the polypeptide comprises or consists essentially of: NWFCITOWLWKKKK-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 7); NWFDITNWLWYIKKKK-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 8); NWFDITNWLWK-Aib-K-Aib-K-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 9); KK-Aib-NWFDITNWLWK-Aib-K-Aib-K-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 10); NWFDITYNWLWYIK-Aib-K-Aib-KK-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 11); or NWFCITOWLWKKKK-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 12).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention additionally encompasses a polypeptide having a sequence consisting essentially of: NWFX\n1\nITX\n2\nWLWX (SEQ ID NO: 13), wherein X comprises 0-8 amino acids consisting essentially of K, Aib, Y, I, or other natural or synthetic amino acids, including conservative substitutions thereof; wherein X\nI\n=D, C, or other natural or synthetic amino acids or a conservative substitution thereof; wherein X\n2\n=0, N, or other natural or synthetic amino acids or a conservative substitution thereof; wherein the polypeptide has a helical structure, and is not otherwise disclosed in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHaving designed, identified, or selected possible binding candidate binders by determining those which have favorable fitting properties, e.g., strong attraction between a candidate and Fab 4E10, these can then be screened for activity. Consequently, the invention further involves: obtaining or synthesizing the candidate modulator or inhibitor; and contacting the candidate binder with Fab 4E10 to determine the ability of the candidate to bind with Fab 4E10. In the latter step, the candidate is advantageously contacted with Fab 4E10 under conditions to determine its function. Instead of, or in addition to, performing such an assay, the invention may comprise: obtaining or synthesizing the candidate modulator, forming a complex of Fab 4E10 and the candidate, and analyzing the complex, e.g., by X-ray diffraction or NMR or other means, to determine the ability of the candidate to interact with Fab 4E10. Detailed structural information can then be obtained about the binding of the candidate to Fab 4E10, and in light of this information, adjustments can be made to the structure or functionality of the potential modulator, e.g., to improve its binding to Fab 4E10. These steps may be repeated and re-repeated as necessary. Alternatively or additionally, potential binders can be administered to an animal capable of eliciting an antibody response, to ascertain whether the potential binder elicits anti-HIV antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further involves a method of determining three dimensional structures of Fab 4E10 and KGND homologues of unknown structure by using the structural co-ordinates of Table 1 and the information in the Figures. For example, if X-ray crystallographic or NMR spectroscopic data are provided for a Fab 4E10 and/or KGND homologue of unknown structure, the structure of Fab 4E10 complex as defined in Table 1 and the Figures may be used to interpret that data to provide a likely structure for the Fab 4E10 and/or KGND homologue by techniques well known in the art, e.g., by phase modeling in the case of X-ray crystallography. Thus, an inventive method can comprise: aligning a representation of an amino acid sequence of a Fab 4E10 and/or KGND homologue of unknown structure with the amino acid sequence of Fab 4E10 and/or KGND to match homologous regions of the amino acid sequences; modeling the structure of the matched homologous regions of the Fab 4E10 and/or KGND of unknown structure on the structure as defined in Table 1 and/or in the Figures of the corresponding regions of Fab 4E10 and/or KGND; and, determining a conformation (e.g. so that favorable interactions are formed within the Fab 4E10 and/or KGND of unknown structure and/or so that a low energy conformation is formed) for the Fab 4E10 and/or KGND of unknown structure which substantially preserves the structure of said matched homologous regions. “Homologous regions” describes amino acid residues in two sequences that are identical or have similar, e.g., aliphatic, aromatic, polar, negatively charged, or positively charged, side-chain chemical groups. Identical and similar residues in homologous regions are sometimes described as being respectively “invariant” and “conserved” by those skilled in the art. Advantageously, the first and third steps are performed by computer modeling. Homology modeling is a technique that is well known to those skilled in the art (see, e.g., Greer, 1985; and Blundell et al. 1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, comparison of amino acid sequences is accomplished by aligning an amino acid sequence of a polypeptide of a known structure with the amino acid sequence of a the polypeptide of unknown structure. Amino acids in the sequences are then compared and groups of amino acids that are homologous are grouped together. This method detects conserved regions of the polypeptides and accounts for amino acid insertions and deletions. Homology between amino acid sequences can be determined by using commercially available algorithms (see also the description of homology above). In addition to those otherwise mentioned herein, mention is made too of the programs BLAST, gapped BLAST, BLASTN, BLASTP, and PSI-BLAST, provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. These programs are widely used in the art for this purpose and can align homologous regions of two amino acid sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the amino acid sequence of the polypeptides with known and unknown structures are aligned, the structures of the conserved amino acids in a computer representation of the polypeptide with known structure are transferred to the corresponding amino acids of the polypeptide whose structure is unknown. For example, a tyrosine in the amino acid sequence of known structure may be replaced by a phenylalanine, the corresponding homologous amino acid in the amino acid sequence of unknown structure. The structures of amino acids located in non-conserved regions may be assigned manually using standard peptide geometries or by molecular simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics. Refining the entire structure can be by molecular dynamics and/or energy minimization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aspects of the invention which employ the Fab 4E10 and/or KGND structure in silico may be equally applied to homologue models of Fab 4E10 and/or KGND obtained by the above aspect of the invention and this forms yet a further embodiment of the invention. Thus, having determined a conformation of a Fab 4E10 and/or KGND by the methods described herein, such a conformation may be used in a computer-based method of rational drug or compound design or identification as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a method for determining the structure of a binder of Fab 4E10 bound to Fab 4E10 comprising: providing a crystal of Fab 4E10, e.g., according to the invention, soaking the crystal with the binder, and determining the structure of the FAB 4E10-binder complex. Alternatively or additionally the FAB 4E10 and the binder may be cocrystallized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides systems, such as computer systems, intended to generate structures and/or perform rational drug or compound design for a Fab 4E10 or complex of Fab 4E10 and a potential binder. The system can contain: atomic co-ordinate data according to Table 1 and the Figures or derived therefrom by homology modeling, said data defining the three-dimensional structure of a Fab 4E10 or at least one sub-domain thereof; or structure factor data for Fab 4E10, said structure factor data being derivable from the atomic co-ordinate data of Table 1 and the Figures. The invention also involves computer readable media with: atomic coordinate data according to Table 1 and/or the Figures or derived therefrom by homology modeling, said data defining the three-dimensional structure of a Fab 4E10 or at least one sub-domain thereof; or structure factor data for Fab 4E10, said structure factor data being derivable from the atomic co-ordinate data of Table 1 and/or the Figures. “Computer readable media” refers to any media which can be read and accessed directly by a computer, and includes, but is not limited to: magnetic storage media such as floppy discs, hard storage medium and magnetic tape; optical storage media such as optical discs or CD-ROM; electrical storage media such as RAM and ROM; and hybrids of these categories, such as magnetic/optical media. By providing such computer readable media, the atomic co-ordinate data can be routinely accessed to model Fab 4E10 or a sub-domain thereof. For example RASMOL (Sayle et al., TIBS vol. 20 (1995), 374) is a publicly available software package which allows access and analysis of atomic coordinate data for structural determination and/or rational drug design. The invention further comprehends methods of doing business by providing access to such computer readable media and/or computer systems and/or atomic co-ordinate data to users; e.g., the media and/or atomic co-ordinate data can be accessible to a user, for instance on a subscription basis, via the Internet or a global communication/computer network; or, the computer system can be available to a user, on a subscription basis. Structure factor data, which are derivable from atomic co-ordinate data (see, e.g., Blundell et al., in Protein Crystallography, Academic Press, NY, London and San Francisco (1976)), are particularly useful for calculating electron density maps, e.g., difference Fourier electron density maps. Thus, there are additional uses for the computer readable media and/or computer systems and/or atomic co-ordinate data and additional reasons to provide them to users. A “computer system” refers to the hardware means, software means and data storage means used to analyze the atomic co-ordinate data of the present invention. The minimum hardware means of computer-based systems of the invention may comprise a central processing unit (CPU), input means, output means, and data storage means. Desirably, a monitor is provided to visualize structure data. The data storage means may be RAM or other means for accessing computer readable media of the invention. Examples of such systems are microcomputer workstations available from Silicon Graphics Incorporated and Sun Microsystems running Unix based, Linux, Windows NT or IBM OS/2 operating systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the invention further comprehends methods of transmitting information obtained in any method or step thereof described herein or any information described herein, e.g., via telecommunications, telephone, mass communications, mass media, presentations, interne, email, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method of analyzing a complex of Fab 4E10 and a potential binder comprising: employing X-ray crystallographic diffraction data from the complex and a three-dimensional structure of Fab 4E10 or at least a sub-domain thereof, to generate a different Fourier electron density map of the complex; advantageously, the three-dimensional structure being as defined by the atomic co-ordinate data according to Table 1 and/or the Figures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch complexes can be crystallized and analyzed using X-ray diffraction methods, e.g., according to the approaches described by Greer et al., 1994, and difference Fourier electron density maps can be calculated based on X-ray diffraction patterns of soaked or co-crystallized Fab 4E10 and the solved structure of uncomplexed Fab 4E10. These maps can then be used to determine whether and where a particular potential binder binds to Fab 4E10 and/or changes the conformation of Fab 4E10. Electron density maps can be calculated using programs such as those from the CCP4 computer package (Collaborative Computing Project, No. 4. The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography, Acta Crystallographica, D50, 1994, 760-763). For map visualization and model building programs such as “QUANTA” (1994, San Diego, Calif.: Molecular Simulations, Jones et al., 1991) can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 1 gives atomic co-ordinate data for Fab 4E10 complexed with KGND, and lists each atom by a unique number; the chemical element and its position for each amino acid residue (as determined by electron density maps and antibody sequence comparisons), the amino acid residue in which the element is located, the chain identifier, the number of the residue, coordinates (e.g., X, Y, Z) which define with respect to the crystallographic axes the atomic position (in Å) of the respective atom, the occupancy of the atom in the respective position, “B”, isotropic displacement parameter (in Å\n2\n) which accounts for movement of the atom around its atomic center, and atomic number. See also the text herein and the Figures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of the 3D structure of Fab 4E10 provides important information about the likely active/binding site(s) of Fab 4E10. This information may be used for rational design of Fab 4E10 binders, e.g., by computational techniques that identify possible binding ligands for the active site(s), by enabling linked-fragment approaches to drug design, and by enabling the identification and location of bound ligands using analyses such as X-ray crystallographic analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGreer et al., supra, relates to an iterative approach to ligand design based on repeated sequences of computer modeling, protein-ligand complex formation, and X-ray analysis. Thymidylate synthase inhibitors were designed by Greer; and, Fab 4E10 binders may also be designed in this way. Using, for example, GRID (P. Goodford, 1985) or the solved 3D structure of Fab 4E10, a potential binder of Fab 4E10 may be designed that complements the functionalities of the FAB 4E10 active site(s). The potential binder can be synthesized, formed into a complex with Fab 4E10, and the complex then analyzed, e.g., by X-ray crystallography, NMR or a combination thereof, to identify the actual position of the bound compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of the position of the potential binder compound in the complex allows determination of the interactions of it with Fab 4E10. This allows the skilled artisan to analyze the affinity and specificity of the compound for Fab 4E10, and to propose modifications to the compound to increase or decrease either or both of these properties. Thus, the structure and/or functional groups of the compound can then be adjusted, if necessary or desired, in view of the results from the analysis (e.g., X-ray analysis), and the synthesis and analysis sequence repeated until an optimized compound is obtained. Related approaches to structure-based drug and compound design are also discussed in other documents cited herein, as well as in Bohacek et al., 1996.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result of the determination of the Fab 4E10 3D structure, more purely computational techniques for rational drug and compound design may also be used to design Fab 4E10 binders and hence compounds that elicit anti-HIV antibodies; for example, automated ligand-receptor docking programs (see Jones et al., 1995) which require accurate information on the atomic coordinates of target receptors, may be used to design or identify potential Fab 4E10 binders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLinked-fragment approaches to drug or compound design also require accurate information on the atomic co-ordinates of a target. Small compounds that have the potential to bind to regions of Fab 4E10 which in themselves may not be binder compounds may be assembled by chemical linkage to provide potential binders. Thus, the basic idea behind these approaches is to determine the binding locations of more than one, e.g., plural or a plurality of, ligands to a target molecule, and then construct a molecular scaffold to connect the ligands together in such a way that their relative binding positions are preserved. The ligands may be provided computationally and modeled in a computer system, or provided in an experimental setting, wherein crystals according to the invention are provided and more than one, e.g., plural or a plurality of, ligands soaked separately or in mixed pools into the crystal prior to analysis, e.g., X-ray analysis, and determination of their location.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding site of two or more ligands are determined and may be connected to thus form a potential lead compound that can be further refined, e.g., the iterative technique of Greer et al. For a virtual linked-fragment approach, see Verlinde et al., 1992; and for NMR and X-ray approaches, see Skuker et al., 1996; and Stout et al., 1998. The use of these or other approaches to design and/or identify Fab 4E10 binders and hence compounds that elicit anti-HIV antibodies (see, e.g., patent documents cited herein such as in the Background Section and documents cited therein, supra) is made possible by the determination of the Fab 4E10 structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany of the techniques and approaches to structure-based described herein employ X-ray analysis to identify the binding position of a potential modulator in a complex with a protein. A common way of doing this is to perform X-ray crystallography on the complex, produce a difference Fourier electron density map, and associate a particular pattern of electron density with the potential modulator. However, to produce a map (See Blundell et al., supra), it is important to know the 3D structure of the protein beforehand (or at least the protein structure factors). Therefore, determination of the Fab 4E10 structure also allows difference Fourier electron density maps of complexes of Fab 4E10 with a potential modulator to be produced, which can greatly assist in the process of rational compound and/or drug design or identification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe approaches to structure-based drug or compound design or identification described herein involve initial identification of possible compounds for interaction with the target molecule (in this case Fab 4E10), and thus elicit anti-HIV antibodies. Sometimes these compounds are known, e.g., from research literature. However, when they are not, or when novel compounds are wanted, a first stage of the drug or compound design or identification program may involve computer-based in silico screening of compound databases (such as the Cambridge Structural Database) with the aim of identifying compounds which interact with the active site or sites of the target bio-molecule (in this case Fab 4E10). Screening selection criteria may be based on pharmacokinetic properties such as metabolic stability and toxicity. However, determination of the Fab 4E10 structure allows the architecture and chemical nature of each Fab 4E10 active site to be identified, which in turn allows the geometric and functional constraints of a descriptor for the potential binder to be derived. The descriptor can be, therefore, a type of virtual 3D pharmacophore, which can also be used as selection criteria or filter for database screening.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds which have a chemical structure selected using the invention, wherein said compounds are Fab 4E10 binders, form a further aspect of the invention; and, such compounds may be used in methods of medical treatments, such as for diagnosis, preventing or treating HIV or for eliciting antibodies for diagnosis of HIV, including use in vaccines. Further, such compounds may be used in the preparation of medicaments for such treatments or prevention, or compositions for diagnostic purposes. The compounds may be employed alone or in combination with other treatments, vaccines or preventatives; and, the compounds may be used in the preparation of combination medicaments for such treatments or prevention, or in kits containing the compound and the other treatment or preventative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is noted that these therapeutics can be a chemical compound, a composition comprising a polypeptide of the present invention and/or antibody elicited by such a chemical compound and/or portion thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a composition comprising a polypeptide of the invention, and can be administered alone or as an active ingredient in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, and vehicles, as well as other active ingredients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds or compositions can be administered orally, subcutaneously or parenterally including intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraperitoneally, and intranasal administration as well as intrathecal and infusion techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is noted that humans are treated generally longer than the mice or other experimental animals which treatment has a length proportional to the length of the disease process and drug effectiveness. The doses may be single doses or multiple doses over a period of several days, but single doses are preferred. Thus, one can scale up from animal experiments, e.g., rats, mice, and the like, to humans, by techniques from this disclosure and documents cited herein and the knowledge in the art, without undue experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe treatment generally has a length proportional to the length of the disease process and drug effectiveness and the patient being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen administering a therapeutic of the present invention parenterally, it will generally be formulated in a unit dosage injectable form (solution, suspension, emulsion). The pharmaceutical formulations suitable for injection include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersing medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Nonaqueous vehicles such a cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, or peanut oil and esters, such as isopropyl myristate, may also be used as solvent systems for compound compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, various additives which enhance the stability, sterility, and isotonicity of the compositions, including antimicrobial preservatives, antioxidants, chelating agents, and buffers, can be added. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. In many cases, it will be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. According to the present invention, however, any vehicle, diluent, or additive used would have to be compatible with the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the compounds utilized in practicing the present invention in the required amount of the appropriate solvent with various amounts of the other ingredients, as desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmacological formulation of the present invention, e.g., comprising a therapeutic compound or polypeptide of the present invention, can be administered to the patient in an injectable formulation containing any compatible carrier, such as various vehicles, adjuvants, additives, and diluents; or the compounds utilized in the present invention can be administered parenterally to the patient in the form of slow-release subcutaneous implants or targeted delivery systems such as monoclonal antibodies, iontophoretic, polymer matrices, liposomes, and microspheres.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmacological formulation of the compound and composition comprising a polypeptide utilized in the present invention can be administered orally to the patient. Conventional methods such as administering the compounds in tablets, suspensions, solutions, emulsions, capsules, powders, syrups and the like are usable. Known techniques which deliver the compound orally or intravenously and retain the biological activity are preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a formulation of the present invention can be administered initially, and thereafter maintained by further administration. For instance, a formulation of the invention can be administered in one type of composition and thereafter further administered in a different or the same type of composition. For example, a formulation of the invention can be administered by intravenous injection to bring blood levels to a suitable level. The patient's levels are then maintained by an oral dosage form, although other forms of administration, dependent upon the patient's condition, can be used. In the instance of a vaccine composition, the vaccine may be administered as a single dose, or the vaccine may incorporate set booster doses. For example, booster doses may comprises variants in order to provide protection against multiple clades of HIV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe quantity to be administered will vary for the patient being treated and whether the administration is for treatment or prevention and will vary from a few micrograms to a few milligrams for an average 70 kg patient, e.g., 5 micrograms to 5 milligrams such as 500 micrograms, or about 100 ng/kg of body weight to 100 mg/kg of body weight per administration and preferably will be from 10 pg/kg to 10 mg/kg per administration. Typically, however, the antigen is present in an amount on, the order of micrograms to milligrams, or, about 0.001 to about 20 wt %, preferably about 0.01 to about 10 wt %, and most preferably about 0.05 to about 5 wt %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf course, for any composition to be administered to an animal or human, including the components thereof, and for any particular method of administration, it is preferred to determine therefor: toxicity, such as by determining the lethal dose (LD) and LD\n50 \nin a suitable animal model e.g., rodent such as mouse; and, the dosage of the composition(s), concentration of components therein and timing of administering the composition(s), which elicit a suitable immunological response, such as by titrations of sera and analysis thereof for antibodies or antigens, e.g., by ELISA and/or RFFIT analysis. Such determinations do not require undue experimentation from the knowledge of the skilled artisan, this disclosure and the documents cited herein. And, the time for sequential administrations can be ascertained without undue experimentation. For instance, dosages can be readily ascertained by those skilled in the art from this disclosure and the knowledge in the art. Thus, the skilled artisan can readily determine the amount of compound and optional additives, vehicles, and/or carrier in compositions and to be administered in methods of the invention. Typically, an adjuvant or additive is commonly used as 0.001 to 50 wt % solution in phosphate buffered saline, and the active ingredient is present in the order of micrograms to milligrams, such as about 0.0001 to about 5 wt %, preferably about 0.0001 to about 1 wt %, most preferably about 0.0001 to about 0.05 wt % or about 0.001 to about 20 wt %, preferably about 0.01 to about 10 wt %, and most preferably about 0.05 to about 5 wt %. Such determinations do not require undue experimentation from the knowledge of the skilled artisan, this disclosure and the documents cited herein. And, the time for sequential administrations can be ascertained without undue experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of compositions comprising a therapeutic of the invention include liquid preparations for orifice, e.g., oral, nasal, anal, vaginal, peroral, intragastric, mucosal (e.g., perlingual, alveolar, gingival, olfactory or respiratory mucosa) etc., administration such as suspensions, syrups or elixirs; and, preparations for parenteral, subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular or intravenous administration (e.g., injectable administration), such as sterile suspensions or emulsions. Such compositions may be in admixture with a suitable carrier, diluent, or excipient such as sterile water, physiological saline, glucose or the like. The compositions can also be lyophilized. The compositions can contain auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, gelling or viscosity enhancing additives, preservatives, flavoring agents, colors, and the like, depending upon the route of administration and the preparation desired. Standard texts, such as “REMINGTON′S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE”, 17th edition, 1985, incorporated herein by reference, may be consulted to prepare suitable preparations, without undue experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the invention, are conveniently provided as liquid preparations, e.g., isotonic aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions or viscous compositions which may be buffered to a selected pH. If digestive tract absorption is preferred, compositions of the invention can be in the “solid” form of pills, tablets, capsules, caplets and the like, including “solid” preparations which are time-released or which have a liquid filling, e.g., gelatin covered liquid, whereby the gelatin is dissolved in the stomach for delivery to the gut. If nasal or respiratory (mucosal) administration is desired, compositions may be in a form and dispensed by a squeeze spray dispenser, pump dispenser or aerosol dispenser. Aerosols are usually under pressure by means of a hydrocarbon. Pump dispensers can preferably dispense a metered dose or, a dose having a particular particle size.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the invention can contain pharmaceutically acceptable flavors and/or colors for rendering them more appealing, especially if they are administered orally. The viscous compositions may be in the form of gels, lotions, ointments, creams and the like (e.g., for transdermal administration) and will typically contain a sufficient amount of a thickening agent so that the viscosity is from about 2500 to 6500 cps, although more viscous compositions, even up to 10,000 cps may be employed. Viscous compositions have a viscosity preferably of 2500 to 5000 cps, since above that range they become more difficult to administer. However, above that range, the compositions can approach solid or gelatin forms which are then easily administered as a swallowed pill for oral ingestion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid preparations are normally easier to prepare than gels, other viscous compositions, and solid compositions. Additionally, liquid compositions are somewhat more convenient to administer, especially by injection or orally. Viscous compositions, on the other hand, can be formulated within the appropriate viscosity range to provide longer contact periods with mucosa, such as the lining of the stomach or nasal mucosa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObviously, the choice of suitable carriers and other additives will depend on the exact route of administration and the nature of the particular dosage form, e.g., liquid dosage form (e.g., whether the composition is to be formulated into a solution, a suspension, gel or another liquid form), or solid dosage form (e.g., whether the composition is to be formulated into a pill, tablet, capsule, caplet, time release form or liquid-filled form).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolutions, suspensions and gels, normally contain a major amount of water (preferably purified water) in addition to the active compound. Minor amounts of other ingredients such as pH adjusters (e.g., a base such as NaOH), emulsifiers or dispersing agents, buffering agents, preservatives, wetting agents, jelling agents, (e.g., methylcellulose), colors and/or flavors may also be present. The compositions can be isotonic, i.e., it can have the same osmotic pressure as blood and lacrimal fluid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe desired isotonicity of the compositions of this invention may be accomplished using sodium chloride, or other pharmaceutically acceptable agents such as dextrose, boric acid, sodium tartrate, propylene glycol or other inorganic or organic solutes. Sodium chloride is preferred particularly for buffers containing sodium ions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nViscosity of the compositions may be maintained at the selected level using a pharmaceutically acceptable thickening agent. Methylcellulose is preferred because it is readily and economically available and is easy to work with. Other suitable thickening agents include, for example, xanthan gum, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carbomer, and the like. The preferred concentration of the thickener will depend upon the agent selected. The important point is to use an amount which will achieve the selected viscosity. Viscous compositions are normally prepared from solutions by the addition of such thickening agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutically acceptable preservative can be employed to increase the shelf-life of the compositions. Benzyl alcohol may be suitable, although a variety of preservatives including, for example, parabens, thimerosal, chlorobutanol, or benzalkonium chloride may also be employed. A suitable concentration of the preservative will be from 0.02% to 2% based on the total weight although there may be appreciable variation depending upon the agent selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art will recognize that the components of the compositions should be selected to be chemically inert with respect to the active compound. This will present no problem to those skilled in chemical and pharmaceutical principles, or problems can be readily avoided by reference to standard texts or by simple experiments (not involving undue experimentation), from this disclosure and the documents cited herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is generally envisaged that compounds and compositions of the invention will be administered by injection, as such compounds are to elicit anti-HIV antibodies, and the skilled artisan can, from this disclosure and the knowledge in the art, formulate compounds and compositions identified by herein methods for administration by injection and administer such compounds and compositions by injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventive compositions of this invention are prepared by mixing the ingredients following generally accepted procedures. For example the selected components may be simply mixed in a blender, or other standard device to produce a concentrated mixture which may then be adjusted to the final concentration and viscosity by the addition of water or thickening agent and possibly a buffer to control pH or an additional solute to control tonicity. Generally the pH may be from about 3 to 7.5. Compositions can be administered in dosages and by techniques well known to those skilled in the medical arts taking into consideration such factors as the age, sex, weight, and condition of the particular patient, and the composition form used for administration (e.g., solid vs. liquid). Dosages for humans or other mammals can be determined without undue experimentation by the skilled artisan, from this disclosure, the documents cited herein, and the knowledge in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable regimes for initial administration and further doses or for sequential administrations also are variable, may include an initial administration followed by subsequent administrations; but nonetheless, may be ascertained by the skilled artisan, from this disclosure, the documents cited herein, and the knowledge in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the invention comprehends; in further aspects, methods for preparing therapeutic or preventive compositions including an active agent, ingredient or compound or Fab 4E10 binder as from inventive methods herein for ascertaining compounds that bind to, as well as to methods for inhibiting HIV or eliciting antibodies against HIV by administering a compound or compounds that bind to Fab 4E10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, as discussed herein, compounds which bind to Fab 4E10 are useful in generating antibodies, which are themselves useful in assays as well as in therapeutics as well as diagnostics; and, the compounds which bind to Fab 4E10 are useful for detecting anti-HIV antibodies in a sample. From documents cited herein, one can readily make and use such antibodies, and methods for producing monoclonal antibodies are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,196,265 and 6,221,645. Thus, the compounds that bind to Fab 4E10 can be used to generate antibodies and the antibodies can be used, without undue experimentation, e.g., to detect HIV immunogens, antigens or epitopes in a sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is further described by the following non-limiting example(s), given by way of illustration.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nCrystallization of Fab 4E10 Complex\n\n\n \n \n \nFab 4E10 was obtained from Polymun, Herman Katinger, and is otherwise available as described in documents cited/incorporated by reference herein. Briefly, Fab 4E10 was obtained by antibody producing hybridomas that were generated by a combined polyethylene glycol/electrofusion method. PBMC from 10 asymptomatic HIV-1 positive donors were fused with the mouse-human heteromyeloma cell line CB-F7. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for HIV-specific antibody production and positive clones were further analyzed by ELISA, Western blot, and immunofluorescence assays. In order to enable safe mass production and to change the isotype of 2175-and 4E10 from IgG3 to IgG1 the antibodies were expressed recombinantly in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO) as IgG1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “4E10-IgG3” exclusively refers to the known IgG3 variant and the term “4E10-IgG1” to the IgG1 variant of 4E10. Mab 4E10IgG3 is produced by a hybridoma cell line deposited at ECACC under Accession Nr. 90091703, while 4E10-IgG1 is expressed by a CHO cell line (deposited under the Budapest Treaty at ECACC Acc.Nr. 01 1 10665). Both variants recognize the same epitope on gp41 of HIV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe minimum binding epitope (core epitope) of 4E10 is entirely present on peptide 2031 and is located subsequent to the ELDKWAS (SEQ ID NO: 82) epitope of 2F5 and within the aa sequence LWNWFDITNWL (SEQ ID NO: 83) (a.a. positions 670-680 of gp41; numbering according to TCLA isolate HTLV-III MN). More detailed mapping using smaller peptides revealed a core epitope of 5 amino acids comprising the aa sequence WFXIT (SEQ ID NO: 78) (a.a. 673-677 of gp41 of HTLV-III MN). The X may preferably be D, N, S, or T, although other amino acids are possible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFab 4E10 was contacted with KGND, which was synthesized using standard protein synthesis techniques. Crystals were grown by the vapor diffusion method under the following conditions: 10% PEG (polyethylene glycol), 0.1 M \n \nsodium citrate pH\n \n 5, and 10 mM hexaminecobalt trichloride. The formed crystals are as described herein and in the Figures, with atomic coordinates as set forth in Table 1, determined by X-ray diffraction using a Synchrotron Radiation source and otherwise standard XRD methods (see, e.g., documents cited/incorporated by reference herein). The Figures identify relevant regions of KGND and Fab 4E10, and provide comparisons thereof, all of which may be employed by the skilled artisan in the practice of embodiments of the invention.\n\n\n

Preparation, Crystallization and Data Collection\n\n\n \n \n \nRecombinant IgG1(κ) 4E10 was overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells as previously described (Buchacher et al., 1994; Kunert et al., 2000). Antigen-binding fragment Fab 4E10 was obtained by papain digestion of IgG1 4E10. Mercuripapain (Sigma; enzyme at 0.5 mg/ml) was pre-activated with 10 mM cysteine and 1.25 mM EDTA in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.5 for 15 minutes at 37° C. Activated papain solution was then added to IgG1 4E10 (at 5 mg/ml in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.5) to give a final w/w ratio of 4% papain, and the reaction was incubated at 37° C. for 4 hours. Iodoacetamide at a concentration of 20 mM was added and followed by further incubation at 37° C. for 1 hour to stop the digestion reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFab 4E10 was purified to >95% homogeneity using sequential affinity, size exclusion, and ionic exchange chromatography. Initially, digested sample was diluted 1:3 with 3.0 M NaCl in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 9.0 and loaded onto a recombinant protein A column (Repligen). The non-bound material was diluted 1:3 with 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA and loaded onto a recombinant protein G Gammabind Plus column (Amersham Pharmacia). The Fab was eluted using 0.1 M acetic acid, pH 3.0, and immediately neutralized with 1/10 volume of 1.0 M NaHCO\n3\n. The eluted fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 0.2 M sodium acetate pH 5.5, and loaded on a Superdex 75 HR16-60 column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated in 0.2 M sodium acetate pH 5.5. The gel filtrated pooled fractions were further purified by cation exchange chromatography on a MonoS HR5-5 column (Amersham Pharmacia) with 20 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5 and a 0 to 1.0 M NaCl gradient. Pure Fab 4E10 was dialyzed against 20 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5, and concentrated to 12 mg/ml using a Millipore Ultrafree-15 centrifuge concentrator (10 kDa as molecular weight cut-off).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide was synthesized as previously described (Zwick et al., 2001a) and diluted in water to a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Crystals of Fab 4E10 in complex with the peptide were obtained by co-crystallization after overnight preincubation at 4° C. of peptide and Fab 4E10 in a molar ratio of 1:5 (protein:peptide). Crystallization conditions for the complex were initially screened in a nanodrop format (total of 100 nl per drop) using a crystallization robot (Syrrx). Promising crystallization conditions were identified and optimized manually. The best crystals of the complex were grown at 22° C. by sitting drop vapor diffusion against 10-12% (w/v) PEG 8,000 in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0; 10 mM hexamine cobalt trichloride. Prior to being cooled to cryogenic temperatures, crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution of mother liquor containing 25% (v/v) glycerol. Data were collected on beamline 9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) using a liquid nitrogen cryostream maintained at 90 K, and processed using the HKL package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) and the CCP4 suite of programs (Collaborative Computational Project \nNumber\n 4, 1994). Diffraction patterns show the contribution of more than one crystalline lattice; however, it was possible to separate and process the diffraction data from only the dominant lattice with good final statistics (Table 2). This crystal belongs to space group C2, with two 4E10-peptide complexes per asymmetric unit (61.5% solvent content and Matthews' coefficient of 3.2 Å\n3 \nDa\n−1\n). Coordinates and structure factors for Fab 4E10-peptide have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1TZG.\n\n\n \nStructure Determination and Refinement\n\n\n \n \n \nTo examine the interaction of 4E10 with the Trp-rich membrane-proximal region of gp41, the crystal structure of a Fab 4E10-peptide epitope complex was determined at 2.2 Å resolution. The 4E10 epitope is contained within the 13-residue peptide (Lys\nP668 \nGly\nP669 \nTrP\nP670 \nASn\nP671 \nTrp\nP672 \nPhe\nP673 \nAsp\nP674 \nIle\nP675 \nThr\nP676 \nAsn\nP677 \nTrp\nP678 \nGly\nP679 \nLys\nP680\n; numbered according to the HXB2 isolate sequence with a P chain identifier) that was previously shown to bind 4E10 (in that study, the peptide was named KGND) (Zwick et al., 2001a). The Lys and Gly residues at either end of the peptide were added to increase peptide solubility in water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure of Fab 4E10 as a complex with the 13-residue peptide was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) and Fab 48G7, a catalytic antibody (PDB entry 1HKL), as a probe. The structure was then refined to a resolution of 2.2 Å with R\ncryst\n=21.7%, and R\nfree\n=26.0% (Table 2) in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) and REFMAC (Collaborative Computational Project \nNumber\n 4, 1994). R\nfree \nwas calculated using the same set of 5% randomly assigned reflections in both programs. Fab heavy and light chains were treated separately as a rigid body for the initial refinement in CNS. The protein model was then refined using torsion angle simulated annealing at 5,000 K. Following these initial stages, the refinement proceeded through cycles of positional, temperature factor, and manual rebuilding in XFIT (McRee, 1999) into σ\nA\n-weighted 2F\no\n-F\nc \nand F\no\n-F\nc \nelectron density omit maps. The maximum likelihood target function, bulk solvent corrections and anisotropic temperature factor corrections were used for the refinement cycles in CNS. Density for the peptide was clear after a few cycles of refinement and manual rebuilding of the starting Fab model. Tight non-crystallographic restraints were used early on in the refinement and released gradually toward the end of the refinement. Water molecules were added automatically using cycles of ARP (Collaborative Computational Project \nNumber\n 4, 1994) for placement and REFMAC with TLS groups for refinement, then verified by manual inspection in XFIT. Stereochemical analysis of the refined structure was performed using PROCHECK (Collaborative Computational Project \nNumber\n 4, 1994). Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. One of the molecules of the complex in the asymmetric unit (molecule 2) has higher B values (40.4 Å\n2\n) than the other (23.3 Å\n2\n) due to fewer crystal packing contacts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe final model contains Fab residues L1-L212, H1-H232 (Fab residues are numbered according to standard convention (Kabat et al., 1991) with light and heavy chain identifiers L and H, respectively) and peptide residues P669-P680. Heavy chain C-terminal residues (Ser\nH229\n, Cys\nH230\n, Asp\nH231\n, and Lys\nH232\n) were visible in one Fab (molecule 1). Electron density omit maps clearly defined the location and conformation of the peptide in the binding site of 4E10 (\nFIG. 38A\n). The only peptide residue with no interpretable electron density is the N-terminal Lys\nP668\n, which was omitted from the model. \nFIG. 38\n depicts the structure of the peptide bound to Fab 4E10, in this case, the peptide sequence is KGWNWFDITNWGK (SEQ ID NO: 2) and it encompasses the 4E10 epitope. \nFIG. 38A\n provides a stereo view of the peptide structure superimposed on the sigma A-weighted Fo-Fc electron density omit map contoured at 46. Clear density is evident for all peptide residues except at the N-terminus. Part of the heavy (gray) and light (pink) chains of the antibody are displayed. \nFIGS. 38B and 38C\n provide the side and top views, respectively, of the peptide helix. Hydrogen bonds involved in stabilization of the helical conformation are shown as dotted lines. \nFIG. 38D\n is a representation of the peptide helical wheel. The residues in the polar face are in red.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fab 4E10-peptide complex model has good geometry with only Ala\nL51\n, which is in a conserved γ turn as observed in most antibody structures (Stanfield et al., 1999), in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Table 2). The two molecules in the asymmetric unit are similar, whereas individually the C\nα\n's of peptide residues, constant or variable Fab domains superimpose with r.m.s. deviations below 0.4 Å. Thus, only the complex with lower B values (molecule 1) is described here.\n\n\n \nStructural Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nSuperpositions and root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) calculations were carried out using the INSIGHT II package (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) for pairs of C\nH\n, C\nL\n, V\nH\n, and V\nL \ndomains. Hydrogen bonds between Fab 4E10 and peptide were identified using HBPLUS (McDonald and Thornton, 1994) and van der Waals contacts were assigned with CONTACSYM (Sheriff et al., 1987). Buried surface areas were calculated using MS (Connolly, 1993) with a 1.7 Å probe radius and standard van der Waals radii (Gelin and Karplus, 1979). The Lys\nP680 \nto Trp\nP680 \nchange was modeled with XFIT (McRee, 1999). Secondary structure was assigned using PROMOTIF (Hutchinson and Thornton, 1996). Graphics were prepared using XFIT (\nFIGS. 38\n, \n39\nE, and \n39\nF), RASTER3D (Merritt and Bacon, 1997) (\nFIGS. 38-40\n), GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991) (\nFIG. 39D\n), MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) (\nFIGS. 39A-39D\n and \n40\n), and MODELZILLA (\nFIG. 41\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 39\n depicts the antigen binding site of Fab 4E10. \nFIGS. 39A and 39B\n show the CDRs L1, L2, L3, H1, H2, and H3 highlighted in the Fab 4E10-peptide complex: the light chain (pink) CDRs L1 (dark blue) and L3 (green) and the heavy chain (gray) CDRs H1 (orange), H2 (magenta), and H3 (red) bind the peptide (yellow). CDR L2 (cyan) does not contact antigen. \nFIG. 39C\n shows the conformation of the H3 loop in the peptide-bound structure of Fab 4E10. The H3 loop (gray backbone with pink side chains) is rich in Gly and Trp residues. The peptide (yellow) is shown for reference. \nFIG. 39D\n depicts the electrostatic potential surface of Fab 4E10 with a bound peptide. Negatively-charged regions are red, positively charged regions are blue, and neutral regions are white (±15 kV potential range). The peptide (yellow) binds to a shallow hydrophobic cavity on the antibody. \nFIG. 39E\n shows an overall view of two molecules of the Fab 4E10-peptide complex in the unit cell. The crystal contacts in this region are close to the antigen binding site of Fab 4E10 (heavy chains are gray and green; light chains are salmon and blue). The peptides (yellow and purple chains) are located in the interface between the two related Fab molecules. \nFIG. 39F\n depicts the interaction of two peptide chains in the unit cell show the close interdigitation of their indole side chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 40\n depicts contacts between Fab 4E10 and key residues of its epitope. Hydrogen bonds are shown as dotted lines.

The side chain of Trp\nP672 \nis shown in 40B and 40C for reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFab 4E10 has the canonical β-sandwich immunoglobulin fold with an elbow angle of 193° for both molecules in the asymmetric unit. The complementarity determining regions (CDRs), or hypervariable loops, L1, L2, L3, H1, and H2 belong to \n \n \n \n \ncanonical classes\n \n \n \n \n 2, 1, 1, 1, and 2, respectively, as determined from the length, sequence, and conformation of the loops (A1-Lazikani et al., 1997) (\nFIGS. 39A and 39B\n). CDR H3 bends away from the binding site to allow interaction of its base and central residues with the C-terminal region of the peptide (\nFIG. 39B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody 4E10 has a long CDR H3 (Glu\nH95 \nGly\nH96 \nThr\nH97 \nThr\nH98 \nGly\nH99 \nTrp\nH100 \nGly\nH100A \nTrp\nH100B \nIle\nH100C \nGly\nH100D \nLys\nH100E \nPro\nH100F \nIle\nH100G \nGly\nH100H \nAla\nH100I \nPhe\nH100J \nAla\nH101 \nHis\nH102\n) with a ten amino acid insert after \nresidue\n 100. Such long CDR H3 loops are also found in other HIV-1 MAbs, such as 2F5 (Barbato et al., 2003), Z13 (Zwick et al., 2001a), b12 (Saphire et al., 2001), 447-52D (Stanfield et al., 2004), and 17b (Kwong et al., 1998) and may facilitate access to concave or relatively inaccessible sites. In addition, the H3 loop of 4E10 is quite hydrophobic and rich in Gly and Trp residues (\nFIG. 39C\n); five Gly and two Trp residues are present in the 18 residues of the H3 loop. The Gly residues give the loop some conformational freedom, while the Trp residues may facilitate interactions with hydrophobic regions in or around the membrane-proximal region of gp41, including the viral membrane (Ofek et al. Manuscript in preparation). Thus, the size and amino acid composition of the H3 loop may facilitate 4E10 access and binding to its partially occluded epitope in the native gp41 oligomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 13-residue peptide is bound to Fab 4E10 in a helical conformation (\nFIGS. 38 and 39\n) as found for a 19-residue peptide (KWASLWNWFNITNWLWYIK (SEQ ID NO: 1); residues 665-683 of the Trp-rich membrane-proximal region of gp41) in membrane-mimetic dodecylphosphocholine micelles by NMR spectroscopy (Schibli et al., 2001). The 13-residue peptide has an α-helical conformation from Asp\nP674 \nto Lys\nP680 \npreceded by a short 3\n10 \nhelix (Asn\nP671 \nand Trp\nP672\n) and an extended structure (Gly\nP669 \nand)Trp\nP670\n) at the N-terminus (\nFIGS. 38B and 38C\n). The transition from 3\n10 \nhelix to α-helix occurs at Phe\nP673\n, where the carbonyl oxygen makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the backbone nitrogen of Asn\nP677 \n(\nFIG. 38B\n), the i+4 residue from Phe\nP673\n, in an almost α-helical manner. The 3\n10 \nhelix has been suggested to act as a folding intermediate in α-helix formation. The helical conformation creates an amphipathic structure with a narrow polar face (defined by residues Asn\nP671\n, Asp\nP674\n, Asn\nP677\n, and)Lys\nP680 \nand a hydrophobic face (Trp\nP672\n, Phe\nP673\n, Ile\nP675\n, Thr\nP676\n, Trp\nP678\n, and Gly\nP679\n) (\nFIGS. 38C\n, \n38\nD, \n39\nC and \n39\nD). Residue Lys\nP680\n, which is part of a solubility tag, corresponds to the universally-conserved Trp in the gp41 sequence and is located between the two faces. In addition, the H3 loop of 4E10 is quite hydrophobic and rich in Gly (5) and Trp (2) residues (\nFIG. 39\n \nc\n). The Gly residues give the loop some conformational freedom, while the Trp residues may facilitate interactions with hydrophobic regions in or around the membrane-proximal region of gp41, including the viral membrane (Ofek, submitted). The Fab-bound peptide structure thus defines the minimal 4E10 epitope as WFXYZ, where X does not play a major role in 4E10 binding, Y can be Ile/Leu/Val, and Z can be Thr/Ser. The WFXYZ motif appears to be absolutely conserved in all HIV-1 viruses. The remarkable broadly neutralizing activity of 4E10 appears to derive from its ability to recognize the most conserved gp41 residues within its core epitope sequence. The majority of the contacts (36%) are made with the absolutely-conserved Trp672 of gp41.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 47\n depicts both the schemiatic representation of gp41 and the neutralizing activity of 4E10. \nFIG. 47\n \na \nshows important functional regions include the fusion peptide (FP; purple box), the N- and C-terminal heptad repeat regions (NHR, green box, and CHR, red box, respectively), and the transmembrane region (TM; yellow box). The location and sequence of the Trp-rich region are indicated with the core 2F5 and 4E10 epitopes shown in red and the region contained within the peptide used in this study underlined. Sequence numbering follows strain HXB2. The various domains are not drawn to scale. \nFIG. 37\n \nb\n, depicts the neutralizing activity of 4E10 against a panel of viruses from different clades. A total of 93 viruses were analyzed of which 52 have unique sequences in the 4E10 epitope region shown here. The sequences are arranged in order of neutralization sensitivity from the most sensitive (red; IC\n50\n<1 μg/mL) to the most resistant (green; IC\n50\n>50 μg/mL. The intermediate sensitivity, 1 μg/mL>IC\n50\n>50 μg/mL, is in yellow). The sequences around the 4E10 epitope are shown with conserved residues as dashes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn complexes between peptides and anti-peptide antibodies, β-turns are the predominant secondary structure of the bound peptide (Stanfield and Wilson, 1995). Thus, the conformation of the peptide bound to 4E10 is highly unusual. Helical peptides bound to antibody have rarely been reported. To date, only two other examples of crystal structures of complexes between helical peptides and antibodies have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank: an anti-interleukin 2 Fab in complex with an antigenic nonapeptide with 7 residues in an α-helical conformation (PDB access code 1F90) (Afonin et al., 2001), and antibody C21 in complex with its epitope on P-glycoprotein where all 11 peptide residues form an α-helix (PDB code 2AP2) (van Den Elsen et al., 1999).\n\n\n \nBinding Affinity by ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to determine the binding affinity of the antibody for the peptide and gp41. Microplate wells (Corning) were coated overnight at 4° C. with 50 μl of PBS containing peptide (4.1 μg/ml) or recombinant gp41 (4 μg/ml). The wells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 and blocked with 3% BSA for 45 min at 37° C. After a single wash, 4E10 (5 μg/ml) was added to the wells in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.02% Tween and allowed to incubate at 37° C. for 2 h. The wells were washed four times, goat anti-human IgG F(ab′)\n2 \nalkaline phosphatase (Pierce) diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 1% BSA was added, and the plate was incubated for 40 min at room temperature. The wells were washed four times and developed by adding 50 μl of alkaline phosphatase substrate, prepared by adding one tablet of disodium-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) to 5 ml of alkaline phosphatase staining buffer (pH 9.8), as specified by the manufacturer. After 30 min, the optical density at 405 nm was read on a microplate reader (Molecular Devices).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody 4E10 binds with approximately 4-fold higher affinity to recombinant gp41 than to the synthetic peptide (data not shown), as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The reduced affinity of 4E10 for the peptide could be due to lack of appropriate flanking residues or conformational restraints of the peptide conformation in gp41. Nevertheless, the contact residues between 4E10 and the core epitope are likely to be the same on gp41.\n\n\n \nStructural Basis for 4E10 Specificity\n\n\n \n \n \nSpecific antibody-antigen recognition comes from steric and chemical complementarity between antigen and antibody. The Fab 4E10 combining site is mostly a hydrophobic cavity (\nFIG. 39D\n) that allows a close fit of the amphipathic peptide. The antibody surface area buried by the peptide is approximately 580 Å\n2\n, whereas the corresponding area on the peptide is about 529 Å\n2\n. Although these values are comparable to those found in other Fab-peptide complexes (Stanfield and Wilson, 1995), the 4E10 peptide additionally buries an extra 360 Å\n2 \nof its surface due to crystal packing. In the crystal, two peptide molecules are related by a 2-fold symmetry axis and are adjacent to each other (\nFIGS. 39E and 39F\n). This supersecondary interaction of the two peptide chains (\nFIG. 39F\n) combines to bury the hydrophobic peptide almost completely and perhaps mimics the low-energy conformation in the intact gp41 oligomer or the association with the viral membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFab 4E10 uses five of its six CDR loops to bind the peptide; CDR L2 is not used and CDR L1 makes only minor contacts (\nFIG. 39B\n). Eight hydrogen bonds, 1 salt bridge, and 98 van der Waals contacts are made between peptide and Fab residues from CDRs L1 (4% of total contacts), L3 (28%), H1 (8%), H2 (41%), and H3 (19%) (Table 3). Ten additional hydrogen bonds between peptide and Fab residues are mediated by water molecules buried at the Fab-peptide interface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe extent and nature of the Fab-peptide interactions define the relative importance of each peptide residue for complex formation. In a helical conformation, the peptide backbone cannot easily engage in hydrogen bonds to the Fab because of the intra-peptide hydrogen bonding along the helix. The peptide recognition then depends mainly on interactions in which the peptide side chain knobs from the helix intercalate into holes on the antibody surface. The helical conformation of the bound peptide places the side chains of Trp\nP672 \nand Phe\nP673 \non the same side of the peptide and along with Ile\nP675\n, Thr\nP676\n, and Lys\nP680 \nforms an extensive hydrophobic face that intimately contacts the Fab (\nFIGS. 38 and 39\n). The side chains of Trp\nP672 \nand Phe\nP673 \ninsert into a pocket in the antibody-combining site, where they form a cluster of aromatic rings with Fab residues Tyr\nL91\n, Trp\nH47\n, and Phe\nH100J \n(\nFIG. 40A\n). In addition to the 37 van der Waals contacts, the main chain and side chain of Trp\nP672 \nhydrogen bond to Ser\nL94 \nand Ile\nH56\n, respectively (Table 3 and \nFIG. 40A\n). The Trp\nP672 \ncontacts represent 36% of the total contacts between Fab 4E10 and peptide that make it the most important residue in the antibody-peptide interaction (Table 3); the majority of these contacts (85%) are with CDR H2 (residues Gly\nH50\n, Val\nH51\n, Ile\nH52\n, Ile\nH56\n, and Asn\nH58\n). The next key peptide residues are Thr\nP676 \nand Phe\nP673\n, which make 18% and 14% of the total contacts with the Fab, respectively. Phe\nP673 \nworks cooperatively with Trp\nP672 \nto form the cluster of aromatic rings in the binding site (\nFIG. 40A\n). In addition to several van der Waals contacts, the side chain of Thr\nP676 \nhydrogen bonds to the carboxyl of Glu\nH95 \n(Table 3 and \nFIG. 40B\n). Thr\nP676 \nalong with Lys\nP680 \nare the peptide residues with the most interactions with the H3 loop (Table 3). Even though Ile\nP675 \nis responsible for only 6% of the contacts between 4E10 and the peptide, the side chain of Ile\nP675 \nstacks with the side chains of Ile\nH52 \nand Ile\nH56 \nto create a small cluster of isoleucines on the edge of the antibody-combining site (\nFIG. 40B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutagenesis of HIV-1 has recently shown that Trp\nP680 \nis important for 4E10 neutralization (Zwick. et al. Manuscript in preparation). In the peptide used here, a Lys rather than a Trp was substituted at position 680 to increase peptide solubility. To explore the structural role of Trp\nP680 \nin the binding site, Trp\nP680 \nwas modeled in place of Lys\nP680 \nin an orientation that maximizes contacts with 4E10 (\nFIG. 40C\n). In this conformation, the N\ne1 \natom of Trp\nP680 \nwould hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Leu\nH100C\n, in the same way as the N\nξ \natom of Lys\nP680 \nhydrogen bonds to Leu\nH100C \nin the crystal structure. In addition, Trp\nP680 \nwould pack with Tyr\nH32 \nand Pro\nH100F \n(\nFIG. 40C\n) forming a second cluster of aromatic residues in the antibody-combining site. All of these proposed contacts would place Trp\nP680\n, together with Trp\nP672\n, Phe\nP673\n, Ile\nP675\n, and Thr\nP676\n, as a critical residue for 4E10 specificity for gp41.\n\n\n \nDiscussion\n\n\n \n \n \nThe structural analysis of the contributions made by each peptide residue to 4E10 binding reveals the key epitope residues and complements results obtained from epitope mapping (Zwick et al., 2001a) and mutagenesis experiments (Zwick et al. Manuscript in preparation). Previously, 4E10 was mapped to a linear epitope comprising residues NWF(D/N)IT (SEQ ID NO: 77) (Zwick et al., 2001a) on the 671-679 Trp-rich region of gp41. The crystal structure of the Fab 4E10-epitope complex illustrates that Trp\nP672\n, Phe\nP673\n, Ile\nP675\n, and Thr\nP676 \nmake the greatest number of selective contacts with 4E10. These peptide residues dictate 4E10's high affinity for the epitope. Trp\nP672\n, Phe\nP673 \n(and probably Trp\nP680\n; a Lys was present at this position in the peptide used here) side chains are buried in the binding site and are involved in aromatic 7π-stacking interactions. The most important residue for antibody-peptide binding is Trp\nP672\n, which alone is responsible for 36% of the total contacts between the Fab and the peptide. In comparison, Ile\nP675 \nand Thr\nP676 \nhave a secondary role for defining the 4E10 specificity. Thr\nP676 \ncan be replaced by a serine without affecting 4E10 binding and Ser is found in many HIV isolates that are neutralized by 4E10. Such Thr/Ser change can maintain the hydrogen bond with CDR H3 residue Glu\nH95\n. On the other hand, Ile\nP675\n, which is highly conserved and forms part of a cluster of three isoleucines in the binding site, is not involved in as many contacts with 4E10 and can be replaced by other medium-size hydrophobic residues, such as Leu or Val, without any drastic decrease in 4E10 affinity for gp41. Thus, the minimal epitope for 4E10 can now be defined as WFXYZ, where X does not play a major role for 4E10 binding, Y can be Ile/Leu/Val, and Z can be Thr/Ser. Since the X residue must not make steric clashes with the antibody binding site, some restrictions about the size and chemical features of this side chain still remains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 4E10 epitope is part of the fusion machinery of HIV and Trp\n672 \nhas a crucial role in virus infectivity (Salzwedel et al., 1999). Second, the variable residues that flank the conserved Trp\nP672\n, Phe\nP673\n, Ile\nP675\n, and Thr/Ser\nP676 \nare located on the opposite side of the helical epitope and are not involved in many contacts with the antibody. These variable residues might be masked in the interface of a gp41 oligomer or embedded in the viral membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough HIV-1 entry into human cells has been extensively investigated, many aspects of the process remain undefined. It is hypothesized that before CD4 binding, gp41 is in a metastable conformation with the fusion peptide buried in the gp41 structure (Gallo et al., 2003) (\nFIG. 41\n). \nFIG. 41\n is a cartoon representation of a hypothetical model of HIV env-mediated membrane fusion and virus neutralization by antibody 4E10. The native state of the gp120-gp41 complex is metastable and triggered by gp120 binding to CD4 and coreceptor (here CCR5). The 4E10 epitope on gp41 is represented as a pink helix parallel to the plane of the viral membrane and the epitope seems to be exposed and susceptible to antibody binding and virus neutralization in the metastable and receptor-bound states of gp41. Conformational changes of the Env proteins leading to the pre-hairpin intermediate cause gp120 dissociation of gp41 and insertion of the gp41 fusion peptide into the host cell membrane. For clarity, only one gp41 monomer is shown for the pre-hairpin state (N-terminal heptad repeat is a pink helix and C-terminal heptad repeat is a green helix). 4E10 binding to the extended pre-hairpin intermediate is a possibility to be still proved. The viral and cell membranes are brought into close proximity and the orientation of the helical gp41 membrane-proximal region parallel to the membranes with the Trp residues around the helix axis could aid in the disruption of both membranes. In the final stages of fusion, the C-terminal heptad repeat folds back onto the N-terminal heptad repeat to generate a trimer of hairpins also known as the 6-helix bundle structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding of gp120 to CD4 and coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) triggers conformational changes in gp120 and gp41, resulting in dissociation of gp120 from gp41 and change of gp41 to a pre-hairpin intermediate conformation in which the fusion peptide is inserted into the host membrane and the N- and C-terminal heptad repeat regions are separated (Gallo et al., 2003). The C-terminal heptad repeat region would then fold back onto the N-terminal heptad repeat to generate a trimer of hairpins (also known as the six-helix bundle) with the three C-terminal helices wrapped around the central three N-helices in an antiparallel orientation (Weissenhorn et al., 1997; Chan et al., 1997). Transition from the pre-hairpin to the hairpin gp41 structure brings the host and viral membranes into close proximity. The Trp-rich region of gp41 may be or become parallel to the plane of the viral-host membranes and the distribution of Trp residues around the helix could then allow the Trp-rich region to disrupt both membranes (Schibli et al., 2001), and aid in the formation of a fusion pore along with the fusion peptide. The binding of 4E10 to the Trp-rich region would prevent such an event. The final step of the fusion process is pore expansion to a size that permits passage of the viral nucleocapsid. A cluster of several HIV Env trimers must interact with a cluster of host cell receptors for the fusion process take place efficiently.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe membrane-proximal region of gp41 appears to be quite flexible and apparently changes conformation during the course of the membrane fusion event. The membrane-proximal region is suggested to first extend and then contract to a helical structure (Barbato et al., 2003). Such a structural transition is in agreement with data showing the region in a mostly extended conformation with a central Asp\n664\n-Lys\n665\n-Trp\n666 \nβ-turn when bound to MAb 2F5 (Barbato et al., 2003), as a 3\n10 \nhelix in water (Biron et al., 2002), and as an α-helix in a membrane-mimic micelle (Schibli et al., 2001) and when bound to 4E10 (this study). The 3\n10 \nhelix could be an intermediate to the final α-helix. The 4E10 epitope region might be helical all or most of the time since it is very close to the helical transmembrane domain and has been shown to be exposed and susceptible to antibody binding and virus neutralization by 4E10, at least when gp41 is in the native metastable and receptor-bound conformations (Binley et al., 2003) (\nFIG. 41\n). In addition, the 4E10 epitope could still be accessible when gp41 is in the extended pre-hairpin conformation. However, 4E10 binding to the extended pre-hairpin intermediate has still to be proved. In the metastable and receptor-bound conformations, 4E10 epitope may be partially occluded by the gp120-gp41 oligomer. If at this stage, the Trp-rich helix is already parallel to the membrane, as suggested from the NMR structure of this region in a membrane-mimic micelle (Schibli et al., 2001) and as represented in \nFIG. 41\n, the 4E10 epitope might be less occluded by the gp120-gp41 oligomer than if the region is perpendicular to the membrane and is part of a gp41 oligomer. In either of these scenarios, the size and hydrophobic character of the CDR H3 of 4E10 should be an important feature to facilitate interaction with the partially occluded and membrane-proximal 4E10 epitope. The five Gly residues may give the CDR H3 conformational freedom and eliminate potential steric clashes with side chains. The H3 loop size and flexibility would allow a potential interaction between the tip of the loop (Pro\nH100F\n) and Trp\n680\n, a gp41 residue located only a few residues further from the membrane (\nFIG. 40C\n). Simultaneously, the two Trp residues located close to the tip of the H3 loop (Trp\nH100 \nand Trp\nH100B\n) (\nFIG. 39C\n) have the potential to enhance the interaction between 4E10 and HIV by inserting their side chains into the viral membrane when the tip of the H3 loop is contacting the epitope, similarly to that proposed for 2F5 (Ofek et al. Manuscript in preparation). Mutagenesis studies of the H3 loop of 4E10 are ongoing to test the importance of the CDR H3 for 4E10 binding to gp41 in virus particles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fact that the 4E10 epitope is contiguous and highly conserved among HIV isolates of different clades makes the epitope a good lead for structure-based design of a broadly effective HIV-1 vaccine. 4E10 may also increase the efficacy of an antibody combination therapy, since 4E10 neutralizes viruses that are not neutralized by other available MAbs. Despite the contiguous nature of the 4E10 epitope, denaturation of recombinant gp41 reduces the binding of 4E10, but not of 2F5 (Zwick et al., 2001a). This effect suggests the importance of the helical epitope conformation for MAb 4E10. The 13-residue peptide used in this study therefore mimics the biologically-relevant conformation of its cognate epitope on gp41 and helical peptide analogs could be used to focus the immune response to induce higher titers of 4E10-like antibodies able to neutralize a broad range of HIV subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nX-ray Diffraction Data and Refinement Statistics for the Complex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrystal Features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace group\n\n\nC2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. of molecules of complex per asym.\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit cell parameters (Å, °)\n\n\nA = 157.3, b = 45.1, c = 198.5,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nβ = 113.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Quality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution (Å)\na\n \n\n\n50.00-2.20 (2.28-2.20) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. of observations\n\n\n198,794\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. of unique reflections\n\n\n61,572\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMosaicity (°)\n\n\n0.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleteness (%)\na\n \n\n\n93.0 (61.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiplicity\na\n \n\n\n3.2 (2.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI/σ (I)\na\n \n\n\n16.7 (2.3) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\nsym \n(%)\na,b\n \n\n\n 7.5 (37.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Quality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\ncryst \n(%)\nc\n \n\n\n21.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\nfree \n(%)\nc\n \n\n\n26.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. of protein atoms\n\n\n6907\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO.

These structures provide insight into the conformations that compounds have to adopt in order to elicit neutralizing antibodies. 4E10 is the most broadly neutralizing HIV-1 Mab known, and recognizes a highly conserved, contiguous helical epitope in the gp41 membrane proximal region. Based on the crystal structure of the 4E10/epitope peptide complex, helical peptides and small molecule helix mimics are developed as immunogens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, substantial structural information is also now available for the fusion-active form of gp41, with at least eighteen different crystal structures in the PDB representing variants of the protease-resistant core of the HIV-1 gp41 ectodomain (\nFIG. 45\n) (Weissenhorn, 1997; Chan, 1997; Eckert, 1999; Tan, 1997; Ji, 1999; Shu, 2000a; Shu, 2000b; Liu, 2001; Zhou, 2000; Lu, 2001). Additionally, x-ray and NMR structures are available for the related SIV gp41 (Yang, 1999; Malashkevich, 1998; Caffrey, 1998; Kuszewski, 1999; Liu, 2002), Ebola virus GP2 cores (Malashkevich, 1999; Weissenhorn, 1998) and visna virus core (Malashkevich, 2001). The fusion-active form of gp41 is a bundle of six helices with three inner helices (N-terminal heptad repeat; NHR) forming a trimeric coiled-coil and three outer helices (C-terminal heptad repeat; CHR) packing anti-parallel to the inner trimer (\nFIG. 45\n). The first gp41 core structures were for the N36/C34 complex (\nFIG. 45\n, 1AIK, (Chan, 1997)), and a single fusion peptide with a trimeric GCN4 sequence N-terminal to gp41 residues 546-596 (NHR), followed by 628-670 (CHR) (\nFIG. 45\n, 1ENV, (Weissenhorn, 1997)). Other structures include a fusion peptide containing the NHR region (551-584) linked by residues SGGRGG (SEQ ID NO: 84) to the CHR region (633-659) (\nFIG. 45\n, 1SZT, (Tan, 1997)) in different detergents, and with mutations in several positions (Ji, 1999; Shu, 2000a; Shu, 2000b). Finally, the structure of a peptide (IQN17) designed to solubilize N36 by fusing a trimeric GCN4 sequence to a mutated NHR sequence was determined as a complex with a fusion inhibiting D-amino acid peptide (\nFIG. 45\n, 1CZQ, (Eckert, 1999)). All of these structures are presumed to represent the fusion active form of the gp41 ectodomain. Comparison with the pre-fusion (Wilson, 1981) and the fusion active forms (Bullough, 1994; Chen, 1999) of the influenza virus hemagglutinin, reveals some similarity of the HIV-1 gp41 structure and fusion mechanism to that of the influenza virus hemagglutinin HA2. These short-lived fusion intermediates expose new epitopes that may provide additional neutralization targets, or facilitate design of fusion inhibitors, such as peptides (\nFIG. 45\n) (Eckert, 1999; Wild, 1994; Jiang, 1993; Jiang, 1993; Rimsky, 1998; Ferrer, 1999) and small molecules (Jiang, 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther structural information for gp41 includes IR spectroscopy of the N-terminal fusion peptide (Gordon, 2004), an NMR structure of the Trp-rich membrane proximal region (KWASLWNWFNITNWLWYIK; SEQ ID NO: 1) bound to micelles (Schibli, 2001), and several NMR studies of the 2F5 epitope, part of the same Trp-rich region (Barbato, 2003; Biron, 2002). These studies all indicate that the fusion peptide and the membrane proximal region can adopt helical conformations, at least in apolar environments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs stated, the 4E10 epitope appears to adopt a helical conformation; therefore a first generation of peptide mimics with a α-helix conformation has been designed. Among the different techniques available to increase the helicity of a peptide is the formation of constrained cyclic peptides and the introduction of the unusual amino acid amino isobutyric acid. Schematic representations of the different peptides that have or will be synthesized, as well as the structure of Aib are shown in \nFIG. 43\n. Peptides belonging to three different categories have been designed and synthesized: cycloethers, lactams, Aib-containing peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, initial results on the ability of some peptides to bind 4E10, 2F5 and Z13, have provided insight on the importance of the sequence NWFDIT (SEQ ID NO: 85), which appears to be more promising than NWFNIT (SEQ ID NO: 86) to generate broadly neutralizing antibodies. The presence of aspartic acid appears to be crucial to allow binding to 4E10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe goal of this experiment was to synthesize peptides, or peptidomimetics, with a helical conformation and with the key amino acids. A large number of peptides have been synthesized with increasing diversity in the structures. To enhance helicity, an amino isobutyric acid (Aib) may be introduced, or a (i, i+3), a (i, i+4), or a (i, i+7)\n17 \ncyclic peptide may be formed, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds from three main families were designed and synthesized: the Aib-containing peptides (Aib stands for amino isobutyric acid (an unnatural amino acid that induces a local helical backbone structure)), the cyclic thioethers, and the cyclic lactams. The variety of examples from each family can be expanded by changing the sequence of the amino acids and the size of the ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor compounds in the Aib family, the position of the substitution(s) and the length of our peptides are being studied. In the lactan family of compounds, (i, i+4) derivatives based on the sequences c(EXXXK) (a side chain cyclized peptide between Glu and Lys to induce helicity) and c(KXXXE) (the reverse of the c(EXXXK) side chain) have been synthesized. The diversity of these compounds is expanded by replacing lysine with ornithine, which reduces the ring size. Compounds in a (i, i+3) model are also being designed. This allows a determination of which ring size seems more appropriate, and whether the amide bond should be reversed. Additionally, in the cyclothioether compounds, the size of the ring is also studied by replacing the initial c(CXXXO) sequence (a sidechain cyclized peptide with a thioether bond between Cys and a bromoacetylated ornithine residue) with c(OXXXC), c(KXXXC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther methods to increase the peptide helicity include introduction of an α-aminoisobutyric acid residue (AIB), or crosslinking the helix with lactam, thioether, or disulfide bridges (\nFIG. 43\n)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, circular dichroism (CD) experiments are performed on each compound to assess their helicity content.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFifty-five different peptides have already been synthesized (Table 4, the —NH2 at the C-terminus means the peptides are amides; the poly Arg or poly Lys tails are for solubility, not for 4E10 binding). Thus, small molecule α-helix mimetics that present the side chains of the Ab bound hydrophobic face of the amphipathic α-helix (residues (672-680) are prepared, examined for 4E10 Ab binding, and ultimately enlisted as antigens to elicit Mabs capable of binding the conserved gp41 core epitope. Since the Ab-antigen recognition comes from steric and chemical complementarity derived from a mostly hydrophobic Ab cavity and since the bound peptide antigens adopt an α-helix conformation with internal (versus Ab-peptide) hydrogen bonds, the recognition depends mainly on the hydrophobic side chain interactions with the hydrophobic Ab binding site. These can be synthetically reproduced by displaying the key side chains on α-helix mimetics designed to appropriately display the recognition face (side chains of Trp\nP672\n, Phe\nP673\n, Ile\nP675\n, Thr\nP676 \nand Trp\nP680\n) on a small molecule (e.g. i, i+3, and i+7 residues). Included in the list of peptides in Table 4 is one such mimetic that was based on a design from the Hamilton lab (Ernst, 2003; Kutzki, 2002) (\nFIG. 46\n). Furthermore, tight binding peptides for 4E10 from the Scott lab are also selected from peptide libraries displayed on the major coat protein of filamentous bacteriophage (pVIII) (Scott, 1990) and include cyclic peptide E6.8 (RCRTIDVFRNCI; SEQ ID NO: 17) and linear peptide 10A.3 (AEPAETSWFYLTTFL; SEQ ID NO:18).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding of these peptides with the different epitopes has been studied by ELISAs. The affinity of peptides binding to 4E10 has been increased, as can be seen on the ELISA chart in \nFIG. 44\n. This figure depicts competition assays on 44-2 (native sequence) with different peptides: a cycloether (22-4), an Aib-containing peptide (33-1), some lactams (38) and a shorter native sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a second consideration to the design of peptides described above, it is preferred that the non 4E10 binding elements of the peptides also be engineered to be as non-immunogenic as possible. Accordingly the minimum elements required to obtain the best binding are identified and all non-crucial elements are rendered as non-immunogenic as possible to reduce the likelihood of non-neutralizing epitopes and the formation of non-neutralizing antibodies; only the key binding elements need to be present, the remainder can be replaced by alanine when possible (because alanine is poorly immunogenic) or by the least immunogenic substituents. The present compounds bind tightly to the 4E10 antibody; and, following immunization, the elicited antibodies will be tested in a single-round infectivity neutralization assay against the sensitive HIV-1 strain HxB2. Pre-immune serum will be included as a negative control. The neutralization will be confirmed using purified IgGs from the serum in the neutralization assay against HxB2 and a less neutralization-sensitive isolate, JR-FL. In parallel, the sera will be titered against the peptides in our panel to determine their breadth and specificity, in comparison with 4E10.\n\n\n \n

the panel of peptides. The monoclonal antibodies will also be tested in neutralization assays. The “WF” of the core 4E10 epitope, NWFDIT (SEQ ID NO: 85), appears to be significant for 4E10 binding and this will be confined in other antibodies to this region of gp41 in order for them to neutralize HIV-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, to improve the non-immunogenicity of the helical peptides, the peptides will be “masked” on the side of the helix that is not involved in the binding using, for instance, C-sugars (such as those described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/471,328). Sugars are known to be poorly immunogenic because of their bulk, and C-sugars present the advantage of an increased enzymatic stability. C-sugars would be attached on the functional side chains of amino acids placed on the inert phase of the helix (Brunel, 2003a; Brunel, 2003b).\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nSynthesis and Characterization of Peptides and Peptidomimetics\n\n\n \n \n \nTo identify the minimal gp41 peptide sequence that binds tightly to 4E10, a series of peptides were synthesized. Previous studies had identified the residues NWFDIT (SEQ ID NO: 85) (gp41 671-676) to be an important part of the core 4E10 epitope (Stiegler, G., 2001; Zwick, M. B., 2001). The importance of W680 was also shown from alanine scanning mutagenesis of the gp41 membrane proximal envelope region (MPER) on the virus using 4E10 neutralization as a readout, and also suggested from analysis of the crystal structure of a 13-amino acid peptide “KGND”, which includes gp41 residues 669 to 677 bound to 4E10 (Cardoso, R. M., 2005; Zwick, M. B., 2005). Therefore, the sequence NWFDITNWLW (SEQ ID NO: 87) corresponding to gp41 residues 671-680 was selected as a starting point to identify the full linear epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides were synthesized manually using solid phase peptide methodology on a C-terminal amide yielding MBHA resin, using in situ neutralization cycles for Boc-solid phase peptide synthesis (Schnolzer, M., 1992). Aib was activated using 0.5 mmol Boc-Aib-OH, 0.5 mmol TFFH and 0.7 ml DIEA in 1.5 ml DMF for 15 minutes at 25° C. The activated amino acid was added to the deprotected polypeptide resin without prior neutralization and coupled for 20 minutes. When necessary, double couplings were performed. The N-termini of the peptides were left unprotected. Solubilizing tails were introduced on the C-terminal end of the peptide to allow easier synthesis of multiple compounds. Following chain assembly, the peptides were cleaved from the resin with HF and 10% anisole for 1 hour at 0° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides were purified by analytical reverse-phase HPLC, performed on a Rainin HPLC system equipped with a Vydac C18 column (10 mm, 1.0×15 cm, \nflow rate\n 1 mL/min). Preparative reverse-phase HPLC was performed on Waters 4000 HPLC system using Vydac C18 columns (10 μm, 5.0×25 cm) and a Gilson UV detector. Linear gradients of acetonitrile in water/0.1% TFA were used to elute bound peptides. Peptides were characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on an API-III triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). Peptide masses were calculated from the experimental mass to charge (m/z) ratios from all of the observed protonation states of a peptide by using MacSpec software (Sciex). All observed peptide masses agreed with the calculated average masses within 0.5 Da.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIC\n50\n, were determined by competitive ELISA using a constant concentration of biotinylated peptide and IgG with a variable concentration of gp41 peptides. Microwells were coated overnight at 4° C. with 50 μl PBS containing neutravidin (Pierce; 4 μg/ml). Wells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.05\n% Tween\n 20, and blocked with 4% non-fat dry milk in PBS for 45 minutes at 37° C. A mixture of a biotinylated 4E10-epitope peptide, SLWNWFDITNWLWRRK(biotin)-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 88) (20 nM), IgG 4E10 (0.2 nM), and the competing peptide analog (3-fold dilution series starting at 10 μM) in 0.4% non-fat dry milk, 0.02% Tween and PBS was incubated in a separate 96-well plate at 37° C. for 2 hours. After washing the blocked plate, the mixture of 4E10, biotinylated peptide and competing peptide was added to the wells. After 20 minutes at room temperature, the Wells were washed five times, and a 1:500 dilution of goat anti-human IgG F(ab′)\n2 \nHRP conjugate (Pierce) was added. Following incubation at RT for 40 minutes, the wells were washed five times, and developed by adding 50 μl of TMB solution (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After ˜20 minutes, wells containing TMB solution were stopped by adding 50 μl of H\n2\nSO\n4 \n(2M) and the O.D. at 450 nm was read on a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The concentration of competitor peptide corresponding to a half-maximal signal (IC\n50\n) was determined by interpolation of the resulting binding curve. Each peptide competitor was tested in duplicate in at least two separate experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting peptide NWFDITNWLWKKKK-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 15) had an IC\n50 \nof 40 nM. The extent of the 4E10 peptide epitope was characterized by extending this sequence towards the N and C-termini. N-terminal extensions of the epitope did not improve 4E10 binding. C-terminal extension of the sequence up to the transmembrane domain (residue 683) increased 4E10 binding by 4-fold with respect to the starting peptide. The results herein suggest that residues 671-683 of gp41 (NWFDITNWLWYIK; SEQ ID NO: 73) represent the shortest linear epitope with optimal affinity for 4E10. A peptide encompassing this sequence with a solubilizing lysine tail, NWFDITNWLWYIKKKK-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 8), had an IC\n50 \nof 10 nM, an improvement of 4-fold over the starting peptide and an improvement over 1000-fold compared to KGND, a 13 mer co-crystallized with 4E10.

In peptide 104-1, the side chain was acylated. “nd” in Table 5 means “not determined”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe importance of individual amino acid side chains were assessed by performing alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Alanine was individually substituted for each amino acid in the optimized epitope (residues 671-683). The effects of these mutations on the IC\n50 \nare shown in \nFIG. 47\n. Mutations at W672, F673, and T676 resulted in a major decrease in binding to the 4E10 antibody (over 1,000-fold), and confirm that these three residues are crucial for peptide recognition by 4E10. The next major increase in IC\n50 \nwas observed when L679 was mutated to alanine. The importance of this residue had not been predicted in prior reports. Four other residues (N671, D674, 1675, and W680) also showed a decrease in binding of 20 to 30-fold when alanine substitutions were performed. The other residues in the sequence could be substituted to alanine without any major decrease in 4E10 binding (five-fold or less).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStructural analyses of the 4E10/peptide complex showed that the bound conformation of the peptide is helical (Cardoso, R. M., 2005). Therefore, helix-inducing constraints were introduced, including Aib residues and side chain tethers. Table 6 contains the peptide sequences and binding constants of the constrained peptides. Peptides in which “WF” was not included in the cyclic tether showed substantially increased binding to 4E10, indicating that these particular constraints on “WF” interfere with binding. Constraints in the center and C-terminus resulted in peptides with a tighter binding to 4E10, suggesting that increasing the helical character in these regions is favorable for 4E10 binding. The results herein are consistent with the crystal structure of “KGND” bound to the antibody in which the helix begins to “unwind” at residues W672 (Cardoso, R. M., 2005). Tightly binding peptides (IC\n50 \nof 10 nM) were obtained that incorporated either Aib residues or thioether tethers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine whether the imposed constraints increased the helicity of the peptides, each one was analyzed in solution using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (\nFIG. 48\n). An Aviv spectropolarimeter Model 203-02 was used, with cells of 0.1 cm in length, a wavelength step of 0.5 nm and a bandwidth of 1.0 nm. One to three scans were reported. The exact peptide concentrations were determined by UV measurements at 280 nm on a Gison UV detector, model 116.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tightest binding peptides were all helical with minima close to 207 and 222 nm. However, a further increase in helicity did not result in an increase in binding: 94-1 is more helical than 84-1, but has a smaller IC\n50\n. Peptide 119, which is more helical 94-1, had the same IC\n50\n. Nevertheless, the imposed constraints were able to increase the peptide order in solution without diminishing 4E10 binding. Slightly shorter, structurally constrained peptides with tight binding to 4E10 (IC\n50\n=10 nM) were also identified (see peptides 102-1 and 104-2).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmino acid sequences and 4E10 binding data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(IC\n50\n and K\nd\n) of selected\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconstrained analogs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nK\nd\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nStructure\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKGND\n\n\nKGWNWFDITNWGK-OH\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n102-1\n\n\nNWFDITNWLWKBKBK-\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n10\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 9)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n102-2\n\n\nKKBNWFDITNWLWKBKBK-\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n10\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 10)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n119  \n\n\nNWFDITNWLWYIKBKBKK-\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n10\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 75)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 74-2\n\n\n \nCWFO\nITNWLWKKKK-\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n230\n\n\n276\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 52)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n104-2\n\n\nNWF\nCITO\nWLWKKKK-\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 89)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“B” refers to the amino acid residue Aib (amino isobutyric acid). The underlined amino acids are in a cyclic conformation. Such a sequence containing C,O is a cyclic thioether.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe affinitiefs of the peptide analogs for 4E10 were also measured by surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a \nBiacore\n 2000 instrument (Uppsala, Sweden). Around 2,200 response units (RU) of Fab 4E10 were coated on CM5 chips. The carboxyl groups on the chip were activated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Fifty micrograms of Fab were diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5; a flow rate of 5 μl/min was used. Unreacted carboxyl groups were blocked with 1M ethanolamine at pH 8.5. The control was treated in the same fashion without any antibody present. Different amounts of free peptides were then passed over the surfaces at 30 or 50 μl/min for 2 min. Regeneration was done in HPS-EP buffer, 0.25 NaCl (Biacore) in 10 minutes. The amount of salt was increased compared to the commercial buffer to reduce the non-specific binding. For data evaluation, the BIAevaluation software was used. RI and Rmax were controlled, double referencing were done (0 concentration and start point). Analyses were performed to achieve the best curve fitting and small chi\n2 \n(<1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe K\nd \nvalues obtained from the Biacore analysis were in good agreement with the ELISA results and were all within a factor of 1.5-2.5 higher than the corresponding IC\n50 \nvalues as determined by ELISA (see Tables 5 and 6). The affinity-optimized native sequences, as well as several of the constrained peptides, all bind the 4E10 neutralizing antibody with affinities in the nanomolar range (\nK\n \n \n \nd \n20 nM). Their IC\n50\ns were determined by ELISA to be around 10 nM. The recurrence of 10 nM values in the ELISA of the tightest binding peptides to 4E10 could mean that a sensitivity limit might have been reached in the assay even though lower IC\n50s \ncould theoretically be measured. However, in the two examples chosen, peptides with an IC\n50 \nof 10 nM were confirmed via Biacore to have similar K\nds \n(18 and 17 nM for 94-1 and 104-2, respectively). Note than an IC\n50 \nof 0.25 μg/ml was determined for recombinant gp41 (residues 541-682 of HxB2; Viral Therapeutics, Inc., Ithaca, N.Y.), which, if it is assumed that gp41 has an average molecular weight of 25 kDa and is largely monomeric in solution, is equal to an IC\n50 \naround 10 nM. However, this value can differ substantially if gp41 is not monomeric in solution.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nNeutralization Assays of HIV by Peptides and Peptidomimetics\n\n\n \n \n \nTo further investigate the interaction of peptide analogs and 4E10, the inhibitory effect of the best analogs on neutralization by 4E10 was assessed. Neutralization assays were performed in two different formats. In the first, replication competent HIV-1\nSF162 \nwas assayed for neutralization using TZM-b1 cells as indicator cells (Wei, X., 2002). Alternatively, a pseudotype assay was used in which recombinant HIV-1\nJR-CSF \nvirions, competent for a single round of infection, were generated using the luciferase reporter plasmid pNL4-3.Luc.R-E-, as described previously (Connor, R. I., 1995; Zwick, M. B., 2003), and the pseudovirus assayed for neutralization using U87.CD4.CCR5 cells as target cells (Bjorndal, A., 1997). In all cases, the competitor peptide (NWFDITNWLWYIKKKK-NH\n2\n; SEQ ID NO: 8) and IgG 4E10 were pre-incubated for 30 minutes at 37° C. (60 μg/ml), then the mixture was added (1:1 by volume) to HIV-1, and the resulting mixture incubated for a further hour at 37° C. The mixture of peptide, 4E10, and HIV-1 was then added (1:1 by volume) to the target cells, and the assay developed using luciferase reagent (Promega) following 48-72 hour incubation at 37° C. The degree of virus neutralization was determined as a percentage reduction of viral infectivity against an Ab-free control. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice with similar results.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide 94-1, comprising the sequence NWFDITNWLWYIKKKK-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 8)produced the most favorable and reproducible inhibition of 4E10 neutralization in initial experiments. This peptide could block the neutralization of 4E10 of replication competent primary isolates, SF162 and JRCSF, at 30 μg/ml (\nFIG. 49\n). The peptide also blocks neutralization under conditions, in which normal sera was spiked with 4E10 (\nFIG. 50\n). Under similar conditions, this peptide does not block neutralization by polyclonal IgG from HIV-1 infected donors, or by the reference sera, FDA2 (\nFIG. 50\n). The results herein show that the peptide interacts with the 4E10 antibody, preventing it from interacting with (and neutralizing) the virus.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nStructural Basis of Enhanced Binding of Long and Helically-Constrained Peptide Epitopes of the Broadly Neutralizing HIV-1 Antibody 4E10\n\n\n \n \n \nPotent, broadly HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) may be invaluable for the design of an AIDS vaccine. 4E10 is the broadest HIV-1 nAB known to date and recognizes a contiguous and highly conserved helical epitope in the membrane-proximal region of gp41. The 4E10 epitope is thus an excellent target for vaccine design as it is also highly amenable to peptide engineering to enhance helical character, which should aid in eliciting 4E10-like Abs by vaccination. To investigate the structural effect of both increasing the peptide length and of introducing helix promoting constraints in the 4E10 epitope, the crystal structures of Fab $d10 bound to an optimized peptide epitope (NWFDITNWLWYIKKKK-NH\n2\n) (SEQ ID NO: 8), an Aib-constrained peptide epitope (NWFDITNAibLWRR-NH\n2\n) (SEQ ID NO: 34), and a thioether-linked peptide (NWF\nCITO\nWLWKKKK-NH\n2\n) (SEQ ID NO: 89) to resolutions of 1.7 Å, 2.1 Å and 2.2 Å, respectively, have been determined. The thioether-linked peptide is the first reported structure of a cyclic tethered helical peptide bound to an antibody. The introduced helix constraints limit the conformational flexibility of the peptides without affecting interactions with 4E10. The substantial increase in affinity (10 nM versus 10\n4 \nnM of the IC\n50 \nof the original KGND peptide template) is largely realized by 4E10 interaction with an additional helical turn at the C-terminus that includes Leu\n679 \nand Trp\n680\n, gp41 residues shown to contact CDRs H2 and H3 or 4E10. Thus, the core 4E10 epitope was extended and modified to a WFX(I/L)(T/S)XX(L/I)W motif, where X does not play a major role in 4E10 binding and can introduce constraints.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe development of a vaccine that will provide protection against exposure to HIV-1 is one of the today's most compelling medical challenges. Such a vaccine is likely to include a component that elicits broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 (Ferrantelli et al., 2002; Mascola et al., 2003; Burton et al., 2004). Some guidance as to the composition of this immunogen may be provided by the handful of broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (4E10, 2F5, 2G12 and b12) that have so far been isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals. These antibodies target conserved epitopes (Saphire et al., 2001; Calarese et al., 2003; Ofek et al., 2004; Cardoso et al., 2005) on gp120 (antibodies b12 and 2G12) or gp41 (antibodies 4E10 and 2F5), the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins responsible for mediating viral binding and entry into human cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4E10 is the most broadly HIV-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibody described to date with activity against isolates from all HIV-1 clades (Binley et al., 2004). The epitopes of 4E10 and 2F5 seem particularly promising vaccines leads since these anti-gp41 antibodies are very broadly neutralizing and their epitopes are highly conserved and contiguous. However, antibodies elicted against peptides encompassing the 2F5 epitope on gp41, which have been extensively explored, are typically non-neutralizing (Coeffier et al., 2000; Joyce et al., 2002). This lack of success may be a result of the failure of the peptides to adopt a conformation similar to the native epitope in the context of the virus. Thus, restricting the peptide epitope to adopt a specific ensemble of relevant conformations will increase the probability of eliciting effective neutralizing antibody in humans. Unfortunately, the peptide epitope for 2F5 adopts a largely extended conformation (Ofek et al., 2004), and mimicking such a structure may be difficult. On the other hand, the peptide epitope for 4E10 adopts a largely helical structure (Cardoso et al., 2005), which is much more amenable to peptide engineering by introducing structural constraints.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo engineer a synthetic immunogen capable of eliciting 4E10-like antibodies, a multi-step strategy was initiated. The first step was the characterization of the epitope and its essential features in atomic detail. Antibody 4E10 recognizes a contiguous epitope in the membrane-proximal, Trp-rich region of gp41 (Zwick et al., 2004) that seems to be critical for HIV-1 entry into human cells (Salzwedel et al., 1999; Munoz-Barroso et al., 1999). The three-dimensional structural of Fab 4E10, bound to a partial peptide epitope (named KGND; KGWNWFDITNWGK-NH\n2\n) (SEQ ID NO: 2) encompassing gp41 residues 670-678, revealed the epitope conformation and the atomic details of the antibody-epitope interaction (Cardoso et al., 2005). The bound peptide epitope adopts a helical conformation in which the key contact residues, Trp\nP672\n, Phe\nP673\n, Ile\nP675\n, and Thr\nP676\n, map to one face of the helix that is buried in an extremely hydrophobic antibody combining-site. The importance of additional flanking residues, especially at the C-terminus, has been proposed by mutagenesis studies (Zwick et al., 2005), structural modeling (Cardoso et al., 2005), and extensive analysis of various truncated peptides that encompass the 4E10 epitope (Brunel et al., 2006). The next step of the strategy focused on limiting the conformational diversity of the peptides by designing analogs that are constrained to adopt a helical conformation in solution similar to that of the peptide KGND bound to 4E10 (Brunel et al., 2006). Chemically constrained peptides have been designed to mimic helices involved in protein-protein interactions. For example, BH3 derived tethered helices directed at BCL-2 have been shown to be anti-apoptotic (Walensky et al., 2004) and nuclear eceptor co-activator helices have been shown to be potent estrogen antagonists (Leduc et al., 2003). Peptides derived from the native gp41 sequence are generally helical in PBS buffer and the presence of a helical conformation is generally associated with strong 4E10 binding (Brunel et al., 2006). To enhance helicity and reduce alternative peptide conformations, constraints were introduced to promote helical propensity through use of α-amino isobutyric acid (Aib), or through cross-linking side chains along one face of the helix with an i→i+3 thioether tether (Brunet et al., 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA critical element of gp41 immunogen design is to develop conformational constrained ligands that do not introduce binding interactions that are not present in the native gp41 target. As a result, crystallographic characterization of the constrained gp41 peptides to 4E10 is critical to guide the design of second-generation 4E10 immunogens. Although there are several examples of constrained peptides that have been structurally characterized in solution by NMR and CD, there have been few studies characterizing how these constrained helices bind their protein targets (Leduc et al., 2003). To investigate the structural effect of increasing the peptide length and helix-promoting constraints in the antibody-peptide interaction, the crystal structures of Fab 4E1-in complex with a longer (compared to peptide KGND) non-constrained peptide epitope (94-1; NWFDITNWLWYIKKKK-NH\n2\n) (SEQ ID NO: 8), an Aib-containing peptide (33-1; NWFDITN-Aib-LWRR-NH\n2\n) (SEQ ID NO: 34), and a thioether-linked peptide epitope (104-2; NWFc(CITO)WLWKKKK-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 89), where c(CITO) indicates the presence of a covalent bridge linking the side chains of cysteine and ornithine) were determined. The structure of the peptide 104-2 complex is the first known example of a cyclic tethered helical peptide bound to an antibody. Peptide 33-1 is the first reported structure of a helical Aib-containing peptide bound to an antibody. Structural analysis of the 94-1, 33-1 and 104-2 complexes allowed the extension and modification of the consensus motif required for 4E10 recognition and binding.\n\n\n \nPeptide Synthesis and Purification\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptides were synthesized manually using solid phase peptide methodooyg on an C-terminal amide yielding MBHA resin, using in-situ neutralization cycles for Boc-solid phase peptide synthesis (Schnolzer et al., 1992). Aib was activated using 0.15 mmol Boc-Aib-OH, 0.5 mmol TFFH and 0.7 mL DIEA in 1.5 mL DMF for 15 min, 25° C. The activated amino acid was added to the deprotected polypeptide resin without prior neutralization and coupled for 20 min. When necessary, double couplines were performed. Following chain assembly, the peptides 94-1 and 33-1 were cleaved from the resin with HF and 10% anisole for 1 h at 0° C. For peptide 104-2, following chain assembly, the Orn(Fmoc) residue was deprotected with piperidine and then bromoacetylated with bromoacetic anhydride. After side-chain deprotection and cleavage from the resin with HF, the peptide was precipitated and washed with ether. The thioether link was formed by adding \n6M guanidine HCl\n 100 nM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH 8.4 to the mixture of precipitated peptide and resin (<1 mg/mL) which was stirred at RT for 2 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides were purified by HPLC. Analytical reserved-phase HPLC was performed on a Rainin HPLC system equipped with a \nVydac C\n 18 column (10 μm, 1.0×15 cm, \nflow rate\n 1 mL/min). Preparative reversed-phase HPLC was performed on Waters 4000 HPLC system using Vydac C-18 columns (10 μm, 5.0×25 cm) and a Gilson UV detector. Linear gradients of acetonitrile in water/0.1% TFA were used to elute bound peptides. Peptides were characterized by electrospray ionization MS on an API-III triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Sciex, Thornhill, ON, CA). Peptide masses were calculated from the experimental mass to charge (m/z) ratios from all of the observed protonation states of a peptide by using MacSpec software (Sciex). All observed peptide masses agreed with the calculated average masses within 0.5 Da.\n\n\n \nPreparation of Complexes, Crystallization and Data Collection\n\n\n \n \n \nAntigen-binding fragment Fab 4E10 was obtained by papain digestion of the recombinant IgG1(κ) 4E10 as previous described (Cardoso et al., 2005). Peptides 94-1, 33-1, and 104-2 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 50 mg/ml. Crystals of Fab4E10 in complex with the peptide were obtained by co-crystallization after overnight incubation at 4° C. of peptide and Fab4310 in a molar ratio of 1:5 (protein:peptide). The best crystals of the complexes were grown at 22° C. by sitting drop vapor diffusion against 20% (w/v) PEG 3,350 in 0.2 M ammonium nitrate in the case of the 4E10:104-2 complex, 26% (w/v) PEG 8,000 in 0.2 M sodium acetate pH 5.6 and 0.2 M sodium thiocyanate for the rE10:94-1 complex, and 36% (w/v) MPEG, 5,000 in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.5 for the 4E10:33-1 complex. Prior to being cooled to cryogenic temperatures, the crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution of mother liquor containing 25% (v/v) glycerol. Data were collected on beamlines 11-1 (complex with peptide 94-1) and 9-2 (complex with peptide 104-2) at the Stanford Synchotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), and beamline 8.2.1 (complex with peptide 33-1).at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), using a liquid nitrogen cryostream maintained at 90 K. The data sets were processed using the HKL package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) and the CCP4 suite of programs (Collaborative \nComputational Project Number\n 4, 1994).\n\n\n \nStructure Determination and Refinement\n\n\n \n \n \nThe structure of Fab 4E10 as a complex with each peptide was determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe (Collaborative \nComputational Project Number\n 4, 1994) and Fab 4E10 (PDB entry 1TZG), without the bound peptide, as a probe. A non-crystallographic translation vector for the 4E10:33-1 complex was calculated from native Patterson maps using CCP4 (Collaborative \nComputational Project Number\n 4, 1994). The structures were refined in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). R\nfree \nwas calculated using a set of 5% randomly assigned reflections. Fab heavy and light chains were treated separately as rigid bodies for the initial refinement. The protein model was then refined using torsion angle simulated annealing at 5,000 K. Following these initial stages, the refinement proceeding through cycles of positional, temperature factor, and manual rebuilding in XFIT (McRee, 1999) into σ\nA\n-weighted 2F\no\n-F\nc \nand F\no\n-F\nc \nelectron density omit maps. The maximum likelihood target function, bulk solvent corrections and anisotropic temperature factor corrections were used for the refinement cycles in CNS. Density for each peptide was clearly interpretable after a few cycles of refinement and manual rebuilding of the starting Fab model. Tight non-crystallographic restraints were used early on in the refinement and released gradually toward the end of the refinement. Water molecules were added manually in XFIT. Stereochemical analysis of the refined structure was performed using PROCHECK (Collaborative \nComputational Project Number\n 4, 1994). Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 8.\n\n\n \nStructural Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nSuperpositions and root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) calculations were carried out suing the INSIGHT II package (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) for pairs of \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1, C\nL\n, V\nH\n, and V\nL \ndomains. Hydrogen bonds between Fab 4E10 and peptide were identified using HBPLUS (McDonald and Thornton, 1994) and van der Waals' contacts were assigned with CONTACTSYM (Sheriff et al., 1987). Buried surface areas were calculated using MS (Connolly, 1993) with a 1.7 Å probe radius and standard van der Waals radii. Secondary structure was assigned using PROMOTIF (Hutchinson and Thornton, 1996). Graphics were prepared using XFIT (McRee, 1999) (\nFIG. 53\n), RASTER3D (Merrit and Bacon, 1997) (\nFIG. 54\n), and PYMOL (DeLano, 2002) (\nFIGS. 54 and 55\n).\n\n\n \nBinding Affinity by ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nIC50s were determined by competitive ELISA using a constant concentration of biotinylated peptide and IgG with a variable concentration of gp41 peptides. Microwells were coated overnight at 4° C. with 50 μl PBS containing neutravidin (Pierce; 4 μg/ml). Wells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.05\n% Tween\n 20, and blocked with 4% non-fat dry milk (NFDM) in PBS for 45 min at 37° C. Meanwhile, a mixture of a biotinylated 4E10-peptide epitope, SLWNWFDITNWLWRRK(biotin)-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 88), (20 nM), IgG 4E10 (0.2 nM), and the competing peptide analogue (3-fold dilution series starting at 10 μM) in 0.4% NFDM, 0.02% Tween and PBS was incubated in a separate 96-well plate at 37° C. for 2 h. After washing the blocked plate, the mixture of 4E10, biotinylated peptide and competing peptide was added to the wells. After 20 min at room temperature, the wells were washed five times, and a 1:500 dilution of goat anti-human IgG F(ab′)\n2 \nHRP conjugate (Pierce) was added. Following incubation at RT for 40 min, the wells were washed five times, and developed by adding 50 μl of H\n2\nSO\n4 \n(2 M), and the O.D. at 450 nm was read on a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The concentration of competitor peptide corresponding to a half-maximal signal (IC50) was determined by interpolation of the resulting binding curve. Each peptide competitor was tested in duplicate in at least two separate experiments.\n\n\n \nBinding Affinity by Surface Plasmon Resonance\n\n\n \n \n \nSurface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a \nBiacore\n 2000 instrument (Uppsala, Sweden).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChip preparation: around 2,200 response units (RU) of Fab 4E10 were coated on CM5 chips. The carboxyl groups on the chip were activated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Fifty micrograms of Fab was diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5; a flow rate of 5 μl/min was used. Unreacted carboxyl groups were blocked with 1M ethanolamine at pH 8.5. The control was treated in the same fashion without any antibody present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperiment: different amounts of free peptides were then passed over the surfaces at 30 or 50 μl/min for 2 min. Regeneration was done in HPS-EP buffer, 0.25 NaCl (Biacore) in 10 min. The amount of salt was increased compared to the commercial buffer to reduce the non-specific binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData evaluation: the BIAevaluation software was used. RI and Rmax were controlled, double referencing were done (0 concentration and start point). Analyses were performed to achieve the best curve fitting and small chi\n2 \n(<1).\n\n\n \nStructure Determination and Refinement\n\n\n \n \n \nCrystal structures of Fab 4E10 in complex with a non-constrained peptide, an Aib-containing peptide, and a thioether-linked peptide (94-1, 33-1, and 104-2 respectively, Table 7) have been determined to resolutions of 1.76 Å (94-1), 2.1 Å (104-2), and 2.2 Å (33-1). Binding of Fab 4E10 and peptide was achieved by overnight incubation of 4° C. of the Fab with a 5-fold molar excess of peptide. Crystals of each complex grew after about one week. The structures were determined by molecular replacement using the previously determined Fab 4E10 structure (PDB entry 1TZG, Cardoso et al., 2005) as the initial model, and were then re-built and refined. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 8.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Amino acid sequence and 4E10 binding affinity for 4E10 peptide epitopes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide 104-2 has a covalent tether linking the side chains of cysteine \n\n\n\n\n\n\nand ornithine (O)a. Peptide 33-1 has an Aib (B)b, which replaces a Trp. Peptides  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n44-1 and 104-1 are the controls for peptides 33-1 and 104-2, respectively. Key \n\n\n\n\n\n\n residues for 4E10 binding are residues WF, IT and LW, helix-constraining residues  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nare B, C and O and the tether linked region is underlined. Only IC50 values \n\n\n\n\n\n\nwere measured for peptides KGND, 44-1, and 104-1 (\n \n \nSEQ ID NOS\n \n \n 8, 2, 90, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n19, 89 and 12 are disclosed respectively in order of appearance).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nK\nd\n (nM)\n\n\nk\non\n (M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)\n\n\nk\noff\n (s\n−1\n)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nSequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n   671        680\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 94-1\n\n\n 20\n\n\n6.91 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n13.8 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n 10\n\n\n   NWFDITNWLWYIKKKK-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKGND\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n>10,000    \n\n\nKGWNWFDITNWGK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 33-1\n\n\n302\n\n\n4.31 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n 130 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n100-400\n\n\n   NWFDITNBLWRR-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 44-1\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n600\n\n\n   NWFDITNWLWRR-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n104-2\n\n\n 17\n\n\n2.02 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n 3.4 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n 10\n\n\n   NWF\nCITO\nWLWKKKK-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n104-1\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n 40\n\n\n   NWFCITOWLWKKKK-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nTether in peptide 104-2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nb\nAib residue \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe final models contain Fab residues L1-L213, H1-H227 and peptide residues P671-P680 (33-1 and 104-2) or P671-P683 (94-1). Fab residues are numbered according to standard convention (Kabat 35 al., 1991) with light and heavy chain identifiers L and H, respectively.

Fab 4E10 adopts a very similar conformation in all studied complexes, as shown by the small rmsd (0.1 Å to 0.5 Å) for C\nα \nsuperposition of \npairs C\n \n \n \nH\n1, C\nL\n, V\nH\n, and V\nL \ndomains. The Fab has the canonical β-sandwich immunoglobulin fold with an average elbow angle of 168° (±3°) for the complexes with peptides 94-1, 104-2, and 33-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hydrophobic nature of the complementarity determining regions (CDR's) H2 (GVIPLLTITNYA) (SEQ ID NO: 91) and H3 (EGTTGWGWLGKPIGAFAH) (SEQ ID NO: 92) makes the 4E10 combining site considerably more hydrophobic than that of most antibodies, which facilitates 4E10 binding to its Trp-rich epitope on the membrane-proximal region of gp41. The hydrophobic tip of the CDR H3 (Gly\nH99\n, Trp\nH100\n, Gly\nH100A\n, Trp\nH100B\n, Leu\nH100C\n, Gly\nH100D\n) forms a surface resembling the “H3 foot” described for 2F5 (Ofek et al., 2004), another HIV neutralizing antibody that binds to a neighboring epitope within the membrane-proximal region of gp41. As only two of these H3 loop residues (Leu\nH100C \nand Gly\nH100D\n; Tables 9 and 10) contact the peptide epitope, the other hydrophobic residues are positioned such that they could interact with the adjacent viral membrane and/or other residues of gp41. Furthermore, the length and glycine-tryptophan-rich composition of the CDR H3 of 4E10 could be an important feature to facilitate interaction with the membrane-proximal epitope. Five Gly and two Trp residues are found within the 18 residues of the H3 loop. The Gly residues (Gly\nH96\n, Gly\nH100A\n, Gly\nH100D\n, and Gly\nH100H\n) may give the H3 loop sufficient conformational flexibility to access the membrane surface when bound to the gp41 epitope. High B values for residues at the tip of CDR H3 in all three complexes (94-1, 104-2, and 33-1) attests to the conformational flexibility of this H3 loop. The two Trp residues, located at the hydrophobic tip of the H3 loop (Trp\nH100 \nand Trp\nH100B\n), could enhance the interaction between 4E10 and HIV by interaction of their side chains with the viral membrane when its base encounters the gp41 epitope.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan der Waals contacts between Fab4E10 and bound peptides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\n94-1 Complex\n\n\n104-2 Complex\n\n\n33-1 Complex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsn\nP671\n \n\n\nTyr\nL91\n, Gly\nL92\n, Gln\nL93\n,\n\n\nLys\nL32\n, Gly\nL92\n, Gln\nL93\n,\n\n\nTyr\nL91\n, Gly\nL92\n, Gln\nL93\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer\nL94\n \n\n\nSer\nL94\n \n\n\nSer\nL94\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrp\nP672\n \n\n\nSer\nL94\n, Ala\nH33\n, Gly\nH50\n,\n\n\nSer\nL94\n, Ala\nH33\n, Ser\nH35\n,\n\n\nSer\nL94\n, Ala\nH33\n, Gly\nH50\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal\nH51\n, Ile\nH52\n, Ile\nH56\n, Asn\nH58\n \n\n\nGly\nH50\n, Val\nH51\n, Ile\nH52\n,\n\n\nVal\nH51\n, Ile\nH52\n, Ile\nH56\n, Thr\nH57\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIle\nH56\n, Asn\nH58\n \n\n\nAsn\nH58\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhe\nP673\n \n\n\nTyr\nL91\n, Gln\nL93\n, Ser\nL94\n,\n\n\nTyr\nL91\n, Gln\nL93\n, Ser\nL94\n,\n\n\nTyr\nL91\n, Gln\nL93\n, Ser\nL94\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer\nL96\n, Trp\nH47\n, Phe\nH100J\n \n\n\nSer\nL96\n, Trp\nH47\n, Phe\nH100J\n \n\n\nSer\nL96\n, Trp\nH47\n, Phe\nH100J\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nAsp\nP674\n/Cys\nP674\n \n\n\nLys\nL32\n \n\n\nLys\nL32\n \n\n\nLys\nL32\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIle\nP675\n \n\n\nIle\nH52\n, Leu\nH54\n, Ile\nH56\n \n\n\nIle\nH52\n, Leu\nH54\n, Ile\nH56\n \n\n\nIle\nH52\n, Leu\nH544\n, Ile\nH56\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThr\nP676\n \n\n\nThr\nH31\n, Tyr\nH32\n, Ala\nH33\n,\n\n\nThr\nH31\n, Tyr\nH32\n, Ala\nH33\n,\n\n\nThr\nH31\n, Tyr\nH32\n, Ala\nH33\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle\nH52\n, Glu\nH95\n, Pro\nH100F\n \n\n\nIle\nH52\n, Glu\nH95\n, Pro\nH100F\n \n\n\nIle\nH52\n, Glu\nH95\n, Pro\nH100F\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nAsn\nP677\n/Orn\nP677\n \n\n\nLys\nH100E\n, Pro\nH100F\n \n\n\nLys\nL32\n, Pro\nH100F\n \n\n\nLys\nH100E\n, Pro\nH100F\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeu\nP679\n \n\n\nIle\nH52\n, Leu\nH53\n, Leu\nH54\n \n\n\nThr\nH31\n, Leu\nH53\n, Leu\nH54\n \n\n\nThr\nH31\n, Leu\nH53\n, Leu\nH54\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrp\nP680\n \n\n\nGly\nH100D\n, Lys\nH100E\n, Pro\nH100F\n \n\n\nGly\nH100D\n, Lys\nH100E\n, Pro\nH100F\n \n\n\nGly\nH100D\n, Lys\nH100E\n, Pro\nH100F\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyr\nP681\n \n\n\nLys\nH100E\n \n\n\nn.a.\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nResidues P674 and P677 are cysteine and ornithine, respectively, in peptide 104-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrogen bonds and salt bridge interactions (Å) in Fab 4E10:peptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomplexes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n33-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide atom\n\n\nFab atom\n\n\n94-1 Complex\n\n\n104-2 Complex\n\n\nComplex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsn\nP671\n-N\nδ2\n \n\n\nTyr\nL91\n-O\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrp\nP672\n-N\n\n\nSer\nL94\n-O\nγ\n \n\n\n3.1\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrp\nP672\n-N\nε1\n \n\n\nIle\nH56\n-O\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThr\nP676\n-O\nγ1\n \n\n\nGlu\nH95\n-O\nε1\n \n\n\n3.3\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThr\nP676\n-O\nγ1\n \n\n\nGlu\nH95\n-O\nε2\n \n\n\n2.7\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nOrn\nP677\n-O\nγ1\n \n\n\nLys\nL32\n-N\nξ\n \n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n2.5\n\n\nn.a.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrp\nP680\n-N\nξ\n \n\n\nLeu\nH100C\n-O\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nResidue P677 is an ornithine only in peptide 104-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nStructure of the Peptide Epitope\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptides 94-1, 104-2, and 33-1 include more residues of the gp41 C-terminal region than the previously studied peptide KGND (Cardoso et al., 2005). At least one additional helical turn and residues Leu\nP679 \nand Trp\nP680 \nare included in all three new peptides (Table 7). Peptide 94-1 also encompasses Tyr\n681\n, Ile\n682\n, and Lys\n683\n, the gp41 residues believed to be immediately adjacent to the viral membrane. The extension of the 4E10 epitope included in the new peptides was based on mutagenesis results (Zwick et al., 2005), the 4E10 crystal structure with the KGND peptide (Cardoso et al., 2005), and binding studies of variable length peptides (Brunet al., 2006) that suggested the importance of these additional gp41 residues for 4E10 binding. The final four Lys (peptides 104-2 and 94-1) or two Arg (peptide 33-1) residues at the C-terminus of each peptide were included to increase peptide solubility in water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe helical conformation of the epitope is critical for 4E10 binding (Cardoso et al., 2005; Brunel et al., 2006). Peptides 104-2 and 33-1 were constrained to adopt an α-helical conformation using a thioether bridge and an Aib residue, respectively (Table 7 and \nFIG. 53\n). To achieve the thioether bridge in peptide 104-2, Asp\nP674 \nwas mutated to a Cys and Asn\nP677 \nwas changed to the unnatural amino acid Ornithine (\nFIG. 53B\n) (Brunel et al., 2006). The peptide 104-2:4 E10 complex is the first reported structure of the helical tethered side chain bound to an antibody. The Aib residue replaces Trp\nP678 \nin peptide 33-1 (\nFIG. 53C\n). The introduction of these constraints resulted in peptides with very similar conformation (rmsd below 0.2 Å for C\nα \nsuperposition of peptide pairs). This confirms the efficiency of the thioether bridge to enhance the helical character of a peptide (Brunel et al., 2006). The three peptides (94-1, 104-2, and 33-1) bind to 4E10 in virtually identical orientations (\nFIG. 54\n), with each peptide in an α-helical conformation from Ile\nP675 \nto Lys\nP683\n, preceded by a short 310 helix from Trp\nP672 \nto Asp\nP674 \n(Cys\nP674 \nin peptide 104-2). AsnP671, the N-terminal residue, is in an extended conformation. The membrane-proximal gp41 residues Tyr\n681\n, Ile\n682\n, and Lys\n683 \nare included only in the 94-1 peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide 104-2 superimposes onto the other peptides with a slightly different helical axis due to a different positioning of its C-terminal solubility tab (Lys\nP681\n-Lys\nP684\n) (\nFIG. 54\n). In addition, the side chain of Trp\nP678 \nhas a different rotamer in peptide 104-2 in comparison to peptide 94-1 (\nFIG. 54B\n). This rotamer change is associated with crystal contacts unique to the 104-2 and 33-1 structures, which were determined using crystals belonging to the same space group (Table 8). In the 104-2 structure, Trp\nP678 \nhas to adopt a different rotamer to avoid steric clashes with Leu\nH54 \nand Thr\nH55 \nof a molecule in another asymmetric unit. Interestingly, Trp\nP678 \npacks nicely against the tether of peptide 104-2 which would shield the backbone hydrogen bonds from solvent, potentially stabilizing the structure. These crystal contacts are also related to a rotamer change of Leu\nP679 \nin the 104-2 and 33-1 structures in comparison with the 94-1 structure. The rotamer change brings Leu\nP679 \ncloser to Thr\nH31 \nin the 104-2 and 33-1 structures and closer to Ile\nH52 \nin the 94-1 structure (Table 9). Both Trp\nP678 \nand Leu\nP679 \nhave clear electron density.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe helical conformation of the 4E10 epitope creates an amphipathic structure with a small polar face (defined by residues Asn\nP671\n, Asp\nP674\n, Asn\nP677\n, and Tyr\nP681\n) and a large hydrophobic face (Trp\nP672\n, Phe\nP673\n, Ile\nP675\n, Thr\nP\n676, Trp\nP678\n, Leu\nP679\n, Trp\nP680\n, and Ile\nP682\n) The epitope residues with the large number of contacts with antibody 4E10 are located on the hydrophobic face, suggesting that this is the “neutralizing face” of the epitope. The polar face of the epitope has crystal contacts with the H2 loop and the peptide molecule of the other antibody:epitope complex in the unit cell and, in the context of the virus, this “non-neutralizing face” for 4E10 could be involved in interactions with the viral membrane and/or other regions of gp41.\n\n\n \nThe Combining Site.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Fab 4E10 combining site is a largely hydrophobic cavity that is well adapted for binding of poorly water-soluble peptides. The surface area buried by the peptide on the Fab is 654 Å\n2\n, 654 Å\n2\n, and 610 Å\n2 \nfor peptides 94-1, 104-2, and 33-1, respectively. The corresponding buried surface area on the peptides is 625 Å\n2\n, 617 Å\n2\n, and 573 Å\n2\n. In all three antibody-peptide complexes, 4E10 uses five of its six CDR loops to bind the peptide; CDR L2 is not used and CDR L1 makes only minor contacts. This pattern of CDR preferential usage and the size of the buried surface area are typical for anti-peptide antibodies (Stanfield et al., 1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA total of 117, 128, and 129 van der Waal's contacts are made between Fab 4E10 and peptide 94-1, 104-2, and 33-1, respectively (Table 9). Furthermore, several hydrogen bonds are made between rE10 and each peptide (Table 10). In the 104-2 complex, an additional hydrogen bond is made between the O\nγ1 \nof Orn\nP677 \nand the side chain of Lys\nL32\n. However, antibody interactions with the key residues Trp\nP672\n, Phe\nP673\n, Ile\nP675\n, and Thr\nP676 \nare basically preserved in all of four known 4E10-peptide complexes. The side chains of Trp\nP672 \nand Phe\nP673 \nare buried in the antibody-combining site and are involved in aromatic π-stacking interactions with 4E10 residues Trp\nP672 \nhydrogen bond to Ser\nL94 \nand Ile\nH56\n, respectively (Table 10). The hydroxyl of Thr\nP676 \nhydrogen bonds to the carboxylate of Glu\nH95 \n(Table 10 and \nFIG. 55A\n) and Ile\nP675 \nstacks with CDR H2 residues Ile\nH52\n, Leu\nH54\n, and Ile\nH56 \n(Table 9 and \nFIG. 55C\n) to create a cluster of isoleucines/leucines on the edge of the antibody-combining site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody 4E10 binds with approximately 10\n3\n-fold higher affinity to peptides 94-1, 104-2, and 33-1 than to the original peptide KGND (Table 7), as determined by surface plasmon resonance and ELISA. This substantially increased affinity of 4E10 is likely due to the inclusion of appropriate flanking residues, such as Leu\nP679 \nand Trp\nP680\n, in the re-designated peptides. The indole of Trp\nP680 \nhydrogen bonds to the backbone of Leu\nH100C\n(Table 10 and \nFIG. 55C\n), as previously predicted (Cardoso et al., 2005), and the side chain of Leu\nP679 \nstacks with the side chains of Ile\nH52\n, Leu\nH53\n, and Leu\nH54\n, extending the cluster of isoleucines/leucines created by Ile\nP675\n, Ile\nH52\n, Leu\nH54\n, and Ile\nH56 \non the edge of the antibody-combining site (Table 9 and \nFIG. 55C\n). Antibody 4E10 binds to peptides 94-1 and 104-2 with about 17-fold higher affinity than to peptide 33-1 (Table 7). In the case of peptide 94-1, this increased affinity could be related to the unique contacts between Leu\nP679 \nand Ile\nH52\n, as well as the additional Tyr\nP681 \nand Lys\nH100E \ninteraction. In the case of peptide 104-2, the higher affinity in comparison to peptide 33-1 could be due to the hydrogen bond between Orn\nP677 \nand Lys\nL32\n, which is seen only in peptide 104-2 (Tables 55 and 56). In contrast, the extra methyl group of Aib in peptide 33-1 does not interact with the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConstraining the peptide increased the binding affinity of the peptide epitope for 4E10. Replacement of Trp\nP678 \nwith Aib increased in 3-fold the binding affinity of the peptide epitope 33-1 in comparison with its peptide control 44-1 (Table 7), as determined by ELISA. The tethered linkage in positions 674 and 677 resulted in a 4-fold increased affinity of the peptide epitope 104-2 in comparison with its peptide control 104-1 (Table 7). The on-rates of the two constrained peptides (33-1 and 104-2) are very similar (k″ values on Table 7), which is in agreement with similar peptide analogs previously characterized (Brunet et al., 2006). The difference in kd between peptides 104-2 and 33-1 (or 94-1) is due to a difference in k\noff \nvalues, which are related to a better stabilization of the complex antibody:peptide. In the case of peptide 104-2 this stabilization could be because the additional H bond between Orn\nP677 \nand Lys\nL32\n. The unconstrained peptide 94-1 presents faster on and off rates compared to 104-2, even though their K\nd \nvalues are similar. Constraining the peptide did not facilitate the formation of the complex with the antibody but it increased the stability of the complex once formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTyr\nP681\n, Ile\nP682\n, and Lys\nP683\n, the gp41 residues immediate prior to the transmembrane domain, do not have close contacts with 4E10. However, these residues extend the helix, which suggests the 4E10 epitope may form a continuous helix with the transmembrane domain. As observed in the 4E10:peptide 94-1 complex, only the O\nH \nand C\nξ2 \natoms of Tyr\nP681 \nhave a 3.9 and 4.2 van der Waals' interaction, respectively, with the Cd atom of Lys\nH100E\n, a residue located near the base of the antibody H3 loop. However, Tyr\nP681 \nand Ile\nP682 \nmake intra-peptide contacts that might have a structural role in maintaining the side chain orientation of epitope residues contacting the antibody (\nFIGS. 55B and 55C\n). Residue Tyr\nP681 \nstacks with Trp\nP680\n, a key epitope residue for 4E10 binding, and could help to stabilize the Trp\nP680 \nin an optimal conformation for interaction with the antibody (\nFIG. 55B\n). The side chain of Ile\nP682\n, which has no contacts with 4E10, packs with Leu\nP679 \nand Ile\nP675 \n(\nFIG. 55C\n) to expand the cluster of Ile/Leu at the edge of antibody combining site.\n\n\n \nExpansion of the Core Epitope\n\n\n \n \n \nThe structural analysis of the contributions made by each peptide residue to 4E10 binding reveals the key epitope residues. In the present Example, the crystal structures of 4E10 bound to longer peptides (encompassing region 671-683 of gp41) reveal that an additional helical turn including Leu\nP679 \nand Trp\nP680\n, in addition to the previously defined residues Trp\nP682\n, Phe\nP673\n, Ile\nP675\n, and Thr\nP676\n, make a significant number of selective contacts with 4E10 (\nFIG. 55\n, Tables 9 and 10). These findings complement and extend the results obtained from the previous 4E10 structure along with mutagenesis and binding experiments (Cardoso et al., 2005; Zwick et al., 2005; Brunel et al., 2006). Thus, the 4E10 core epitope has been extended to the contiguous motif WFX(I/L)(T/S)XX(L/I)W. Selective contacts with these key residues in a helical conformation dictate the high affinity for 4E10 for the epitope. Furthermore, the fact that the key epitope residues are very conserved in all HIV-1 viruses explains the broadly neutralizing activity of antibody 4E10. Trp\nP682\n, Ile\nP675\n, and Leu\nP679 \nare all highly conserved residues on gp41 from different HIV-1 subtypes. Phe\nP673 \nis replaced by Leu in only a few isolates. Thr\nP676 \ncan be replaced by a serine, which is found in many HIV isolates that are neutralized by 4E10. The tolerance of the 4E10 epitope to both Thr and Ser at the 676 position could be due to the maintenance of the hydrogen bond with CDR H3 residue Glu\nH95\n. Similarly, Trp\nP680 \nis occasionally replaced by Arg, which can maintain the hydrogen bond interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of Leu\nH100C\n, as previously observed for Lys\nP680 \nin the crystal structure of peptide KGND bound to 4E10.\n\n\n \nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\n\n \n \n \nElucidation of the critical features of 4E10 recognition of HIV-1 helps to define potential immunogens able to elicit 4E10-like antibodies. Antibody 4E10 recognizes a contiguous and helical WFX(I/L)(T/S)XX(L/I)W motif, where X does not play a major role in 4E10 contacts. Crystal structures of 4E10 bound to peptide epitopes (encompassing region 671-683 of gp41) reveal that the gp41 residues Trp\n682\n, Phe\n673\n, Ile\n675\n, Thr\n676\n, Leu\n679\n, and Trp\n680 \nhave the most significant contacts with the antibody. On the other hand, the “X” residues potentially can stabilize the helical structure in solution (Brunel et al., 2005) and can be used to introduce conformational constraints.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective immunogen needs to present a single, stable conformational epitope to the immune system. Although gp41 peptides based on the 4E10 epitope are helical in solution, these linear peptides could adopt numerous alternative conformations when bound to an antibody. As a result, simple linear peptides elicit non-neutralizing antibodies. In order to stabilize the helical conformation and also destabilize alternative conformations, peptidomimetic constraints were introduced at the non-interacting “X” positions of the eptiope. The first approach was to substitute Aib, an unnatural amino acid, at position 678 in the gp41 sequence. Aib residues have two methyl groups bound to the C\nα \natom, which restrict the backbone to the helical region of the Φ,Ψ dihedral angle map (Marshall et al., 1990) and can stabilize both 3\n10 \nand α-helices while extended conformations are destabilized. Aib-containing peptides bound to antibodies has been previously structurally characterized with the Aib residue in a constrained beta turn conformation (PDB entries 1AI1 and 1F58; Ghiara et al., 1997 and Stanfield et al., 1999). In this study, the structure of the 33-1:4 E10 complex shows that the bound Aib peptide has phi/psi angles in the α-helical region, nearly identical to the unconstrained peptide 94-1. In addition, the side chain residues contacting the antibody are nearly identical—the rmsd of superpositions between 33-1 and 94-1 is just 0.6 Å (superposition of the C\nβ \nof all peptide residues and the side chains of only residues contacting 4E10). Importantly, the Aib side chain makes no significant contacts with the antibody or other peptide side chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second approach was the lock the helix with a tether link between positions 674 and 677 in the 104-2 peptide. This 4E10 bound peptide epitope has the expected helical conformation and, similar to the Aib-containing peptide, the side chain residues contacting the antibody adopts rotamers nearly identical to the unconstrained peptide 94-1-the rmsd of backbone superpositions, including C\nβ \nof all residues and side chains of contacting residues, between 104-2 and 4-1 is only 0.7 Å. However, the tether link forms a hydrogen bond with the antibody (between the O\nγ1 \nof Orn\nP677 \nand the side chain of Lys\nL32\n) and Trp\nP678 \nhas a rotamer that packs against the tether. While extra interactions are usually desirable for drug design, they represent a “red flag” for immunogen design because they could elicit non-neutralizing antibodies to these new elements. Thus, this long tether link might not be the most appropriate constraint for the immunogen and perhaps a shorter tether loop will have a better fit. Furthermore, peptides encompassing the 4E10 epitope (down to the YIK motif) with an Aib replacing Asp\n674 \nas well as maybe Asn\n677 \nand/or Trp\n678 \nmay be part of the next generation of immunogens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDR H3 of 4E10 remains something of an enigma and a potential interaction of this CDR with the viral membrane is another source of considerations for the immunogen design. The CDR H3 of 4E10, as for antibody 2F5, has a large surface remaining that is not involved in antigen contact. A more typical situation has the CDR H3 in contact with antigen throughout most of its length (MacCallum et al., 1996). The length (18 residues), extensive area not contacting the epitope, hydrophobic character, and glycine-rich composition of the CDR H3 of 4E10 raises the possibility that the tip of the H3 loop, particularly Trp\nH100 \nand Trp\nH100B\n, has further interactions with the viral membrane or with other gp41 or gp120 residues, in the context of the intact virus. Biochemical analysis using envelope glycoprotein proteoliposomes suggests that 4E10 and 2F5 binding is enhanced in the presence of a lipid membrane (Ofek et al., 2004). Mutagenesis studies of the H3 loop of the 4E10 are ongoing to test the importance of the CDR H3 for 4E10 binding to gp41 and virus neutralization. Presentation of the 4E10 epitope as an oligomer and/or in a membrane-like context should be further evaluated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo develop an effective immunogen to elicit 4E10-like antibodies, a multi-step strategy was adopted. Initially, the extension and properties of the 4E10 minimal epitope (the contiguous and helical WFX(I/L)(T/S)XX(L/I)W motif were identified and characterized atomic detail. A 10\n3\n-fold increase in binding affinity was achieved by 4E10 interaction with an additional helical turn at the C-terminus that includes Leu\n679 \nand Trp\n680\n, gp41 residues shown to contact CDRs H2 and H3 of 4E10. Next, constraints were introduced towards the C-terminal of the epitope to increase the helical character in this region of the peptide. Constrained peptides are better immunogen candidates as they cannot adopt some conformations which would only elicit non-neutralizing antibodies. Introduction of Aib in position 678 of the peptide epitope or a tether bridge between residues 674 and 677 resulted in a 3\n10 \nhelix (residues WF) followed by an α-helix (residues (I/L)(T/S)XX(L/I)W) structure, which is also observed for the non-contrained peptide epitope. While the Aib side chain makes no additional contacts with the antibody, the tether link has undesirable extra interactions with 4E10, which could contribute to elicitation of non-neutralizing antibodies. The next generation of immunogens will have dispensable constituents of the 4E10 epitope replaced with less immunogenic substituents to mask the “non-neutralizing face” without perturbing the contrained helical conformation. This step will pursue presentation of only the face of the helix contacting 4E10 to the immune system. Additionally, a helical presentation of the core 4E10 epitope in a membrane-like context, for instance liposomes, may have a major impact on the design of a vaccine candidate to elicit 4E10-like antibodies.\n\n\n \nAccession Numbers\n\n\n \n \n \nCoordinates and structure factors for Fab 4E10 bound to peptides 94-1, 33-1 and 104-2 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 2FX7, 2FX8, and 2FX9, respectively.\n\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nU.S. Pat.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides heterospecific polypeptide constructs comprising one or more single domain antibodies, said constructs having improved stability \nin vivo\n and their use in diagnosis and therapy.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPolypeptide therapeutics and in particular antibody-based therapeutics have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity. However, in order to be effective as therapeutic agent, their pharmacokinetic profile should be optimized. The majority of current antibody applications are for acute disorders. There are however significant opportunities to develop antibody therapeutics for chronic conditions. This will require large doses of protein over a long period of time. Since the cost of antibody production in mammalian cells is high, the development of traditional antibody therapeutics for these applications has been discouraged. An alternative approach has been to express fragments of antibodies such as Fab's or single-chain Fv's in microbial expression systems such as yeast and bacteria. These fragments however have very short circulation times \nin vivo.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the initial approaches to increase the circulation in the bloodstream of proteins and peptides were based on chemical modification, such as pegylation (\n \nUS 4,179,337\n \n). Examples of such products are PEG-intron, i.e. pegyiated interferon alpha-2b for the treatment of HCV, and treatment of chronic disorder with PEG-modified antibodies (\nA.P Chapman, Adv.Drug Delivery Reviews (2002), 54, 531-545\n). Such chemical methods, however, suffer from a number of disadvantages, such as inactivation of the target protein or peptide due to the chemical modification of certain amino acid side chains, instability of the target protein/peptide during the chemical reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo overcome these limitations, alternative approaches have been developed, first of all by using non-conventional or modified proteins, secondly by using alternative methods to increase half-ilfe \nin vivo,\n Stabilisation of the protein drug can therefore be carried out by choosing an inherently stable protein scaffold and providing methods to bind such scaffold to plasma proteins which occur in high concentrations, such as immunoglobulins or albumin. Binding to plasma protein can be an effective means to improving the pharmacokinetic properties of molecules in general. More precisely, binding to albumin to improve the half-life of proteins has been described: \nM.S. Dennis et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 33, 2383-90, 2002\n) isolated peptides having affinity for serum albumin. When bound to a Fab molecule, half-lives comparable to pegyiated Fab's were obtained. Peptide ligands having affinity for IgG or serum albumin have been disclosed (\n \nWO 01/45746\n \n). Cemu Bioteknik (Nygren, Wigzell, Uhlen, \n \nEP 486525 B1\n \n; \n \nUS 6,267,964\n \n) described fusions of active proteins or peptides to polypeptides from bacterial origin that bind to serum albumin (e.g. Staph A). The drawback of these peptide-based approaches is that the peptides have to fold properly and be accessible to binding to serum albumin when fused to the therapeutic protein. Therefore, these peptides are inherently unstable and have affinities in the submicromolar range rather than subnanomolar or low nanmolar range, as is the case with conventional antibodies. As part of a larger protein, such as a conventional antibody molecule, binding of these peptides to albumin may be sterically hindered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative hybrid molecule with two functional units is based on a heterospecific antibody. Such a hybrid would consist of a bifunctional or heterospecific antibody construct with one entity having specificity and affinity for the target, the second entity having specificity and affinity for a serum protein, such as albumin. However, such heterospecific constructs based on conventional antibodies or Fab fragments have several important drawbacks: these are complex, large molecules composed of two polypeptide chains (VH and VL) and therefore difficult and expensive to produce in high amounts in mammalian expression systems. Furthermore, producing bifunctional antibodies composed of 4 chains (2 VH's and 2 VL's) have the inherent risk of resulting in molecules with the unproductive VH-VL combinations and consequent loss of activity. Several alternatives have been tried with mixed results based on peptide derivatives of conventional antibodies, such as diabodies and bifunctional scFv's (\n \nWO0220615\n \n; \n \nWO9413804\n \n; \n \nWO9119739\n \n; \n \nWO9409131\n \n) .\nHolliger et al (Nature Biotech. 15, 632-636, 1979\n) suggests that binding one of the antibody fragments of a diabody (bispecific construct derived from a conventional antibody) to serum immunoglobulin (IgG) may prolong serum residence time of such diabodies but no suggestion is made that bispecific diabodies may be stabilised using antibodies against a serum protein other than serum IgG. Diabodies are known to be inherently difficult to produce due to stickiness of their exposed surface and due to non-productive associations between the four different V-regions (2 VH+2 VL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCovalent binding to serum proteins as disclosed in, for example, \n \nEP0793506B1\n \n, \n \nUS 5,612,034\n \n, \n \n6,103,233\n \n, and \n \nUS20020009441\n \n using reactive groups forming stable covalent bonds to a serum protein or a cell have the inherent disadvantage of unwanted target modification through the reactive groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusions to large, long lived proteins such as albumin (\nSyed et al, Blood 89, 3243-3252 (1997\n), \nYen et al, PNAS 89, 1904-1908 (1992\n); Celltech (\n \nWO0027435\n \n)) or N-terminal fusions of albumin polypeptides (Delta Biotech/HGS, \n \nUS 5,380,712\n \n, \n \nUS 5,766,883\n \n) or the Fc portion of IgG (\nCapon et al, Nature 337, 525-531(1989\n); \nAshkenazi et al, Curr. Op.Immunol. 9, 195-200 (1997\n)) have been described. Such fusions have the disadvantage of inefficient production and causing unwanted immunological reactions .\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA complex of interferon with a monoclonal antibody to increase the serum half-life of interferon has been described in \n \nUS 5,055,289\n \n. Such approach has the inherent risk of impairing the biological activity of the interferon since the size of the construct raises the problem of steric hindrance.\n\n\n \n\n\nTHE AIMS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is an aim of the present invention to provide therapeutic heterospecific antibody polypeptide constructs which overcome the problems of therapeutic antibodies of the art namely, low half-life \nin vivo\n, poor folding, low expression, and poor stability, it is a further aim of the present invention to provide methods for providing said heterospecific antibodies

Examples include, but are not limited to, heavy chain antibodies, antibodies naturally devoid of light chains, single domain antibodies derived from conventional 4-chain antibodies, engineered antibodies and single domain scaffolds other than those derived from antibodies. Single domain antibodies may be any of the art, or any future single domain antibodies. Single domain antibodies may be derived from any species including, but not limited to mouse, human, camel, llama, goat, rabbit, bovine. According to one aspect of the invention, a single domain antibody as used herein is a naturally occurring single domain antibody known as heavy chain antibody devoid of light chains. Such single domain antibodies are disclosed in \n \nWO 9404678\n \n for example. For clarity reasons, this variable domain derived from a heavy chain antibody naturally devoid of light chain is known herein as a VHH or nanobody to distinguish it from the conventional VH of four chain immunoglobulins. Such a VHH molecule can be derived from antibodies raised in \nCamelidae\n species, for example in camel, dromedary, alpaca and guanaco. Other species besides \nCamelidae\n may produce heavy chain antibodies naturally devoid of light chain; such VHHs are within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe one or more single domain antibodies of the polypeptide construct which are directed against a target may be of the same sequence. Alternatively they may not all have the same sequence. It is within the scope of the invention that a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprises anti-target single domain antibodies which do not all share the same sequence, but which are directed against the same target, or fragment thereof, one or more antigens thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention there are provided methods for the utilization of a plurality of anti-target and /or anti-serum protein single domain antibodies to increase the avidity and/or affinity of the heterospecific molecule. In this manner, serum half-lives of molecules modified in accordance with the invention can be extended. Such modification will modify and/or extend the therapeutic window of a specific therapeutic molecule, This flexibility cannot be achieved with alternative methods in the art, such as when using peptides with specificity to serum proteins, diabodies which are difficult to produce in a multivalent form, chemical modifications (such as pegylation, acyiation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe one or more single domain antibodies of the polypeptide construct which are directed against a serum protein may be of the same sequence. Alternatively they may not all have the same sequence. It is within the scope of the invention that a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprises anti-serum protein single domain antibodies which do not all share the same sequence, but which are directed against serum protein, or fragment thereof, one or more antigens thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, one or more anti-target single domain antibodies of the polypeptide construct may be directed to more than one target (\ne.g\n. vWF and collagen). Similarly, the anti-serum protein single domain antibodies of the polypeptide construct may be directed against more than one serum protein (\ne.g\n, serum albumin and fibrinogen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVHHs, according to the present invention, and as known to the skilled addressee are heavy chain variable domains derived from immunoglobulins naturally devoid of light chains such as those derived from \nCamelids\n as described in \n \nWO9404678\n \n (and referred to hereinafter as VHH domains or nanobodies). VHH molecules are about 10x smaller than IgG molecules. They are single polypeptides and very stable, resisting extreme pH and temperature conditions. Moreover, they are resistant to the action of proteases which is not the case for conventional antibodies. Furthermore, \nin vitro\n expression of VHHs produces high yield, properly folded functional VHHs. In addition, antibodies generated in \nCamelids\n will recognize epitopes other than those recognised by antibodies generated \nin vitro\n through the use of antibody libraries or via immunisation of mammals other than \nCamelids\n (\n \nWO 9749805\n \n). As such, anti-albumin VHH's may interact in a more efficient way with serum albumin which is known to be a carrier protein. As a carrier protein some of the epitopes of serum albumin may be inaccessible by bound proteins, peptides and small chemical compounds. Since VHH's are known to bind into 'unusual' or non-conventional epitopes such as cavities (\n \nWO9749805\n \n), the affinity of such VHH's to circulating albumin may be increased.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to the finding that a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more VHHs directed against one or more serum proteins of a subject, and one or more VHHs directed against one or more target molecule of said subject surprisingly has significantly prolonged half-life in the circulation of said subject compared with the half-life of the anti-target VHH when not part of said construct. Furthermore, such prolonged half-life is in the range of several days due to the high affinity anti-serum albumin VHH's compared to several hours when using low affinity peptides specific for albumin (Dennis et al, JBC, 277, 35035). The extension of the half-life is demonstrated by the inventors herein, for example, in Example 16, and by the polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NO: 5. Furthermore, the said construct was found to exhibit the same favourable properties of VHHs such as high stability remaining intact in mice for at least 19 days (Example 16), extreme pH resistance, high temperature stability and high target affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA target according to the invention is any biological substance capable of binding to a heterospecific polypeptide construct of the invention. Targets may be, for example, proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, oligonucleic acids, saccharides, polysaccharides, glycoproteins. Examples include, but are not limited to therapeutic targets, diagnostic targets, receptors, receptor ligands, viral coat proteins, immune system proteins, hormones, enzymes, antigens, cell signaling proteins, or a fragment thereof. Targets may be native protein or a fragment thereof, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, or a functional portion of an homologous sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe properties of single domain antibodies, in particular VHHs, compare favourably with those of antibodies derived from sources such as mouse, sheep, goat, rabbit etc. (\ni.e.\n traditional antibodies), and humanised derivatives thereof. Traditional antibodies are not stable at room temperature, and have to be refrigerated for preparation and storage, requiring necessary refrigerated laboratory equipment, storage and transport, which contribute towards time and expense. Refrigeration is sometimes not feasible in developing countries. Furthermore, the manufacture or small-scale production of said antibodies is expensive because the mammalian cellular systems necessary for the expression of intact and active antibodies require high levels of support in terms of time and equipment, and yields are very low. Furthermore, traditional antibodies have a binding activity which depends upon pH, and hence are unsuitable for use in environments outside the usual physiological pH range such as, for example, in treating gastric bleeding, gastric surgery. Furthermore, traditional antibodies are unstable at low or high pH and hence are not suitable for oral administration. However, it has been demonstrated that VHHs resist harsh conditions, such as extreme pH, denaturing reagents and high temperatures (\nEwert S et al, Biochemistry 2002 Mar 19;41(11):3628-36\n), so making them suitable for delivery by oral administration. Furthermore, traditional antibodies have a binding activity which depends upon temperature, and hence are unsuitable for use in assays or kits performed at temperatures outside biologically active-temperature ranges (\ne.g.\n 37 ± 20°C).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore VHHs are more soluble, meaning they may be stored and/or administered in higher concentrations compared with conventional antibodies. The polypeptides of the present invention also retain binding activity at a pH and temperature outside those of usual physiological ranges, which means they may be useful in situations of extreme pH and temperature which require a modulation of platelet-mediated aggregation, such as in gastric surgery, control of gastric bleeding, assays performed at room temperature etc. The polypeptides of the present invention also exhibit a prolonged stability at extremes of pH, meaning they would be suitable for delivery by oral administration. The polypeptides of the present invention may be cost-effectively produced through fermentation in convenient recombinant host organisms such as \nEscherichia coli\n and yeast; unlike conventional antibodies which also require expensive mammalian cell culture facilities, achievable levels of expression are high. Examples of yields of the polypeptides of the present invention are 1 to 10 mg/ml (\nE. coli\n) and up to 1g/l (yeast). The polypeptides of the present invention also exhibit high binding affinity for a broad range of different antigen types, and ability to bind to epitopes not recognised by conventional antibodies; for example they display long CDR-based loop structures with the potential to penetrate into cavities and exhibit enzyme function inhibition. Furthermore, since binding often occurs through the CDR3 loop only, it is envisaged that peptides derived from CDR3 could be used therapeutically (\nDesmyter et al., J Biol Chem, 2001, 276: 26285-90\n). The polypeptides of the invention are also able to retain full binding capacity as fusion protein with an enzyme or toxin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more VHHs each directed against one or more serum proteins of a subject, and one or more VHH each directed against one or more target molecules wherein the VHHs belong to the traditional class of \nCamelidae\n single domain heavy chain antibodies. The present invention also relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more VHH each directed against one or more serums protein of a subject, and one or more VHH each directed against one or more target molecules wherein the VHHs belong to a class of \nCamelidae\n single domain heavy chain antibodies that have human-like sequences. A VHH sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 12 which binds to TNF-alpha and a second VHH which binds to mouse albumin, belongs to this class of VHH peptides. As such, peptides belonging to this class show a high amino acid sequence homology to human VH framework regions and said peptides might be administered to patients directly without expectation of an unwanted immune response therefrom, and without the burden of further humanization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA human-like class of \nCamelidae\n single domain antibodies represented by SEQ ID No. 1, 3 and 4 have been described in \n \nWO03035694\n \n and contain the hydrophobic FR2 residues typically found in conventional antibodies of human origin or from other species, but compensating this loss in hydrophilicity by other substitutions at position 103 that substitutes the conserved tryptophan residue present in VH from double-chain antibodies. As such, peptides belonging to these two classes show a high amino acid sequence homology to human VH framework regions and said peptides might be administered to a human directly without expectation of an unwanted immune response therefrom, and without the burden of further humanisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, one aspect of the present invention allows for the direct administration of an anti-serum albumin polypeptide, wherein the single domain antibodies belong to the humanized class of VHH, and comprise a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3 or 4 to a patient in need of the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA subject as used herein is any mammal having a circulatory system in which the fluid therein comprises serum proteins. Examples of circulatoy system include blood and lymphatic systems. Examples of animals include, but are not limited to, rabbits, humans, goats, mice, rats, cows, calves, camels, llamas, monkeys, donkeys, guinea pigs, chickens, sheep, dogs, cats, horses etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising at least one single domain antibody directed against a therapeutic and/or diagnostic target, and at least one single domain antibodies each directed against one or more serum proteins or polypeptides. As already mentioned, the anti-target single domain antibodies may have the same sequence. Alternatively, at least two anti-target single domain antibodies may have the different sequences, but are directed against the same epitope or different epitopes on the same target, fragments thereof, or antigen thereof. Similarly, the anti-serum protein single domain antibodies may have the same sequence. Alternatively, at least two anti-serum protein single domain antibodies may have the different sequences, but are directed against the same epitope or different epitopes on the same serum protein, fragments thereof, or antigen thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, where more than one anti-target single domain antibodies is present in the heterospecific polypeptide construct, each anti-target single domain antibody may be directed to a different target (\ne.g.\n one to vWF and one to collagen). Similarly, where more than one anti-serum protein single domain antibody is present, each anti-serum single domain antibody may be directed to a different serum protein (\ne.g.\n one to serum albumin and one to fibrinogen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the invention, is a heterospecific polypeptide, wherein an anti-serum protein single domain antibody corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs:1 to 4 and 28 to 40.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe constructs disclosed herein retain the advantageous properties of single domain antibodies (\ne.g\n. VHHs) and have a prolonged lifetime in the circulation of an individual. Thus, such constructs are able to circulate in the subject's serum for several days, reducing the frequency of treatment, the inconvenience to the subject and resulting in a decreased cost of treatment. Furthermore, it is an aspect of the invention that the half-life of the heterospecific polypeptide constructs may be controlled by the number of anti-serum protein single domain antibodies present in the construct. A controllable half-life is desirable in several circumstances, for example, in the application of a timed dose of a therapeutic heterospecific polypeptide construct, or to obtain a desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to an aspect of the invention a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a homologous sequence of a full-length heterospecific polypeptide construct. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a full-length heterospecific polypeptide construct. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a homologous sequence of a full-length heterospecific polypeptide construct. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a homologous sequence of a full-length heterospecific polypeptide construct. According to an aspect of the invention a heterospecific polypeptide construct may comprise a sequence of a heterospecific polypeptide construct.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to an aspect of the invention a single domain antibody used to form a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a complete single domain antibody (e.g. a VHH) or a homologous sequence thereof. According to another aspect of the invention, a single domain antibody used to form the heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a complete single domain antibody. According to another aspect of the invention, a single domain antibody used to form the heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a homologous sequence of a complete single domain antibody. According to another aspect of the invention, a single domain antibody used to form the heterospecifiic polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a homologous sequence of a complete single domain antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect of the invention a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be an homologous sequence of the parent sequence. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion parent sequence. According to another aspect of the invention, a heterospecific polypeptide construct may be a functional portion of a homologous sequence of the parent sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an homologous sequence of the present invention may comprise additions, deletions or substitutions of one or more amino acids, which do not substantially alter the functional characteristics of the polypeptides of the invention. The number of amino acid deletions or substitutions is preferably up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64,65, 66, 67, 68, 69 or 70 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA homologous sequence of the present invention may include a single domain antibody of the invention which has been humanised.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy humanised is meant mutated so that immunogenicity upon administration in human patients is minor or nonexistent. Humanising a single domain antibody, according to the present invention, comprises a step of replacing one or more of amino acids by their human counterpart as found in the human consensus sequence, without that polypeptide losing its typical character, \ni.e.\n the humanisation does not significantly affect the antigen binding capacity of the resulting polypeptide. Such methods are known by the skilled addressee. A humanisation technique applied to \nCamelidae\n VHHs may also be performed by a method comprising the replacement of any of the following residues either alone or in combination: some VHH contain typical \nCamelidae\n hallmark residues at position 37, 44, 45 and 47 with hydrophilic characteristics. Replacement of the hydrophilic residues by human hydrophobic residues at positions 44 and 45 (E44G and R45L) did not have an effect on binding and/or inhibition. Further humanization may be required by substitution of residues in \nFR\n 1 , such as \n \nposition\n \n 1, 5, 28 and 30; FR3, such as positions 74, 75, 76, 83, 84, 93 and 94; and FR4, such as position 103, 104,108 and 111 (all numbering according to the Kabat).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a method for humanizing a VHH comprising the steps of replacing of any of the following residues either alone or in combination:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFR1 position\n \n 1, 5, 28 and 30,\n \nthe hallmark amino acid at position 44 and 45 in FR2,\n \nFR3 residues 74, 75, 76, 83, 84, 93 and 94 ,\n \nand positions 103, 104, 108 and 111 in FR4;\n \n\n(numbering according to the Kabat numbering).\n    \n \n \n \nSome \nCamelidae\n VHH sequences display a high sequence homology to human VH framework regions and therefore said VHH might be administered to patients directly without expectation of an immune response therefrom, and without the additional burden of humanisation. Therefore, one aspect of the present invention allows for the formation of a heterospecific polypeptide construct without humanisation of the VHH, when said VHH exhibit high homology to human VH framework regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA homologous sequence of the present invention may be a sequence of the invention derived from another species such as, for example, camel, llama, dromedary, alpaca, guanaco etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere homologous sequence indicates sequence identity, it means a sequence which presents a high sequence identity (more than 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 98% sequence identity) with a single domain antibody of the invention, and is preferably characterised by similar properties of the parent sequence, namely affinity, said identity calculated using known methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA homologous sequence according to the present invention may refer to nucleotide sequences of more than 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800 or 1000 nucleotides able to hybridise to the reverse-complement of the nucleotide sequence capable of encoding a native sequence under stringent hybridisation conditions (such as the ones described by \nSAMBROOK et al., Molecular Cloning, Laboratory Manuel, Cold Spring, Harbor Laboratory press, New York\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a functional portion refers to a single domain antibody of sufficient length such that the interaction of interest is maintained with affinity of 1 x 10\n-6\n M or better.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively a functional portion of a single domain antibody of the invention comprises a partial deletion of the complete amino acid sequence and still maintains the binding site(s) and protein domain(s) necessary for the binding of and interaction with the target or serum protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a functional portion of a single domain antibody of the invention refers to less than 100% of the sequence (e.g., 99%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, etc.), but comprising 5 or more amino acids or 15 or more nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA portion of a single domain antibody of the invention refers to less than 100% of the sequence (\ne.g.\n, 99%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, etc.), but comprising 5 or more amino acids or 15 or more nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTargets as mentioned herein such as TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma receptor, serum proteins (e.g. serum albumin, serum immunoglobulins, thyroxine-binding protein, transferrin, fibrinogen) and IFN-gamma may be fragments of said targets. Thus a target is also a fragment of said target, capable of eliciting an immune response. A target is also a fragment of said target, capable of binding to a single domain antibody raised against the full length target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fragment as used herein refers to less than 100% of the sequence (e.g., 99%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% etc.), but comprising 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or more amino acids. A fragment is of sufficient length such that the interaction of interest is maintained with affinity of 1 x 10\n-6\n M or better.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fragment as used herein also refers to optional insertions, deletions and substitutions of one or more amino acids which do not substantial alter the ability of the target to bind to a single domain antibody raised against the wild-type target. The number of amino acid insertions deletions or substitutions is preferably up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 or 70 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe serum protein may be any suitable protein found in the serum of subject, or fragment thereof. In one aspect of the invention, the serum protein is serum albumin, serum immunoglobulins, thyroxine-binding protein, transferrin, or fibrinogen. Depending on the intended use such as the required half-life for effective treatment and/or compartimentalisation of the target antigen, the VHH-partner can be directed to one of the above serum proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA single domain antibody directed against a target means single domain antibody that it is capable of binding to its target with an affinity of better than 10\n-6\n M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heterospecific polypeptide constructs disclosed herein may be made by the skilled artisan according to methods known in the art or any future method. For example, VHHs may be obtained using methods known in the art such as by immunising a camel and obtaining hybridomas therefrom, or by cloning a library of single domain antibodies using molecular biology techniques known in the art and subsequent selection by using phage display.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-serum protein single domain antibody may be directed against a polypeptide of a serum protein or a whole protein. The anti-target single domain antibody may be directed against a polypeptide of said target of the whole target. Methods for scanning a protein for immunogenic polypeptides are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe single domain antibodies may be joined using methods known in the art or any future method. For example, they may be fused by chemical cross-linking by reacting amino acid residues with an organic derivatising agent such as described by \nBlattler et al, \n; \n \nEP294703\n \n. Alternatively, the single domain antibody may be fused genetically at the DNA level \ni.e\n. a polynucleotide construct formed which encodes the complete polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies and one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies. A method for producing bivalent or multivalent VHH polypeptide constructs is disclosed in \n \nPCT patent application WO 96/34103\n \n. One way of joining multiple single domain antibodies is via the genetic route by linking single domain antibody coding sequences either directly or \nvia\n a peptide linker. For example, the C-terminal end of the first single domain antibody may be finked to the N-terminal end of the next single domain antibody. This linking mode can be extended in order to link additional single domain antibodies for the construction and production of tri-, tetra-, etc. functional constructs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the present invention is the administration of heterospecific polypeptide constructs according to the invention which avoids the need for injection. Conventional antibody-based therapeutics have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity, however, they have one important drawback: these are complex, large molecules and therefore relatively unstable, and they are sensitive to breakdown by proteases. This means that conventional antibody drugs cannot be administered orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation because they are not resistant to the low pH at these sites, the action of proteases at these sites and in the blood and/or because of their large size. They have to be administered by injection (intravenously, subcutaneously, etc.) to overcome some of these problems. Administration by injection requires specialist training in order to use a hypodermic syringe or needle correctly and safely. It further requires sterile equipment, a liquid formulation of the therapeutic polypeptide, vial packing of said polypeptide in a sterile and stable form and, of the subject, a suitable site for entry of the needle, Furthermore, subjects commonly experience physical and psychological stress prior to and upon receiving an injection. An aspect of the present invention overcomes these problems of the prior art, by providing the heterospecific polypeptides constructs of the present invention. Said constructs are sufficiently small, resistant and stable to be delivered orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation substantial without loss of activity. The heterospecific polypeptides constructs of the present invention avoid the need for injections, are not only cost/time savings, but are also more convenient and more comfortable for the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising at least one single domain antibody directed against a target for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound that is able pass through the gastric environment without being inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs known by persons skilled in the art, once in possession of said polypeptide construct, formulation technology may be applied to release a maximum amount of VHHs in the right location (in the stomach, in the colon, etc.). This method of delivery is important for treating, prevent and/or alleviate the symptoms of disorder whose targets that are located in the gut system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder susceptible to modulation by a therapeutic compound that is able pass through the gastric environment without being inactivated, by orally administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies specific for antigen related to the disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein for the preparation of a medicament for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound that is able pass through the gastric environment without being inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the gut system without being inactivated, by orally administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the bloodstream of a subject without being inactivated, by orally administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising at least one single domain antibody directed against a target herein for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound delivered to the vaginal and/or rectal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a non-limiting example, a formulation according to the invention comprises a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein comprising one or more VHHs directed against one or more targets in the form of a gel, cream, suppository, film, or in the form of a sponge or as a vaginal ring that slowly releases the active ingredient over time (such formulations are described in \n \nEP 707473\n \n, \n \nEP 684814\n \n, \n \nUS 5629001\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by a therapeutic compound to the vaginal and/or rectal tract, by vaginally and/or rectally administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies specific for antigen related to the disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein for the preparation of a medicament for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound delivered to the vaginal and/or rectal tract without being inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the vaginal and/or rectal tract without being inactivated, by administering to the vaginal and/or rectal tract of a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the bloodstream of a subject without being inactivated, by administering to the vaginal and/or rectal tract of a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the presents invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising at least one single domain antibody directed against a target comprising at least one single domain antibody directed against a target, for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound delivered to the nose, upper respiratory tract and/or lung.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a non-limiting example, a formulation according to the invention, comprises a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein directed against one or more targets in the form of a nasal spray (e.g. an aerosol) or inhaler. Since the construct is small, it can reach its target much more effectively than therapeutic IgG molecule,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by a therapeutic compound delivered to the upper respiratory tract and lung, by administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein wherein one or more single domain antibodies are specific for an antigen related to the disorder, by inhalation through the mouth or nose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a dispersible VHH composition, in particular dry powder dispersible VHH compositions, such as those described in \n \nUS 6514496\n \n. These dry powder compositions comprise a plurality of discrete dry particles with an average particle size in the range of 0.4-10 mm. Such powders are capable of being readily dispersed in an inhalation device. VHH's are particularly suited for such composition as lyophilized material can be readily dissolved (in the lung subsequent to being inhaled) due to its high solubilisation capacity (\nMuyldermans, S., Reviews in Molecular Biotechnology, 74, 277-303, (2001\n)). Alternatively, such lyophilized VHH formulations can be reconstituted with a diluent to generate a stable reconstituted formulation suitable for subcutaneous administration. For example, anti-IgE antibody formulations (Example 1; \n \nUS 6267958\n \n, \n \nEP 841946\n \n) have been prepared which are useful for treating allergic asthma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein for the preparation of a medicament for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound delivered to the nose, upper respiratory tract and/or lung without being inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the nose, upper respiratory tract and lung, by administering to the nose, upper respiratory tract and/or lung of a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the nose, upper respiratory tract and/or lung without being inactivated, by administering to the nose, upper respiratory tract and/or lung of a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for delivering an anti-target therapeutic compound to the bloodstream of a subject without being inactivated by administering to the nose, upper respiratory tract and/or lung of a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more single domain antibodies directed against said target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound delivered to the intestinal mucosa, wherein said disorder increases the permeability of the intestinal mucosa. Because of their small size, a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein can pass through the intestinal mucosa and reach the bloodstream more efficiently in subjects suffering from disorders which cause an increase in the permeability of the intestinal mucosa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders susceptible to modulation by an anti-target therapeutic compound delivered to the intestinal mucosa, wherein said disorder increases the permeability of the intestinal mucosa, by orally administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis process can be even further enhanced by an additional aspect of the present invention - the use of active transport carriers. In this aspect of the invention, VHH is fused to a carrier that enhances the transfer through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream. In a non-limiting example, this \"carrier\" is a second VHH which is fused to the therapeutic VHH. Such fusion constructs are made using methods known in the art.

During their lifetime, subjects can develop an allergic response to harmless parasites such as \nDermatophagoides pteronyssinus,\n the house dust mite or to substances such as clumps, plastics, metals. This results in an induction of IgE molecules that initiates a cascade of immunological responses. One aspect of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IgE single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies. In one aspect of the invention, said anti-IgE single domain antibodies prevents the interaction of IgE with their receptor(s) on mast cells and basophils, so blocking initiation of the immunological cascade and a subsequent allergic reaction. In another aspect an anti-serum protein single domain antibody is directed to one of the subject's serum proteins. A heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein thus reduces or prevents an allergic response due to common or unusual allergens. Furthermore, the construct has a prolonged lifetime in the blood so increasing the therapeutic window. 7\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is believed to play an important role in various diseases, for example in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis. Both TNF-alpha and the receptors (CD120a, CD120b) have been studied in great detail. TNF-alpha in its bioactive form is a trimer and the groove formed by neighboring subunits is important for the cytokine-receptor interaction. Several strategies to antagonize the action of the cytokine have been developed and are currently used to treat various disease states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA TNF inhibitor which has sufficient specificity and selectivity to TNF may be an efficient prophylactic or therapeutic pharmaceutical compound for preventing or treating inflammatory diseases. However, it is extremely difficult and a lengthy process to develop a small chemical entitiy (NCE) with sufficient potency and selectivity to such target sequence. Antibody-based therapeutics on the other hand have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity. In addition, the development time can be reduced considerably when compared to the development of new chemical entities (NCE's). However, conventional antibodies are difficult to elicit against multimeric proteins where the receptor-binding domain of the ligand is embedded in a groove, as is the case with TNF-alpha.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heterospecific polypeptide constructs of the present invention, wherein the anti-target single domain antibody is directed against TNF-alpha overcome the problems experienced using peptide therapeutics of the art because of the properties such as stability, size, and reliable expressioin. Furthermore, the inventiors have found that, despite presence of a groove in multimeric TNF-alpha, the heterospecific polypeptide constructs are still able to achieve strong binding to TNF-alpha\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder mediated by inflammatory molecules. An aspect of the invention is the use of said construct for the preparation of a medicament for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder mediated by inflammatory molecules. Another aspect of the invention is a method for treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of a disorder mediated by inflammatory molecules, by administering a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein to an individual. According to the present invention, an anti-target single domain antibody of said heterospecific polypeptide is directed against a target involved in a cause or a manifestation of said disorder, or involved in causing symptoms thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, a target against which a single domain antibody of a heterospecific polypeptide construct is directed is tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is believed to play an important role in various disorders, for example in inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and multiple scierosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-target single domain antibodies may be directed against whole TNF-alpha or a fragment thereof, or a fragment of a homologous sequence thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibody fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibody, the sequences of said heterospecific polypeptide corresponding to any of SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 18. The anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies therein are derived from \nCamelidae\n heavy chain antibodies (VHHs), which bind to TNF-alpha.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-aipha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of inflammatory disorders. TNF-alpha is involved in inflammatory processes, and the blocking of TNF-alpha action can have an anti-inflammatory effect, which is highly desirable in certain disorder states such as, for example, Crohn's disease. Oral delivery of these heterospecific polypeptide construct results in the delivery of such molecules in an active form in the colon at sites that are affected by the disorder. These sites are highly inflamed and contain TNF-alpha producing cells. These heterospecific polypeptide constructs can neutralise the TNF-alpha locally, avoiding distribution throughout the whole body and thus limiting negative side-effects. Genetically modified microorganisms such as \nMicrococcus lactis\n are able to secrete antibody fragments. Such modified microorganisms can be used as vehicles for local production and delivery of antibody fragments in the intestine. By using a strain which produces a TNF-alpha-neutralising heterospecific polypeptide construct, inflammatory bowel disorder could be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to inflammatory processes, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide construct is administered intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is the use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to inflammatory processes, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide construct is administered intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a method of treating, preventing and/or alleviating disorders relating to inflammatory processes, comprising administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to inflammatory processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders relating to inflammatory processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is an aspect of the invention that the anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies of the present invention may be derived from VHHs of any class. For example, they may be derived from a class of VHHs with high homology to the human VH sequence, or may be derived from any of the other classes of VHHs, including the major class of VHH. These VHHs include the full length \nCamelidae\n VHHs, domains and may comprise a human Fc domain if effector functions are needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 18, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof. SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 18 comprise anti-TNF alpha \nCamelidae\n VHH and anti-mouse serum albumin \nCamelidae\n VHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptides construct comprising one or more anti-TNF-alpha single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies wherein said anti-serum protein single domain antibodies correspond to any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 4 (anti-serum protein \nCamelidae\n VHHs), a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors have found that a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising a sequence corresponding to any of SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 18 surprisingly exhibits higher than expected affinity towards its target and prolonged half-life in the circulatory system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlatelet-mediated aggregation is the process wherein von Willebrand Factor (vWF)-bound collagen adheres to platelets and/or platelet receptors (examples of both are gpla/Ila, gplb, or collagen), ultimately resulting in platelet activation. Platelet activation leads to fibrinogen binding, and finally to platelet aggregation. The ability to disrupt platelet-mediated aggregation has many applications including the treatment of disease as mentioned below. Since the heterospecific polypeptide constructs of the invention effective prevent clotting, and the half-life thereof is controllable, they may be used for surgical procedures, for example, which require an inhibition of platelet-mediated aggregation for a limited time period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonovalent single domain antibodies such as VHHs show surprisingly high platelet aggregation inhibition in experiments to measure platelet aggregation inhibition under high shear: 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation was obtained at a concentration between 4 and 25 nM. In comparison, the Fab fragment derived from a vWF-specific antibody inhibiting the interaction with collagen, 82D6A3, inhibits 50% of platelet aggregation at approximately a twenty-fold higher concentration (\nVanhoorelbeke K. et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2003, 278: 37815-37821\n). These results were unexpected given that the IC50 values for the monovalent VHH's are up to 225 times fold worse in ELISA then the IC50 value of the IgG of 82D6A3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis clearly shows that IgG antibodies is not suited to interaction with macromolecules which are starting, or are in the process of aggregating, such as those involved in platelet-mediated aggregation. vWF makes multimers of up to 60 monomers (final multimers of up to 20 million dalton in size). Indeed, it has been shown that not all A3 domains are accessible to 82D6A3 (\nDongmei WU, Blood, 2002, 99, 3623 to 3628\n). Furthermore the large size of conventional antibodies, would restrict tissue penetration, for example, during platelet-mediated aggregation at the site of a damaged vessel wall.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure of single domain antibodies, in particular is unique. For example VHH molecules derived from \nCamelidae\n antibodies are among the smallest intact antigen-binding domains known (approximately 15 kDa, or 10 times smaller than a conventional IgG) and hence are well suited towards delivery to dense tissues and for accessing the limited space between macromolecules participating in or starting the process of platelet mediated aggregation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that experiments show, that the small size of a VHH is advantageous over a large intact antibody for inhibition of interactions between such large macromolecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite the small size of nanobodies, and thus advantages for penetration, it is still surprising that such a small molecules can inhibit interactions between large polymers such as vWF (up to 60 monomers) and collagen and with such a high efficiency. It has been described that only the large multimeric forms of vWF are hemostatically active (\nFurlan, M,. 1996, Ann. Hematol. 72:341-348\n). Binding of multimeric vWF to collagen occurs with ∼100-fold higher affinity than binding of monomeric vWF fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results from the high shear experiments indicate that a lower dose will be needed for administration to patients. Therefore, fewer side effects are expected (such as immunogenicity or bleeding problems).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is an aspect of the present invention to provide heterospecific polypeptide constructs which modulate processes which comprise platelet-mediated aggregation such as, for example, vWF-collagen binding, vWF-platelet receptor adhesion, collagen-platelet receptor adhesion, platelet activation, fibrinogen binding and/or platelet aggregation. Said heterospecific polypeptide constructs are derived from single domain antibodies directed towards vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains, gplb or collagen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-target single domain antibodies may be directed against whole vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains, gplb or collagen or a fragment thereof, or a fragment of a homologous sequence thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, a target against which a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies is directed is von Willebrand factor (vWF). According to another aspect of the invention, the target is vWF A1 or A3 domains. According to another aspect of the invention, the target is gplb. According to another aspect of the invention, the target is gpla/llA. According to another aspect of the invention, the target is coliagen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-vWF single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein VHHs, the sequences of said heterospecific polypeptide corresponding to any of SEQ ID NOs: 19 to 21. The anti-vWF single domain antibodies therein are derived from \nCamelidae\n heavy chain antibodies (VHHs), which bind to vWF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies target, wherein the target is any of vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains, gplb or collagen for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of disorders or conditions relating to platelet-mediated aggregation or dysfunction thereof. Said disorders include transient cerebral ischemic attack, unstable angina pectoris, cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, restenosis. Said conditions include those arising from coronary by-pass graft, coronary artery valve replacement and coronary interventions such angioplasty, stenting, or atherectomy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies, wherein the target is any of vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains or collagen for use in the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders or conditions relating to platelet-mediated aggregation or dysfunction thereof, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide construct is administered intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is the use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies target, wherein the target is any of vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains or collagen for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders or conditions relating to platelet-mediated aggregation or dysfunction thereof, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide construct is administered intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a method of treating, preventing and/or alleviating disorders or conditions relating to relating to platelet-mediated aggregation or dysfunction thereof, comprising administering to a subject a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies target, wherein the target is any of vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains or collagen, wherein said heterospecific polypeptide construct is administered intravenously, orally, sublingually, topically, nasally, vaginally, rectally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies, wherein the target is any of vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains or collagen for use in the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders or conditions relating to platelet-mediated aggregation or dysfunction thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a use of a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies, wherein the target is any of vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains or collagen for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment, prevention and/or alleviation of disorders or conditions relating to platelet-mediated aggregation or dysfunction thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is an aspect of the invention that the anti-vWF, anti-vWF A1 or anti-vWF A3 or anti-collagen VHHs of the present invention may be derived from VHHs of any class. For example, they may be derived from the class of VHHs with high homology to the human VH sequence, or may be derived from any of the other classes of VHHs, Including the major class of VHH. These VHHs include the full length \nCamelidae\n VHHs, domains and may comprise a human Fc domain if effector functions are needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-vWF single domain antibodies wherein said heterospecific polypeptide corresponds to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 19 to 21, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof. SEQ ID NOs: 19 to 21 comprise anti-vWF VHH and anti-mouse serum albumin VHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies, wherein the target is any of vWF, vWF A1 or A3 domains, gplb or collagen and wherein said anti-serum protein single domain antibodies correspond to any of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 4, a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring their lifetime, subjects may develop an allergic response to harmless parasites (\ne.g\n. \nDermatophagoides pteronyssinus,\n house dust mite) or substances (clumps, plastics, metals). This results in the induction of IgE molecules that initiate a cascade of immunological responses.

As such they prevent the initiation of the immunological cascade, an allergic reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, a target against which a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies is directed is IgE.

For example, they may be derived from a class of VHHs with high homology to the human VH sequence, or may be derived from any of the other classes of VHHs, including the major class of VHH. Said VHHs may be derived from \nCamelidae.\n These VHHs include the full length \nCamelidae\n VHHs, domains and may comprise a human Fc domain if effector functions are needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above aspects and embodiments apply to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IgE single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies, wherein the heterospecific polypeptides correspond to a sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOs: 22 to 24 , a homologous sequence thereof, a functional portion thereof, of a homologous sequence of a functional portion thereof.

Furthermore, the construct has a prolonged lifetime in the blood so increasing the therapeutic window.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is believed to play an important role in various disorders, for example in inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis and hyperimmune reactions in the eye. IFN-gamma has also been shown to play a significant role in the pathology of autoimmune diseases. For example, the presence of IFN-gamma has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (\nBrennan et al, Brit. J. Rheum., 31, 293-8 (1992\n)). Several strategies to antagonize the action of these cytokines have been developed and are currently used to treat various disease states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIFN-gamma in its bioactive form is a dimer and the groove formed by the two subunits is important for its biological activity through interaction with the IFN-gamma receptor. An IFN-gamma inhibitor which has sufficient specificity and selectivity to IFN-gamma may be an efficient prophylactic or therapeutic pharmaceutical compound for preventing or treating inflammatory disorders. Diseases associated with IFN-gamma include multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis (\n \nUS6,333,032\n \n Advanced Biotherapy Concepts, Inc.). Other diseases include Crohn's disease and psoriasis (\n \nUS6,329,511\n \n Protein Design Labs). Yet other diseases are bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (\n \nEP0695189\n \n Genentech).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNone of the presently available drugs are completely effective for the treatment of autoimmune disease, and most are limited by severe toxicity. In addition, it is extremely difficult and a lengthy process to develop a new chemical entitiy (NCE) with sufficient potency and selectivity to such target sequence. Antibody-based therapeutics on the other hand have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity. In addition, the development time can be reduced considerably when compared to the development of new chemical entities (NCE's). However, conventional antibodies are difficult to raise against multimeric proteins where the receptor-binding domain of the ligand is embedded in a groove, as is the case with IFN-gamma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heterospecific polypeptide constructs of the present invention, wherein the anti-target single domain antibody is directed against TNF-alpha overcome the problems experienced using peptide therapeutics of the art because of the properties thereof such as stability, size, and reliable expression. Furthermore, the inventors have found that, despite presence of a groove in multimeric IFN-gamma, the heterospecific polypeptide constructs are still able to achieve strong binding to IFNA-gamma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, a target against which one or more anti-target single domain antibodies of a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-target single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies is directed is interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). IFN-gamma is secreted by some T cells. In addition to its anti-viral activity, IFN-gamma stimulates natural killer (NK) cells and T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and activates macrophages and stimulates the expression of MHC molecules on the surface of cells. Hence, IFN-gamma generally serves to enhance many aspects of immune function, and is a candidate for treatment of disorders where the immune system is over-active \ne.g.\n Crohn's disease, autoimmune disorders and organ plant rejection in addition inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention relates to a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IFN-gamma single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies, the sequences of said heterospecific polypeptide corresponding to any of SEQ ID NOs: 25 to 27. The anti-IFN-gamma single domain antibodies therein are derived from \nCamelidae\n heavy chain antibodies (VHHs), which bind to IFN-gamma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-target single domain antibodies may be directed against whole IFN-gamma or a fragment thereof, or a fragment of a homologous sequence thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a heterospecific polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti-IFN-gamma single domain antibodies fused to one or more anti-serum protein single domain antibodies for use in treating, preventing and/or alleviating the symptoms of the disorders wherein the immune system is overactive, as mentioned above. Current therapy consists of intravenous administration of anti-IFN-gamma antibodies. Oral delivery of these heterospecific polypeptide constructs results in the delivery of such molecules in an active form in the colon at sites that are affected by the disorder. These sites are highly inflamed and contain IFN-gamma producing cells. These heterospecific polypeptide constructs can neutralise the IFN-gamma locally, avoiding distribution throughout the whole body and thus limiting negative side-effects.

One skilled in the art can readily assess the potency of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"compound\" refers to a heterospecific polypeptide construct as disclosed herein, a polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NOs: 5 to 27, a homologous sequence thereof, or a homologue thereof, or a nucleic acid capable of encoding said polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, \ni.e.,\n the material may be administered to an individual along with the compound without causing any undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the pharmaceutical composition in which it is contained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention disclosed herein is useful for treating or preventing a condition relating to a disorder as mentioned herein (\ne.g.\n allergy and/or inflammation), in a subject and comprising administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound or composition that binds to a component involved in the disorder pathway (\ne.g.\n to IgE and/or TNF-alpha in the blood stream), so inhibiting the disorder pathway and the disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention is the use of compounds of the invention for treating or preventing a condition relating to a disorder as mentioned herein (\ne.g.\n allergy and/or inflammation), in a subject and comprising administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound in combination with another, such as, for example, aspirin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is not limited to the administration of formulations comprising a single compound of the invention. It is within the scope of the invention to provide combination treatments wherein a formulation is administered to a patient in need thereof that comprises more than one compound of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well known in the art how to determine the inhibition of a disorder pathway using the standard tests described herein, or using other similar tests. Preferably, the method would result in at least a 10% reduction in an indicator of the disorder, including, for example, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%,60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, or any amount in between, more preferably by 90%. For example, an inhibition of an allergic pathway by inhibition of IgE by a peptide of the invention might result in a 10% reduction in food-specific IgE levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound useful in the present invention can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient or any animal in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, \ni.e.,\n orally or parenterally, by intranasally by inhalation, intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the present invention can also be administered using gene therapy methods of delivery. See, \ne.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,399,346\n \n, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Using a gene therapy method of delivery, primary cells transfected with the gene for the compound of the present invention can additionally be transfected with tissue specific promoters to target specific organs, tissue, grafts, tumors, or cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present compound may be systemically administered, \ne.g.,\n orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, It may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pilis, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-reiease preparations and devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compound may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form must be sterile, fiuid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable Solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical administration, the present compound may be applied in pure form, i.e., when they are liquids, However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, hydroxyalkyls or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the present compound can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified cellulose or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the compound to the skin are known to the art; for example, see \n \nJacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392\n \n), \n \nGeria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478\n \n), \n \nSmith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157\n \n) and \n \nWortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful dosages of the compound can be determined by comparing their \nin vitro\n activity, and \nin vivo\n activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animas, to humans are known to the art; for example, see \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the concentration of the compound(s) in a liquid composition, such as a lotion, will be from about 0.1-25 wt-%, preferably from about 0.5-10 wt-%. The concentration in a semisolid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder will be about 0.1-5 wt-%, preferably about 0.5-2.5 wt-%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. Also the dosage of the compound varies depending on the target cell, tumor, tissue, graft, or organ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, \ne.g.,\n into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn administration regimen could include long-term, daily treatment. By \"long-term\" is meant at least two weeks and preferably, several weeks, months, or years of duration. Necessary modifications in this dosage range may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein. See \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Martin, E.W., ed. 4), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA\n. The dosage can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1: immunization of Ilamas\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOne Ilama was immunized with human serum albumin (HSA). The immunization scheme is summarized in Table 1.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2: Repertoire cloning\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPeripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were isolated by centrifugation on a density gradient (Ficoll-Paque Plus Amersham Biosciences). PBLs were used to extract total RNA (Chomczynski and Sacchi 1987). cDNA was prepared on 100 µg total RNA with MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (Gibco BRL) using oligo d(T) oligonucleotides. The cDNA was purified with a phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by an ethanol precipitation and subsequently used as template to amplify the VHH repertoire.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a first PCR, the repertoire of both conventional (1.6 kb) and heavy-chain (1.3 kb) antibody gene segments were amplified using a leader specific primer (5' - GGCTGAGCTCGGTGGTCCTGGCT- 3') and the oligo d(T) primer (5'-AACTGGAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCAGGAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3'). The resulting DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and the 1.3 kb fragment, encoding heavy-chain antibody segments was purified from the agarose gel. A second PCR was performed using a mixture of FR1 reverse primers and the same oiigo d(T) forward primer. The PCR products were digested with \nSfi\nI (introduced in the FR1 primer) and \nBstE\nII (naturally occurring in FR4). Following gel electrophoresis, the DNA fragment of approximately 400 basepairs were purified from gel and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of phagemid pAX004 to obtain a library of cloned VHHs after electroporation of \nEscherichia coli\n TG1. The size of the library was 1.4 x 10\n7\n cfu, and all clones contained insert of the correct size.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 3: Rescue of the library, phage preparation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe library was grown at 37°C in 10 ml 2xTY medium containing 2% glucose, and 100 µg/ml ampicillin, until the OD600nm reached 0.5. M13KO7 phages (10\n12\n) were added and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 x 30 minutes, first without shaking, then with shaking at 100 rpm. Cells were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4500 rpm at room temperature. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 2xTY medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 25 µg/ml kanamycin, and incubated overnight at 37°C with vigorously shaking at 250 rpm. The overnight cultures were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4°C. Phages were PEG precipitated (20% poly-ethylene-glycol and 1.5 M NaCl) and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 10,000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml PBS. Phages were again PEG precipitated and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 20,000 rpm and 4°C. The pellet was dissolved in 5 ml PBS-1% casein. Phages were titrated by infection of TG1 calls at OD600nm= 0.5 and plating on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. The number of transformants indicates the number of phages (= pfu). The phages were stored at -80°C with 15% glycerol.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 4: Phage ELISA\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate (Maxisorp) was coated overnight at 4°C with PBS-1% casein or with 5 µg/ml HSA (human serum albumin). The plate was washed 3 times with PBS-Tween (0.05% Tween20) and blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with 200 µl PBS-1% casein. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween. Phages were prepared as described above and applied to the wells in consecutive twofold dilutions. Plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween. Bound phage were detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody anti-M13 conjugated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP) diluted 1/2000 in PBS. The plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween. Staining was performed with ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2\n and signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. Results are shown in \nFigure 1\n and indicate the presence of HSA-specific nanobodies in the library.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5: Selection: first and second round of biopanning\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA well in a microtiterplate was coated with 10 µg/ml mouse serum albumin (MSA), or with PBS containing 1% casein. After overnight incubation at 4°C, the wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% casein, for 3 hours at room temperature (RT). 200 µl phages was added to the wells. After 2 hours incubation at RT, the wells were washed 10x with PBS-Tween and 10x with PBS. Bound phages were eluted with 100 µl 0.2 M glycin buffer pH= 2.4. Elutions were performed for 20 minutes at room temperature. Eluted phages were allowed to infect exponentially growing \nE.Coll\n TG1 cells, and were then plated on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. A second round was performed with the same conditions as described above. Results are summarized in Table 2.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 6: Screening of individual clones after biopanning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nELISA: binding to human serum albumin (HSA) and mouse serum albumin (MSA)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA single colony was used to start an overnight culture in LB containing 2% glucose and 100 µg/ml ampicillin. This overnight culture was diluted 100-fold in T8 medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin, and incubated at 37°C until OD600nm= 0.5. 1 mM IPTG was added and the culture was incubated for 3 more hours at 37°C or overnight at 28°C. Cultures were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4°C. The pellet was frozen overnight or for 1 hour at -20°C. Next, the pellet was thawed at room temperature for 40 minutes, re-suspended in PBS and shaken on ice for 1 hour. Periplasmic fraction was isolated by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 4°C at 20,000 rpm. The supernatant containing the VHH was used for further analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated with 5 µg/ml HSA, with 5 µg/ml mouse serum albumin (MSA) or with PBS-1% casein, overnight at 4°C. Plates were blocked for two hours at room temperature with 300 \nµl\n 1% casein in PBS. The plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween. Periplasmic fraction was prepared for 23 individual clones after the first and second round of selection, and allowed to bind to the wells of the microtiterplate. Plates were washed six times with PBS-Tween, after which binding of nanobody was detected by incubation with mouse anti-Histidine monoclonal antibody Serotec MCA 1396 (1/1000 dilution) in PBS for 1 hour at RT followed by anti-mouse-\nalkaline phosphatase conjugate\n 1/2000 in PBS, also for 1 hour at RT. Staining was performed with the substrate PNPP (p-nitrophenyl-phosphate. 2 mg/ml in 1 M diethanolamine, 1mM Mg\n2\nSO\n4\n, pH9.8) and the signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. Results are summarized in Table 3.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 7: Hinfl pastern and sequencing\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA PCR was performed on positive clones after the second round of panning, with a set of primers binding to a sequence in the vector. The PCR product was digested with the restriction enzyme Hinfl and loaded on a agarose gel. 4 clones were selected with a different Hinfl-pattern for further evaluation. Those clones were sequenced, and results are summarized in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 1, 2 ,3 and 4).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 8: Test cross-reactivity with albumin of different species\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA SDS-PAGE was run for plasma (1/10 dilution) from different species (baboon, pig, hamster, human, rat. mouse and rabbit) and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. Phages were prepared for \nclones MSA\n 21, \nMSA\n 24, \nMSA\n 210, MSA212 and a control nanobody as described in Example 3. Phages were allowed to bind to the nitrocellulose blotted serum albumins and unbound phages were washed away. Binding was detected with an anti-M13 polyclonal antibody coupled to HRP. DAP was used as a substrate for detection. Results are shown in \nFigure 2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom these results we can conclude that all 4 binders are cross-reactive between pig, human, mouse (less for MSA212) and hamster serum albumin. \nMSA\n 21 is also cross-reactive with rabbit serum albumin. With the irrelevant nanobody no binding was observed (not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a control experiment, a SDS-PAGE was run with the different plasma samples diluted 1/100 in PBS. The gel was stained with coomassie. We can conclude from \nFigure 3\n that albumin levels in all plasma samples are high except for rabbit plasma, with low levels of albumin.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 9: Expression and purification\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmid was prepared for the binders and was transformed into WK6 electrocompetent cells. A single colony was used to start an overnight culture in LB containing 2% glucose and 100 µg/ml ampicillin. This overnight culture was diluted 100-fold in 300 ml TB medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin, and incubated at 37°C until OD600nm= 0.5. 1 mM IPTG was added and the culture was incubated for 3 more hours at 37°C or overnight at 28°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCultures were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10.000 rpm at 4°C. The pellet was frozen overnight or for 1 hour at -20°C. Next, the pellet was thawed at room temperature for 40 minutes, re-suspended in 20 ml PBS and shaken on ice for 1 hour. Periplasmic fraction was isolated by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 4°C at 20,000 rpm. The supernatant containing the nanobody was loaded on Ni-NTA and purified to homogeneity.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 10: ELISA on MSA of the purified nanobodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiterplate was coated with 5 µg/ml MSA overnight at 4C. After washing, the plate was blocked for 2 hours at RT with PBS-1 % casein. Samples were applied in duplicate starting at a concentration of 2500 nM at 1/3 dilutions and allowed to bind for 2 hours at RT. A polyclonal rabbit anti-nanobody serum was added at 1/1000 (K208) for one hour at RT. Detection was with anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate at 1/1000 and staining with PNPP as described in Example 6. Results are shown in \nFigure 4\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 11: Construction of bispecific constructs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe \nE. coli\n production vector pAX11 was constructed to allow the two-step cloning of bivalent or bispecific VHH (\nFigure 5\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe carboxy terminal VHH was cloned first with PstI and BstEII, while in the second step the other VHH was inserted by SfiI and NotI, which do not cut within the first gene fragment. The procedure avoids the enforcement of new sites by amplification and thus the risk of introducing PCR errors. The middle hinge of llama was used as a linker between the nanobodies. A VHH against human TNF alpha was cloned at the COOH terminal of MSA specific nanobodies. Sequences are summarized in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 5, 6, 7 and 8). Plasmid was prepared and was transformed into WK6 electrocompetent cells. A single colony was used to start an overnight culture in LB containing 2% glucose and 100 µg/ml ampicillin. This overnight culture was diluted 100-fold in 300 µl TB medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin, and incubated at 37°C until OD600nm= 0.5. 1 mM IPTG was added and the culture was incubated for 3 more hours at 37°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCultures were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4°C. The pellet was frozen overnight at -20C. The next morning, the pellet was thawed in the cold room for 40 minutes, re-suspended in 20 ml PBS and shaken on ice for 1 hour. Periplasmic fraction was isolated by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 4°C at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was loaded on Ni-NTA and purified to homogeneity. Sequences are shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 5, 6, 7 and 8). A extra purification step was needed to remove some degradation product (5%) on gelfiltration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother bispecific VHH against human TNF-alpha (MP7 12b) is listed in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 15, 16, 17 and 18).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 12: Test bispecific construct in sandwich ELISA\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated with 5 ug/ml MSA overnight at 4°C. Plates were blocked for two hours at room temperature with 300 \nµl\n 1% casein in PBS. The plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween. Purified protein for the bispecific constructs was allowed to bind to the wells of the microtiterplate at a concentration of 0.4, 0.5, 2.5 and 2.5 µ/ml for MSA21, MSA24, MSA210 and MSA212 respectively. Plates were washed six times with PBS-Tween, Biotinilated TNF was added at a concentration of 10 µg/ml and diluted 3 fold, and allowed to bind for 2 hours at room temperature. Binding was detected by incubation with mouse extravidin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) 1/2000 in PBS, for 1 hour at RT. Staining was performed with the substrate PNPP (p-nitrophenyl-phosphate, 2 mg/ml in 1M diethanolamine, 1 mM Mg\n2\nSO\n4\n, pH9.8) and the signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. Results are shown in \nFigure 6\n and indicate that the bispecific construct can bind both antigens simultaneously.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 13: Determine affinity of albumin binders in BIACORE\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAffinities for mouse albumin were determined in BIACORE by immobilization of mouse albumin on a CM5 BlAcore chip using EDC-NHS covalent coupling and are summarized in Table 5. The results indicate that the affinity for albumin is retained in the bispecific construct.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 14: Optimization of ELISA in plasma or blood\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPharamcokinetic experiments were initiated to compare half life in mice of the TNF-alpha binder TNF3E with MSA21/VHH#3E and MSA24/ VHH#3E. Therefore our ELISA had to be optimized to obtain low background values when the samples are in blood or in plasma. A microtiterplate was coated with neutravidin. After overnight incubation at 4C, the plates were washed and blocked for 2 hours at RT with PBS-1% casein. 1 µg/ml biotinylated TNF-alpha was allowed to bind for 30 minutes at RT and the plate was washed. Samples (monovalent VHH#3E and MSA21/VHH#3E) were applied starting at a concentration of 1 µg/ml, diluted in PBS, 10% plasma or 10% blood and allowed to bind for 2 hours. After washing the plates, a rabbit antiserum was added at a dilution of 1/2000 either recognizing the heavy chain class (K208) or recognizing the conventional class (URL49). After 1 hour incubation, the plates were washed and an anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate was added (Sigma) at a dilution of 1/1000. After 1 hour incubation at RT, plates were washed and binding was detected with substrate. Results are shown in \nFigure 7\n. The results clearly show that background values with the rabbit antisera (K208 and URL49) are very low when the samples are diluted in 10% blood or 10% plasma as compared to PBS. The URL49 antiserum only recognizes the MSA21NHH#3E bispecific nanobody and not monovalent VHH#3E, therefore, this antiserum can be used to test the integrity of our bispecific nanobody upon administration to the mice.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 15: Large scale expression and purification of VHH#3E, MSA21/VHH#3E and MSA24/VHH#3E for pharmacokinetic studies in mice\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n3 liter culture was started for monovalent TNF3E and for bispecific MSA21/VHH#3E or MSA24/VHH#3E and purified as described in Example 11. An extra purification step was needed for the removal of endotoxins. Therefore, samples were purified on a Polymyxin column (BIO-RAD). Samples were analyzed for bacterial endotoxin concentration with the LAL-assay (Limulus Amebocyte Lysate, Bio Whittaker). Results are summarized in Table 6.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 16: Pharmacokinetics in mice\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n9 mice (CB57/B16) for each construct were injected intravenously in the tail with 100 µg nanobody. Blood was retrieved at different time points (3 mice per time point) and serum was prepared. Samples were analyzed by ELISA for the presence of monovalent or bispe-ific nanobody as described in example 14. K208 was also compared to URL49 for the bispecific constructs to verify the integrity of the molecule. Results are shown in \nFigures 8 to 11\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe can conclude from the results that the half life of the monovalent nanobody (40-45 minutes) is dramatically improved by making a bispecific nanobody with specificity for albumin MSA21/VHH#3E and MSA24/VHH#3E (half-life 2.5 to 3 days). The bispecific nanobody MSA21/VHH#3E remains intact even after 19 days in the mice as shown in ELISA with URL49 (\nFigure 11\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 17: Further extension of half-life of nanobodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to increase the half-life of MSA21/TNF3E and MSA24/TNF3E even further, a trivalent nanobody was prepared by fusing the bivalent MSA21-MSA21 construct to target-specific nanobody TNF3E. The resulting MSA21/MSA21/TNF3E (Table 7, and SEQ ID NO: 9) was tested \nin vivo\n according to the method of Example 16.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 18: Immunization of liama002\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n1 llama was immunized with vWF.

The size of the library was 1.4 x 10\n7\n cfu, and >90% of the clones contained insert of the correct size. Phages were prepared as described in Example 3.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 20: Selection for binders for vWF inhibiting the interaction with collagen: first and second round of panning\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA well in a microtiterplate was coated with 2 µg/ml vWF or with PBS containing 1% casein. After overnight incubation at 4°C, the wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% casein, for 3 hours at RT. 200 µl phages was added to the wells. After 2 hours incubation at RT, the wells were washed 10x with PBS-Tween and 10x with PBS. Phages were specifically eluted with 100 µl of 100 µg/ml collagen type III. Elutions were performed for overnight at room temperature. Eluted phages were allowed to infect exponentially growing TG1 cells, and were then plated on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/m) ampicillin and 2% glucose. This experiment was repeated for a second round of panning, under the same conditions as described above. The results from the panning are presented in Tables 8 and 9.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 21: Functional characterization of vWF binders: Inhibition of binding of vWF to collagen by VHH\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated overnight at 4°C with collagen type III at 25 µg/ml in PBS. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween and blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with PBS containing 1% casein. The plate was washed five times with PBS-tween. 100 µl of 2 µg/ml vWF (vWF is pre-incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes) was mixed with 20 µl periplasmic extract containing a VHH antibody (described in Example 6) and incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature in the wells of the microtiterplate, The plate was washed five times with PBS-tween. An anti-vWF-HRP monoclonal antibody (DAKO) was diluted 3,000-fold in PBS and incubated for 1 hour. The plate was washed five times with PBS-Tween and vWF-binding was detected with ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2\n. Signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. The results are presented in Table 10, showing that inhibitors are obtained after the first and second round of panning.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 22: Expression and purification of VHH\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein was prepared and purified as described in Example 9.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 23: ELISA: binding to vWF\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiter plate was coated with 2 µg/ml vWF, overnight at 4°C . Plates were blocked for two hours at room temperature with 300 \nµl\n 1% casein in PBS. The plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween. Dilution series of all purified samples were incubated for 2 hours at RT. Plates were washed six times with PBS-Tween, after which binding of VHH was detected by incubation with \nmouse anti-myc mAB\n 1/2000 in PBS for 1 hour at RT followed by anti-mouse-\nHRP conjugate\n 1/1000 in PBS, also for 1 hour at RT. Staining was performed with the substrate ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2\n and the signals were measured after 30 minutes at 405 nm. The binding as a function of concentration of purified VHH is indicated in \nFigure 12\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 24: Inhibition ELISA with purified VHH\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition ELISA was performed as described in Example 20 but with decreasing concentrations of VHH and with human plasma at a dilution of 1/60 instead of with purified vWF. Results are represented in \nFigure 13\n. The concentration of VHH resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50) is given in table 10.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 25: Construction and sequence of bispecific constructs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBispecific constructs were prepared with the first VHH specific for albumin (MSA21) and the second VHH specific for vWF. Constructs were made as described in Example 11. Sequences are shown in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOS: 19 to 21)\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 26: Expression and purification of bispecific constructs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein was expressed and purified as described in Example 9. An extra purification step was needed on superdex 75 for removal of some monovalent degradation product (5-10%).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 27: Functionality of both VHHs in the bispecific construct\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA microtiterplate was coated with 5 µg/ml mouse serum albumin overnight at 4°C. After washing the plate, wells were blocked for 2 hours with PBS-1% casein. The bispecific proteins were allowed to bind to the wells for 2 hours at RT. After washing, human, dog and pig plasma was added at different dilutions and allowed to bind for 2 hours at RT. Binding of vWF was detected with anti-vWF-HRP from DAKO at 1/3000 dilution. Staining was performed with ABTS/H\n2\nO\n2\n. Results are shown in \nFigure 14\n and indicate that functionality of both VHHs is retained in the bispecific construct.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 28: Inhibition of binding of vWF to collagen by the bispecific constructs as compared to the monovalent VHHs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition for binding of vWF to collagen was tested for monovalent as compared to bispecific constructs as described in Example 20. IC50 values are summarized in Table 11.Results indicate that the inhibitory properties of the VHH are retained in the bispecific construct.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 29: Construction of a bispecific construct containing a VHH-CDR3 fragment fused to an anti-serum albumin VHH\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA functional portion, the CDR3 region of MP2F6SR, was amplified by using a sense primer located in the \nframework\n 4 region (F6 CRD3 Forward:CTGGCCCCAGAAGTCATACC) and an anti-sense primer located in the \nframework\n 3 region (F6 CDR3 Reverse primer:TGTGCATGTGCAGCAAACC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to fuse the CDR-3 fragment with the anti-serum albumin VHH MSA-21, a second round PCR amplification was performed with following primers:\n\n \n \n \nF6 CDR3 Reverse primer Sfi1:\n \nGTCCTCGCAACTGCGGCCCAGCCGGCCTGTGCATGTGCAGCAAACC\n \nF6 CDR3 Forward primer Not1:\n \nGTCCTCGCAACTGCGCGGCCGCCTGGCCCCAGAAGTCATACC\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe PCR reactions was performed in 50 ml reaction volume using 50pmol of each primer. The reaction conditions for the primary PCR were 11 min at 94 °C, followed by 30/60/120 sec at 94/55/72 °C for 30 cycles, and 5 min at 72°C. All reaction were performed wit 2.5 mM MgCl2 , 200 mM dNTP and 1.25U AmpliTaq God DNA Polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Brussels, Belgium).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter cleavage of the VHH gene of MSA clones with restriction enzymes Pst1/BstEII the digested products were cloned in \npAX11\n 1 to obtain clones with a VHH at the C-terminus of the multicloning site. The clones were examined by PCR using vector based primers. From clones wielding a 650 bp product, DNA was prepared and used as acceptor vector to clone the CDR3 of MP2F6SR after cleavage of the PCR product with restriction enzymes Sfi1/Not1 to allow N-terminal expression of CDR3 in fusion with a MSA VHH.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 30: Calculation of homologies between anti-target single domain antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof the invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe degree of amino acid sequence homology between anti-target single domain antibodies of the invention was calculated using the Bioedit Sequence Alignment Editor.
