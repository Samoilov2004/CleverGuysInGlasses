Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe orexins (hypocretins) comprise two neuropeptides produced in the hypothalamus: the orexin A (OX-A) (a 33 amino acid peptide) and the orexin B (OX-B) (a 28 amino acid peptide) (Sakurai T. et al., Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585). Orexins are found to stimulate food consumption in rats suggesting a physiological role for these peptides as mediators in the central feedback mechanism that regulates feeding behaviour (Sakurai T. et al., Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585). Orexins regulate states of sleep and wakefulness opening potentially novel therapeutic approaches for narcoleptic or insomniac patients (Chemelli R. M. et al., Cell, 1999, 98, 437-451). Orexins have also been indicated as playing a role in arousal, reward, learning and memory (Harris, et al., Trends Neurosci., 2006, 29 (10), 571-577). Two orexin receptors have been cloned and characterized in mammals. They belong to the super family of G-protein coupled receptors (Sakurai T. et al., Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585): the orexin-1 receptor (OX or OX1R) is selective for OX-A and the orexin-2 receptor (OX2 or OX2R) is capable to bind OX-A as well as OX-B. The physiological actions in which orexins are presumed to participate are thought to be expressed via one or both of OX1 receptor and OX2 receptor as the two subtypes of orexin receptors. The 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl compound almorexant, (2R)-2-{(1S)-6,7-dimethoxy-1-[2-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-ethyl]-3,4-dihydro-1H-isoquinolin-2-yl}-N-methyl-2-phenyl-acetamide, is disclosed as an antagonist of both the OX1 receptor and the OX2 receptor in PCT Patent Publication WO2005/118548 and Drugs of the Future, 2009, 34(1), 5-10.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to tetrahydronapthyridine and tetrahydropyridopyrazine compounds which are antagonists of orexin receptors, and which are useful in the treatment or prevention of neurological and psychiatric disorders and diseases in which orexin receptors are involved. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and the use of these compounds and compositions in the prevention or treatment of such diseases in which orexin

Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds. Formula I shows the structure of the class of compounds without specific stereochemistry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration. If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs appreciated by those of skill in the art, halogen or halo as used herein are intended to include fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. Similarly, C\n1-6\n, as in C\n1-6\nalkyl is defined to identify the group as having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbons in a linear or branched arrangement, such that C\n1-8 \nalkyl specifically includes methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, and hexyl. A group which is designated as being independently substituted with substituents may be independently substituted with multiple numbers of such substituents. The term “heterocycle” as used herein includes both unsaturated and saturated heterocyclic moieties, wherein the unsaturated heterocyclic moieties (i.e. “heteroaryl”) include benzoimidazolyl, benzimidazolonyl, benzofuranyl, benzofurazanyl, benzopyrazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzotriazolyl, benzothiophenyl, benzoxazepin, benzoxazolyl, carbazolyl, carbolinyl, cinnolinyl, furanyl, imidazolyl, indolinyl, indolyl, dihydroindolyl, indolazinyl, indazolyl, isobenzofuranyl, isoindolyl, isoquinolyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, naphthpyridinyl, oxadiazolyl, oxazolyl, oxazoline, isoxazoline, oxetanyl, pyrazinyl, pyrazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyridopyridinyl, pyridazinyl, pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyrrolyl, quinazolinyl, quinolyl, quinoxalinyl, tetrahydroquinoxalinyl, tetrazolyl, tetrazolopyridyl, thiadiazolyl, thiazolyl, thienyl, triazolyl, and N-oxides thereof, and wherein the saturated heterocyclic moieties include azetidinyl, 1,4-dioxanyl, hexahydroazepinyl, piperazinyl, piperidinyl, pyridin-2-onyl, pyrrolidinyl, morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, thiomorpholinyl, and tetrahydrothienyl, and N-oxides thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopic variations of a compound of the Formula I in which one or more atoms is replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen such as \n2\nH and \n3\nH, carbon such as \n11\nc, \n13\nC and \n14\nC, nitrogen such as \n13\nN and \n15\nN, oxygen such as \n15\nO, \n17\nO and \n18\nO, phosphorus such as \n32\nP, sulfur such as \n35\nS, fluorine such as \n18\nF, iodine such as \n23\nI and \n125\nI, and chlorine such as \n36\nCl. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula I, for example those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e. \n14\nC, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. \n2\nH, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n15\nO and \n13\nN, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples using appropriate isotopically-labelled reagents in place of the non-labelled reagent previously employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids.

It will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of Formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplifying the invention is the use of the compounds disclosed in the Examples and herein. Specific compounds within the present invention include a compound which selected from the group consisting of the compounds disclosed in the following Examples and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and individual enantiomers or diastereomers thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject compounds are useful in a method of antagonizing orexin receptor activity in a patient such as a mammal in need of such inhibition comprising the administration of an effective amount of the compound. The present invention is directed to the use of the compounds disclosed herein as antagonists of orexin receptor activity. In addition to primates, especially humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention. The present invention is directed to a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in medicine. The present invention is further directed to a use of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for antagonizing orexin receptor activity or treating the disorders and diseases noted herein in humans and animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject treated in the present methods is generally a mammal, such as a human being, male or female. The term “therapeutically effective amount” means the amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. It is recognized that one skilled in the art may affect the neurological and psychiatric disorders by treating a patient presently afflicted with the disorders or by prophylactically treating a patient afflicted with the disorders with an effective amount of the compound of the present invention. As used herein, the terms “treatment” and “treating” refer to all processes wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting, arresting, controlling, or stopping of the progression of the neurological and psychiatric disorders described herein, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all disorder symptoms, as well as the prophylactic therapy of the mentioned conditions, particularly in a patient who is predisposed to such disease or disorder. The terms “administration of” and or “administering a” compound should be understood to mean providing a compound of the invention or a prodrug of a compound of the invention to the individual in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “composition” as used herein is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. Such term in relation to pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. By “pharmaceutically acceptable” it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as orexin receptor OX1R and/or OX2R antagonists may be readily determined without undue experimentation by methodology well known in the art, including the “FLIPR Ca\n2+\n Flux Assay” (Okumura et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 280:976-981, 2001). In a typical experiment the OX1 and OX2 receptor antagonistic activity of the compounds of the present invention was determined in accordance with the following experimental method. For intracellular calcium measurements, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the rat orexin-1 receptor or the human orexin-2 receptor, are grown in Iscove's modified DMEM containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.5 g/ml G418, 1% hypoxanthine-thymidine supplement, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). The cells are seeded at 20,000 cells/well into Becton-Dickinson black 384-well clear bottom sterile plates coated with poly-D-lysine. All reagents were from GIBCO-Invitrogen Corp. The seeded plates are incubated overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO2. Ala-6,12 human orexin-A as the agonist is prepared as a 1 mM stock solution in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and diluted in assay buffer (HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA and 2.5 mM probenecid, pH7.4) for use in the assay at a final concentration of 70 pM. Test compounds are prepared as 10 mM stock solution in DMSO, then diluted in 384-well plates, first in DMSO, then assay buffer. On the day of the assay, cells are washed 3 times with 100 ul assay buffer and then incubated for 60 min (37° C., 5% CO\n2\n) in 60 ul assay buffer containing 1 uM Fluo-4AM ester, 0.02% pluronic acid, and 1% BSA. The dye loading solution is then aspirated and cells are washed 3 times with 100 ul assay buffer. 30 ul of that same buffer is left in each well. Within the Fluorescent Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices), test compounds are added to the plate in a volume of 25 ul, incubated for 5 min and finally 25 ul of agonist is added. Fluorescence is measured for each well at 1 second intervals for 5 minutes and the height of each fluorescence peak is compared to the height of the fluorescence peak induced by 70 pM Ala-6,12 orexin-A with buffer in place of antagonist. For each antagonist, IC50 value (the concentration of compound needed to inhibit 50% of the agonist response) is determined. Alternatively, compound potency can be assessed by a radioligand binding assay (described in Bergman et. al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2008, 18, 1425-1430) in which the inhibition constant (Ki) is determined in membranes prepared from CHO cells expressing either the OX1 or OX2 receptor. The intrinsic orexin receptor antagonist activity of a compound which may be used in the present invention may be determined by these assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the compounds of the following examples had activity in antagonizing the rat orexin-1 receptor and/or the human orexin-2 receptor in the aforementioned assays with an IC\n50 \nof less than about 100 nM. Compounds of the present invention also have activity in the radioligand binding assay, generally with a Ki<100 nM against the orexin-1 and/or the orexin-2 receptor. Additional data is provided in the following Examples. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as antagonists of orexin-1 receptor and/or the orexin-2 receptor. In general, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that a substance is considered to effectively antagonize the orexin receptor if it has an IC50 of less than about 50 μM, preferably less than about 100 nM. The present invention also includes compounds within the generic scope of the invention which possess activity as agonists of the orexin-1 receptor and/or the orexin-2 receptor. With respect to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinolinyl compounds such as almorexant, the present tetrahydronapthyridine and tetrahydropyridopyrazine compounds exhibit unexpected properties, such as with respect to reduced bioactivation, decreased inhibition of metabolic enzymes (such as decreased cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibition) and/or decreased potential for side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe orexin receptors have been implicated in a wide range of biological functions. This has suggested a potential role for these receptors in a variety of disease processes in humans or other species. The compounds of the present invention have utility in treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with orexin receptors, including one or more of the following conditions or diseases: sleep disorders, sleep disturbances, including enhancing sleep quality, improving sleep quality, increasing sleep efficiency, augmenting sleep maintenance;

The dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be varied, however, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The active ingredient may be administered to patients (animals and human) in need of such treatment in dosages that will provide optimal pharmaceutical efficacy. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment. The dose will vary from patient to patient depending upon the nature and severity of disease, the patient's weight, special diets then being followed by a patient, concurrent medication, and other factors which those skilled in the art will recognize. Generally, dosage levels of between 0.0001 to 10 mg/kg. of body weight daily are administered to the patient, e.g., humans and elderly humans, to obtain effective antagonism of orexin receptors. The dosage range will generally be about 0.5 mg to 1.0 g. per patient per day which may be administered in single or multiple doses. In one embodiment, the dosage range will be about 0.5 mg to 500 mg per patient per day; in another embodiment about 0.5 mg to 200 mg per patient per day; and in yet another embodiment about 5 mg to 50 mg per patient per day. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be provided in a solid dosage formulation such as comprising about 0.5 mg to 500 mg active ingredient, or comprising about 1 mg to 250 mg active ingredient. The pharmaceutical composition may be provided in a solid dosage formulation comprising about 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 30 mg, 50 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg or 250 mg active ingredient. For oral administration, the compositions may be provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, such as 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 750, 800, 900, and 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, such as once or twice per day. The compounds may be administered before bedtime. For example, the compounds may be administered about 1 Hour prior to bedtime, about 30 minutes prior to bedtime or immediately before bedtime.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with one or more other drugs in the treatment, prevention, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of diseases or conditions for which compounds of the present invention or the other drugs may have utility, where the combination of the drugs together are safer or more effective than either drug alone. Such other drug(s) may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of the present invention. When a compound of the present invention is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of the present invention is contemplated. However, the combination therapy may also includes therapies in which the compound of the present invention and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compounds of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of the present invention. The above combinations include combinations of a compound of the present invention not only with one other active compound, but also with two or more other active compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with other drugs that are used in the prevention, treatment, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of the diseases or conditions for which compounds of the present invention are useful. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of the present invention. When a compound of the present invention is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition containing such other drugs in addition to the compound of the present invention is contemplated. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that also contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe weight ratio of the compound of the compound of the present invention to the second active ingredient may be varied and will depend upon the effective dose of each ingredient. Generally, an effective dose of each will be used. Thus, for example, when a compound of the present invention is combined with another agent, the weight ratio of the compound of the present invention to the other agent will generally range from about 1000:1 to about 1:1000, such as about 200:1 to about 1:200. Combinations of a compound of the present invention and other active ingredients will generally also be within the aforementioned range, but in each case, an effective dose of each active ingredient should be used. In such combinations the compound of the present invention and other active agents may be administered separately or in conjunction. In addition, the administration of one element may be prior to, concurrent to, or subsequent to the administration of other agent(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be administered in conbination with other compounds which are known in the art to be useful for enhancing sleep quality and preventing and treating sleep disorders and sleep disturbances, including e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, antianxiety agents, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, cyclopyrrolones, GABA agonists, 5HT-2 antagonists including 5HT-2A antagonists and 5HT-2A/2C antagonists, histamine antagonists including histamine H3 antagonists, histamine H3 inverse agonists, imidazopyridines, minor tranquilizers, melatonin agonists and antagonists, melatonergic agents, other orexin antagonists, orexin agonists, prokineticin agonists and antagonists, pyrazolopyrimidines, T-type calcium channel antagonists, triazolopyridines, and the like, such as: adinazolam, allobarbital, alonimid, alprazolam, amitriptyline, amobarbital, amoxapine, armodafinil, APD-125, bentazepam, benzoctamine, brotizolam, bupropion, busprione, butabarbital, butalbital, capromorelin, capuride, carbocloral, chloral betaine, chloral hydrate, chlordiazepoxide, clomipramine, clonazepam, cloperidone, clorazepate, clorethate, clozapine, conazepam, cyprazepam, desipramine, dexclamol, diazepam, dichloralphenazone, divalproex, diphenhydramine, doxepin, EMD-281014, eplivanserin, estazolam, eszopiclone, ethchlorynol, etomidate, fenobam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, fosazepam, gaboxadol, glutethimide, halazepam, hydroxyzine, ibutamoren, imipramine, indiplon, lithium, lorazepam, lormetazepam, LY-156735, maprotiline, MDL-100907, mecloqualone, melatonin, mephobarbital, meprobamate, methaqualone, methyprylon, midaflur, midazolam, modafinil, nefazodone, NGD-2-73, nisobamate, nitrazepam, nortriptyline, ornortriptyline, oxazepam, paraldehyde, paroxetine, pentobarbital, perlapine, perphenazine, phenelzine, phenobarbital, prazepam, promethazine, propofol, protriptyline, quazepam, ramelteon, reclazepam, roletamide, secobarbital, sertraline, suproclone, TAK-375, temazepam, thioridazine, tiagabine, tracazolate, tranylcypromaine, trazodone, triazolam, trepipam, tricetamide, triclofos, trifluoperazine, trimetozine, trimipramine, uldazepam, venlafaxine, zaleplon, zolazepam, zopiclone, zolpidem, and salts thereof, and combinations thereof, and the like, or the compound of the present invention may be administered in conjunction with the use of physical methods such as with light therapy or electrical stimulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the subject compound may be employed in combination with other compounds which are known in the art, either administered separately or in the same pharmaceutical compositions, include, but are not limited to: insulin sensitizers including (i) PPARγ antagonists such as glitazones (e.g. ciglitazone;
