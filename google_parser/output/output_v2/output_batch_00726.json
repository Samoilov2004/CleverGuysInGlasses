No. 60/993,053, filed Sep. 7, 2007, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to amino acid sequences that block the interaction between (a target on) an antigen presenting cell (APC) and (a target on) a T-cell. More particularly, the present invention relates to amino acid sequences that are directed against (as defined herein) a target on an APC (also referred to herein as “APC target”) or a target on a T-cell (also referred to herein as “T-cell target”), in particular, against targets that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]). The invention further relates to compounds or constructs, and in particular proteins and polypeptides, that comprise or essentially consist of one or more such amino acid sequences (also referred to herein as “amino acid sequences of the invention”, “compounds of the invention”, and “polypeptides of the invention”, respectively).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to nucleic acids encoding such amino acid sequences and polypeptides (also referred to herein as “nucleic acids of the invention” or “nucleotide sequences of the invention”); to methods for preparing such amino acid sequences and polypeptides; to host cells expressing or capable of expressing such amino acid sequences or polypeptides; to compositions, and in particular to pharmaceutical compositions, that comprise such amino acid sequences, polypeptides, nucleic acids and/or host cells; and to uses of such amino acid sequences or polypeptides, nucleic acids, host cells and/or compositions, in particular for prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, such as the prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic purposes mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther aspects, embodiments, advantages and applications of the invention will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCostimulatory molecules are expressed on the membrane of activated antigen presenting cells (APC) such as dendritic cells, macrophages or B-cells. The presence of co-stimulatory molecules on the APC is required (“\nsignal\n 2”) alongside antigenic peptide in the context of the MHC molecule (“\nsignal\n 1”) to obtain efficient stimulation of naïve antigen reactive T-cells. The presence of costimulatory molecules is sensed by receptors on the surface of the T-cell. Selective blockade of the interaction of such costimulatory molecules with their cognate activating receptor (such as CD28) on the T-cell may therefore inhibit T-cell activation (Howard et al., Current Drug Targets—Inflammation & Allergy 4: 85, 2005; Stuart and Racke, Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 6: 275-89, 2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) are by far the best studied costimulatory molecules and are members of the B7:CD28 superfamily. The B7:CD28/CTLA-4 pathway has a pivotal role in regulating T-cell activation and tolerance. The B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) co-stimulatory molecules provide a major signal for augmenting and sustaining T-cell responses through interaction with CD28, but deliver inhibitory signals when they engage a second, higher affinity receptor on T cells, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4 or CD152) (Alegre et al. Nat. Immunol. Rev. 1:220, 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCTLA4 or CD152 is another receptor on T-cells for both CD80 and CD86. Unlike CD28, however, interaction of CD152 with CD80 and/or CD86 does not lead to T-cell activation. CD152 is thought to interact with both CD80 and CD86 with a higher affinity than CD28, and may therefore serve as a decoy receptor for CD28, depriving the latter of its ligands and therefore indirectly decreasing T-cell activation (Collins et al., Immunity 17: 201, 2002). Alternatively, CD152 may also transduce a negative signal into the T-cell, leading to lower overall levels of T-cell activation. Regardless of the mechanism, the activity of CD152 signaling leads to a dampening of T-cell responses, especially late (48-72H) after T-cell stimulation when surface CD152 expression becomes high (Oosterwegel et al. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 11: 294, 1999.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe B7-1/B7-2:CD28/CTLA-4 pathway is the best characterized T-cell co-stimulatory pathway and has a critical role in regulating T cell activation and tolerance. Additional B7 and CD28 family members, however, have been identified (\nFIG. 1\n), and two new pathways have been delineated: (a) one pathway involving inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) that interacts with a ligand that we call ICOS ligand (but is also known as B7h, GL50, B7RP-1, LICO, and B7-H2) and (b) a second pathway involving the PD-1 receptor that interacts with two new B7 family members, PD-L1 and PD-L2. In addition, there is another B7 homolog, B7-H3 (whose receptor remains to be identified), which suggests that there are still additional pathways within the B7:CD28 superfamily to be identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies of ICOS pathway blockade suggest that this pathway may be an attractive target for blocking chronic inflammation. Because ICOS co-stimulation is important for IL-10 production, ICOS may be important for T-cell tolerance, when IL-10-producing T regulatory cells have a role in T-cell tolerance. Because CD28 and ICOS have both synergistic and overlapping effects, combination therapy may be advantageous, particularly for inhibiting established immune responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phenotype of PD-1\n−/−\n mice implicates PD-1 in down-regulating immune responses and regulating tolerance of peripheral T or B cells or both. PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in nonlymphoid tissues suggests that this pathway regulates inflammatory responses in peripheral tissues. Further studies are needed to elucidate PD-L1 and PD-L2 functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause the B7:CD28 superfamily pathways deliver signals necessary for T-cell activation, there has been great interest in manipulating this pathway for therapy. Blockade could inhibit undesired T-cell responses occurring during autoimmunity, transplant rejection, or allergy, whereas stimulation through this pathway could promote T-cell responses for tumor and vaccine immunity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivated self-antigen directed T-cells are responsible for at least part of the tissue damage in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatiod arthritis or multiple sclerosis by virtue of their effector function, and indirectly for production of high-affinity self-reactive antibodies by providing “help” to B-cells. Thus, blockade of the interaction of CD80 and/or CD86 with CD28 can be therapeutic in autoimmune conditions. These principles have been firmly established in both animal models of human disease, as well as in man, by using either blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against CD80 or CD86, or using soluble forms of their receptor (Stuart and Racke, 2002). CTLA-4 immunoglobulin (CTLA4-Ig), a soluble form of CTLA4, which blocks the interactions of B7-1 and B7-2 with both CD28 and CTLA-4, has entered clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis (abatacept; Webb et al. European Journal of Immunology 26: 2320-2328, 1996), multiple sclerosis (Adorini, New Trends in Clinical and Experimental Immunosuppression—Fourth International Conference, Geneva, Switzerland, 17-20 Feb. 2000), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Website pipeline RepliGen, 2006, Jan. 9). A primatized anti-B7-1 antibody (IDEC-114), genetically engineered from cynomolgus macaque monkey and human components, is being developed as a novel treatment for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and is currently undergoing phase I/II trials in patients with psoriasis (Gottlieb et al. J. Investigative Dermatology 114: 840, 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nICOS blockade during the effector phase of EAE, an animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS), can inhibit disease progression and ameliorate EAE (Rottman et al., Nat. Immunol. 2: 605-611, 2001), which suggests that ICOS co-stimulation has a key role in sustaining effector Th1 cells. When B7:CD28 interactions are blocked during the effector phase, EAE is transient and mild. Thus, B7:CD28 interactions are also critical for sustaining effector T cells. However, the effects of CD28 signaling are mainly on T-cell expansion, whereas ICOS mainly affects effector cytokine production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPathway antagonists have also been shown to enable long-term graft survival and suppress autoimmunity (Salama et al., J. Clin. Invest. 108: 943, 2001). A mutant form of CTLA4-Ig (betalacept), for example, is also being developed for the prevention of acute rejection and maintenance therapy of kidney transplants (Larsen et al., Am. J. Transplantation 5: 443, 2005). In a Th1-mediated cardiac allograft rejection model, blockade or elimination of ICOS co-stimulation prolongs acute cardiac allograft survival and suppresses intragraft cytokine production, particularly IFN-g and IL-10 (Ozkaynak E, et al., Nat. Immunol. 2: 591-596, 2001). ICOS blockade also prevents transplant arteriosclerosis that develops when the CD40:CD40L pathway is blocked (Ozkaynak et al., Nat. Immunol. 2: 591-596, 2001). B7:CD28 blockade similarly prevents graft arteriosclerosis (Furukawa et al., Am. J. Pathol. 157: 473-484, 2000). Thus, ICOS and CD28 similarly promote inflammation underlying graft arteriopathy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlocking CD152 signaling by the use of monoclonal antibodies blocking its interaction with CD80 and/or CD86 increases the level of T-cell activation in vivo, and this has been demonstrated to be beneficial as an adjunct treatment in tumor vaccine therapies. A fully human monoclonal antibody against CTLA4 (Keler et al., J. Immunol. 171: 6251, 2003; Longber, Human antibodies 12: 1, 2003) has entered phase III clinical trials in patients with metastatic melanoma. Since inhibition of CTLA4 signaling leads to very different outcomes than CD28 blockade during T-cell activation, it may be beneficial to design a CD80 and/or CD86 neutralizing therapeutic entity which inhibits the interaction of CD80 and/or CD86 with CD28 but not CTLA4, or vice versa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCD80 and CD86 are also present at high levels on many lymphomas of B-cell origin. Thus, monoclonal antibodies, fragments thereof and other proteins binding CD80 and/or CD86 can be useful in the therapy of such tumors, either by recruiting effector functions, induction of cell death or as a targeting entity in immunotoxin- or radiotoxin conjugates (Friedberg et al., Blood 106: 11, Abs 2435, 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults of studies in murine models of virus and parasite infections have suggested synergies between ICOS and CD28. ICOS blockade in CD28\n−/−\n mice further reduced Th1/Th2 polarization in viral and parasitic infection models (Kopf et al., J. Exp. Med. 192: 53-61, 2000). ICOS-Ig abrogated IFN-g production by virus-specific T cells from LCMV-infected CD28\n−/−\n mice. ICOS can regulate both CD28-dependent and CD28-independent CD4\n+\n subset responses. CTLA-4 can oppose T-cell activation by either CD28 or ICOS. A phase I/II clinical trial has been initiated for HIV infection with a fully human monoclonal antibody against CTLA4 (Keler et al., J. Immunol. 171: 6251, 2003; Longber, Human antibodies 12: 1, 2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough CD80 and CD86 have at least partially redundant roles, it is clear that blockade of one or the other can have differential effects. For example, in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it has been demonstrated that blockade of CD80 by monoclonal antibodies can have beneficial effects on disease progression whereas treatments by CD86 blockade does not have a strong beneficial effect in this model. Importantly, the beneficial effect of CD80 blockade by monoclonal antibody is highly dependent on the time of treatment versus disease induction. Recently, it was also demonstrated that treatment with a monovalent (Fab) form of a blocking anti-CD80 monoclonal antibody dramatically improves disease in EAE, and treatment efficacy is not dependent on the time of treatment initiation (Podojil et al., J. Immunol. 177: 2948, 2006). This indicates that a strict monomeric CD80 blocking entity such as a Nanobody® or dAb might be advantageous over a bivalent anti-CD80 monoclonal antibody, illustrating that there is a need for alternative or improved amino acid sequences that can be used for modulating the interaction between cells of the immune system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention solves this problem by providing amino acid sequences, polypeptides and compositions that can generally be used to modulate, and in particular inhibit and/or prevent, binding of an APC target to a T-cell target (or vice-versa), and thus to modulate, and in particular inhibit or prevent, the signalling that is mediated by said APC target and/or said T-cell target, to modulate the biological pathways in which said APC target and/or said T-cell targets is involved, and/or to modulate the biological mechanisms, responses and effects associated with such signalling or these pathways.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the amino acid sequence, polypeptide or composition of the invention may increase T-cell survival. Without being limiting, in this aspect of the invention, T-cell survival is preferably increased to more than 50% T-cell survival, such as 50-100% T-cell survival, more preferably 70-100% T-cell survival, even more preferably 80-100% T-cell survival, such as 90-100% T-cell survival.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the amino acid sequence, polypeptide or composition of the invention may decrease T-cell survival. Without being limiting, in this aspect of the invention, T-cell survival is preferably decreased to less than 50% T-cell survival, such as 0-50% T-cell survival, more preferably 0-30% T-cell survival, even more preferably 20-50% T-cell survival, such as 0-10% T-cell survival. In yet another aspect, the amino acid sequence, polypeptide or composition of the invention may increase differentiation of naive T-cells into activated cytokine secreting T-cells. Without being limiting, in this aspect of the invention, differentiation is preferably increased by more than 50% of the naive T-cells, such as 50-100% of the naive T-cells, more preferably 70-100% of the naive T-cells, even more preferably 80-100% of the naive T-cells, such as 90-100% of the naive T-cells. In yet another aspect, the amino acid sequence, polypeptide or composition of the invention may decrease differentiation of naive T-cells into activated cytokine secreting T-cells. Without being limiting, in this aspect of the invention, differentiation is preferably decreased to less than 50% of the naive T-cells, such as 0-50% of the naive T-cells, more preferably, 0-30% of the naive T-cells, even more preferably 0-20% of the naive T-cells, such as 0-10% of the naive T-cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs such, the polypeptides and compositions of the present invention can be used for the prevention and treatment (as defined herein) of autoimmune diseases, allergy and asthma, transplant rejections (acute and chronic), cancer and tumors, effector cell exhaustion, and/or infections.

and to provide methods for the diagnosis, prevention and/or treatment of such diseases and disorders that involve the administration and/or the use of such therapeutic proteins and compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, it is a specific object of the present invention to provide amino acid sequences that are directed against (as defined herein) an APC target or a T-cell target, in particular against an APC target or a T-cell target from a warm-blooded animal, more in particular against an APC target or a T-cell target from a mammal, and especially against a human APC target or T-cell target;

as well as compounds and constructs, and in particular proteins and polypeptides, that comprise at least one such amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore in particular, the invention provides amino acid sequences that can bind to an APC target or a T-cell target with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K\nD\n-value (actual or apparent), a K\nA\n-value (actual or apparent), a k\non\n-rate and/or a k\noff\n-rate, or alternatively as an IC\n50 \nvalue, as further described herein) that is as defined herein; as well as compounds and constructs, and in particular proteins and polypeptides, that comprise at least one such amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are preferably such that they:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nbind to an APC target or a T-cell target with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 10\n−5 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less, and preferably 10\n−7 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less and more preferably 10\n−8 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter (i.e. with an association constant (K\nA\n) of 10\n5 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more, and preferably 10\n7 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more and more preferably 10\n8 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles);\n\n\nand/or such that they:\n\n \nbind to an APC target or a T-cell target with a k\non\n-rate of between 10\n2 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nto about 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, preferably between 10\n3 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, more preferably between 10\n4 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, such as between 10\n5 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1\nS\n−1\n;\n\n\nand/or such that they:\n\n \nbind to an APC target or a T-cell target with a k\noff \nrate between 1 s\n−1 \n(t\n1/2\n=0.69 s) and 10\n−6 \ns\n−1 \n(providing a near irreversible complex with a t\n1/2 \nof multiple days), preferably between 10\n−2 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, more preferably between 10\n−3 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, such as between 10\n−4 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferably, a monovalent amino acid sequence of the invention (or a polypeptide that contains only one amino acid sequence of the invention) is preferably such that it will bind to an APC target or a T-cell target with an affinity less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 μM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred IC50 values for binding of the amino acid sequences or polypeptides of the invention to an APC target or a T-cell target will become clear from the further description and examples herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor binding to an APC target or a T-cell target, an amino acid sequence of the invention will usually contain within its amino acid sequence one or more amino acid residues or one or more stretches of amino acid residues (i.e. with each “stretch” comprising two or amino acid residues that are adjacent to each other or in close proximity to each other, i.e. in the primary or tertiary structure of the amino acid sequence) via which the amino acid sequence of the invention can bind to said APC target or said T-cell target, which amino acid residues or stretches of amino acid residues thus form the “site” for binding to said APC target or said T-cell target (also referred to herein as the “antigen binding site”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences provided by the invention are preferably in essentially isolated form (as defined herein), or form part of a protein or polypeptide of the invention (as defined herein), which may comprise or essentially consist of one or more amino acid sequences of the invention and which may optionally further comprise one or more further amino acid sequences (all optionally linked via one or more suitable linkers). For example, and without limitation, the one or more amino acid sequences of the invention may be used as a binding unit in such a protein or polypeptide, which may optionally contain one or more further amino acid sequences that can serve as a binding unit (i.e. against one or more other targets than the one or more APC target or the one or more T-cell target), so as to provide a monovalent, multivalent or multispecific polypeptide of the invention, respectively, all as described herein. Such a protein or polypeptide may also be in essentially isolated form (as defined herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, a polypeptide comprising only one amino acid of the invention may be advantageous and preferred over polypeptides comprising two or more amino acids of the invention. A monovalent (Fab) anti-CD80 monoclonal antibody, for example, proved to be much more efficient for improving EAE compared to the corresponding bivalent monoclonal antibody (Podojil et al., see supra). Therefore, in this preferred aspect, the invention relates to a monovalent polypeptide comprising only one amino acid sequence of the invention or else, to a multivalent or multispecific polypeptide comprising one amino acid of the invention and one or more other binding units (i.e. against one or more other targets than the one or more APC target or the one or more T-cell target) as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention as such preferably essentially consist of a single amino acid chain that is not linked via disulphide bridges to any other amino acid sequence or chain (but that may or may not contain one or more intramolecular disulphide bridges. For example, it is known that Nanobodies—as described herein—may sometimes contain a disulphide bridge between CDR3 and CDR1 or FR2). However, it should be noted that one or more amino acid sequences of the invention may be linked to each other and/or to other amino acid sequences (e.g. via disulphide bridges) to provide peptide constructs that may also be useful in the invention (for example Fab′ fragments, F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments, ScFv constructs, “diabodies” and other multispecific constructs. Reference is for example made to the review by Holliger and Hudson, Nat Biotechnol. 2005 September; 23(9):1126-36).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, when an amino acid sequence of the invention (or a compound, construct or polypeptide comprising the same) is intended for administration to a subject (for example for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes as described herein), it is preferably either an amino acid sequence that does not occur naturally in said subject; or, when it does occur naturally in said subject, in essentially isolated form (as defined herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will also be clear to the skilled person that for pharmaceutical use, the amino acid sequences of the invention (as well as compounds, constructs and polypeptides comprising the same) are preferably directed against a human APC target or T-cell target; whereas for veterinary purposes, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are preferably directed against an APC target or a T-cell target from the species to be treated, or at least cross-reactive with the APC target or T-cell target from the species to be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, an amino acid sequence of the invention may optionally, and in addition to the at least one binding site for binding against the APC target or T-cell target, contain one or more further binding sites for binding against other antigens, proteins or targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe efficacy of the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention, and of compositions comprising the same, can be tested using any suitable in vitro assay, cell-based assay, in vivo assay and/or animal model known per se, or any combination thereof, depending on the specific disease or disorder involved. Suitable assays and animal models will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include binding assays such as surface plasmon resonance, e.g. implemented in the BIAcore (BIAcore AB, St. Albans, UK), the equilibrium binding assay as described by van der Merwe et al. (J. Exp. Med. 185: 393, 1997) and other binding assays such as for example described in Collins et al. (Immunity 17: 201, 2002); a T-cell activation assay as e.g. described in Podojil et al. J. Immunol. 177: 2948, 2006); animal models such as experimental autoimmune glomerulonephritis (EAG), an animal model of human anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease (Reynolds et al., J. Clin. Invest. 105: 643-51, 2000), the MRL-lpr/lpr mice, a model for lupus nephritis (Liang et al., J. Immunol. 165: 3436-43, 2000), experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), an autoimmune model for MS (Kuchroo et al., Cell 80: 707-18, 1995; Podojil et al., J. Immunol. 177: 2948, 2006; Girvin et al., J. Immunol. 164: 136-43, 2000; Rottman et al., Nat. Immunol. 2: 605-611, 2001), susceptible nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice (Lenschow et al., J. Exp. Med. 181: 1145-55, 1995; Lenschow et al., Immunity 5: 285-93, 1996, Erratum in: Immunity 6(2): following 215, 1997), the cutaneous leishmaniasis model as described in Corry et al. (J. Immunol. 153: 4142-8, 1994), the Cardiac allograft rejection model described in Ozkaynak et al. (Nat. Immunol. 2: 591-6, 2001) and Furukawa et al. (Am. J. Pathol. 157: 473, 2000), the vaccinated primate model as described by Rollier et al. (2007, Hepatology 45: 602) and other models known to the skilled person such as referred to, for example, in Yamada et al., J. Am Soc. Nephrol. 13: 559, 2002, as well as the assays and animal models used in the experimental part below and in the prior art cited herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, according to the invention, amino acid sequences and polypeptides that are directed against an APC target or a T-cell target from a first species of warm-blooded animal may or may not show cross-reactivity with said APC target or a T-cell target from one or more other species of warm-blooded animal. For example, amino acid sequences and polypeptides directed against a human APC target or T-cell target may or may not show cross reactivity with an APC target or a T-cell target from one or more other species of primates (such as, without limitation, monkeys from the genus \nMacaca \n(such as, and in particular, cynomologus monkeys (\nMacaca fascicularis\n) and/or rhesus monkeys (\nMacaca mulatta\n)) and baboon (\nPapio ursinus\n)) and/or with an APC target or a T-cell target from one or more species of animals that are often used in animal models for diseases (for example mouse, rat, rabbit, pig or dog), and in particular in animal models for diseases and disorders associated with an APC target or a T-cell target (such as the species and animal models mentioned herein). In this respect, it will be clear to the skilled person that such cross-reactivity, when present, may have advantages from a drug development point of view, since it allows the amino acid sequences and polypeptides against a human APC target or T-cell target to be tested in such disease models.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore generally, amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention that are cross-reactive with an APC target or a T-cell target from multiple species of mammal will usually be advantageous for use in veterinary applications, since it will allow the same amino acid sequence or polypeptide to be used across multiple species. Thus, it is also encompassed within the scope of the invention that amino acid sequences and polypeptides directed against an APC target or a T-cell target from one species of animal (such as amino acid sequences and polypeptides against a human APC target or T-cell target) can be used in the treatment of another species of animal, as long as the use of the amino acid sequences and/or polypeptides provide the desired effects in the species to be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is in its broadest sense also not particularly limited to or defined by a specific antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) of an APC target or a T-cell target against which the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are directed. For example, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides may or may not be directed against an “interaction site” (as defined herein).However, it is generally assumed and preferred that the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are preferably directed against an interaction site (as defined herein), and in particular against the site on their target by which said target interacts with its receptor or ligand, i.e. e.g. for B7-1 and B7-2, the site on B7-1 and B7-2 respectively that interacts with CD28 or the site on B7-1 and B7-2 respectively that interacts with CTLA4 (Ellis et al. J. Immunol. 156(8): 2700-9, 1996; Stamper et al., Nature 410: 608-11, 2001, Erratum in: Nature 411: 617, 2001; Schwartz et al., Nature 410: 604-8, 2001; Ikemizu et al., Immunity. 12(1): 51-60, 2000; Zhang et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 100: 2586, 2003), for B7RP-1, the site on B7RP-1 that interacts with ICOS, for PD-L1 and PD-L2, the site on PD-L1 and PD-L2 respectively that interacts with PD-1 and for B7H-3 and B7x, the site on B7H-3 and B7x respectively that interacts with BTLA, for CD28, the site on CD28 that interacts with B7-1 and/or B7-2, for CTLA4, the site on CTLA4 that interacts with B7-1 and/or B7-2, for ICOS, the site on ICOS that interacts with B7RP-1, for PD-1, the site on PD-1 that interacts with PD-L1 and/or PD-L2, for BTLA, the site on BTLA that interacts with B7H-3 and/or B7x. Thus, in one preferred, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are directed against the site on the APC target or on the T-cell target by which said target interacts with its receptor or ligand respectively, and are as further defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElse, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are preferably directed against a site on their target in the proximity of the site by which said target interacts with its receptor or ligand respectively, as to provide some sterical hindrance for the interaction of the target with its receptor or ligand. Preferably, the site against which the amino acids and polypeptides of the invention are directed is such that binding of the target to its receptor or ligand is modulated, and in particular inhibited or prevented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are directed against a site on B7-1 such that the interaction of B7-1 with CD28 is modulated, and in particular inhibited or prevented.

Generally, such polypeptides will bind to the APC target or a T-cell with increased avidity compared to a single amino acid sequence of the invention. Such a polypeptide may for example comprise two amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against the same antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) of the APC target or a T-cell (which may or may not be an interaction site); or comprise at least one “first” amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a first antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) of the APC target or a T-cell (which may or may not be an interaction site); and at least one “second” amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a second antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) different from the first (and which again may or may not be an interaction site). Preferably, in such “biparatopic” polypeptides of the invention, at least one amino acid sequence of the invention is directed against an interaction site (as defined herein), although the invention in its broadest sense is not limited thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, when the target is part of a binding pair (for example, a receptor-ligand binding pair), the amino acid sequences and polypeptides may be such that they compete with the cognate binding partner (e.g. the ligand, receptor or other binding partner, as applicable) for binding to the target, and/or such that they (fully or partially) neutralize binding of the binding partner to the target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also within the scope of the invention that, where applicable, an amino acid sequence of the invention can bind to two or more antigenic determinants, epitopes, parts, domains, subunits or confirmations of an APC target or a T-cell target. In such a case, the antigenic determinants, epitopes, parts, domains or subunits of the APC target or T-cell target to which the amino acid sequences and/or polypeptides of the invention bind may be essentially the same (for example, if the APC target or T-cell target contains repeated structural motifs or occurs in a multimeric form) or may be different (and in the latter case, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to such different antigenic determinants, epitopes, parts, domains, subunits of the APC target or T-cell target with an affinity and/or specificity which may be the same or different). Also, for example, when an APC target or a T-cell target exists in an activated conformation and in an inactive conformation, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to either one of these confirmation, or may bind to both these confirmations (i.e. with an affinity and/or specificity which may be the same or different). Also, for example, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to a conformation of an APC target or a T-cell target in which it is bound to a pertinent ligand, may bind to a conformation of an APC target or a T-cell target in which it not bound to a pertinent ligand, or may bind to both such conformations (again with an affinity and/or specificity which may be the same or different).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also expected that the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention will generally bind to all naturally occurring or synthetic analogs, variants, mutants, alleles, parts and fragments of an APC target or a T-cell target; or at least to those analogs, variants, mutants, alleles, parts and fragments of an APC target or a T-cell target that contain one or more antigenic determinants or epitopes that are essentially the same as the antigenic determinant(s) or epitope(s) to which the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention bind in the APC target or T-cell target (e.g. in wild-type APC target or T-cell target). Again, in such a case, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to such analogs, variants, mutants, alleles, parts and fragments with an affinity and/or specificity that are the same as, or that are different from (i.e. higher than or lower than), the affinity and specificity with which the amino acid sequences of the invention bind to (wild-type) APC target or T-cell target. It is also included within the scope of the invention that the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention bind to some analogs, variants, mutants, alleles, parts and fragments of an APC target or a T-cell target, but not to others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen an APC target or a T-cell target exists in a monomeric form and in one or more multimeric forms, it is within the scope of the invention that the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention only bind to the APC target or T-cell target in monomeric form, only bind to the APC target or T-cell target in multimeric form, or bind to both the monomeric and the multimeric form. Again, in such a case, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to the monomeric form with an affinity and/or specificity that are the same as, or that are different from (i.e. higher than or lower than), the affinity and specificity with which the amino acid sequences of the invention bind to the multimeric form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, when the APC target or T-cell target can associate with other proteins or polypeptides to form protein complexes (e.g. with multiple subunits), it is within the scope of the invention that the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention bind to the APC target or T-cell target in its non-associated state, bind to the APC target or T-cell target in its associated state, or bind to both. In all these cases, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to such multimers or associated protein complexes with an affinity and/or specificity that may be the same as or different from (i.e. higher than or lower than) the affinity and/or specificity with which the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention bind to the APC target or T-cell target in its monomeric and non-associated state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, as will be clear to the skilled person, proteins or polypeptides that contain two or more amino acid sequences directed against an APC target or a T-cell target may bind with higher avidity to the APC target or T-cell target than the corresponding monomeric amino acid sequence(s). For example, and without limitation, proteins or polypeptides that contain two or more amino acid sequences directed against different epitopes of an APC target or a T-cell target may (and usually will) bind with higher avidity than each of the different monomers, and proteins or polypeptides that contain two or more amino acid sequences directed against the APC target or T-cell target may (and usually will) bind also with higher avidity to a multimer of the APC target or T-cell target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention will at least bind to those forms of the APC target or T-cell target (including monomeric, multimeric and associated forms) that are the most relevant from a biological and/or therapeutic point of view, as will be clear to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also within the scope of the invention to use parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles and/or derivatives of the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention, and/or to use proteins or polypeptides comprising or essentially consisting of one or more of such parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles and/or derivatives, as long as these are suitable for the uses envisaged herein. Such parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles and/or derivatives will usually contain (at least part of) a functional antigen-binding site for binding against the APC target or T-cell target; and more preferably will be capable of specific binding to the APC target or T-cell target, and even more preferably capable of binding to the APC target or T-cell target with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K\nD\n-value (actual or apparent), a K\nA\n-value (actual or apparent), a k\non\n-rate and/or a k\noff\n-rate, or alternatively as an IC\n50 \nvalue, as further described herein) that is as defined herein. Some non-limiting examples of such parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles, derivatives, proteins and/or polypeptides will become clear from the further description herein. Additional fragments or polypeptides of the invention may also be provided by suitably combining (i.e. by linking or genetic fusion) one or more (smaller) parts or fragments as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, which will be further described herein, such analogs, mutants, variants, alleles, derivatives have an increased half-life in serum (as further described herein) compared to the amino acid sequence from which they have been derived. For example, an amino acid sequence of the invention may be linked (chemically or otherwise) to one or more groups or moieties that extend the half-life (such as PEG), so as to provide a derivative of an amino acid sequence of the invention with increased half-life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequence of the invention may be an amino acid sequence that comprises an immunoglobulin fold or may be an amino acid sequence that, under suitable conditions (such as physiological conditions) is capable of forming an immunoglobulin fold (i.e. by folding). Reference is inter alia made to the review by Halaby et al., J. (1999) Protein Eng. 12, 563-71. Preferably, when properly folded so as to form an immunoglobulin fold, such an amino acid sequence is capable of specific binding (as defined herein) to the APC target or T-cell target; and more preferably capable of binding to the APC target or T-cell target with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K\nD\n-value (actual or apparent), a K\nA\n-value (actual or apparent), a k\non\n-rate and/or a k\noff\n-rate, or alternatively as an IC\n50 \nvalue, as further described herein) that is as defined herein. Also, parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles and/or derivatives of such amino acid sequences are preferably such that they comprise an immunoglobulin fold or are capable for forming, under suitable conditions, an immunoglobulin fold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, but without limitation, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be amino acid sequences that essentially consist of 4 framework regions (FR1 to FR4 respectively) and 3 complementarity determining regions (CDR1 to CDR3 respectively); or any suitable fragment of such an amino acid sequence (which will then usually contain at least some of the amino acid residues that form at least one of the CDR's, as further described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences of the invention may in particular be an immunoglobulin sequence or a suitable fragment thereof, and more in particular be an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence or a suitable fragment thereof, such as light chain variable domain sequence (e.g. a V\nL\n-sequence) or a suitable fragment thereof; or a heavy chain variable domain sequence (e.g. a V\nH\n-sequence) or a suitable fragment thereof. When the amino acid sequence of the invention is a heavy chain variable domain sequence, it may be a heavy chain variable domain sequence that is derived from a conventional four-chain antibody (such as, without limitation, a V\nH \nsequence that is derived from a human antibody) or be a so-called V\nHH\n-sequence (as defined herein) that is derived from a so-called “heavy chain antibody” (as defined herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, it should be noted that the invention is not limited as to the origin of the amino acid sequence of the invention (or of the nucleotide sequence of the invention used to express it), nor as to the way that the amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence of the invention is (or has been) generated or obtained. Thus, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be naturally occurring amino acid sequences (from any suitable species) or synthetic or semi-synthetic amino acid sequences. In a specific but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence is a naturally occurring immunoglobulin sequence (from any suitable species) or a synthetic or semi-synthetic immunoglobulin sequence, including but not limited to “humanized” (as defined herein) immunoglobulin sequences (such as partially or fully humanized mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin sequences, and in particular partially or fully humanized V\nHH \nsequences or Nanobodies), “camelized” (as defined herein) immunoglobulin sequences, as well as immunoglobulin sequences that have been obtained by techniques such as affinity maturation (for example, starting from synthetic, random or naturally occurring immunoglobulin sequences), CDR grafting, veneering, combining fragments derived from different immunoglobulin sequences, PCR assembly using overlapping primers, and similar techniques for engineering immunoglobulin sequences well known to the skilled person; or any suitable combination of any of the foregoing. Reference is for example made to the standard handbooks, as well as to the further description and prior art mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, the nucleotide sequences of the invention may be naturally occurring nucleotide sequences or synthetic or semi-synthetic sequences, and may for example be sequences that are isolated by PCR from a suitable naturally occurring template (e.g. DNA or RNA isolated from a cell), nucleotide sequences that have been isolated from a library (and in particular, an expression library), nucleotide sequences that have been prepared by introducing mutations into a naturally occurring nucleotide sequence (using any suitable technique known per se, such as mismatch PCR), nucleotide sequence that have been prepared by PCR using overlapping primers, or nucleotide sequences that have been prepared using techniques for DNA synthesis known per se.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequence of the invention may in particular be a domain antibody (or an amino acid sequence that is suitable for use as a domain antibody), a single domain antibody (or an amino acid sequence that is suitable for use as a single domain antibody), a “dAb” (or an amino acid sequence that is suitable for use as a dAb) or a Nanobody® (as defined herein, and including but not limited to a V\nHH \nsequence); other single variable domains, or any suitable fragment of any one thereof. For a general description of (single) domain antibodies, reference is also made to the prior art cited above, as well as to \nEP\n 0 368 684. For the term “dAb's”, reference is for example made to Ward et al. (Nature 1989 Oct. 12; 341 (6242): 544-6), to Holt et al., Trends Biotechnol., 2003, 21(11):484-490; as well as to for example WO 06/030220, WO 06/003388 and other published patent applications of Domantis Ltd. It should also be noted that, although less preferred in the context of the present invention because they are not of mammalian origin, single domain antibodies or single variable domains can be derived from certain species of shark (for example, the so-called “IgNAR domains”, see for example WO 05/18629).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the amino acid sequence of the invention may be a Nanobody® (as defined herein) or a suitable fragment thereof. [Note: Nanobody®, Nanobodies® and Nanoclone® are registered trademarks of Ablynx N. V.] Such Nanobodies directed against an APC target or a T-cell target will also be referred to herein as “Nanobodies of the invention”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor a general description of Nanobodies, reference is made to the further description below, as well as to the prior art cited herein. In this respect, it should however be noted that this description and the prior art mainly described Nanobodies of the so-called “\nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 class” (i.e. Nanobodies with a high degree of sequence homology to human germline sequences of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 class such as DP-47, DP-51 or DP-29), which Nanobodies form a preferred aspect of this invention. It should however be noted that the invention in its broadest sense generally covers any type of Nanobody directed against an APC target or a T-cell target, and for example also covers the Nanobodies belonging to the so-called “\nV\n \n \n \nH\n4 class” (i.e. Nanobodies with a high degree of sequence homology to human germline sequences of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n4 class such as DP-78), as for example described in the U.S. \nprovisional application\n 60/792,279 by Ablynx N. V. entitled “\nDP\n-78-\nlike Nanobodies\n” filed on Apr. 14, 2006 (see also PCT/EP2007/003259).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, Nanobodies (in particular V\nHH \nsequences and partially humanized Nanobodies) can in particular be characterized by the presence of one or more “Hallmark residues” (as described herein) in one or more of the framework sequences (again as further described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, generally, a Nanobody can be defined as an amino acid sequence with the (general) structure\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4\n\n\nin which FR1 to FR4 refer to \nframework regions\n 1 to 4, respectively, and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the \ncomplementarity determining regions\n 1 to 3, respectively, and in which one or more of the Hallmark residues are as further defined herein.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn particular, a Nanobody can be an amino acid sequence with the (general) structure\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4\n\n\n \n \nin which FR1 to FR4 refer to \nframework regions\n 1 to 4, respectively, and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the \ncomplementarity determining regions\n 1 to 3, respectively, and in which the framework sequences are as further defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore in particular, a Nanobody can be an amino acid sequence with the (general) structure\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4\n\n\nin which FR1 to FR4 refer to \nframework regions\n 1 to 4, respectively, and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the \ncomplementarity determining regions\n 1 to 3, respectively, and in which:\n\n \n \n \ni) preferably one or more of the amino acid residues at \n \npositions\n \n 11, 37, 44, 45, 47, 83, 84, 103, 104 and 108 according to the Kabat numbering are chosen from the Hallmark residues mentioned in Table A-3 below;\n\n\nand in which:\n\n \nii) said amino acid sequence has at least 80% amino acid identity with at least one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 1 to 22, in which for the purposes of determining the degree of amino acid identity, the amino acid residues that form the CDR sequences (indicated with X in the sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 1 to 22) are disregarded.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn these Nanobodies, the CDR sequences are generally as further defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the invention also relates to such Nanobodies that can bind to (as defined herein) and/or are directed against an APC target or a T-cell target, to suitable fragments thereof, as well as to polypeptides that comprise or essentially consist of one or more of such Nanobodies and/or suitable fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred aspect of the invention, Nanobodies are raised against B7-1 and B7-2. SEQ ID NO's: 266-285 give the amino acid sequences of a number of V\nHH \nsequences that have been raised against B7-1 and B7-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the invention in some specific aspects provides:\n\n \n \n \n \n \namino acid sequences that are directed against (as defined herein) B7-1 and/or B7-2 and that have at least 80%, preferably at least 85%, such as 90% or 95% or more sequence identity with at least one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 266-285. These amino acid sequences may further be such that they neutralize binding of the cognate ligand to B7-1 and/or B7-2; and/or compete with the cognate ligand for binding to B7-1 and/or B7-2; and/or are directed against an interaction site (as defined herein) on B7-1 and/or B7-2 (such as the ligand binding site);\n \namino acid sequences that cross-block (as defined herein) the binding of at least one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 266-285 to B7-1 and/or B7-2 and/or that compete with at least one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 266-285 for binding to B7-1 and/or B7-2. Again, these amino acid sequences may further be such that they neutralize binding of the cognate ligand to B7-1 and/or B7-2; and/or compete with the cognate ligand for binding to B7-1 and/or B7-2; and/or are directed against an interaction site (as defined herein) on B7-1 and/or B7-2 (such as the ligand binding site);\n\n\nwhich amino acid sequences may be as further described herein (and may for example be Nanobodies); as well as polypeptides of the invention that comprise one or more of such amino acid sequences (which may be as further described herein, and may for example be bispecific and/or biparatopic polypeptides as described herein), and nucleic acid sequences that encode such amino acid sequences and polypeptides. Such amino acid sequences and polypeptides do not include any naturally occurring ligands.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn some other specific aspects, the invention provides:\n\n \n \n \n \n \namino acid sequences of the invention that are specific for (as defined herein) B7-1 compared to B7-2;\n \namino acid sequences of the invention that are specific for B7-2 compared to B7-1;\n\n\nwhich amino acid sequences of the invention may be as further described herein (and may for example be Nanobodies); as well as polypeptides of the invention that comprise one or more of such amino acid sequences (which may be as further described herein, and may for example be bispecific and/or biparatopic polypeptides as described herein), and nucleic acid sequences that encode such amino acid sequences and polypeptides. Such amino acid sequences and polypeptides do not include any naturally occurring ligands.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAccordingly, some particularly preferred Nanobodies of the invention are Nanobodies which can bind (as further defined herein) to and/or are directed against B7-1 and/or B7-2 and which:\n\n \n \n \ni) have at least 80% amino acid identity with at least one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 266-285, in which for the purposes of determining the degree of amino acid identity, the amino acid residues that form the CDR sequences are disregarded. In this respect, reference is also made to Table A-1a, which lists the \nframework\n 1 sequences (SEQ ID NO's: 126-145), \nframework\n 2 sequences (SEQ ID NO's: 166-185), \nframework\n 3 sequences (SEQ ID NO's: 206-225) and \nframework\n 4 sequences (SEQ ID NO's: 246-265) of the Nanobodies of SEQ ID NO's: 266-285 (with respect to the amino acid residues at \npositions\n 1 to 4 and 27 to 30 of the \nframework\n 1 sequences, reference is also made to the comments made below.

These streches of amino acid residues may be present in, and/or may be corporated into, an amino acid sequence of the invention, in particular in such a way that they form (part of) the antigen binding site of an amino acid sequence of the invention. As these streches of amino acid residues were first generated as CDR sequences of heavy chain antibodies or V\nHH \nsequences that were raised against the APC target or T-cell target (or may be based on and/or derived from such CDR sequences, as further described herein), they will also generally be referred to herein as “CDR sequences” (i.e. as CDR1 sequences, CDR2 sequences and CDR3 sequences, respectively). It should however be noted that the invention in its broadest sense is not limited to a specific structural role or function that these streches of amino acid residues may have in an amino acid sequence of the invention, as long as these streches of amino acid residues allow the amino acid sequence of the invention to bind to the APC target or a T-cell target. Thus, generally, the invention in its broadest sense comprises any amino acid sequence that is capable of binding to an APC target or a T-cell target and that comprises one or more CDR sequences as described herein, and in particular a suitable combination of two or more such CDR sequences, that are suitably linked to each other via one or more further amino acid sequences, such that the entire amino acid sequence forms a binding domain and/or binding unit that is capable of binding to an APC target or a T-cell target. It should however also be noted that the presence of only one such CDR sequence in an amino acid sequence of the invention may by itself already be sufficient to provide an amino acid sequence of the invention that is capable of binding to the APC target or T-cell target; reference is for example again made to the so-called “Expedite fragments” described in WO 03/050531.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in another specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequence of the invention may be an amino acid sequence that comprises at least one amino acid sequence that is chosen from the group consisting of the CDR1 sequences, CDR2 sequences and CDR3 sequences that are described herein (or any suitable combination thereof). In particular, an amino acid sequence of the invention may be an amino acid sequence that comprises at least one antigen binding site, wherein said antigen binding site comprises at least one amino acid sequence that is chosen from the group consisting of the CDR1 sequences, CDR2 sequences and CDR3 sequences that are described herein (or any suitable combination thereof).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, in this aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence of the invention may be any amino acid sequence that comprises at least one stretch of amino acid residues, in which said stretch of amino acid residues has an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the sequence of at least one of the CDR sequences described herein. Such an amino acid sequence may or may not comprise an immunoglobulin fold. For example, and without limitation, such an amino acid sequence may be a suitable fragment of an immunoglobulin sequence that comprises at least one such CDR sequence, but that is not large enough to form a (complete) immunoglobulin fold (reference is for example again made to the “Expedite fragments” described in WO 03/050531).

For example, a CDR3 sequence may be preceded by (part of) a FR3 sequence and followed by (part of) a FR4 sequence). Such a fragment may also contain a disulphide bridge, and in particular a disulphide bridge that links the two framework regions that precede and follow the CDR sequence, respectively (for the purpose of forming such a disulphide bridge, cysteine residues that naturally occur in said framework regions may be used, or alternatively cysteine residues may be synthetically added to or introduced into said framework regions).

Such a nucleic acid will also be referred to herein as a “nucleic acid of the invention” and may for example be in the form of a genetic construct, as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention relates to a host or host cell that expresses (or that under suitable circumstances is capable of expressing) an amino acid sequence of the invention and/or a polypeptide of the invention; and/or that contains a nucleic acid of the invention. Some preferred but non-limiting examples of such hosts or host cells will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to the use of an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention, or of a composition comprising the same, in (methods or compositions for) modulating an APC target or a T-cell target, in particular, targets that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[“T-cell targets”]), either in vitro (e.g. in an in vitro or cellular assay) or in vivo (e.g. in an a single cell or in a multicellular organism, and in particular in a mammal, and more in particular in a human being, such as in a human being that is at risk of or suffers from a cancers and/or tumors).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to methods for modulating an APC target or a T-cell target, in particular, a target that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]), either in vitro (e.g. in an in vitro or cellular assay) or in vivo (e.g. in an a single cell or multicellular organism, and in particular in a mammal, and more in particular in a human being, such as in a human being that is at risk of or suffers from a cancer and/or tumor), which method comprises at least the step of contacting the APC target or T-cell target, in particular, a target that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]), with at least one amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention, or with a composition comprising the same, in a manner and in an amount suitable to modulate the APC target or T-cell target, in particular, a target that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]), with at least one amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to the use of an one amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in the preparation of a composition (such as, without limitation, a pharmaceutical composition or preparation as further described herein) for modulating an APC target or a T-cell target, in particular, a target that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]), either in vitro (e.g. in an in vitro or cellular assay) or in vivo (e.g. in an a single cell or multicellular organism, and in particular in a mammal, and more in particular in a human being, such as in a human being that is at risk of or suffers from a cancer and/or tumor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of the present invention, “modulating” or “to modulate” generally means either reducing or inhibiting the activity of, or alternatively increasing the activity of, the APC target or T-cell target, in particular, a target that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]), as measured using a suitable in vitro, cellular or in vivo assay (such as those mentioned herein). In particular, “modulating” or “to modulate” may mean either reducing or inhibiting the activity of, or alternatively increasing the activity of the APC target or T-cell target, in particular, a target that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]), as measured using a suitable in vitro, cellular or in vivo assay (such as those mentioned herein), by at least 1%, preferably at least 5%, such as at least 10% or at least 25%, for example by at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or 90% or more, compared to activity of the APC target or T-cell target, in particular, a target that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]), in the same assay under the same conditions but without the presence of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be clear to the skilled person, “modulating” may also involve effecting a change (which may either be an increase or a descrease) in affinity, avidity, specificity and/or selectivity of the APC target or T-cell target, in particular, a target that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]), for one or more of its targets, ligands, receptors or substrates; and/or effecting a change (which may either be an increase or a decrease) in the sensitivity of the APC target or T-cell target, in particular, a target that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]), for one or more conditions in the medium or surroundings in which the APC target or T-cell target, in particular, a target that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]), is present (such as pH, ion strength, the presence of co-factors, etc.), compared to the same conditions but without the presence of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention. As will be clear to the skilled person, this may again be determined in any suitable manner and/or using any suitable assay known per se, such as the assays described herein or in the prior art cited herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Modulating” may also mean effecting a change (i.e. an activity as an agonist or as an antagonist, respectively) with respect to one or more biological or physiological mechanisms, effects, responses, functions, pathways or activities in which the APC target or T-cell target, in particular, a target that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]), (or in which its substrate(s), ligand(s), receptor(s) or pathway(s) are involved, such as its signalling pathway or metabolic pathway and their associated biological or physiological effects) is involved. Again, as will be clear to the skilled person, such an action as an agonist or an antagonist may be determined in any suitable manner and/or using any suitable (in vitro and usually cellular or in assay) assay known per se, such as the assays described herein or in the prior art cited herein. In particular, an action as an agonist or antagonist may be such that an intended biological or physiological activity is increased or decreased, respectively, by at least 1%, preferably at least 5%, such as at least 10% or at least 25%, for example by at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or 90% or more, compared to the biological or physiological activity in the same assay under the same conditions but without the presence of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModulating may for example involve reducing or inhibiting the binding of the APC target or T-cell target, in particular, a target that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]) to one of its substrates, receptor(s) or ligands and/or competing with a natural ligand, receptor or substrate for binding to the APC target or T-cell target, in particular, a target that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets” ]). Modulating may also involve activating the APC target or T-cell target, in particular, targets that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (such as B7-1, B7-2, B7RP-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7H-3 and B7x [“APC targets”] and their receptors CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3 [“T-cell targets”]), or the mechanism or pathway in which it is involved. Modulating may be reversible or irreversible, but for pharmaceutical and pharmacological purposes will usually be in a reversible manner. Modulating may for example also involve reducing or inhibiting the binding of the APC target to one of its T-cell target receptors and/or competing with one of its T-cell target receptors for binding to the APC target. Modulating may also involve reducing or inhibiting the binding of the T-cell target to one of its APC target receptors and/or competing with one of its APC target receptors for binding to the T-cell target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being limiting, in one aspect, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention or the composition comprising the same will inhibit and/or block binding of B7-1 to CD28.

the amino acid residues mentioned in the Table can be either charged and/or uncharged at such a higher or lower pH, as will be clear to the skilled person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n(4)\nAs is known in the art, the charge of a His residue is greatly dependant upon even small shifts in pH, but a His residu can generally be considered essentially uncharged at a pH of about 6.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\ne) For the purposes of comparing two or more nucleotide sequences, the percentage of “sequence identity” between a first nucleotide sequence and a second nucleotide sequence may be calculated by dividing [the number of nucleotides in the first nucleotide sequence that are identical to the nucleotides at the corresponding positions in the second nucleotide sequence] by [the total number of nucleotides in the first nucleotide sequence] and multiplying by [100%], in which each deletion, insertion, substitution or addition of a nucleotide in the second nucleotide sequence—compared to the first nucleotide sequence—is considered as a difference at a single nucleotide (position).\n    \n \nAlternatively, the degree of sequence identity between two or more nucleotide sequences may be calculated using a known computer algorithm for sequence alignment such as NCBI Blast v2.0, using standard settings.\n \nSome other techniques, computer algorithms and settings for determining the degree of sequence identity are for example described in WO 04/037999, \nEP\n 0 967 284, \nEP\n 1 085 089, WO 00/55318, WO 00/78972, WO 98/49185 and \nGB\n 2 357 768-A.\n \nUsually, for the purpose of determining the percentage of “sequence identity” between two nucleotide sequences in accordance with the calculation method outlined hereinabove, the nucleotide sequence with the greatest number of nucleotides will be taken as the “first” nucleotide sequence, and the other nucleotide sequence will be taken as the “second” nucleotide sequence;\n \n\n\n\n\nf) For the purposes of comparing two or more amino acid sequences, the percentage of “sequence identity” between a first amino acid sequence and a second amino acid sequence (also referred to herein as “amino acid identity”) may be calculated by dividing [the number of amino acid residues in the first amino acid sequence that are identical to the amino acid residues at the corresponding positions in the second amino acid sequence] by [the total number of amino acid residues in the first amino acid sequence] and multiplying by [100%], in which each deletion, insertion, substitution or addition of an amino acid residue in the second amino acid sequence—compared to the first amino acid sequence—is considered as a difference at a single amino acid residue (position), i.e. as an “amino acid difference” as defined herein.\n    \n \nAlternatively, the degree of sequence identity between two amino acid sequences may be calculated using a known computer algorithm, such as those mentioned above for determining the degree of sequence identity for nucleotide sequences, again using standard settings.\n \nUsually, for the purpose of determining the percentage of “sequence identity” between two amino acid sequences in accordance with the calculation method outlined hereinabove, the amino acid sequence with the greatest number of amino acid residues will be taken as the “first” amino acid sequence, and the other amino acid sequence will be taken as the “second” amino acid sequence.\n \nAlso, in determining the degree of sequence identity between two amino acid sequences, the skilled person may take into account so-called “conservative” amino acid substitutions, which can generally be described as amino acid substitutions in which an amino acid residue is replaced with another amino acid residue of similar chemical structure and which has little or essentially no influence on the function, activity or other biological properties of the polypeptide. Such conservative amino acid substitutions are well known in the art, for example from WO 04/037999, GB-A-3 357 768, WO 98/49185, WO 00/46383 and WO 01/09300; and (preferred) types and/or combinations of such substitutions may be selected on the basis of the pertinent teachings from WO 04/037999 as well as WO 98/49185 and from the further references cited therein.\n \nSuch conservative substitutions preferably are substitutions in which one amino acid within the following groups (a)-(e) is substituted by another amino acid residue within the same group: (a) small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues: Ala, Ser, Thr, Pro and Gly; (b) polar, negatively charged residues and their (uncharged) amides: Asp, Asn, Glu and Gln; (c) polar, positively charged residues: His, Arg and Lys; (d) large aliphatic, nonpolar residues: Met, Leu, Ile, Val and Cys; and (e) aromatic residues: Phe, Tyr and Trp.\n \nParticularly preferred conservative substitutions are as follows: Ala into Gly or into Ser; Arg into Lys; Asn into Gln or into His; Asp into Glu; Cys into Ser; Gln into Asn; Glu into Asp; Gly into Ala or into Pro; His into Asn or into Gln; Ile into Leu or into Val; Leu into Ile or into Val; Lys into Arg, into Gln or into Glu; Met into Leu, into Tyr or into Ile; Phe into Met, into Leu or into Tyr; Ser into Thr; Thr into Ser; Trp into Tyr; Tyr into Trp; and/or Phe into Val, into Ile or into Leu.\n \nAny amino acid substitutions applied to the polypeptides described herein may also be based on the analysis of the frequencies of amino acid variations between homologous proteins of different species developed by Schulz et al., Principles of Protein Structure, Springer-Verlag, 1978, on the analyses of structure forming potentials developed by Chou and Fasman, Biochemistry 13: 211, 1974 and Adv. Enzymol., 47: 45-149, 1978, and on the analysis of hydrophobicity patterns in proteins developed by Eisenberg et al., Proc. Nad. Acad Sci. USA 81: 140-144, 1984; Kyte & Doolittle; J Molec. Biol. 157: 105-132, 198 1, and Goldman et al., Ann Rev. Biophys. Chem. 15: 321-353, 1986, all incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. Information on the primary, secondary and tertiary structure of Nanobodies is given in the description herein and in the general background art cited above. Also, for this purpose, the crystal structure of a V\nHH \ndomain from a llama is for example given by Desmyter et al., Nature Structural Biology, Vol. 3, 9, 803 (1996); Spinelli et al., Natural Structural Biology (1996); 3, 752-757; and Decanniere et al., Structure, Vol. 7, 4, 361 (1999). Further information about some of the amino acid residues that in conventional V\nH \ndomains form the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface and potential camelizing substitutions on these positions can be found in the prior art cited above.\n \n\n\n\n\ng) Amino acid sequences and nucleic acid sequences are said to be “exactly the same” if they have 100% sequence identity (as defined herein) over their entire length;\n\n\nh) When comparing two amino acid sequences, the term “amino acid difference” refers to an insertion, deletion or substitution of a single amino acid residue on a position of the first sequence, compared to the second sequence; it being understood that two amino acid sequences can contain one, two or more such amino acid differences;\n\n\ni) When a nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence is said to “comprise” another nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, respectively, or to “essentially consist of” another nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, this may mean that the latter nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence has been incorporated into the firstmentioned nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, respectively, but more usually this generally means that the firstmentioned nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence comprises within its sequence a stretch of nucleotides or amino acid residues, respectively, that has the same nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, respectively, as the latter sequence, irrespective of how the firstmentioned sequence has actually been generated or obtained (which may for example be by any suitable method described herein). By means of a non-limiting example, when a Nanobody of the invention is said to comprise a CDR sequence, this may mean that said CDR sequence has been incorporated into the Nanobody of the invention, but more usually this generally means that the Nanobody of the invention contains within its sequence a stretch of amino acid residues with the same amino acid sequence as said CDR sequence, irrespective of how said Nanobody of the invention has been generated or obtained. It should also be noted that when the latter amino acid sequence has a specific biological or structural function, it preferably has essentially the same, a similar or an equivalent biological or structural function in the firstmentioned amino acid sequence (in other words, the firstmentioned amino acid sequence is preferably such that the latter sequence is capable of performing essentially the same, a similar or an equivalent biological or structural function). For example, when a Nanobody of the invention is said to comprise a CDR sequence or framework sequence, respectively, the CDR sequence and framework are preferably capable, in said Nanobody, of functioning as a CDR sequence or framework sequence, respectively. Also, when a nucleotide sequence is said to comprise another nucleotide sequence, the firstmentioned nucleotide sequence is preferably such that, when it is expressed into an expression product (e.g. a polypeptide), the amino acid sequence encoded by the latter nucleotide sequence forms part of said expression product (in other words, that the latter nucleotide sequence is in the same reading frame as the firstmentioned, larger nucleotide sequence).\n\n\nj) A nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence is considered to be “(in) essentially isolated (form)”—for example, compared to its native biological source and/or the reaction medium or cultivation medium from which it has been obtained—when it has been separated from at least one other component with which it is usually associated in said source or medium, such as another nucleic acid, another protein/polypeptide, another biological component or macromolecule or at least one contaminant, impurity or minor component. In particular, a nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence is considered “essentially isolated” when it has been purified at least 2-fold, in particular at least 10-fold, more in particular at least 100-fold, and up to 1000-fold or more. A nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence that is “in essentially isolated form” is preferably essentially homogeneous, as determined using a suitable technique, such as a suitable chromatographical technique, such as polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis;\n\n\nk) The term “domain” as used herein generally refers to a globular region of an amino acid sequence (such as an antibody chain, and in particular to a globular region of a heavy chain antibody), or to a polypeptide that essentially consists of such a globular region.\n    \n \nUsually, such a domain will comprise peptide loops (for example 3 or 4 peptide loops) stabilized, for example, as a sheet or by disulfide bonds. The term “binding domain” refers to such a domain that is directed against an antigenic determinant (as defined herein);\n \n\n\n\n\nl) The term “antigenic determinant” refers to the epitope on the antigen recognized by the antigen-binding molecule (such as a Nanobody or a polypeptide of the invention) and more in particular by the antigen-binding site of said molecule. The terms “antigenic determinant” and “epitope” may also be used interchangeably herein.\n\n\nm) An amino acid sequence (such as a Nanobody, an antibody, a polypeptide of the invention, or generally an antigen binding protein or polypeptide or a fragment thereof) that can (specifically) bind to, that has affinity for and/or that has specificity for a specific antigenic determinant, epitope, antigen or protein (or for at least one part, fragment or epitope thereof) is said to be “against” or “directed against” said antigenic determinant, epitope, antigen or protein.\n\n\nn) The term “specificity” refers to the number of different types of antigens or antigenic determinants to which a particular antigen-binding molecule or antigen-binding protein (such as a Nanobody or a polypeptide of the invention) molecule can bind. The specificity of an antigen-binding protein can be determined based on affinity and/or avidity. The affinity, represented by the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of an antigen with an antigen-binding protein (K\nD\n), is a measure for the binding strength between an antigenic determinant and an antigen-binding site on the antigen-binding protein: the lesser the value of the K\nD\n, the stronger the binding strength between an antigenic determinant and the antigen-binding molecule (alternatively, the affinity can also be expressed as the affinity constant (K\nA\n), which is 1/K\nD\n). As will be clear to the skilled person (for example on the basis of the further disclosure herein), affinity can be determined in a manner known per se, depending on the specific antigen of interest. Avidity is the measure of the strength of binding between an antigen-binding molecule (such as a Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention) and the pertinent antigen. Avidity is related to both the affinity between an antigenic determinant and its antigen binding site on the antigen-binding molecule and the number of pertinent binding sites present on the antigen-binding molecule. Typically, antigen-binding proteins (such as the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention) will bind to their antigen with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 10\n−5 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less, and preferably 10\n−7 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less and more preferably 10\n−8 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter (i.e. with an association constant (K\nA\n) of 10\n5 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more, and preferably 10\n7 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more and more preferably 10\n8 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles). Any K\nD \nvalue greater than 10\n4 \nmol/liter (or any K\nA \nvalue lower than 10\n4 \nM\n−1\n) liters/mol is generally considered to indicate non-specific binding. Preferably, a monovalent immunoglobulin sequence of the invention will bind to the desired antigen with an affinity less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM. Specific binding of an antigen-binding protein to an antigen or antigenic determinant can be determined in any suitable manner known per se, including, for example, Scatchard analysis and/or competitive binding assays, such as radioimmunoassays (RIA), enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and sandwich competition assays, and the different variants thereof known per se in the art; as well as the other techniques mentioned herein.\n    \n \nThe dissociation constant may be the actual or apparent dissociation constant, as will be clear to the skilled person. Methods for determining the dissociation constant will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the techniques mentioned herein. In this respect, it will also be clear that it may not be possible to measure dissociation constants of more then 10\n−4 \nmoles/liter or 10\n−3 \nmoles/liter (e.g. of 10\n−2 \nmoles/liter). Optionally, as will also be clear to the skilled person, the (actual or apparent) dissociation constant may be calculated on the basis of the (actual or apparent) association constant (K\nA\n), by means of the relationship [K\nD\n=1/K\nA\n].\n \nThe affinity denotes the strength or stability of a molecular interaction. The affinity is commonly given as by the K\nD\n, or dissociation constant, which has units of mol/liter (or M). The affinity can also be expressed as an association constant, K\nA\n, which equals 1/K\nD \nand has units of (mol/liter)\n−1 \n(or M\n−1\n). In the present specification, the stability of the interaction between two molecules (such as an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention and its intended target) will mainly be expressed in terms of the K\nD \nvalue of their interaction; it being clear to the skilled person that in view of the relation K\nA\n=1/K\nD\n, specifying the strength of molecular interaction by its K\nD \nvalue can also be used to calculate the corresponding K\nA \nvalue. The K\nD\n-value characterizes the strength of a molecular interaction also in a thermodynamic sense as it is related to the free energy (DG) of binding by the well known relation DG=RT·ln(K\nD\n) (equivalently DG=−RT·ln(K\nA\n)), where R equals the gas constant, T equals the absolute temperature and In denotes the natural logarithm.\n \nThe K\nD \nfor biological interactions which are considered meaningful (e.g. specific) are typically in the range of 10\n−10 \nM (0.1 nM) to 10\n−5 \nM (10000 nM). The stronger an interaction is, the lower is its K\nD\n.\n \nThe K\nD \ncan also be expressed as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant of a complex, denoted as k\noff\n, to the rate of its association, denoted k\non \n(so that K\nD\n=k\noff\n/k\non \nand K\nA\n=k\non\n/k\noff\n). The off-rate k\noff \nhas units s\n−1 \n(where s is the SI unit notation of second). The on-rate k\non \nhas units M\n−1\ns\n−1\n. The on-rate may vary between 10\n2 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nto about 10\n7\nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, approaching the diffusion-limited association rate constant for bimolecular interactions. The off-rate is related to the half-life of a given molecular interaction by the relation t\n1/2\n=ln(2)/k\noff\n. The off-rate may vary between 10\n−6 \ns\n−1 \n(near irreversible complex with a t\n1/2 \nof multiple days) to 1 s\n−1 \n(t\n1/2\n=0.69 s).\n \nThe affinity of a molecular interaction between two molecules can be measured via different techniques known per se, such as the well known surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor technique (see for example Ober et al., Intern. Immunology, 13, 1551-1559, 2001) where one molecule is immobilized on the biosensor chip and the other molecule is passed over the immobilized molecule under flow conditions yielding k\non\n, k\noff \nmeasurements and hence K\nD \n(or K\nA\n) values. This can for example be performed using the well-known BIACORE instruments.\n \nIt will also be clear to the skilled person that the measured K\nD \nmay correspond to the apparent K\nD \nif the measuring process somehow influences the intrinsic binding affinity of the implied molecules for example by artefacts related to the coating on the biosensor of one molecule. Also, an apparent K\nD \nmay be measured if one molecule contains more than one recognition sites for the other molecule. In such situation the measured affinity may be affected by the avidity of the interaction by the two molecules.\n \nAnother approach that may be used to assess affinity is the 2-step ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) procedure of Friguet et al. (J. Immunol. Methods, 77, 305-19, 1985). This method establishes a solution phase binding equilibrium measurement and avoids possible artefacts relating to adsorption of one of the molecules on a support such as plastic.\n \nHowever, the accurate measurement of K\nD \nmay be quite labor-intensive and as consequence, often apparent K\nD \nvalues are determined to assess the binding strength of two molecules. It should be noted that as long all measurements are made in a consistent way (e.g. keeping the assay conditions unchanged) apparent K\nD \nmeasurements can be used as an approximation of the true K\nD \nand hence in the present document K\nD \nand apparent K\nD \nshould be treated with equal importance or relevance. Finally, it should be noted that in many situations the experienced scientist may judge it to be convenient to determine the binding affinity relative to some reference molecule. For example, to assess the binding strength between molecules A and B, one may e.g. use a reference molecule C that is known to bind to B and that is suitably labelled with a fluorophore or chromophore group or other chemical moiety, such as biotin for easy detection in an ELISA or FACS (Fluorescent activated cell sorting) or other format (the fluorophore for fluorescence detection, the chromophore for light absorption detection, the biotin for streptavidin-mediated ELISA detection). Typically, the reference molecule C is kept at a fixed concentration and the concentration of A is varied for a given concentration or amount of B. As a result an IC\n50 \nvalue is obtained corresponding to the concentration of A at which the signal measured for C in absence of A is halved. Provided K\nD ref\n, the K\nD \nof the reference molecule, is known, as well as the total concentration c\nref \nof the reference molecule, the apparent K\nD \nfor the interaction A-B can be obtained from following formula: K\nD\n=IC\n50\n/(1+c\nres\n/K\nD ref\n). Note that if c\nref\n<<K\nD ref\n, K\nD\n≈IC\n50\n. Provided the measurement of the IC\n50 \nis performed in a consistent way (e.g. keeping c\nref \nfixed) for the binders that are compared, the strength or stability of a molecular interaction can be assessed by the IC\n50 \nand this measurement is judged as equivalent to K\nD \nor to apparent K\nD \nthroughout this text.\n \n\n\n\n\no) The half-life of an amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention can generally be defined as the time taken for the serum concentration of the amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide to be reduced by 50%, in vivo, for example due to degradation of the sequence or compound and/or clearance or sequestration of the sequence or compound by natural mechanisms. The in vivo half-life of an amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention can be determined in any manner known per se, such as by pharmacokinetic analysis. Suitable techniques will be clear to the person skilled in the art, and may for example generally involve the steps of suitably administering to a warm-blooded animal (i.e. to a human or to another suitable mammal, such as a mouse, rabbit, rat, pig, dog or a primate, for example monkeys from the genus \nMacaca \n(such as, and in particular, cynomologus monkeys (\nMacaca fascicularis\n) and/or rhesus monkeys (\nMacaca mulatta\n)) and baboon (\nPapio ursinus\n)) a suitable dose of the amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention; collecting blood samples or other samples from said animal; determining the level or concentration of the amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention in said blood sample; and calculating, from (a plot of) the data thus obtained, the time until the level or concentration of the amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention has been reduced by 50% compared to the initial level upon dosing. Reference is for example made to the Experimental Part below, as well as to the standard handbooks, such as Kenneth, A et al: Chemical Stability of Pharmaceuticals: A Handbook for Pharmacists and Peters et al, Pharmacokinete analysis: A Practical Approach (1996). Reference is also made to “Pharmacokinetics”, M Gibaldi & D Perron, published by Marcel Dekker, 2nd Rev. edition (1982).\n    \n \nAs will also be clear to the skilled person (see for \n \nexample pages\n \n 6 and 7 of WO 04/003019 and in the further references cited therein), the half-life can be expressed using parameters such as the t1/2-alpha, t1/2-beta and the area under the curve (AUC). In the present specification, an “increase in half-life” refers to an increase in any one of these parameters, such as any two of these parameters, or essentially all three these parameters. As used herein “increase in half-life” or “increased half-life” in particular refers to an increase in the t1/2-beta, either with or without an increase in the t1/2-alpha and/or the AUC or both.\n \n\n\n\n\np) In the context of the present invention, “modulating” or “to modulate” generally means either reducing or inhibiting the activity of, or alternatively increasing the activity of, a target or antigen, as measured using a suitable in vitro, cellular or in vivo assay. In particular, “modulating” or “to modulate” may mean either reducing or inhibiting the activity of, or alternatively increasing a (relevant or intended) biological activity of, a target or antigen, as measured using a suitable in vitro, cellular or in vivo assay (which will usually depend on the target or antigen involved), by at least 1%, preferably at least 5%, such as at least 10% or at least 25%, for example by at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or 90% or more, compared to activity of the target or antigen in the same assay under the same conditions but without the presence of the construct of the invention.\n    \n \nAs will be clear to the skilled person, “modulating” may also involve effecting a change (which may either be an increase or a decrease) in affinity, avidity, specificity and/or selectivity of a target or antigen for one or more of its ligands, binding partners, partners for association into a homomultimeric or heteromultimeric form, or substrates; and/or effecting a change (which may either be an increase or a decrease) in the sensitivity of the target or antigen for one or more conditions in the medium or surroundings in which the target or antigen is present (such as pH, ion strength, the presence of co-factors, etc.), compared to the same conditions but without the presence of the construct of the invention. As will be clear to the skilled person, this may again be determined in any suitable manner and/or using any suitable assay known per se, depending on the target or antigen involved.\n \n“Modulating” may also mean effecting a change (i.e. an activity as an agonist, as an antagonist or as a reverse agonist, respectively, depending on the target or antigen and the desired biological or physiological effect) with respect to one or more biological or physiological mechanisms, effects, responses, functions, pathways or activities in which the target or antigen (or in which its substrate(s), ligand(s) or pathway(s) are involved, such as its signalling pathway or metabolic pathway and their associated biological or physiological effects) is involved. Again, as will be clear to the skilled person, such an action as an agonist or an antagonist may be determined in any suitable manner and/or using any suitable (in vitro and usually cellular or in assay) assay known per se, depending on the target or antigen involved. In particular, an action as an agonist or antagonist may be such that an intended biological or physiological activity is increased or decreased, respectively, by at least 1%, preferably at least 5%, such as at least 10% or at least 25%, for example by at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or 90% or more, compared to the biological or physiological activity in the same assay under the same conditions but without the presence of the construct of the invention.\n \nModulating may for example also involve allosteric modulation of the target or antigen; and/or reducing or inhibiting the binding of the target or antigen to one of its substrates or ligands and/or competing with a natural ligand, substrate for binding to the target or antigen. Modulating may also involve activating the target or antigen or the mechanism or pathway in which it is involved. Modulating may for example also involve effecting a change in respect of the folding or confirmation of the target or antigen, or in respect of the ability of the target or antigen to fold, to change its confirmation (for example, upon binding of a ligand), to associate with other (sub)units, or to disassociate. Modulating may for example also involve effecting a change in the ability of the target or antigen to transport other compounds or to serve as a channel for other compounds (such as ions).\n \nModulating may be reversible or irreversible, but for pharmaceutical and pharmacological purposes will usually be in a reversible manner\n \n\n\n\n\nq) In respect of a target or antigen, the term “interaction site” on the target or antigen means a site, epitope, antigenic determinant, part, domain or stretch of amino acid residues on the target or antigen that is a site for binding to a ligand, receptor or other binding partner, a catalytic site, a cleavage site, a site for allosteric interaction, a site involved in multimerisation (such as homomerization or heterodimerization) of the target or antigen; or any other site, epitope, antigenic determinant, part, domain or stretch of amino acid residues on the target or antigen that is involved in a biological action or mechanism of the target or antigen. More generally, an “interaction site” can be any site, epitope, antigenic determinant, part, domain or stretch of amino acid residues on the target or antigen to which an amino acid sequence or polypeptide of the invention can bind such that the target or antigen (and/or any pathway, interaction, signalling, biological mechanism or biological effect in which the target or antigen is involved) is modulated (as defined herein).\n\n\nr) An amino acid sequence or polypeptide is said to be “specific for” a first target or antigen compared to a second target or antigen when is binds to the first antigen with an affinity (as described above, and suitably expressed as a K\nD \nvalue, K\nA \nvalue, K\noff \nrate and/or K\non \nrate) that is at least 10 times, such as at least 100 times, and preferably at least 1000 times, and up to 10.000 times or more better than the affinity with which said amino acid sequence or polypeptide binds to the second target or polypeptide. For example, the first antigen may bind to the target or antigen with a K\nD \nvalue that is at least 10 times less, such as at least 100 times less, and preferably at least 1000 times less, such as 10.000 times less or even less than that, than the K\nD \nwith which said amino acid sequence or polypeptide binds to the second target or polypeptide. Preferably, when an amino acid sequence or polypeptide is “specific for” a first target or antigen compared to a second target or antigen, it is directed against (as defined herein) said first target or antigen, but not directed against said second target or antigen.\n\n\ns) The terms “cross-block”, “cross-blocked” and “cross-blocking” are used interchangeably herein to mean the ability of an amino acid sequence or other binding agents (such as a polypeptide of the invention) to interfere with the binding of other amino acid sequences or binding agents of the invention to a given target. The extend to which an amino acid sequence or other binding agent of the invention is able to interfere with the binding of another amino acid sequence or other binding agent to said target, and therefore, whether it can be said to cross-block according to the invention, can be determined using competition binding assays (also referred to herein as “cross-blocking assay”). One particularly suitable quantitative cross-blocking assay uses a Biacore instrument which can measure the extent of interactions using surface plasmon resonance technology. Another suitable quantitative cross-blocking assay uses an ELISA-based approach to measure competition between amino acid sequences or other binding agents in terms of their binding to the target.\n    \n \nThe following generally describes a suitable Biacore assay for determining whether an amino acid sequence or other binding agent cross-blocks or is capable of cross-blocking according to the invention. It will be appreciated that the assay can be used with any of the amino acid sequences or other binding agents described herein. The Biacore instrument (for example the Biacore 3000) is operated in line with the manufacturer's recommendations. Thus, in one cross-blocking assay, the target protein is coupled to a CM5 Biacore chip using standard amine coupling chemistry to generate a surface that is coated with the target. Typically 200-800 resonance units of the target would be coupled to the chip (an amount that gives easily measurable levels of binding but that is readily saturable by the concentrations of test reagent being used). Two test amino acid sequences (termed A* and B*) or other binding agents to be assessed for their ability to cross-block each other are mixed at a one to one molar ratio of binding sites in a suitable buffer to create the test mixture. When calculating the concentrations on a binding site basis, the molecular weight of an amino acid sequence or other binding agent is assumed to be the total molecular weight of the amino acid sequence or other binding agent divided by the number of target binding sites on that amino acid sequence or other binding agent. The concentration of each amino acid sequence or other binding agent in the test mix should be high enough to readily saturate the binding sites for that amino acid sequence or other binding agent on the target molecules captured on the Biacore chip. The amino acid sequences or other binding agents in the mixture are at the same molar concentration (on a binding site basis) which would typically be between 1.00 and 1.5 micromolar (on a binding site basis). Separate solutions containing A* alone and B* alone are also prepared. A* and B* in these solutions should be in the same buffer and at the same concentration as in the test mix. The test mixture is passed over the target-coated Biacore chip and the total amount of binding recorded. The chip is then treated in such a way as to remove the bound amino acid sequences or other binding agents without damaging the chip-bound target. Typically this is done by treating the chip with 30 mM HCl for 60 seconds. The solution of A* alone is then passed over the target-coated surface and the amount of binding recorded. The chip is again treated to remove all of the bound amino acid sequences or other binding agents without damaging the chip-bound target. The solution of B* alone is then passed over the target-coated surface and the amount of binding recorded. The maximum theoretical binding of the mixture of A* and B* is next calculated, and is the sum of the binding of each amino acid sequence or other binding agent when passed over the target surface alone. If the actual recorded binding of the mixture is less than this theoretical maximum then the two amino acid sequences or other binding agents are cross-blocking each other. Thus, in general, a cross-blocking amino acid sequence or other binding agent according to the invention is one which will bind to the target in the above Biacore cross-blocking assay such that during the assay and in the presence of a second amino acid sequence or other binding agent of the invention the recorded binding is between 80% and 0.1% (e.g. 80% to 4%) of the maximum theoretical binding, specifically between 75% and 0.1% (e.g. 75% to 4%) of the maximum theoretical binding, and more specifically between 70% and 0.1% (e.g. 70% to 4%) of maximum theoretical binding (as just defined above) of the two amino acid sequences or binding agents in combination. The Biacore assay described above is a primary assay used to determine if amino acid sequences or other binding agents cross-block each other according to the invention. On rare occasions particular amino acid sequences or other binding agents may not bind to target coupled via amine chemistry to a CM5 Biacore chip (this usually occurs when the relevant binding site on target is masked or destroyed by the coupling to the chip). In such cases cross-blocking can be determined using a tagged version of the target, for example a N-terminal His-tagged version. In this particular format, an anti-His amino acid sequence would be coupled to the Biacore chip and then the His-tagged target would be passed over the surface of the chip and captured by the anti-His amino acid sequence. The cross blocking analysis would be carried out essentially as described above, except that after each chip regeneration cycle, new His-tagged target would be loaded back onto the anti-His amino acid sequence coated surface. In addition to the example given using N-terminal His-tagged target, C-terminal His-tagged target could alternatively be used. Furthermore, various other tags and tag binding protein combinations that are known in the art could be used for such a cross-blocking analysis (e.g. HA tag with anti-HA antibodies; FLAG tag with anti-FLAG antibodies; biotin tag with streptavidin). The following generally describes an ELISA assay for determining whether an amino acid sequence or other binding agent directed against a target cross-blocks or is capable of cross-blocking as defined herein. It will be appreciated that the assay can be used with any of the amino acid sequences (or other binding agents such as polypeptides of the invention) described herein. The general principal of the assay is to have an amino acid sequence or binding agent that is directed against the target coated onto the wells of an ELISA plate. An excess amount of a second, potentially cross-blocking, anti-target amino acid sequence or other binding agent is added in solution (i.e. not bound to the ELISA plate). A limited amount of the target is then added to the wells. The coated amino acid sequence or other binding agent and the amino acid sequence or other binding agent in solution compete for binding of the limited number of target molecules. The plate is washed to remove excess target that has not been bound by the coated amino acid sequence or other binding agent and to also remove the second, solution phase amino acid sequence or other binding agent as well as any complexes formed between the second, solution phase amino acid sequence or other binding agent and target. The amount of bound target is then measured using a reagent that is appropriate to detect the target. An amino acid sequence or other binding agent in solution that is able to cross-block the coated amino acid sequence or other binding agent will be able to cause a decrease in the number of target molecules bound to the coated amino acid sequence or other binding agent relative to the number of target molecules bound to the coated amino acid sequence or other binding agent in the absence of the second, solution phase, amino acid sequence or other binding agent. In the instance where the first amino acid sequence or other binding agent, e.g. an Ab-X, is chosen to be the immobilized amino acid sequence or other binding agent, it is coated onto the wells of the ELISA plate, after which the plates are blocked with a suitable blocking solution to minimize non-specific binding of reagents that are subsequently added. An excess amount of the second amino acid sequence or other binding agent, i.e. Ab-Y, is then added to the ELISA plate such that the moles of Ab-Y target binding sites per well are at least 10 fold higher than the moles of Ab-X target binding sites that were used, per well, during the coating of the ELISA plate. Target is then added such that the moles of target added per well are at least 25-fold lower than the moles of Ab-X target binding sites that were used for coating each well. Following a suitable incubation period the ELISA plate is washed and a reagent for detecting the target is added to measure the amount of target specifically bound by the coated anti-target amino acid sequence or other binding agent (in this case Ab-X). The background signal for the assay is defined as the signal obtained in wells with the coated amino acid sequence or other binding agent (in this case Ab-X), second solution phase amino acid sequence or other binding agent (in this case Ab-Y), target buffer only (i.e. without target added) and target detection reagents. The positive control signal for the assay is defined as the signal obtained in wells with the coated amino acid sequence or other binding agent (in this case Ab-X), second solution phase amino acid sequence or other binding agent buffer only (i.e. without second solution phase amino acid sequence or other binding agent added), target and target detection reagents. The ELISA assay may be run in such a manner so as to have the positive control signal be at least 6 times the background signal. To avoid any artefacts (e.g. significantly different affinities between Ab-X and Ab-Y for the target) resulting from the choice of which amino acid sequence to use as the coating amino acid sequence or other binding agent and which to use as the second (competitor) amino acid sequence or other binding agent, the cross-blocking assay may to be run in two formats: 1) \nformat\n 1 is where Ab-X is the amino acid sequence that is coated onto the ELISA plate and Ab-Y is the competitor amino acid sequence that is in solution and 2) \nformat\n 2 is where Ab-Y is the amino acid sequence that is coated onto the ELISA plate and Ab-X is the competitor amino acid sequence that is in solution. Ab-X and Ab-Y are defined as cross-blocking if, either in \nformat\n 1 or in \nformat\n 2, the solution phase anti-target amino acid sequence or other binding agent is able to cause a reduction of between 60% and 100%, specifically between 70% and 100%, and more specifically between 80% and 100%, of the target detection signal {i.e. the amount of target bound by the coated amino acid sequence) as compared to the target detection signal obtained in the absence of the solution phase anti- target amino acid sequence or other binding agent (i.e. the positive control wells).\n \n\n\n\n\nt) As further described herein, the total number of amino acid residues in a Nanobody can be in the region of 110-120, is preferably 112-115, and is most preferably 113. It should however be noted that parts, fragments, analogs or derivatives (as further described herein) of a Nanobody are not particularly limited as to their length and/or size, as long as such parts, fragments, analogs or derivatives meet the further requirements outlined herein and are also preferably suitable for the purposes described herein;\n\n\nu) The amino acid residues of a Nanobody are numbered according to the general numbering for V\nH \ndomains given by Kabat et al. (“Sequence of proteins of immunological interest”, US Public Health Services, NIH Bethesda, Md., Publication No. 91), as applied to V\nHH \ndomains from Camelids in the article of Riechmann and Muyldermans, J. Immunol. \nMethods\n 2000 Jun. 23; 240 (1-2): 185-195 (see for example \nFIG. 2\n of this publication); or referred to herein. According to this numbering, FR1 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acid residues at positions 1-30, CDR1 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acid residues at positions 31-35, FR2 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acids at positions 36-49, CDR2 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acid residues at positions 50-65, FR3 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acid residues at positions 66-94, CDR3 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acid residues at positions 95-102, and FR4 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acid residues at positions 103-113. [In this respect, it should be noted that—as is well known in the art for V\nH \ndomains and for V\nHH \ndomains—the total number of amino acid residues in each of the CDR's may vary and may not correspond to the total number of amino acid residues indicated by the Kabat numbering (that is, one or more positions according to the Kabat numbering may not be occupied in the actual sequence, or the actual sequence may contain more amino acid residues than the number allowed for by the Kabat numbering). This means that, generally, the numbering according to Kabat may or may not correspond to the actual numbering of the amino acid residues in the actual sequence. Generally, however, it can be said that, according to the numbering of Kabat and irrespective of the number of amino acid residues in the CDR's, \nposition\n 1 according to the Kabat numbering corresponds to the start of FR1 and vice versa, position 36 according to the Kabat numbering corresponds to the start of FR2 and vice versa, position 66 according to the Kabat numbering corresponds to the start of FR3 and vice versa, and position 103 according to the Kabat numbering corresponds to the start of FR4 and vice versa.].\n    \n \nAlternative methods for numbering the amino acid residues of V\nH \ndomains, which methods can also be applied in an analogous manner to V\nHH \ndomains from Camelids and to Nanobodies, are the method described by Chothia et al. (Nature 342, 877-883 (1989)), the so-called “AbM definition” and the so-called “contact definition”. However, in the present description, claims and figures, the numbering according to Kabat as applied to V\nHH \ndomains by Riechmann and Muyldermans will be followed, unless indicated otherwise; and\n \n\n\n\n\nv) The Figures, Sequence Listing and the Experimental Part/Examples are only given to further illustrate the invention and should not be interpreted or construed as limiting the scope of the invention and/or of the appended claims in any way, unless explicitly indicated otherwise herein.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor a general description of heavy chain antibodies and the variable domains thereof, reference is inter alia made to the prior art cited herein, to the review article by Muyldermans in Reviews in Molecular Biotechnology 74 (2001), 277-302; as well as to the following patent applications, which are mentioned as general background art: WO 94/04678, WO 95/04079 and WO 96/34103 of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel; WO 94/25591, WO 99/37681, WO 00/40968, WO 00/43507, WO 00/65057, WO 01/40310, WO 01/44301, EP 1134231 and WO 02/48193 of Unilever; WO 97/49805, WO 01/21817, WO 03/035694, WO 03/054016 and WO 03/055527 of the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB); WO 03/050531 of Algonomics N.

V. and the further published patent applications by Ablynx N. V. Reference is also made to the further prior art mentioned in these applications, and in particular to the list of references mentioned on pages 41-43 of the International application WO 06/040153, which list and references are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the terminology used in the art (see the above references), the variable domains present in naturally occurring heavy chain antibodies will also be referred to as “V\nHH \ndomains”, in order to distinguish them from the heavy chain variable domains that are present in conventional 4-chain antibodies (which will be referred to hereinbelow as “V\nH \ndomains”) and from the light chain variable domains that are present in conventional 4-chain antibodies (which will be referred to hereinbelow as “V\nL \ndomains”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned in the prior art referred to above, V\nHH \ndomains have a number of unique structural characteristics and functional properties which make isolated V\nHH \ndomains (as well as Nanobodies based thereon, which share these structural characteristics and functional properties with the naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains) and proteins containing the same highly advantageous for use as functional antigen-binding domains or proteins. In particular, and without being limited thereto, V\nHH \ndomains (which have been “designed” by nature to functionally bind to an antigen without the presence of, and without any interaction with, a light chain variable domain) and Nanobodies can function as a single, relatively small, functional antigen-binding structural unit, domain or protein. This distinguishes the V\nHH \ndomains from the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of conventional 4-chain antibodies, which by themselves are generally not suited for practical application as single antigen-binding proteins or domains, but need to be combined in some form or another to provide a functional antigen-binding unit (as in for example conventional antibody fragments such as Fab fragments; in ScFv's fragments, which consist of a V\nH \ndomain covalently linked to a V\nL \ndomain).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of these unique properties, the use of V\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies as single antigen-binding proteins or as antigen-binding domains (i.e. as part of a larger protein or polypeptide) offers a number of significant advantages over the use of conventional V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains, scFv's or conventional antibody fragments (such as Fab- or F(ab′)\n2\n-fragments):\n\n \n \n \n \n \nonly a single domain is required to bind an antigen with high affinity and with high selectivity, so that there is no need to have two separate domains present, nor to assure that these two domains are present in the right spacial conformation and configuration (i.e. through the use of especially designed linkers, as with scFv's);\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies can be expressed from a single gene and require no post-translational folding or modifications;\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies can easily be engineered into multivalent and multispecific formats (as further discussed herein);\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies are highly soluble and do not have a tendency to aggregate (as with the mouse-derived “dAb's” described by Ward et al., Nature, Vol. 341, 1989, p. 544);\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies are highly stable to heat, pH, proteases and other denaturing agents or conditions (see for example Ewert et al, supra);\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies are easy and relatively cheap to prepare, even on a scale required for production. For example, V\nHH \ndomains, Nanobodies and proteins/polypeptides containing the same can be produced using microbial fermentation (e.g. as further described below) and do not require the use of mammalian expression systems, as with for example conventional antibody fragments;\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies are relatively small (approximately 15 kDa, or 10 times smaller than a conventional IgG) compared to conventional 4-chain antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, and therefore show high(er) penetration into tissues (including but not limited to solid tumors and other dense tissues) than such conventional 4-chain antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof;\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies can show so-called cavity-binding properties (inter alia due to their extended CDR3 loop, compared to conventional V\nH \ndomains) and can therefore also access targets and epitopes not accessable to conventional 4-chain antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof. For example, it has been shown that V\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies can inhibit enzymes (see for example WO 97/49805; Transue et al., Proteins 1998 Sep. 1; 32(4): 515-22; Lauwereys et al., EMBO J. 1998 Jul. 1; 17(13): 3512-20).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a specific and preferred aspect, the invention provides Nanobodies that block the interaction between (a target on) an antigen presenting cell (APC) and (a target) on a T-cell. More particularly the invention provides Nanobodies against a target on an APC (“APC target”) or a target on a T-cell (“T-cell target”), and in particular Nanobodies against an APC target or a T-cell target from a warm-blooded animal, and more in particular Nanobodies against APC target or a T-cell target from a mammal, and especially Nanobodies against human APC target or a T-cell target; as well as proteins and/or polypeptides comprising at least one such Nanobody. In particular, the invention provides Nanobodies against targets that belong to the B7:CD28 superfamily (which encompasses APC targets and T-cell targets). “APC targets” include (without being limiting) B7-1 (also referred to as CD80, BB1, B7, \nCD28 antigen ligand\n 1, CD28LG1, LAB1, B71 antigen), B7-2 (also referred to as CD86, \nCD28 antigen ligand\n 2, CD28LG2, LAB7-2 or B72 antigen), B7RP-1 (also referred to as B7h, iCOS-L, ICOS-L, ICOSL, LICOS, GL-50, B7H-2, B7-H2 or L-COS), PD-L1 (also referred to as PDL-1, B7H-1 or B7-H1), PD-L2 (also referred to as PDL-2 or B7-DC), B7H-3 (also referred to as B7RP-2) and B7x (also referred to as B7S). “T-cell targets” include (without being limiting) CD28, CTLA-4 (also referred to as CD152, CELIAC3, CTLA4, Ctla-4, sCTLA4 or IDDM12), ICOS, PD-1, BTLA and TIM-3. In a preferred aspect, the Nanobodies of the invention are directed against B7-1 and/or B7-2, i.e. they may be monospecific against only B7-1 or only B7-2, or they may be bispecific against both B7-1 and B7-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the invention provides Nanobodies against an APC target or a T-cell target, and proteins and/or polypeptides comprising the same, that have improved therapeutic and/or pharmacological properties and/or other advantageous properties (such as, for example, improved ease of preparation and/or reduced costs of goods), compared to conventional antibodies against the APC target or T-cell target or fragments thereof, compared to constructs that could be based on such conventional antibodies or antibody fragments (such as Fab′ fragments, F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments, ScFv constructs, “diabodies” and other multispecific constructs (see for example the review by Holliger and Hudson, Nat Biotechnol. 2005 September; 23(9):1126-36)), and also compared to the so-called “dAb's” or similar (single) domain antibodies that may be derived from variable domains of conventional antibodies. These improved and advantageous properties will become clear from the further description herein, and for example include, without limitation, one or more of:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nincreased affinity and/or avidity for the APC target or T-cell target, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described hereinbelow);\n \nbetter suitability for formatting in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format);\n \nbetter suitability for formatting in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described hereinbelow);\n \nimproved suitability or susceptibility for “humanizing” substitutions (as defined herein);\n \nless immunogenicity, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described hereinbelow);\n \nincreased stability, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described hereinbelow);\n \nincreased specificity towards the APC target or T-cell target, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described hereinbelow);\n \ndecreased or where desired increased cross-reactivity with the APC target or T-cell target from different species;\n\n\nand/or\n\n \none or more other improved properties desirable for pharmaceutical use (including prophylactic use and/or therapeutic use) and/or for diagnostic use (including but not limited to use for imaging purposes), either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described hereinbelow).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs generally described herein for the amino acid sequences of the invention, the Nanobodies of the invention are preferably in essentially isolated form (as defined herein), or form part of a protein or polypeptide of the invention (as defined herein), which may comprise or essentially consist of one or more Nanobodies of the invention and which may optionally further comprise one or more further amino acid sequences (all optionally linked via one or more suitable linkers). For example, and without limitation, the one or more amino acid sequences of the invention may be used as a binding unit in such a protein or polypeptide, which may optionally contain one or more further amino acid sequences that can serve as a binding unit (i.e. against one or more other targets than the APC target or T-cell target), so as to provide a monovalent, multivalent or multispecific polypeptide of the invention, respectively, all as described herein. In particular, such a protein or polypeptide may comprise or essentially consist of one or more Nanobodies of the invention and optionally one or more (other) Nanobodies (i.e. directed against other targets than the APC target or T-cell target), all optionally linked via one or more suitable linkers, so as to provide a monovalent, multivalent or multispecific Nanobody construct, respectively, as further described herein. Such proteins or polypeptides may also be in essentially isolated form (as defined herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a Nanobody of the invention, the binding site for binding against the APC target or T-cell target is preferably formed by the CDR sequences. Optionally, a Nanobody of the invention may also, and in addition to the at least one binding site for binding against the APC target or T-cell target, contain one or more further binding sites for binding against other antigens, proteins or targets. For methods and positions for introducing such second binding sites, reference is for example made to Keck and Huston, Biophysical Journal, 71, October 1996, 2002-2011; \nEP\n 0 640 130 and WO 06/07260.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs generally described herein for the amino acid sequences of the invention, when a Nanobody of the invention (or a polypeptide of the invention comprising the same) is intended for administration to a subject (for example for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes as described herein), it is preferably directed against a human APC target or T-cell target; whereas for veterinary purposes, it is preferably directed against an APC target or T-cell target from the species to be treated. Also, as with the amino acid sequences of the invention, a Nanobody of the invention may or may not be cross-reactive (i.e. directed against an APC target or T-cell target from two or more species of mammal, such as against a human APC target or T-cell target and an APC target or T-cell target from at least one of the species of mammal mentioned herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, again as generally described herein for the amino acid sequences of the invention, the Nanobodies of the invention may generally be directed against any antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) of the APC target or T-cell target. However, it is generally assumed and preferred that the Nanobodies of the invention (and polypeptides comprising the same) are directed against the site on the APC target or T-cell target by which said target interacts with its receptor or ligand respectively, i.e. for B7-1 and B7-2, the site on B7-1 and B7-2 respectively that interacts with CD28 or the site on B7-1 and B7-2 respectively that interacts with CTLA4 (Ellis et al.

Thus, it is generally preferred that, when a CDR in a Nanobody of the invention is a CDR sequence mentioned in Table A-1g or is suitably chosen from the group of CDR sequences that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with a CDR sequence listed in Table A-1g; and/or from the group consisting of CDR sequences that have 3, 2 or only 1 amino acid difference(s) with a CDR sequence listed in Table A-1g, that at least one and preferably both of the other CDR's are suitably chosen from the CDR sequences that belong to the same combination in Table A-1g (i.e. mentioned on the same line in Table A-1g) or are suitably chosen from the group of CDR sequences that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with the CDR sequence(s) belonging to the same combination and/or from the group consisting of CDR sequences that have 3, 2 or only 1 amino acid difference(s) with the CDR sequence(s) belonging to the same combination. The other preferences indicated in the above paragraphs also apply to the combinations of CDR's mentioned in Table A-1g.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, by means of non-limiting examples, a Nanobody of the invention can for example comprise a CDR1 sequence that has more than 80% sequence identity with one of the CDR1 sequences mentioned in Table A-1g, a CDR2 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid difference with one of the CDR2 sequences mentioned in Table A-1g (but belonging to a different combination), and a CDR3 sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred Nanobodies of the invention may for example comprise: (1) a CDR1 sequence that has more than 80% sequence identity with one of the CDR1 sequences mentioned in Table A-1g; a CDR2 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid difference with one of the CDR2 sequences mentioned in Table A-1g (but belonging to a different combination); and a CDR3 sequence that has more than 80% sequence identity with one of the CDR3 sequences mentioned in Table A-1g (but belonging to a different combination); or (2) a CDR1 sequence that has more than 80% sequence identity with one of the CDR1 sequences mentioned in Table A-1g; a CDR2 sequence, and one of the CDR3 sequences listed in Table A-1g; or (3) a CDR1 sequence; a CDR2 sequence that has more than 80% sequence identity with one of the CDR2 sequence listed in Table A-1g; and a CDR3 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid differences with the CDR3 sequence mentioned in Table A-1g that belongs to the same combination as the CDR2 sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome particularly preferred Nanobodies of the invention may for example comprise: (1) a CDR1 sequence that has more than 80% sequence identity with one of the CDR1 sequences mentioned in Table A-1g; a CDR2 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid difference with the CDR2 sequence mentioned in Table A-1g that belongs to the same combination; and a CDR3 sequence that has more than 80% sequence identity with the CDR3 sequence mentioned in Table A-1g that belongs to the same combination; (2) a CDR1 sequence; a \nCDR\n 2 listed in Table A-1g and a CDR3 sequence listed in Table A-1g (in which the CDR2 sequence and CDR3 sequence may belong to different combinations).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome even more preferred Nanobodies of the invention may for example comprise: (1) a CDR1 sequence that has more than 80% sequence identity with one of the CDR1 sequences mentioned in Table A-1g; the CDR2 sequence listed in Table A-1g that belongs to the same combination; and a CDR3 sequence mentioned in Table A-1g that belongs to a different combination; or (2) a CDR1 sequence mentioned in Table A-1g; a CDR2 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid differences with the CDR2 sequence mentioned in Table A-1g that belongs to the same combination; and a CDR3 sequence that has more than 80% sequence identity with the CDR3 sequence listed in Table A-1g that belongs to the same or a different combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly preferred Nanobodies of the invention may for example comprise a CDR1 sequence mentioned in Table A-1g, a CDR2 sequence that has more than 80% sequence identity with the CDR2 sequence mentioned in Table A-1g that belongs to the same combination; and the CDR3 sequence mentioned in Table A-1g that belongs to the same combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the most preferred Nanobodies of the invention, the CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences present are suitably chosen from one of the combinations of CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, listed in Table A-1g.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention (a) CDR1 has a length of between 1 and 12 amino acid residues, and usually between 2 and 9 amino acid residues, such as 5, 6 or 7 amino acid residues; and/or (b) CDR2 has a length of between 13 and 24 amino acid residues, and usually between 15 and 21 amino acid residues, such as 16 and 17 amino acid residues; and/or (c) CDR3 has a length of between 2 and 35 amino acid residues, and usually between 3 and 30 amino acid residues, such as between 6 and 23 amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred, but non-limiting aspect, the invention relates to a Nanobody in which the CDR sequences (as defined herein) have more than 80%, preferably more than 90%, more preferably more than 95%, such as 99% or more sequence identity (as defined herein) with the CDR sequences of at least one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 1288-1391.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, Nanobodies with the above CDR sequences may be as further described herein, and preferably have framework sequences that are also as further described herein. Thus, for example and as mentioned herein, such Nanobodies may be naturally occurring Nanobodies (from any suitable species), naturally occurring V\nHH \nsequences (i.e. from a suitable species of Camelid) or synthetic or semi-synthetic amino acid sequences or Nanobodies, including but not limited to partially humanized Nanobodies or V\nHH \nsequences, fully humanized Nanobodies or V\nHH \nsequences, camelized heavy chain variable domain sequences, as well as Nanobodies that have been obtained by the techniques mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one specific, but non-limiting aspect, the invention relates to a humanized Nanobody, which consists of 4 framework regions (FR1 to FR4 respectively) and 3 complementarity determining regions (CDR1 to CDR3 respectively), in which CDR1 to CDR3 are as defined herein and in which said humanized Nanobody comprises at least one humanizing substitution (as defined herein), and in particular at least one humanizing substitution in at least one of its framework sequences (as defined herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred, but non-limiting aspect, the invention relates to a Nanobody in which the CDR sequences have at least 70% amino acid identity, preferably at least 80% amino acid identity, more preferably at least 90% amino acid identity, such as 95% amino acid identity or more or even essentially 100% amino acid identity with the CDR sequences of at least one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 1288-1391. This degree of amino acid identity can for example be determined by determining the degree of amino acid identity (in a manner described herein) between said Nanobody and one or more of the sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 1288-1391, in which the amino acid residues that form the framework regions are disregarded. Such Nanobodies can be as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred, but non-limiting aspect, the invention relates to a Nanobody with an amino acid sequence that is chosen from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO's: 1288-1391 or from the group consisting of from amino acid sequences that have more than 80%, preferably more than 90%, more preferably more than 95%, such as 99% or more sequence identity (as defined herein) with at least one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 1288-1391.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention relates to humanized variants of the Nanobodies of SEQ ID NO's: 1288-1391, that comprise, compared to the corresponding native V\nHH \nsequence, at least one humanizing substitution (as defined herein), and in particular at least one humanizing substitution in at least one of its framework sequences (as defined herein). Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such humanized variants are the humanized Nanobodies of SEQ ID NO's: 1407-1418. Thus, the invention also relates to a humanized Nanobody with an amino acid sequence that is chosen from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO's: 1407-1418 or from the group consisting of from amino acid sequences that have more than 80%, preferably more than 90%, more preferably more than 95%, such as 99% or more sequence identity (as defined herein) with at least one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 1407-1418 (in which amino acid sequences that are chosen from the latter group of amino acid sequences may contain a greater number or a smaller number of humanizing substitutions compared to the corresponding sequence of SEQ ID NO's: 1407-1418, as long as they retain at least one of the humanizing substitutions present in the corresponding sequence of SEQ ID NO's: 1407-1418).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptides of the invention comprise or essentially consist of at least one Nanobody of the invention. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of polypeptides of the invention are given in SEQ ID NO's: 1392-1399.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be clear to the skilled person that the Nanobodies that are mentioned herein as “preferred” (or “more preferred”, “even more preferred”, etc.) are also preferred (or more preferred, or even more preferred, etc.) for use in the polypeptides described herein. Thus, polypeptides that comprise or essentially consist of one or more “preferred” Nanobodies of the invention will generally be preferred, and polypeptides that comprise or essentially consist of one or more “more preferred” Nanobodies of the invention will generally be more preferred, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, proteins or polypeptides that comprise or essentially consist of a single Nanobody (such as a single Nanobody of the invention) will be referred to herein as “monovalent” proteins or polypeptides or as “monovalent constructs”. Proteins and polypeptides that comprise or essentially consist of two or more Nanobodies (such as at least two Nanobodies of the invention or at least one Nanobody of the invention and at least one other Nanobody) will be referred to herein as “multivalent” proteins or polypeptides or as “multivalent constructs”, and these may provide certain advantages compared to the corresponding monovalent Nanobodies of the invention. Some non-limiting examples of such multivalent constructs will become clear from the further description herein; some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such multivalent Nanobody constructs against CTLA4 are the constructs of SEQ ID NO's: 1392-1399.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one, non-limiting, aspect of the invention, a monovalent construct may be advantageous and/or preferred over corresponding multivalent constructs. A monovalent (Fab) anti-CD80 monoclonal antibody, for example, proved to be much more efficient for improving EAE compared to the corresponding bivalent monoclonal antibody (Podojil et al., see supra). Accordingly, in one preferred aspect, the invention relates to a monovalent construct comprising only one Nanobody of the invention or else, to a multivalent construct comprising one Nanobody of the invention and one or more other binding units (i.e. against one or more other targets than the one or more APC target or the one or more T-cell target) as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another specific, but non-limiting aspect, a polypeptide of the invention comprises or essentially consists of at least two Nanobodies of the invention, such as two or three Nanobodies of the invention. As further described herein, such multivalent constructs can provide certain advantages compared to a protein or polypeptide comprising or essentially consisting of a single Nanobody of the invention, such as a much improved avidity for the APC target or T-cell target. Such multivalent constructs will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another specific, but non-limiting aspect, a polypeptide of the invention comprises or essentially consists of at least one Nanobody of the invention and at least one other binding unit (i.e. directed against another epitope, antigen, target, protein or polypeptide), which is preferably also a Nanobody. Such proteins or polypeptides are also referred to herein as “multispecific” proteins or polypeptides or as ‘multispecific constructs”, and these may provide certain advantages compared to the corresponding monovalent Nanobodies of the invention (as will become clear from the further discussion herein of some preferred, but-nonlimiting multispecific constructs). Such multispecific constructs will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein; some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such multispecific Nanobody constructs are the constructs of SEQ ID NO's: 1392-1395.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to yet another specific, but non-limiting aspect, a polypeptide of the invention comprises or essentially consists of at least one Nanobody of the invention, optionally one or more further Nanobodies, and at least one other amino acid sequence (such as a protein or polypeptide) that confers at least one desired property to the Nanobody of the invention and/or to the resulting fusion protein. Again, such fusion proteins may provide certain advantages compared to the corresponding monovalent Nanobodies of the invention. Some non-limiting examples of such amino acid sequences and of such fusion constructs will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible to combine two or more of the above aspects, for example to provide a trivalent bispecific construct comprising two Nanobodies of the invention and one other Nanobody, and optionally one or more other amino acid sequences. Further non-limiting examples of such constructs, as well as some constructs that are particularly preferred within the context of the present invention, will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above constructs, the one or more Nanobodies and/or other amino acid sequences may be directly linked to each other and/or suitably linked to each other via one or more linker sequences. Some suitable but non-limiting examples of such linkers will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific aspect of the invention, a Nanobody of the invention or a compound, construct or polypeptide of the invention comprising at least one Nanobody of the invention may have an increased half-life, compared to the corresponding amino acid sequence of the invention. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such Nanobodies, compounds and polypeptides will become clear to the skilled person based on the further disclosure herein, and for example comprise Nanobodies sequences or polypeptides of the invention that have been chemically modified to increase the half-life thereof (for example, by means of pegylation); amino acid sequences of the invention that comprise at least one additional binding site for binding to a serum protein (such as serum albumin); or polypeptides of the invention that comprise at least one Nanobody of the invention that is linked to at least one moiety (and in particular at least one amino acid sequence) that increases the half-life of the Nanobody of the invention. Examples of polypeptides of the invention that comprise such half-life extending moieties or amino acid sequences will become clear to the skilled person based on the further disclosure herein; and for example include, without limitation, polypeptides in which the one or more Nanobodies of the invention are suitable linked to one or more serum proteins or fragments thereof (such as serum albumin or suitable fragments thereof) or to one or more binding units that can bind to serum proteins (such as, for example, Nanobodies or (single) domain antibodies that can bind to serum proteins such as serum albumin, serum immunoglobulins such as IgG, or transferrine); polypeptides in which a Nanobody of the invention is linked to an Fc portion (such as a human Fc) or a suitable part or fragment thereof; or polypeptides in which the one or more Nanobodies of the invention are suitable linked to one or more small proteins or peptides that can bind to serum proteins (such as, without limitation, the proteins and peptides described in WO 91/01743, WO 01/45746, WO 02/076489 and to the US provisional application of Ablynx N. V. entitled “Peptides capable of binding to serum proteins” of Ablynx N. V. filed on Dec. 5, 2006 (see also PCT/EP/2007/063348).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, as will be clear to the skilled person, such Nanobodies, compounds, constructs or polypeptides may contain one or more additional groups, residues, moieties or binding units, such as one or more further amino acid sequences and in particular one or more additional Nanobodies (i.e. not directed against the APC target or T-cell target), so as to provide a tri- of multispecific Nanobody construct.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the Nanobodies of the invention (or compounds, constructs or polypeptides comprising the same) with increased half-life preferably have a half-life that is at least 1.5 times, preferably at least 2 times, such as at least 5 times, for example at least 10 times or more than 20 times, greater than the half-life of the corresponding amino acid sequence of the invention per se. For example, the Nanobodies, compounds, constructs or polypeptides of the invention with increased half-life may have a half-life that is increased with more than 1 hours, preferably more than 2 hours, more preferably more than 6 hours, such as more than 12 hours, or even more than 24, 48 or 72 hours, compared to the corresponding amino acid sequence of the invention per se.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, such Nanobodies, compound, constructs or polypeptides of the invention exhibit a serum half-life in human of at least about 12 hours, preferably at least 24 hours, more preferably at least 48 hours, even more preferably at least 72 hours or more.

In particular, said one or more amino acid sequences that allow the resulting polypeptides of the invention to cross the blood brain barrier may be one or more (such as two and preferably one) Nanobodies, such as the Nanobodies described in WO 02/057445, of which FC44 (SEQ ID NO:189 of WO 06/040153) and FC5 (SEQ ID NO:190 of WO 06/040154) are preferred examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, polypeptides comprising one or more Nanobodies of the invention are preferably such that they:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nbind to the APC target or T-cell target with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 10\n−5 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less, and preferably 10\n−7 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less and more preferably 10\n−8 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter (i.e. with an association constant (K\nA\n) of 10\n5 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more, and preferably 10\n7 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more and more preferably 10\n8 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles);\n\n\nand/or such that they:\n\n \nbind to the APC target or T-cell target with a k\non\n-rate of between 10\n2 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nto about 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, preferably between 10\n3 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, more preferably between 10\n4 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, such as between 10\n5 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n1\n;\n\n\nand/or such that they:\n\n \nbind to the APC target or T-cell target with a k\noff\n. rate between 1s\n−1 \n(t\n1/2\n=0.69 s) and 10\n−6 \ns\n−1 \n(providing a near irreversible complex with a t\n1/2 \nof multiple days), preferably between 10\n−2 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, more preferably between 10\n−3 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, such as between 10\n−4 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferably, a polypeptide that contains only one amino acid sequence of the invention is preferably such that it will bind to the APC target or T-cell target with an affinity less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM. In this respect, it will be clear to the skilled person that a polypeptide that contains two or more Nanobodies of the invention may bind to the APC target or T-cell target with an increased avidity, compared to a polypeptide that contains only one amino acid sequence of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred IC\n50 \nvalues for binding of the amino acid sequences or polypeptides of the invention to the APC target or T-cell target will become clear from the further description and examples herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther polypeptides according to this preferred aspect of the invention may for example be chosen from the group consisting of amino acid sequences that have more than 80%, preferably more than 90%, more preferably more than 95%, such as 99% or more “sequence identity” (as defined herein) with one or more of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 1392-1399, in which the Nanobodies comprised within said amino acid sequences are preferably as further defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of this invention relates to a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence of the invention (such as a Nanobody of the invention) or a polypeptide of the invention comprising the same. Again, as generally described herein for the nucleic acids of the invention, such a nucleic acid may be in the form of a genetic construct, as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention relates to host or host cell that expresses or that is capable of expressing an amino acid sequence (such as a Nanobody) of the invention and/or a polypeptide of the invention comprising the same; and/or that contains a nucleic acid of the invention. Some preferred but non-limiting examples of such hosts or host cells will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention relates to a product or composition containing or comprising at least one amino acid of the invention, at least one polypeptide of the invention and/or at least one nucleic acid of the invention, and optionally one or more further components of such compositions known per se, i.e. depending on the intended use of the composition. Such a product or composition may for example be a pharmaceutical composition (as described herein), a veterinary composition or a product or composition for diagnostic use (as also described herein). Some preferred but non-limiting examples of such products or compositions will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further relates to methods for preparing or generating the amino acids, compounds, constructs, polypeptides, nucleic acids, host cells, products and compositions described herein. Some preferred but non-limiting examples of such methods will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further relates to applications and uses of the amino acid sequences, compounds, constructs, polypeptides, nucleic acids, host cells, products and compositions described herein, as well as to methods for the prevention and/or treatment for diseases and disorders associated with an APC target or a T-cell target. Some preferred but non-limiting applications and uses will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther aspects, embodiments, advantages and applications of the invention will also become clear from the further description hereinbelow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, it should be noted that the term Nanobody as used herein in its broadest sense is not limited to a specific biological source or to a specific method of preparation. For example, as will be discussed in more detail below, the Nanobodies of the invention can generally be obtained: (1) by isolating the V\nHH \ndomain of a naturally occurring heavy chain antibody; (2) by expression of a nucleotide sequence encoding a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain; (3) by “humanization” (as described herein) of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain or by expression of a nucleic acid encoding a such humanized V\nHH \ndomain; (4) by “camelization” (as described herein) of a naturally occurring V\nH \ndomain from any animal species, and in particular a from species of mammal, such as from a human being, or by expression of a nucleic acid encoding such a camelized V\nH \ndomain; (5) by “camelisation” of a “domain antibody” or “Dab” as described by Ward et al (supra), or by expression of a nucleic acid encoding such a camelized V\nH \ndomain; (6) by using synthetic or semi-synthetic techniques for preparing proteins, polypeptides or other amino acid sequences known per se; (7) by preparing a nucleic acid encoding a Nanobody using techniques for nucleic acid synthesis known per se, followed by expression of the nucleic acid thus obtained; and/or (8) by any combination of one or more of the foregoing. Suitable methods and techniques for performing the foregoing will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein and for example include the methods and techniques described in more detail herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne preferred class of Nanobodies corresponds to the V\nHH \ndomains of naturally occurring heavy chain antibodies directed against an APC target or T-cell target. As further described herein, such V\nHH \nsequences can generally be generated or obtained by suitably immunizing a species of Camelid with an APC target or T-cell target (i.e. so as to raise an immune response and/or heavy chain antibodies directed against the APC target or T-cell target), by obtaining a suitable biological sample from said Camelid (such as a blood sample, serum sample or sample of B-cells), and by generating V\nHH \nsequences directed against the APC target or T-cell target, starting from said sample, using any suitable technique known per se. Such techniques will be clear to the skilled person and/or are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, such naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains against an APC target or T-cell target, can be obtained from naïve libraries of Camelid V\nHH \nsequences, for example by screening such a library using the APC target or T-cell target, or at least one part, fragment, antigenic determinant or epitope thereof using one or more screening techniques known per se. Such libraries and techniques are for example described in WO 99/37681, WO 01/90190, WO 03/025020 and WO 03/035694. Alternatively, improved synthetic or semi-synthetic libraries derived from naïve V\nHH \nlibraries may be used, such as V\nHH \nlibraries obtained from naïve V\nHH \nlibraries by techniques such as random mutagenesis and/or CDR shuffling, as for example described in WO 00/43507.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in another aspect, the invention relates to a method for generating Nanobodies, that are directed against an APC target or a T-cell target. In one aspect, said method at least comprises the steps of:\n\n \n \n \na) providing a set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences; and\n \nb) screening said set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences for Nanobody sequences that can bind to and/or have affinity for an APC target or T-cell target;\n\n\nand\n\n \nc) isolating the amino acid sequence(s) that can bind to and/or have affinity for the APC target or T-cell target.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn such a method, the set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences may be a naïve set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences; a synthetic or semi-synthetic set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences; and/or a set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences that have been subjected to affinity maturation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred aspect of this method, the set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences may be an immune set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences, and in particular an immune set, collection or library of V\nHH \nsequences, that have been derived from a species of Camelid that has been suitably immunized with the APC target or T-cell target or with a suitable antigenic determinant based thereon or derived therefrom, such as an antigenic part, fragment, region, domain, loop or other epitope thereof. In one particular aspect, said antigenic determinant may be an extracellular part, region, domain, loop or other extracellular epitope(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above methods, the set, collection or library of Nanobody or V\nHH \nsequences may be displayed on a phage, phagemid, ribosome or suitable micro-organism (such as yeast), such as to facilitate screening. Suitable methods, techniques and host organisms for displaying and screening (a set, collection or library of) Nanobody sequences will be clear to the person skilled in the art, for example on the basis of the further disclosure herein. Reference is also made to WO 03/054016 and to the review by Hoogenboom in Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1105-1116 (2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the method for generating Nanobody sequences comprises at least the steps of:\n\n \n \n \na) providing a collection or sample of cells derived from a species of Camelid that express immunoglobulin sequences;\n \nb) screening said collection or sample of cells for (i) cells that express an immunoglobulin sequence that can bind to and/or have affinity for an APC target or T-cell target; and (ii) cells that express heavy chain antibodies, in which substeps (i) and (ii) can be performed essentially as a single screening step or in any suitable order as two separate screening steps, so as to provide at least one cell that expresses a heavy chain antibody that can bind to and/or has affinity for an APC target or T-cell target;\n\n\nand\n\n \nc) either (i) isolating from said cell the V\nHH \nsequence present in said heavy chain antibody; or (ii) isolating from said cell a nucleic acid sequence that encodes the V\nHH \nsequence present in said heavy chain antibody, followed by expressing said V\nHH \ndomain.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn the method according to this aspect, the collection or sample of cells may for example be a collection or sample of B-cells. Also, in this method, the sample of cells may be derived from a Camelid that has been suitably immunized with the APC target or T-cell target or a suitable antigenic determinant based thereon or derived therefrom, such as an antigenic part, fragment, region, domain, loop or other epitope thereof. In one particular aspect, said antigenic determinant may be an extracellular part, region, domain, loop or other extracellular epitope(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above method may be performed in any suitable manner, as will be clear to the skilled person. Reference is for example made to \nEP\n 0 542 810, WO 05/19824, WO 04/051268 and WO 04/106377. The screening of step b) is preferably performed using a flow cytometry technique such as FACS. For this, reference is for example made to Lieby et al., Blood, Vol. 97, No. 12, 3820. Particular reference is made to the so-called “Nanoclone™” technique described in International application WO 06/079372 by Ablynx N. V.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the method for generating an amino acid sequence directed against an APC target or T-cell target may comprise at least the steps of:\n\n \n \n \na) providing a set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences encoding heavy chain antibodies or Nanobody sequences;\n \nb) screening said set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences for nucleic acid sequences that encode a heavy chain antibody or a Nanobody sequence that can bind to and/or has affinity for an APC target or T-cell target;\n\n\nand\n\n \nc) isolating said nucleic acid sequence, followed by expressing the V\nHH \nsequence present in said heavy chain antibody or by expressing said Nanobody sequence, respectively.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn such a method, the set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences encoding heavy chain antibodies or Nanobody sequences may for example be a set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences encoding a naïve set, collection or library of heavy chain antibodies or V\nHH \nsequences; a set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences encoding a synthetic or semi-synthetic set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences; and/or a set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences encoding a set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences that have been subjected to affinity maturation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred aspect of this method, the set, collection or library of amino acid sequences may be an immune set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences encoding heavy chain antibodies or V\nHH \nsequences derived from a Camelid that has been suitably immunized with the APC target or T-cell target or with a suitable antigenic determinant based thereon or derived therefrom, such as an antigenic part, fragment, region, domain, loop or other epitope thereof. In one particular aspect, said antigenic determinant may be an extracellular part, region, domain, loop or other extracellular epitope(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above methods, the set, collection or library of nucleotide sequences may be displayed on a phage, phagemid, ribosome or suitable micro-organism (such as yeast), such as to facilitate screening. Suitable methods, techniques and host organisms for displaying and screening (a set, collection or library of) nucleotide sequences encoding amino acid sequences will be clear to the person skilled in the art, for example on the basis of the further disclosure herein. Reference is also made to WO 03/054016 and to the review by Hoogenboom in Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1105-1116 (2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be clear to the skilled person, the screening step of the methods described herein can also be performed as a selection step. Accordingly the term “screening” as used in the present description can comprise selection, screening or any suitable combination of selection and/or screening techniques. Also, when a set, collection or library of sequences is used, it may contain any suitable number of sequences, such as 1, 2, 3 or about 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10\n4\n, 10\n5\n, 10\n6\n, 10\n7\n, 10\n8 \nor more sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, one or more or all of the sequences in the above set, collection or library of amino acid sequences may be obtained or defined by rational, or semi-empirical approaches such as computer modelling techniques or biostatics or datamining techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, such a set, collection or library can comprise one, two or more sequences that are variants from one another (e.g. with designed point mutations or with randomized positions), compromise multiple sequences derived from a diverse set of naturally diversified sequences (e.g. an immune library)), or any other source of diverse sequences (as described for example in Hoogenboom et al, Nat Biotechnol 23:1105, 2005 and Binz et al, Nat Biotechnol 2005, 23:1247). Such set, collection or library of sequences can be displayed on the surface of a phage particle, a ribosome, a bacterium, a yeast cell, a mammalian cell, and linked to the nucleotide sequence encoding the amino acid sequence within these carriers. This makes such set, collection or library amenable to selection procedures to isolate the desired amino acid sequences of the invention. More generally, when a sequence is displayed on a suitable host or host cell, it is also possible (and customary) to first isolate from said host or host cell a nucleotide sequence that encodes the desired sequence, and then to obtain the desired sequence by suitably expressing said nucleotide sequence in a suitable host organism. Again, this can be performed in any suitable manner known per se, as will be clear to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another technique for obtaining V\nHH \nsequences or Nanobody sequences directed against an APC target or T-cell target involves suitably immunizing a transgenic mammal that is capable of expressing heavy chain antibodies (i.e. so as to raise an immune response and/or heavy chain antibodies directed against the APC target or T-cell target), obtaining a suitable biological sample from said transgenic mammal that contains (nucleic acid sequences encoding) said V\nHH \nsequences or Nanobody sequences (such as a blood sample, serum sample or sample of B-cells), and then generating V\nHH \nsequences directed against the APC target or T-cell target, starting from said sample, using any suitable technique known per se (such as any of the methods described herein or a hybridoma technique). For example, for this purpose, the heavy chain antibody-expressing mice and the further methods and techniques described in WO 02/085945, WO 04/049794 and WO 06/008548 and Janssens et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006 Oct. 10; 103(41):15130-5 can be used. For example, such heavy chain antibody expressing mice can express heavy chain antibodies with any suitable (single) variable domain, such as (single) variable domains from natural sources (e.g. human (single) variable domains, Camelid (single) variable domains or shark (single) variable domains), as well as for example synthetic or semi-synthetic (single) variable domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to the V\nHH \nsequences or Nanobody sequences that are obtained by the above methods, or alternatively by a method that comprises the one of the above methods and in addition at least the steps of determining the nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence of said V\nHH \nsequence or Nanobody sequence; and of expressing or synthesizing said V\nHH \nsequence or Nanobody sequence in a manner known per se, such as by expression in a suitable host cell or host organism or by chemical synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned herein, a particularly preferred class of Nanobodies of the invention comprises Nanobodies with an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain, but that has been “humanized”, i.e. by replacing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of said naturally occurring V\nHH \nsequence (and in particular in the framework sequences) by one or more of the amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position(s) in a V\nH \ndomain from a conventional 4-chain antibody from a human being (e.g. indicated above). This can be performed in a manner known per se, which will be clear to the skilled person, for example on the basis of the further description herein and the prior art on humanization referred to herein. Again, it should be noted that such humanized Nanobodies of the invention can be obtained in any suitable manner known per se (i.e. as indicated under points (1)-(8) above) and thus are not strictly limited to polypeptides that have been obtained using a polypeptide that comprises a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain as a starting material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother particularly preferred class of Nanobodies of the invention comprises Nanobodies with an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring V\nH \ndomain, but that has been “camelized”, i.e. by replacing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring V\nH \ndomain from a conventional 4-chain antibody by one or more of the amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position(s) in a V\nHH \ndomain of a heavy chain antibody. This can be performed in a manner known per se, which will be clear to the skilled person, for example on the basis of the further description herein. Such “camelizing” substitutions are preferably inserted at amino acid positions that form and/or are present at the V\nH\n-V\nL \ninterface, and/or at the so-called Camelidae hallmark residues, as defined herein (see for example WO 94/04678 and Davies and Riechmann (1994 and 1996), supra). Preferably, the V\nH \nsequence that is used as a starting material or starting point for generating or designing the camelized Nanobody is preferably a V\nH \nsequence from a mammal, more preferably the V\nH \nsequence of a human being, such as a \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 sequence. However, it should be noted that such camelized Nanobodies of the invention can be obtained in any suitable manner known per se (i.e. as indicated under points (1)-(8) above) and thus are not strictly limited to polypeptides that have been obtained using a polypeptide that comprises a naturally occurring V\nH \ndomain as a starting material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, again as further described herein, both “humanization” and “camelization” can be performed by providing a nucleotide sequence that encodes a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain or V\nH \ndomain, respectively, and then changing, in a manner known per se, one or more codons in said nucleotide sequence in such a way that the new nucleotide sequence encodes a “humanized” or “camelized” Nanobody of the invention, respectively. This nucleic acid can then be expressed in a manner known per se, so as to provide the desired Nanobody of the invention. Alternatively, based on the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain or V\nH \ndomain, respectively, the amino acid sequence of the desired humanized or camelized Nanobody of the invention, respectively, can be designed and then synthesized de novo using techniques for peptide synthesis known per se. Also, based on the amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain or V\nH \ndomain, respectively, a nucleotide sequence encoding the desired humanized or camelized Nanobody of the invention, respectively, can be designed and then synthesized de novo using techniques for nucleic acid synthesis known per se, after which the nucleic acid thus obtained can be expressed in a manner known per se, so as to provide the desired Nanobody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable methods and techniques for obtaining the Nanobodies of the invention and/or nucleic acids encoding the same, starting from naturally occurring V\nH \nsequences or preferably V\nHH \nsequences, will be clear from the skilled person, and may for example comprise combining one or more parts of one or more naturally occurring V\nH \nsequences (such as one or more FR sequences and/or CDR sequences), one or more parts of one or more naturally occurring V\nHH \nsequences (such as one or more FR sequences or CDR sequences), and/or one or more synthetic or semi-synthetic sequences, in a suitable manner, so as to provide a Nanobody of the invention or a nucleotide sequence or nucleic acid encoding the same (which may then be suitably expressed). Nucleotide sequences encoding framework sequences of V\nHH \nsequences or Nanobodies will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein and/or the further prior art cited herein (and/or may alternatively be obtained by PCR starting from the nucleotide sequences obtained using the methods described herein) and may be suitably combined with nucleotide sequences that encode the desired CDR's (for example, by PCR assembly using overlapping primers), so as to provide a nucleic acid encoding a Nanobody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned herein, Nanobodies may in particular be characterized by the presence of one or more “Hallmark residues” (as described herein) in one or more of the framework sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, according to one preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, a Nanobody in its broadest sense can be generally defined as a polypeptide comprising:\n\n \n \n \na) an amino acid sequence that is comprised of four framework regions/sequences interrupted by three complementarity determining regions/sequences, in which the amino acid residue at position 108 according to the Kabat numbering is Q;\n\n\nand/or:\n\n \nb) an amino acid sequence that is comprised of four framework regions/sequences interrupted by three complementarity determining regions/sequences, in which the amino acid residue at position 45 according to the Kabat numbering is a charged amino acid (as defined herein) or a cysteine residue, and position 44 is preferably an E;\n\n\nand/or:\n\n \nc) an amino acid sequence that is comprised of four framework regions/sequences interrupted by three complementarity determining regions/sequences, in which the amino acid residue at position 103 according to the Kabat numbering is chosen from the group consisting of P, R and S, and is in particular chosen from the group consisting of R and S.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThus, in a first preferred, but non-limiting aspect, a Nanobody of the invention may have the structure\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4\n\n\n \n \n \n \nin which FR1 to FR4 refer to \nframework regions\n 1 to 4, respectively, and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the \ncomplementarity determining regions\n 1 to 3, respectively, and in which\n\n \n \n \na) the amino acid residue at position 108 according to the Kabat numbering is Q;

In the Nanobodies of the invention in which the amino acid residues at positions 44-47 according to the Kabat numbering form the sequence GLEW, the amino acid residue at \nposition\n 37 is chosen from the group consisting of Y, H, I, L, V or F, and is most preferably V.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, without being limited hereto in any way, on the basis of the amino acid residues present on the positions mentioned above, the Nanobodies of the invention can generally be classified on the basis of the following three groups:\n\n \n \n \ni) The “GLEW-group”: Nanobodies with the amino acid sequence GLEW at positions 44-47 according to the Kabat numbering and Q at position 108 according to the Kabat numbering. As further described herein, Nanobodies within this group usually have a V at \nposition\n 37, and can have a W, P, R or S at position 103, and preferably have a W at position 103. The GLEW group also comprises some GLEW-like sequences such as those mentioned in Table A-3 below. More generally, and without limitation, Nanobodies belonging to the GLEW-group can be defined as Nanobodies with a G at position 44 and/or with a W at position 47, in which position 46 is usually E and in which preferably position 45 is not a charged amino acid residue and not cysteine;\n \nii) The “KERE-group”: Nanobodies with the amino acid sequence KERE or KQRE (or another KERE-like sequence) at positions 43-46 according to the Kabat numbering and Q or L at position 108 according to the Kabat numbering. As further described herein, Nanobodies within this group usually have a F at \nposition\n 37, an L or F at position 47; and can have a W, P, R or S at position 103, and preferably have a W at position 103. More generally, and without limitation, Nanobodies belonging to the KERE-group can be defined as Nanobodies with a K, Q or R at position 44 (usually K) in which position 45 is a charged amino acid residue or cysteine, and position 47 is as further defined herein;\n \niii) The “103 P, R, S-group”: Nanobodies with a P, R or S at position 103. These Nanobodies can have either the amino acid sequence GLEW at positions 44-47 according to the Kabat numbering or the amino acid sequence KERE or KQRE at positions 43-46 according to the Kabat numbering, the latter most preferably in combination with an F at \nposition\n 37 and an L or an F at position 47 (as defined for the KERE-group); and can have Q or L at position 108 according to the Kabat numbering, and preferably have Q.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAlso, where appropriate, Nanobodies may belong to (i.e. have characteristics of) two or more of these classes. For example, one specifically preferred group of Nanobodies has GLEW or a GLEW-like sequence at positions 44-47; P,R or S (and in particular R) at position 103; and Q at position 108 (which may be humanized to L).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore generally, it should be noted that the definitions referred to above describe and apply to Nanobodies in the form of a native (i.e. non-humanized) V\nHH \nsequence, and that humanized variants of these Nanobodies may contain other amino acid residues than those indicated above (i.e. one or more humanizing substitutions as defined herein). For example, and without limitation, in some humanized Nanobodies of the GLEW-group or the 103 P, R, S-group, Q at position 108 may be humanized to 108L. As already mentioned herein, other humanizing substitutions (and suitable combinations thereof) will become clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. In addition, or alternatively, other potentially useful humanizing substitutions can be ascertained by comparing the sequence of the framework regions of a naturally occurring V\nHH \nsequence with the corresponding framework sequence of one or more closely related human V\nH \nsequences, after which one or more of the potentially useful humanizing substitutions (or combinations thereof) thus determined can be introduced into said V\nHH \nsequence (in any manner known per se, as further described herein) and the resulting humanized V\nHH \nsequences can be tested for affinity for the target, for stability, for ease and level of expression, and/or for other desired properties. In this way, by means of a limited degree of trial and error, other suitable humanizing substitutions (or suitable combinations thereof) can be determined by the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. Also, based on the foregoing, (the framework regions of) a Nanobody may be partially humanized or fully humanized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in another preferred, but non-limiting aspect, a Nanobody of the invention may be a Nanobody belonging to the GLEW-group (as defined herein), and in which CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 are as defined herein, and are preferably as defined according to one of the preferred aspects herein, and are more preferably as defined according to one of the more preferred aspects herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred, but non-limiting aspect, a Nanobody of the invention may be a Nanobody belonging to the KERE-group (as defined herein), and CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 are as defined herein, and are preferably as defined according to one of the preferred aspects herein, and are more preferably as defined according to one of the more preferred aspects herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in another preferred, but non-limiting aspect, a Nanobody of the invention may be a Nanobody belonging to the 103 P, R, S-group (as defined herein), and in which CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 are as defined herein, and are preferably as defined according to one of the preferred aspects herein, and are more preferably as defined according to one of the more preferred aspects herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, more generally and in addition to the 108Q, 43E/44R and 103 P,R,S residues mentioned above, the Nanobodies of the invention can contain, at one or more positions that in a conventional V\nH \ndomain would form (part of) the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface, one or more amino acid residues that are more highly charged than the amino acid residues that naturally occur at the same position(s) in the corresponding naturally occurring V\nH \nsequence, and in particular one or more charged amino acid residues (as mentioned in Table A-2). Such substitutions include, but are not limited to, the GLEW-like sequences mentioned in Table A-3 below; as well as the substitutions that are described in the International Application WO 00/29004 for so-called “microbodies”, e.g. so as to obtain a Nanobody with Q at position 108 in combination with KLEW at positions 44-47. Other possible substitutions at these positions will be clear to the skilled person based upon the disclosure herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the Nanobodies of the invention, the amino acid residue at position 83 is chosen from the group consisting of L, M, S, V and W; and is preferably L.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in one aspect of the Nanobodies of the invention, the amino acid residue at position 83 is chosen from the group consisting of R, K, N, E, G, I, T and Q; and is most preferably either K or E (for Nanobodies corresponding to naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains) or R (for “humanized” Nanobodies, as described herein). The amino acid residue at position 84 is chosen from the group consisting of P, A, R, S, D T, and V in one aspect, and is most preferably P (for Nanobodies corresponding to naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains) or R (for “humanized” Nanobodies, as described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, in one aspect of the Nanobodies of the invention, the amino acid residue at position 104 is chosen from the group consisting of G and D; and is most preferably G.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCollectively, the amino acid residues at \n \npositions\n \n 11, 37, 44, 45, 47, 83, 84, 103, 104 and 108, which in the Nanobodies are as mentioned above, will also be referred to herein as the “Hallmark Residues”.

Tables A-5 to A-8 mention some non-limiting residues that can be present at each position (according to the Kabat numbering) of the FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4 of naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains. For each position, the amino acid residue that most frequently occurs at each position of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain (and which is the most preferred amino acid residue for said position in a Nanobody) is indicated in bold; and other preferred amino acid residues for each position have been underlined (note: the number of amino acid residues that are found at positions 26-30 of naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains supports the hypothesis underlying the numbering by Chothia (supra) that the residues at these positions already form part of CDR1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Tables A-5-A-8, some of the non-limiting residues that can be present at each position of a \nhuman V\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain have also been mentioned. Again, for each position, the amino acid residue that most frequently occurs at each position of a naturally occurring \nhuman V\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain is indicated in bold; and other preferred amino acid residues have been underlined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor reference only, Tables A-5-A-8 also contain data on the V\nHH \nentropy (“V\nHH \nEnt.”) and V\nHH \nvariability (“V\nHH \nVar.”) at each amino acid position for a representative sample of 1118 V\nHH \nsequences (data kindly provided by David Lutje Hulsing and Prof. Theo Verrips of Utrecht University). The values for the V\nHH \nentropy and the V\nHH \nvariability provide a measure for the variability and degree of conservation of amino acid residues between the 1118 V\nHH \nsequences analyzed: low values (i.e. <1, such as <0.5) indicate that an amino acid residue is highly conserved between the V\nHH \nsequences (i.e. little variability). For example, the G at \nposition\n 8 and the G at \nposition\n 9 have values for the V\nHH \nentropy of 0.1 and 0 respectively, indicating that these residues are highly conserved and have little variability (and in case of \nposition\n 9 is G in all 1118 sequences analysed), whereas for residues that form part of the CDR's generally values of 1.5 or more are found (data not shown). Note that (1) the amino acid residues listed in the second column of Tables A-5-A-8 are based on a bigger sample than the 1118 V\nHH \nsequences that were analysed for determining the V\nHH \nentropy and V\nHH \nvariability referred to in the last two columns; and (2) the data represented below support the hypothesis that the amino acid residues at positions 27-30 and maybe even also at positions 93 and 94 already form part of the CDR's (although the invention is not limited to any specific hypothesis or explanation, and as mentioned above, herein the numbering according to Kabat is used). For a general explanation of sequence entropy, sequence variability and the methodology for determining the same, see Oliveira et al., PROTEINS: Structure, Function and Genetics, 52: 544-552 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE A-5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-limiting examples of amino acid residues in FR1 (for the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfootnotes, see the footnotes to Table A-3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAmino acid residue(s):\n\n\nV\nHH\n \n\n\nV\nHH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPos.\n\n\n \nHuman V\n \n \n \nH\n3\n\n\nCamelid V\nHH\n's\n\n\nEnt.\n\n\nVar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n \nE\n, \nQ\n \n\n\n \nQ\n, A, E\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n\n\n \nQ\n, K\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n \nV\n, L\n\n\n \nQ\n, E, L, V\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n\n\n \nE\n, D, Q, A\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n \nS\n, T\n\n\n \nS\n, F\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n \nG\n, R\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n \nG\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nG\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nG\n, V\n\n\n \nG\n, D, R\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nHallmark residue: L, M, S, V, W;

Usually, a Nanobody will have at least one such amino acid difference with a naturally occurring V\nH \ndomain in at least one of FR2 and/or FR4, and in particular at least one of the Hallmark residues in FR2 and/or FR4 (again, including those at positions 108, 103 and/or 45).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, a humanized Nanobody of the invention may be as defined herein, but with the proviso that it has at least “one amino acid difference” (as defined herein) in at least one of the framework regions compared to the corresponding framework region of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain. More specifically, according to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, a humanized Nanobody may be as defined herein, but with the proviso that it has at least “one amino acid difference” (as defined herein) at least one of the Hallmark residues (including those at positions 108, 103 and/or 45) compared to the corresponding framework region of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain. Usually, a humanized Nanobody will have at least one such amino acid difference with a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain in at least one of FR2 and/or FR4, and in particular at least one of the Hallmark residues in FR2 and/or FR4 (again, including those at positions 108, 103 and/or 45).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be clear from the disclosure herein, it is also within the scope of the invention to use natural or synthetic analogs, mutants, variants, alleles, homologs and orthologs (herein collectively referred to as “analogs”) of the Nanobodies of the invention as defined herein, and in particular analogs of the Nanobodies of SEQ ID NO's 266-285, SEQ ID NO's: 347-351, SEQ ID NO's: 394-399, SEQ ID NO's: 449-455, SEQ ID NO's: 505-511, SEQ ID NO's: 554-559 and SEQ ID NO's: 1288-1391. Thus, according to one aspect of the invention, the term “Nanobody of the invention” in its broadest sense also covers such analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, in such analogs, one or more amino acid residues may have been replaced, deleted and/or added, compared to the Nanobodies of the invention as defined herein. Such substitutions, insertions or deletions may be made in one or more of the framework regions and/or in one or more of the CDR's. When such substitutions, insertions or deletions are made in one or more of the framework regions, they may be made at one or more of the Hallmark residues and/or at one or more of the other positions in the framework residues, although substitutions, insertions or deletions at the Hallmark residues are generally less preferred (unless these are suitable humanizing substitutions as described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy means of non-limiting examples, a substitution may for example be a conservative substitution (as described herein) and/or an amino acid residue may be replaced by another amino acid residue that naturally occurs at the same position in another V\nHH \ndomain (see Tables A-5 to A-8 for some non-limiting examples of such substitutions), although the invention is generally not limited thereto. Thus, any one or more substitutions, deletions or insertions, or any combination thereof, that either improve the properties of the Nanobody of the invention or that at least do not detract too much from the desired properties or from the balance or combination of desired properties of the Nanobody of the invention (i.e. to the extent that the Nanobody is no longer suited for its intended use) are included within the scope of the invention. A skilled person will generally be able to determine and select suitable substitutions, deletions or insertions, or suitable combinations of thereof, based on the disclosure herein and optionally after a limited degree of routine experimentation, which may for example involve introducing a limited number of possible substitutions and determining their influence on the properties of the Nanobodies thus obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, and depending on the host organism used to express the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention, such deletions and/or substitutions may be designed in such a way that one or more sites for post-translational modification (such as one or more glycosylation sites) are removed, as will be within the ability of the person skilled in the art. Alternatively, substitutions or insertions may be designed so as to introduce one or more sites for attachment of functional groups (as described herein), for example to allow site-specific pegylation (again as described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs can be seen from the data on the V\nHH \nentropy and V\nHH \nvariability given in Tables A-5 to A-8 above, some amino acid residues in the framework regions are more conserved than others. Generally, although the invention in its broadest sense is not limited thereto, any substitutions, deletions or insertions are preferably made at positions that are less conserved. Also, generally, amino acid substitutions are preferred over amino acid deletions or insertions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe analogs are preferably such that they can bind to the APC target or T-cell target with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K\nD\n-value (actual or apparent), a K\nA\n-value (actual or apparent), a k\non\n-rate and/or a k\noff\n-rate, or alternatively as an IC\n50 \nvalue, as further described herein) that is as defined herein for the Nanobodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe analogs are preferably also such that they retain the favourable properties the Nanobodies, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, according to one preferred aspect, the analogs have a degree of sequence identity of at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, such as at least 95% or 99% or more; and/or preferably have at most 20, preferably at most 10, even more preferably at most 5, such as 4, 3, 2 or only 1 amino acid difference (as defined herein), with one of the Nanobodies of SEQ ID NOs: 266-285, SEQ ID NO's: 347-351, SEQ ID NO's: 394-399, SEQ ID NO's: 449-455, SEQ ID NO's: 505-511, SEQ ID NO's: 554-559 and SEQ ID NO's:1288-1391.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the framework sequences and CDR's of the analogs are preferably such that they are in accordance with the preferred aspects defined herein. More generally, as described herein, the analogs will have (a) a Q at position 108; and/or (b) a charged amino acid or a cysteine residue at position 45 and preferably an E at position 44, and more preferably E at position 44 and R at position 45; and/or (c) P, R or S at position 103.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne preferred class of analogs of the Nanobodies of the invention comprise Nanobodies that have been humanized (i.e. compared to the sequence of a naturally occurring Nanobody of the invention). As mentioned in the background art cited herein, such humanization generally involves replacing one or more amino acid residues in the sequence of a naturally occurring V\nHH \nwith the amino acid residues that occur at the same position in a human V\nH \ndomain, such as a \nhuman V\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain. Examples of possible humanizing substitutions or combinations of humanizing substitutions will be clear to the skilled person, for example from the Tables herein, from the possible humanizing substitutions mentioned in the background art cited herein, and/or from a comparision between the sequence of a Nanobody and the sequence of a naturally occurring human V\nH \ndomain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanizing substitutions should be chosen such that the resulting humanized Nanobodies still retain the favourable properties of Nanobodies as defined herein, and more preferably such that they are as described for analogs in the preceding paragraphs. A skilled person will generally be able to determine and select suitable humanizing substitutions or suitable combinations of humanizing substitutions, based on the disclosure herein and optionally after a limited degree of routine experimentation, which may for example involve introducing a limited number of possible humanizing substitutions and determining their influence on the properties of the Nanobodies thus obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, as a result of humanization, the Nanobodies of the invention may become more “human-like”, while still retaining the favorable properties of the Nanobodies of the invention as described herein. As a result, such humanized Nanobodies may have several advantages, such as a reduced immunogenicity, compared to the corresponding naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains. Again, based on the disclosure herein and optionally after a limited degree of routine experimentation, the skilled person will be able to select humanizing substitutions or suitable combinations of humanizing substitutions which optimize or achieve a desired or suitable balance between the favourable properties provided by the humanizing substitutions on the one hand and the favourable properties of naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains on the other hand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Nanobodies of the invention may be suitably humanized at any framework residue(s), such as at one or more Hallmark residues (as defined herein) or at one or more other framework residues (i.e. non-Hallmark residues) or any suitable combination thereof. One preferred humanizing substitution for Nanobodies of the “P,R,S-103 group” or the “KERE group” is Q108 into L108. Nanobodies of the “GLEW class” may also be humanized by a Q108 into L108 substitution, provided at least one of the other Hallmark residues contains a camelid (camelizing) substitution (as defined herein). For example, as mentioned above, one particularly preferred class of humanized Nanobodies has GLEW or a GLEW-like sequence at positions 44-47; P, R or S (and in particular R) at position 103, and an L at position 108.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanized and other analogs, and nucleic acid sequences encoding the same, can be provided in any manner known per se. For example, the analogs can be obtained by providing a nucleic acid that encodes a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain, changing the codons for the one or more amino acid residues that are to be substituted into the codons for the corresponding desired amino acid residues (e.g. by site-directed mutagenesis or by PCR using suitable mismatch primers), expressing the nucleic acid/nucleotide sequence thus obtained in a suitable host or expression system; and optionally isolating and/or purifying the analog thus obtained to provide said analog in essentially isolated form (e.g. as further described herein). This can generally be performed using methods and techniques known per se, which will be clear to the skilled person, for example from the handbooks and references cited herein, the background art cited herein and/or from the further description herein. Alternatively, a nucleic acid encoding the desired analog can be synthesized in a manner known per se (for example using an automated apparatus for synthesizing nucleic acid sequences with a predefined amino acid sequence) and can then be expressed as described herein. Yet another technique may involve combining one or more naturally occurring and/or synthetic nucleic acid sequences each encoding a part of the desired analog, and then expressing the combined nucleic acid sequence as described herein. Also, the analogs can be provided using chemical synthesis of the pertinent amino acid sequence using techniques for peptide synthesis known per se, such as those mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this respect, it will be also be clear to the skilled person that the Nanobodies of the invention (including their analogs) can be designed and/or prepared starting from human V\nH \nsequences (i.e. amino acid sequences or the corresponding nucleotide sequences), such as for example from \nhuman V\n \n \n \nH\n3 sequences such as DP-47, DP-51 or DP-29, i.e. by introducing one or more camelizing substitutions (i.e. changing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of said human V\nH \ndomain into the amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position in a V\nHH \ndomain), so as to provide the sequence of a Nanobody of the invention and/or so as to confer the favourable properties of a Nanobody to the sequence thus obtained. Again, this can generally be performed using the various methods and techniques referred to in the previous paragraph, using an amino acid sequence and/or nucleotide sequence for a human V\nH \ndomain as a starting point.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred, but non-limiting camelizing substitutions can be derived from Tables A-5-A-8. It will also be clear that camelizing substitutions at one or more of the Hallmark residues will generally have a greater influence on the desired properties than substitutions at one or more of the other amino acid positions, although both and any suitable combination thereof are included within the scope of the invention. For example, it is possible to introduce one or more camelizing substitutions that already confer at least some the desired properties, and then to introduce further camelizing substitutions that either further improve said properties and/or confer additional favourable properties. Again, the skilled person will generally be able to determine and select suitable camelizing substitutions or suitable combinations of camelizing substitutions, based on the disclosure herein and optionally after a limited degree of routine experimentation, which may for example involve introducing a limited number of possible camelizing substitutions and determining whether the favourable properties of Nanobodies are obtained or improved (i.e. compared to the original V\nH \ndomain).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, however, such camelizing substitutions are preferably such that the resulting an amino acid sequence at least contains (a) a Q at position 108; and/or (b) a charged amino acid or a cysteine residue at position 45 and preferably also an E at position 44, and more preferably E at position 44 and R at position 45; and/or (c) P, R or S at position 103; and optionally one or more further camelizing substitutions. More preferably, the camelizing substitutions are such that they result in a Nanobody of the invention and/or in an analog thereof (as defined herein), such as in a humanized analog and/or preferably in an analog that is as defined in the preceding paragraphs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will also be clear from the disclosure herein, it is also within the scope of the invention to use parts or fragments, or combinations of two or more parts or fragments, of the Nanobodies of the invention as defined herein, and in particular parts or fragments of the Nanobodies of SEQ ID NO's: 266-285, SEQ ID NO's: 347-351, SEQ ID NO's: 394-399, SEQ ID NO's: 449-455, SEQ ID NO's: 505-511, SEQ ID NO's: 554-559 and SEQ ID NO's:1288-1391. Thus, according to one aspect of the invention, the term “Nanobody of the invention” in its broadest sense also covers such parts or fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, such parts or fragments of the Nanobodies of the invention (including analogs thereof) have amino acid sequences in which, compared to the amino acid sequence of the corresponding full length Nanobody of the invention (or analog thereof), one or more of the amino acid residues at the N-terminal end, one or more amino acid residues at the C-terminal end, one or more contiguous internal amino acid residues, or any combination thereof, have been deleted and/or removed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe parts or fragments are preferably such that they can bind to the APC target or T-cell target with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K\nD\n-value (actual or apparent), a K\nA\n-value (actual or apparent), a k\non\n-rate and/or a k\noff\n-rate, or alternatively as an IC\n50 \nvalue, as further described herein) that is as defined herein for the Nanobodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny part or fragment is preferably such that it comprises at least 10 contiguous amino acid residues, preferably at least 20 contiguous amino acid residues, more preferably at least 30 contiguous amino acid residues, such as at least 40 contiguous amino acid residues, of the amino acid sequence of the corresponding full length Nanobody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, any part or fragment is such preferably that it comprises at least one of CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 or at least part thereof (and in particular at least CDR3 or at least part thereof). More preferably, any part or fragment is such that it comprises at least one of the CDR's (and preferably at least CDR3 or part thereof) and at least one other CDR (i.e. CDR1 or CDR2) or at least part thereof, preferably connected by suitable framework sequence(s) or at least part thereof. More preferably, any part or fragment is such that it comprises at least one of the CDR's (and preferably at least CDR3 or part thereof) and at least part of the two remaining CDR's, again preferably connected by suitable framework sequence(s) or at least part thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another particularly preferred, but non-limiting aspect, such a part or fragment comprises at least CDR3, such as FR3, CDR3 and FR4 of the corresponding full length Nanobody of the invention, i.e. as for example described in the International application WO 03/050531 (Lasters et al.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs already mentioned above, it is also possible to combine two or more of such parts or fragments (i.e. from the same or different Nanobodies of the invention), i.e. to provide an analog (as defined herein) and/or to provide further parts or fragments (as defined herein) of a Nanobody of the invention. It is for example also possible to combine one or more parts or fragments of a Nanobody of the invention with one or more parts or fragments of a human V\nH \ndomain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one preferred aspect, the parts or fragments have a degree of sequence identity of at least 50%, preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably at least 80%, such as at least 90%, 95% or 99% or more with one of the Nanobodies of SEQ ID NOs 266-285, SEQ ID NO's: 347-351, SEQ ID NO's: 394-399, SEQ ID NO's: 449-455, SEQ ID NO's: 505-511, SEQ ID NO's: 554-559 and SEQ ID NO's:1288-1391.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe parts and fragments, and nucleic acid sequences encoding the same, can be provided and optionally combined in any manner known per se. For example, such parts or fragments can be obtained by inserting a stop codon in a nucleic acid that encodes a full-sized Nanobody of the invention, and then expressing the nucleic acid thus obtained in a manner known per se (e.g. as described herein). Alternatively, nucleic acids encoding such parts or fragments can be obtained by suitably restricting a nucleic acid that encodes a full-sized Nanobody of the invention or by synthesizing such a nucleic acid in a manner known per se. Parts or fragments may also be provided using techniques for peptide synthesis known per se.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention in its broadest sense also comprises derivatives of the Nanobodies of the invention. Such derivatives can generally be obtained by modification, and in particular by chemical and/or biological (e.g enzymatical) modification, of the Nanobodies of the invention and/or of one or more of the amino acid residues that form the Nanobodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of such modifications, as well as examples of amino acid residues within the Nanobody sequence that can be modified in such a manner (i.e. either on the protein backbone but preferably on a side chain), methods and techniques that can be used to introduce such modifications and the potential uses and advantages of such modifications will be clear to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, such a modification may involve the introduction (e.g. by covalent linking or in an other suitable manner) of one or more functional groups, residues or moieties into or onto the Nanobody of the invention, and in particular of one or more functional groups, residues or moieties that confer one or more desired properties or functionalities to the Nanobody of the invention. Example of such functional groups will be clear to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, such modification may comprise the introduction (e.g. by covalent binding or in any other suitable manner) of one or more functional groups that increase the half-life, the solubility and/or the absorption of the Nanobody of the invention, that reduce the immunogenicity and/or the toxicity of the Nanobody of the invention, that eliminate or attenuate any undesirable side effects of the Nanobody of the invention, and/or that confer other advantageous properties to and/or reduce the undesired properties of the Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention; or any combination of two or more of the foregoing. Examples of such functional groups and of techniques for introducing them will be clear to the skilled person, and can generally comprise all functional groups and techniques mentioned in the general background art cited hereinabove as well as the functional groups and techniques known per se for the modification of pharmaceutical proteins, and in particular for the modification of antibodies or antibody fragments (including ScFv's and single domain antibodies), for which reference is for example made to Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1980). Such functional groups may for example be linked directly (for example covalently) to a Nanobody of the invention, or optionally via a suitable linker or spacer, as will again be clear to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of the most widely used techniques for increasing the half-life and/or reducing the immunogenicity of pharmaceutical proteins comprises attachment of a suitable pharmacologically acceptable polymer, such as poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) or derivatives thereof (such as methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) or mPEG). Generally, any suitable form of pegylation can be used, such as the pegylation used in the art for antibodies and antibody fragments (including but not limited to (single) domain antibodies and ScFv's); reference is made to for example Chapman, Nat. Biotechnol., 54, 531-545 (2002); by Veronese and Harris, Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 54, 453-456 (2003), by Harris and Chess, Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov., 2, (2003) and in WO 04/060965. Various reagents for pegylation of proteins are also commercially available, for example from Nektar Therapeutics, USA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, site-directed pegylation is used, in particular via a cysteine-residue (see for example Yang et al., Protein Engineering, 16, 10, 761-770 (2003). For example, for this purpose, PEG may be attached to a cysteine residue that naturally occurs in a Nanobody of the invention, a Nanobody of the invention may be modified so as to suitably introduce one or more cysteine residues for attachment of PEG, or an amino acid sequence comprising one or more cysteine residues for attachment of PEG may be fused to the N- and/or C-terminus of a Nanobody of the invention, all using techniques of protein engineering known per se to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, for the Nanobodies and proteins of the invention, a PEG is used with a molecular weight of more than 5000, such as more than 10,000 and less than 200,000, such as less than 100,000; for example in the range of 20,000-80,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother, usually less preferred modification comprises N-linked or O-linked glycosylation, usually as part of co-translational and/or post-translational modification, depending on the host cell used for expressing the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another modification may comprise the introduction of one or more detectable labels or other signal-generating groups or moieties, depending on the intended use of the labelled Nanobody. Suitable labels and techniques for attaching, using and detecting them will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include, but are not limited to, fluorescent labels (such as fluorescein, isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde, and fluorescamine and fluorescent metals such as \n152\nEu or others metals from the lanthanide series), phosphorescent labels, chemiluminescent labels or bioluminescent labels (such as luminal, isoluminol, theromatic acridinium ester, imidazole, acridinium salts, oxalate ester, dioxetane or GFP and its analogs), radio-isotopes (such as \n3\nH, \n125\nI, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n14\nC, \n36\nCl, \n57\nCo, \n58\nCo, \n59\nFe, and \n75\nSe), metals, metal chelates or metallic cations (for example metallic cations such as \n99m\nTc, \n123\nI, \n111\nIn, \n131\nI, \n97\nRu, \n67\nCu, \n67\nGa, and \n68\nGa or other metals or metallic cations that are particularly suited for use in in vivo, in vitro or in situ diagnosis and imaging, such as (\n157\nGd, \n55\nMn, \n52\nCr, \n162\nDy, \n52\nCr, and \n56\nFe), as well as chromophores and enzymes (such as malate dehydrogenase, staphylococcal nuclease, delta-V-steroid isomerase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, biotinavidin peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, asparaginase, glucose oxidase, beta-galactosidase, ribonuclease, urease, catalase, glucose-VI-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucoamylase and acetylcholine esterase). Other suitable labels will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include moieties that can be detected using NMR or ESR spectroscopy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch labelled Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may for example be used for in vitro, in vivo or in situ assays (including immunoassays known per se such as ELISA, RIA, EIA and other “sandwich assays”, etc.) as well as in vivo diagnostic and imaging purposes, depending on the choice of the specific label.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be clear to the skilled person, another modification may involve the introduction of a chelating group, for example to chelate one of the metals or metallic cations referred to above. Suitable chelating groups for example include, without limitation, diethyl-enetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another modification may comprise the introduction of a functional group that is one part of a specific binding pair, such as the biotin-(strept)avidin binding pair. Such a functional group may be used to link the Nanobody of the invention to another protein, polypeptide or chemical compound that is bound to the other half of the binding pair, i.e. through formation of the binding pair. For example, a Nanobody of the invention may be conjugated to biotin, and linked to another protein, polypeptide, compound or carrier conjugated to avidin or streptavidin. For example, such a conjugated Nanobody may be used as a reporter, for example in a diagnostic system where a detectable signal-producing agent is conjugated to avidin or streptavidin. Such binding pairs may for example also be used to bind the Nanobody of the invention to a carrier, including carriers suitable for pharmaceutical purposes. One non-limiting example are the liposomal formulations described by Cao and Suresh, Journal of Drug Targetting, 8, 4, 257 (2000). Such binding pairs may also be used to link a therapeutically active agent to the Nanobody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some applications, in particular for those applications in which it is intended to kill a cell that expresses the target against which the Nanobodies of the invention are directed (e.g. in the treatment of cancer), or to reduce or slow the growth and/or proliferation such a cell, the Nanobodies of the invention may also be linked to a toxin or to a toxic residue or moiety. Examples of toxic moieties, compounds or residues which can be linked to a Nanobody of the invention to provide—for example—a cytotoxic compound will be clear to the skilled person and can for example be found in the prior art cited above and/or in the further description herein. One example is the so-called ADEPT™ technology described in WO 03/055527.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther potential chemical and enzymatical modifications will be clear to the skilled person. Such modifications may also be introduced for research purposes (e.g. to study function-activity relationships). Reference is for example made to Lundblad and Bradshaw, Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem., 26, 143-151 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the derivatives are such that they bind to the APC target or T-cell target with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K\nD\n-value (actual or apparent), a K\nA\n-value (actual or apparent), a k\non\n-rate and/or a k\noff\n-rate, or alternatively as an IC\n50 \nvalue, as further described herein) that is as defined herein for the Nanobodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, the invention also relates to proteins or polypeptides that essentially consist of or comprise at least one Nanobody of the invention. By “essentially consist of” is meant that the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide of the invention either is exactly the same as the amino acid sequence of a Nanobody of the invention or corresponds to the amino acid sequence of a Nanobody of the invention which has a limited number of amino acid residues, such as 1-20 amino acid residues, for example 1-10 amino acid residues and preferably 1-6 amino acid residues, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 amino acid residues, added at the amino terminal end, at the carboxy terminal end, or at both the amino terminal end and the carboxy terminal end of the amino acid sequence of the Nanobody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSaid amino acid residues may or may not change, alter or otherwise influence the (biological) properties of the Nanobody and may or may not add further functionality to the Nanobody. For example, such amino acid residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \ncan comprise an N-terminal Met residue, for example as result of expression in a heterologous host cell or host organism.\n \nmay form a signal sequence or leader sequence that directs secretion of the Nanobody from a host cell upon synthesis. Suitable secretory leader peptides will be clear to the skilled person, and may be as further described herein. Usually, such a leader sequence will be linked to the N-terminus of the Nanobody, although the invention in its broadest sense is not limited thereto;\n \nmay form a sequence or signal that allows the Nanobody to be directed towards and/or to penetrate or enter into specific organs, tissues, cells, or parts or compartments of cells, and/or that allows the Nanobody to penetrate or cross a biological barrier such as a cell membrane, a cell layer such as a layer of epithelial cells, a tumor including solid tumors, or the blood-brain-barrier. Examples of such amino acid sequences will be clear to the skilled person. Some non-limiting examples are the small peptide vectors (“Pep-trans vectors”) described in WO 03/026700 and in Temsamani et al., Expert Opin. Biol. Ther., 1, 773 (2001); Temsamani and Vidal, Drug Discov. Today, 9, 1012 (004) and Rousselle, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 296, 124-131 (2001), and the membrane translocator sequence described by Zhao et al., Apoptosis, 8, 631-637 (2003). C-terminal and N-terminal amino acid sequences for intracellular targeting of antibody fragments are for example described by Cardinale et al., Methods, 34, 171 (2004). Other suitable techniques for intracellular targeting involve the expression and/or use of so-called “intrabodies” comprising a Nanobody of the invention, as mentioned below;\n \nmay form a “tag”, for example an amino acid sequence or residue that allows or facilitates the purification of the Nanobody, for example using affinity techniques directed against said sequence or residue. Thereafter, said sequence or residue may be removed (e.g. by chemical or enzymatical cleavage) to provide the Nanobody sequence (for this purpose, the tag may optionally be linked to the Nanobody sequence via a cleavable linker sequence or contain a cleavable motif). Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such residues are multiple histidine residues, glutatione residues and a myc-tag (see for example SEQ ID NO:31 of WO 06/12282).\n \nmay be one or more amino acid residues that have been functionalized and/or that can serve as a site for attachment of functional groups. Suitable amino acid residues and functional groups will be clear to the skilled person and include, but are not limited to, the amino acid residues and functional groups mentioned herein for the derivatives of the Nanobodies of the invention.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect, a polypeptide of the invention comprises a Nanobody of the invention, which is fused at its amino terminal end, at its carboxy terminal end, or both at its amino terminal end and at its carboxy terminal end to at least one further amino acid sequence, i.e. so as to provide a fusion protein comprising said Nanobody of the invention and the one or more further amino acid sequences. Such a fusion will also be referred to herein as a “Nanobody fusion”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe one or more further amino acid sequence may be any suitable and/or desired amino acid sequences. The further amino acid sequences may or may not change, alter or otherwise influence the (biological) properties of the Nanobody, and may or may not add further functionality to the Nanobody or the polypeptide of the invention. Preferably, the further amino acid sequence is such that it confers one or more desired properties or functionalities to the Nanobody or the polypeptide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the further amino acid sequence may also provide a second binding site, which binding site may be directed against any desired protein, polypeptide, antigen, antigenic determinant or epitope (including but not limited to the same protein, polypeptide, antigen, antigenic determinant or epitope against which the Nanobody of the invention is directed, or a different protein, polypeptide, antigen, antigenic determinant or epitope).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample of such amino acid sequences will be clear to the skilled person, and may generally comprise all amino acid sequences that are used in peptide fusions based on conventional antibodies and fragments thereof (including but not limited to ScFv's and single domain antibodies). Reference is for example made to the review by Holliger and Hudson, Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1126-1136 (2005),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, such an amino acid sequence may be an amino acid sequence that increases the half-life, the solubility, or the absorption, reduces the immunogenicity or the toxicity, eliminates or attenuates undesirable side effects, and/or confers other advantageous properties to and/or reduces the undesired properties of the polypeptides of the invention, compared to the Nanobody of the invention per se. Some non-limiting examples of such amino acid sequences are serum proteins, such as human serum albumin (see for example WO 00/27435) or haptenic molecules (for example haptens that are recognized by circulating antibodies, see for example WO 98/22141).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, it has been described in the art that linking fragments of immunoglobulins (such as V\nH \ndomains) to serum albumin or to fragments thereof can be used to increase the half-life. Reference is for made to WO 00/27435 and WO 01/077137). According to the invention, the Nanobody of the invention is preferably either directly linked to serum albumin (or to a suitable fragment thereof) or via a suitable linker, and in particular via a suitable peptide linked so that the polypeptide of the invention can be expressed as a genetic fusion (protein). Some preferred but non-limiting examples of Nanobodies linked to serum albumin are given in SEQ ID NOs:1398-1399. According to one specific aspect, the Nanobody of the invention may be linked to a fragment of serum albumin that at least comprises the domain III of serum albumin or part thereof. Reference is for example made to the U.S. \nprovisional application\n 60/788,256 of Ablynx N.V. entitled “Albumin derived amino acid sequence, use thereof for increasing the half-life of therapeutic proteins and of other therapeutic proteins and entities, and constructs comprising the same” filed on Mar. 31, 2006 (see also PCT/EP2007/002817).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the further amino acid sequence may provide a second binding site or binding unit that is directed against a serum protein (such as, for example, human serum albumin or another serum protein such as IgG), so as to provide increased half-life in serum. Such amino acid sequences for example include the Nanobodies described below, as well as the small peptides and binding proteins described in WO 91/01743, WO 01/45746 and WO 02/076489 and the dAb's described in WO 03/002609 and WO 04/003019. Reference is also made to Harmsen et al., Vaccine, 23 (41); 4926-42, 2005, as well as to \nEP\n 0 368 684, as well as to the following the U.S. \nprovisional applications\n 60/843,349 (see also PCT/EP2007/059475), 60/850,774 (see also PCT/EP2007/060849), 60/850,775 (see also PCT/EP2007/060850) by Ablynx N.V. mentioned herein US provisional application of Ablynx N.V. entitled “Peptides capable of binding to serum proteins” filed on Dec. 5, 2006 (see also PCT/EP2007/063348).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch amino acid sequences may in particular be directed against serum albumin (and more in particular human serum albumin) and/or against IgG (and more in particular human IgG). For example, such amino acid sequences may be amino acid sequences that are directed against (human) serum albumin and amino acid sequences that can bind to amino acid residues on (human) serum albumin that are not involved in binding of serum albumin to FcRn (see for example WO 06/0122787) and/or amino acid sequences that are capable of binding to amino acid residues on serum albumin that do not form part of domain III of serum albumin (see again for example WO 06/0122787); amino acid sequences that have or can provide an increased half-life (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/843,349 by Ablynx N.V. entitled “Serum albumin binding proteins with long half-lives” filed on Sep. 8, 2006; see also PCT/EP2007/059475); amino acid sequences against human serum albumin that are cross-reactive with serum albumin from at least one species of mammal, and in particular with at least one species of primate (such as, without limitation, monkeys from the genus \nMacaca \n(such as, and in particular, cynomologus monkeys (\nMacaca fascicularis\n) and/or rhesus monkeys (\nMacaca mulatta\n)) and baboon (\nPapio ursinus\n), reference is again made to the U.S. provisional application 60/843,349 and PCT/EP2007/059475); amino acid sequences that can bind to serum albumin in a pH independent manner (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/850,774 by Ablynx N.V. entitled “Amino acid sequences that bind to serum proteins in a manner that is essentially independent of the pH, compounds comprising the same, and uses thereof”, filed on Oct. 11, 2006; see also and PCT/EP2007/059475) and/or amino acid sequences that are conditional binders (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/850,775 by Ablynx N.V. entitled “Amino acid sequences that bind to a desired molecule in a conditional manner”, filed on Oct. 11, 2006; see also PCT/EP2007/060850).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect, the one or more further amino acid sequences may comprise one or more parts, fragments or domains of conventional 4-chain antibodies (and in particular human antibodies) and/or of heavy chain antibodies. For example, although usually less preferred, a Nanobody of the invention may be linked to a conventional (preferably human) V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain or to a natural or synthetic analog of a V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain, again optionally via a linker sequence (including but not limited to other (single) domain antibodies, such as the dAb's described by Ward et al.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe at least one Nanobody may also be linked to one or more (preferably human) \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and/or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains, optionally via a linker sequence. For instance, a Nanobody linked to a \nsuitable C\n \n \n \nH\n1 domain could for example be used—together with suitable light chains—to generate antibody fragments/structures analogous to conventional Fab fragments or F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments, but in which one or (in case of an F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment) one or both of the conventional V\nH \ndomains have been replaced by a Nanobody of the invention. Also, two Nanobodies could be linked to a \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain (optionally via a linker) to provide a construct with increased half-life in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one specific aspect of a polypeptide of the invention, one or more Nanobodies of the invention may be linked (optionally via a suitable linker or hinge region) to one or more constant domains (for example, 2 or 3 constant domains that can be used as part of/to form an Fc portion), to an Fc portion and/or to to one or more antibody parts, fragments or domains that confer one or more effector functions to the polypeptide of the invention and/or may confer the ability to bind to one or more Fc receptors. For example, for this purpose, and without being limited thereto, the one or more further amino acid sequences may comprise one or \nmore C\n \n \n \nH\n2 and/or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains of an antibody, such as from a heavy chain antibody (as described herein) and more preferably from a conventional human 4-chain antibody; and/or may form (part of) and Fc region, for example from IgG (e.g. from IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4), from IgE or from another human Ig such as IgA, IgD or IgM. For example, WO 94/04678 describes heavy chain antibodies comprising a Camelid V\nHH \ndomain or a humanized derivative thereof (i.e. a Nanobody), in which the \nCamelidae C\n \n \n \nH\n2 and/or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain have been replaced by \nhuman C\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains, so as to provide an immunoglobulin that consists of 2 heavy chains each comprising a Nanobody and \nhuman C\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains (but no \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domain), which immunoglobulin has the effector function provided by the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains and which immunoglobulin can function without the presence of any light chains. Other amino acid sequences that can be suitably linked to the Nanobodies of the invention so as to provide an effector function will be clear to the skilled person, and may be chosen on the basis of the desired effector function(s). Reference is for example made to WO 04/058820, WO 99/42077, WO 02/056910 and WO 05/017148, as well as the review by Holliger and Hudson, supra; and to the non-prepublished US provisional application by Ablynx N.V. entitled “Constructs comprising single variable domains and an Fc portion derived from IgE” which has a filing date of Dec. 4, 2007. Coupling of a Nanobody of the invention to an Fc portion may also lead to an increased half-life, compared to the corresponding Nanobody of the invention. For some applications, the use of an Fc portion and/or of constant domains (i.e. \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and/or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains) that confer increased half-life without any biologically significant effector function may also be suitable or even preferred. Other suitable constructs comprising one or more Nanobodies and one or more constant domains with increased half-life in vivo will be clear to the skilled person, and may for example comprise two Nanobodies linked to a \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain, optionally via a linker sequence. Generally, any fusion protein or derivatives with increased half-life will preferably have a molecular weight of more than 50 kD, the cut-off value for renal absorption.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another one specific, but non-limiting, aspect, in order to form a polypeptide of the invention, one or more amino acid sequences of the invention may be linked (optionally via a suitable linker or hinge region) to naturally occurring, synthetic or semisynthetic constant domains (or analogs, variants, mutants, parts or fragments thereof) that have a reduced (or essentially no) tendency to self-associate into dimers (i.e. compared to constant domains that naturally occur in conventional 4-chain antibodies). Such monomeric (i.e. not self-associating) Fc chain variants, or fragments thereof, will be clear to the skilled person. For example, Helm et al., J Biol Chem 1996 271 7494, describe monomeric Fce chain variants that can be used in the polypeptide chains of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, such monomeric Fc chain variants are preferably such that they are still capable of binding to the complement or the relevant Fc receptor(s) (depending on the Fc portion from which they are derived), and/or such that they still have some or all of the effector functions of the Fc portion from which they are derived (or at a reduced level still suitable for the intended use). Alternatively, in such a polypeptide chain of the invention, the monomeric Fc chain may be used to confer increased half-life upon the polypeptide chain, in which case the monomeric Fc chain may also have no or essentially no effector functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBivalent/multivalent, bispecific/multispecific or biparatopic/multiparatopic polypeptides of the invention may also be linked to Fc portions, in order to provide polypeptide constructs of the type that is described in the non-prepublished US provisional application entitled “immunoglobulin constructs” filed on Dec. 4, 2007.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe further amino acid sequences may also form a signal sequence or leader sequence that directs secretion of the Nanobody or the polypeptide of the invention from a host cell upon synthesis (for example to provide a pre-, pro- or prepro- form of the polypeptide of the invention, depending on the host cell used to express the polypeptide of the invention).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe further amino acid sequence may also form a sequence or signal that allows the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to be directed towards and/or to penetrate or enter into specific organs, tissues, cells, or parts or compartments of cells, and/or that allows the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to penetrate or cross a biological barrier such as a cell membrane, a cell layer such as a layer of epithelial cells, a tumor including solid tumors, or the blood-brain-barrier. Suitable examples of such amino acid sequences will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include, but are not limited to, the “Peptrans” vectors mentioned above, the sequences described by Cardinale et al. and the amino acid sequences and antibody fragments known per se that can be used to express or produce the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention as so-called “intrabodies”, for example as described in WO 94/02610, WO 95/22618, U.S. Pat. No. 7,004,940, WO 03/014960, WO 99/07414; WO 05/01690; \nEP\n 1 512 696; and in Cattaneo, A. & Biocca, S. (1997) Intracellular Antibodies: Development and Applications. Landes and Springer-Verlag; and in Kontermann, Methods 34, (2004), 163-170, and the further references described therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some applications, in particular for those applications in which it is intended to kill a cell that expresses the target against which the Nanobodies of the invention are directed (e.g. in the treatment of cancer), or to reduce or slow the growth and/or proliferation of such a cell, the Nanobodies of the invention may also be linked to a (cyto)toxic protein or polypeptide. Examples of such toxic proteins and polypeptides which can be linked to a Nanobody of the invention to provide—for example—a cytotoxic polypeptide of the invention will be clear to the skilled person and can for example be found in the prior art cited above and/or in the further description herein. One example is the so-called ADEPT™ technology described in WO 03/055527.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one preferred, but non-limiting aspect, said one or more further amino acid sequences comprise at least one further Nanobody, so as to provide a polypeptide of the invention that comprises at least two, such as three, four, five or more Nanobodies, in which said Nanobodies may optionally be linked via one or more linker sequences (as defined herein). Polypeptides of the invention that comprise two or more Nanobodies, of which at least one is a Nanobody of the invention, will also be referred to herein as “multivalent” polypeptides of the invention, and the Nanobodies present in such polypeptides will also be referred to herein as being in a “multivalent format”. For example a “bivalent” polypeptide of the invention comprises two Nanobodies, optionally linked via a linker sequence, whereas a “trivalent” polypeptide of the invention comprises three Nanobodies, optionally linked via two linker sequences; etc.; in which at least one of the Nanobodies present in the polypeptide, and up to all of the Nanobodies present in the polypeptide, is/are a Nanobody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a multivalent polypeptide of the invention, the two or more Nanobodies may be the same or different, and may be directed against the same antigen or antigenic determinant (for example against the same part(s) or epitope(s) or against different parts or epitopes) or may alternatively be directed against different antigens or antigenic determinants; or any suitable combination thereof. For example, a bivalent polypeptide of the invention may comprise (a) two identical Nanobodies; (b) a first Nanobody directed against a first antigenic determinant of a protein or antigen and a second Nanobody directed against the same antigenic determinant of said protein or antigen which is different from the first Nanobody; (c) a first Nanobody directed against a first antigenic determinant of a protein or antigen and a second Nanobody directed against another antigenic determinant of said protein or antigen; or (d) a first Nanobody directed against a first protein or antigen and a second Nanobody directed against a second protein or antigen (i.e. different from said first antigen). Similarly, a trivalent polypeptide of the invention may, for example and without being limited thereto. comprise (a) three identical Nanobodies; (b) two identical Nanobody against a first antigenic determinant of an antigen and a third Nanobody directed against a different antigenic determinant of the same antigen; (c) two identical Nanobody against a first antigenic determinant of an antigen and a third Nanobody directed against a second antigen different from said first antigen; (d) a first Nanobody directed against a first antigenic determinant of a first antigen, a second Nanobody directed against a second antigenic determinant of said first antigen and a third Nanobody directed against a second antigen different from said first antigen; or (e) a first Nanobody directed against a first antigen, a second Nanobody directed against a second antigen different from said first antigen, and a third Nanobody directed against a third antigen different from said first and second antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides of the invention that contain at least two Nanobodies, in which at least one Nanobody is directed against a first antigen (i.e. against an APC target or T-cell target) and at least one Nanobody is directed against a second antigen (i.e. different from the APC target or T-cell target), will also be referred to as “multispecific” polypeptides of the invention, and the Nanobodies present in such polypeptides will also be referred to herein as being in a “multispecific format”. Thus, for example, a “bispecific” polypeptide of the invention is a polypeptide that comprises at least one Nanobody directed against a first antigen (i.e. an APC target or T-cell target) and at least one further Nanobody directed against a second antigen (i.e. different from the APC target or T-cell target), whereas a “trispecific” polypeptide of the invention is a polypeptide that comprises at least one Nanobody directed against a first antigen (i.e. an APC target or T-cell target), at least one further Nanobody directed against a second antigen (i.e. different from the APC target or T-cell target) and at least one further Nanobody directed against a third antigen (i.e. different from both the APC target or T-cell target, and the second antigen); etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in its simplest form, a bispecific polypeptide of the invention is a bivalent polypeptide of the invention (as defined herein), comprising a first Nanobody directed against an APC target or T-cell target, and a second Nanobody directed against a second antigen, in which said first and second Nanobody may optionally be linked via a linker sequence (as defined herein); whereas a trispecific polypeptide of the invention in its simplest form is a trivalent polypeptide of the invention (as defined herein), comprising a first Nanobody directed against an APC target or T-cell target, a second Nanobody directed against a second antigen and a third Nanobody directed against a third antigen, in which said first, second and third Nanobody may optionally be linked via one or more, and in particular one and more, in particular two, linker sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, as will be clear from the description hereinabove, the invention is not limited thereto, in the sense that a multispecific polypeptide of the invention may comprise at least one Nanobody against an APC target or T-cell target, and any number of Nanobodies directed against one or more antigens different from the APC target or T-cell target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, although it is encompassed within the scope of the invention that the specific order or arrangement of the various Nanobodies in the polypeptides of the invention may have some influence on the properties of the final polypeptide of the invention (including but not limited to the affinity, specificity or avidity for the APC target or T-cell target, or against the one or more other antigens), said order or arrangement is usually not critical and may be suitably chosen by the skilled person, optionally after some limited routine experiments based on the disclosure herein. Thus, when reference is made to a specific multivalent or multispecific polypeptide of the invention, it should be noted that this encompasses any order or arrangements of the relevant Nanobodies, unless explicitly indicated otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, it is also within the scope of the invention that the polypeptides of the invention contain two or more Nanobodies and one or more further amino acid sequences (as mentioned herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor multivalent and multispecific polypeptides containing one or more V\nHH \ndomains and their preparation, reference is also made to Conrath et al., J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 276, 10. 7346-7350, 2001; Muyldermans, Reviews in Molecular Biotechnology 74 (2001), 277-302; as well as to for example WO 96/34103 and WO 99/23221. Some other examples of some specific multispecific and/or multivalent polypeptide of the invention can be found in the applications by Ablynx N.V. referred to herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne preferred, but non-limiting example of a multispecific polypeptide of the invention comprises at least one Nanobody of the invention and at least one Nanobody that provides for an increased half-life. Such Nanobodies may for example be Nanobodies that are directed against a serum protein, and in particular a human serum protein, such as human serum albumin, thyroxine-binding protein, (human) transferrin, fibrinogen, an immunoglobulin such as IgG, IgE or IgM, or against one of the serum proteins listed in WO 04/003019. Of these, Nanobodies that can bind to serum albumin (and in particular human serum albumin) or to IgG (and in particular human IgG, see for example Nanobody VH-1 described in the review by Muyldermans, supra) are particularly preferred (although for example, for experiments in mice or primates, Nanobodies against or cross-reactive with mouse serum albumin (MSA) or serum albumin from said primate, respectively, can be used. However, for pharmaceutical use, Nanobodies against human serum albumin or human IgG will usually be preferred). Nanobodies that provide for increased half-life and that can be used in the polypeptides of the invention include the Nanobodies directed against serum albumin that are described in WO 04/041865, in WO 06/122787 and in the further patent applications by Ablynx N.V., such as those mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the some preferred Nanobodies that provide for increased half-life for use in the present invention include Nanobodies that can bind to amino acid residues on (human) serum albumin that are not involved in binding of serum albumin to FcRn (see for example WO 06/0122787); Nanobodies that are capable of binding to amino acid residues on serum albumin that do not form part of domain III of serum albumin (see for example WO 06/0122787); Nanobodies that have or can provide an increased half-life (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/843,349 by Ablynx N.V mentioned herein; see also PCT/EP2007/059475); Nanobodies against human serum albumin that are cross-reactive with serum albumin from at least one species of mammal, and in particular with at least one species of primate (such as, without limitation, monkeys from the genus \nMacaca \n(such as, and in particular, cynomologus monkeys (\nMacaca fascicularis\n) and/or rhesus monkeys (\nMacaca mulatta\n)) and baboon (\nPapio ursinus\n)) (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/843,349 by Ablynx N.V; see also PCT/EP2007/059475); Nanobodies that can bind to serum albumin in a pH independent manner (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/850,774 by Ablynx N.V. mentioned herein) and/or Nanobodies that are conditional binders (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/850,775 by Ablynx N.V.; see also PCT/EP2007/060850).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome particularly preferred Nanobodies that provide for increased half-life and that can be used in the polypeptides of the invention include the Nanobodies ALB-1 to ALB-10 disclosed in WO 06/122787 (see Tables II and III) of which ALB-8 (SEQ ID NO: 62 in WO 06/122787) is particularly preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred, but non-limiting examples of polypeptides of the invention that comprise at least one Nanobody of the invention and at least one Nanobody that provides for increased half-life are given in SEQ ID NO's 286-305 and 1392-1395.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a specific, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the polypeptides of the invention contain, besides the one or more Nanobodies of the invention, at least one Nanobody against human serum albumin\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, any polypeptides of the invention with increased half-life that contain one or more Nanobodies of the invention, and any derivatives of Nanobodies of the invention or of such polypeptides that have an increased half-life, preferably have a half-life that is at least 1.5 times, preferably at least 2 times, such as at least 5 times, for example at least 10 times or more than 20 times, greater than the half-life of the corresponding Nanobody of the invention per se. For example, such a derivative or polypeptides with increased half-life may have a half-life that is increased with more than 1 hours, preferably more than 2 hours, more preferably more than 6 hours, such as more than 12 hours, or even more than 24, 48 or 72 hours, compared to the corresponding Nanobody of the invention per se.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, such derivatives or polypeptides may exhibit a serum half-life in human of at least about 12 hours, preferably at least 24 hours, more preferably at least 48 hours, even more preferably at least 72 hours or more. For example, such derivatives or polypeptides may have a half-life of at least 5 days (such as about 5 to 10 days), preferably at least 9 days (such as about 9 to 14 days), more preferably at least about 10 days (such as about 10 to 15 days), or at least about 11 days (such as about 11 to 16 days), more preferably at least about 12 days (such as about 12 to 18 days or more), or more than 14 days (such as about 14 to 19 days).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention the polypeptides are capable of binding to one or more molecules which can increase the half-life of the polypeptide in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptides of the invention are stabilised in vivo and their half-life increased by binding to molecules which resist degradation and/or clearance or sequestration. Typically, such molecules are naturally occurring proteins which themselves have a long half-life in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother preferred, but non-limiting example of a multispecific polypeptide of the invention comprises at least one Nanobody of the invention and at least one Nanobody that directs the polypeptide of the invention towards, and/or that allows the polypeptide of the invention to penetrate or to enter into specific organs, tissues, cells, or parts or compartments of cells, and/or that allows the Nanobody to penetrate or cross a biological barrier such as a cell membrane, a cell layer such as a layer of epithelial cells, a tumor including solid tumors, or the blood-brain-barrier. Examples of such Nanobodies include Nanobodies that are directed towards specific cell-surface proteins, markers or epitopes of the desired organ, tissue or cell (for example cell-surface markers associated with tumor cells), and the single-domain brain targeting antibody fragments described in WO 02/057445 and WO 06/040153, of which FC44 (SEQ ID NO:189 of WO 06/040153) and FC5 (SEQ ID NO:190 of WO 06/040154) are preferred examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the polypeptides of the invention, the one or more Nanobodies and the one or more polypeptides may be directly linked to each other (as for example described in WO 99/23221) and/or may be linked to each other via one or more suitable spacers or linkers, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable spacers or linkers for use in multivalent and multispecific polypeptides will be clear to the skilled person, and may generally be any linker or spacer used in the art to link amino acid sequences. Preferably, said linker or spacer is suitable for use in constructing proteins or polypeptides that are intended for pharmaceutical use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome particularly preferred spacers include the spacers and linkers that are used in the art to link antibody fragments or antibody domains. These include the linkers mentioned in the general background art cited above, as well as for example linkers that are used in the art to construct diabodies or ScFv fragments (in this respect, however, its should be noted that, whereas in diabodies and in ScFv fragments, the linker sequence used should have a length, a degree of flexibility and other properties that allow the pertinent V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains to come together to form the complete antigen-binding site, there is no particular limitation on the length or the flexibility of the linker used in the polypeptide of the invention, since each Nanobody by itself forms a complete antigen-binding site).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a linker may be a suitable amino acid sequence, and in particular amino acid sequences of between 1 and 60, preferably between 1 and 50, more preferably preferably between 1 and 30, such as between 1 and 10 amino acid residues. Some preferred examples of such amino acid sequences include gly-ser linkers, for example of the type (gly\nx\nser\ny\n)\nz\n, such as (for example (gly\n4\nser)\n3 \nor (gly\n3\nser\n2\n)\n3\n, as described in WO 99/42077 and the GS30, GS15, GS9 and GS7 linkers described in the applications by Ablynx mentioned herein (see for example WO 06/040153 and WO 06/122825), as well as hinge-like regions, such as the hinge regions of naturally occurring heavy chain antibodies or similar sequences (such as described in WO 94/04678).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome other particularly preferred linkers are poly-alanine (such as AAA), as well as the linkers GS40, GS35, GS30 (SEQ ID NO: 85 in WO 06/122825) and GS9 (SEQ ID NO: 84 in WO 06/122825).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, when the multivalent (such as e.g. bivalent) polypeptide of the invention binds identical (or different) binding sites on different subunits of a mutimer (such as e.g. a dimer; such as e.g. CTLA4), the linker used in the polypeptide of the invention may be an amino acid sequence wherein the number of amino acid residues is more than 30, preferably more than 35, more preferably more than 40, such as between 30 and 60, between 35 and 60 or between 40 and 60.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable linkers generally comprise organic compounds or polymers, in particular those suitable for use in proteins for pharmaceutical use. For instance, poly(ethyleneglycol) moieties have been used to link antibody domains, see for example WO 04/081026.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is encompassed within the scope of the invention that the length, the degree of flexibility and/or other properties of the linker(s) used (although not critical, as it usually is for linkers used in ScFv fragments) may have some influence on the properties of the final polypeptide of the invention, including but not limited to the affinity, specificity or avidity for the APC target or T-cell target, or for one or more of the other antigens. Based on the disclosure herein, the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linker(s) for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention, optionally after some limited routine experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in multivalent polypeptides of the invention that comprise Nanobodies directed against a multimeric antigen (such as a multimeric receptor or other protein), the length and flexibility of the linker are preferably such that it allows each Nanobody of the invention present in the polypeptide to bind to the antigenic determinant on each of the subunits of the multimer. Similarly, in a multispecific polypeptide of the invention that comprises Nanobodies directed against two or more different antigenic determinants on the same antigen (for example against different epitopes of an antigen and/or against different subunits of a multimeric receptor, channel or protein), the length and flexibility of the linker are preferably such that it allows each Nanobody to bind to its intended antigenic determinant. Again, based on the disclosure herein, the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linker(s) for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention, optionally after some limited routine experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also within the scope of the invention that the linker(s) used confer one or more other favourable properties or functionality to the polypeptides of the invention, and/or provide one or more sites for the formation of derivatives and/or for the attachment of functional groups (e.g. as described herein for the derivatives of the Nanobodies of the invention). For example, linkers containing one or more charged amino acid residues (see Table A-2 above) can provide improved hydrophilic properties, whereas linkers that form or contain small epitopes or tags can be used for the purposes of detection, identification and/or purification. Again, based on the disclosure herein, the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linkers for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention, optionally after some limited routine experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, when two or more linkers are used in the polypeptides of the invention, these linkers may be the same or different. Again, based on the disclosure herein, the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linkers for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention, optionally after some limited routine experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsually, for easy of expression and production, a polypeptide of the invention will be a linear polypeptide. However, the invention in its broadest sense is not limited thererto. For example, when a polypeptide of the invention comprises three of more Nanobodies, it is possible to link them by use of a linker with three or more “arms”, which each “arm” being linked to a Nanobody, so as to provide a “star-shaped” construct. It is also possible, although usually less preferred, to use circular constructs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also comprises derivatives of the polypeptides of the invention, which may be essentially analogous to the derivatives of the Nanobodies of the invention, i.e. as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also comprises proteins or polypeptides that “essentially consist” of a polypeptide of the invention (in which the wording “essentially consist of” has essentially the same meaning as indicated hereinabove).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, the polypeptide of the invention is in essentially isolated from, as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, Nanobodies, polypeptides and nucleic acids of the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se, as will be clear to the skilled person from the further description herein. For example, the Nanobodies and polypetides of the invention can be prepared in any manner known per se for the preparation of antibodies and in particular for the preparation of antibody fragments (including but not limited to (single) domain antibodies and ScFv fragments). Some preferred, but non-limiting methods for preparing the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies, polypeptides and nucleic acids include the methods and techniques described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be clear to the skilled person, one particularly useful method for preparing an amino acid sequence, Nanobody and/or a polypeptide of the invention generally comprises the steps of:\n\n \n \n \ni) the expression, in a suitable host cell or host organism (also referred to herein as a “host of the invention”) or in another suitable expression system of a nucleic acid that encodes said amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention (also referred to herein as a “nucleic acid of the invention”), optionally followed by:\n \nii) isolating and/or purifying the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention thus obtained.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn particular, such a method may comprise the steps of:\n\n \n \n \ni) cultivating and/or maintaining a host of the invention under conditions that are such that said host of the invention expresses and/or produces at least one amino acid sequence, Nanobody and/or polypeptide of the invention; optionally followed by:\n \nii) isolating and/or purifying the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention thus obtained.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA nucleic acid of the invention can be in the form of single or double stranded DNA or RNA, and is preferably in the form of double stranded DNA. For example, the nucleotide sequences of the invention may be genomic DNA, cDNA or synthetic DNA (such as DNA with a codon usage that has been specifically adapted for expression in the intended host cell or host organism).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, the nucleic acid of the invention is in essentially isolated from, as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid of the invention may also be in the form of, be present in and/or be part of a vector, such as for example a plasmid, cosmid or YAC, which again may be in essentially isolated form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acids of the invention can be prepared or obtained in a manner known per se, based on the information on the amino acid sequences for the polypeptides of the invention given herein, and/or can be isolated from a suitable natural source. To provide analogs, nucleotide sequences encoding naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains can for example be subjected to site-directed mutagenesis, so at to provide a nucleic acid of the invention encoding said analog. Also, as will be clear to the skilled person, to prepare a nucleic acid of the invention, also several nucleotide sequences, such as at least one nucleotide sequence encoding a Nanobody and for example nucleic acids encoding one or more linkers can be linked together in a suitable manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for generating the nucleic acids of the invention will be clear to the skilled person and may for instance include, but are not limited to, automated DNA synthesis; site-directed mutagenesis; combining two or more naturally occurring and/or synthetic sequences (or two or more parts thereof), introduction of mutations that lead to the expression of a truncated expression product; introduction of one or more restriction sites (e.g. to create cassettes and/or regions that may easily be digested and/or ligated using suitable restriction enzymes), and/or the introduction of mutations by means of a PCR reaction using one or more “mismatched” primers, using for example a sequence of a naturally occurring form of the amino acid sequence as a template. These and other techniques will be clear to the skilled person, and reference is again made to the standard handbooks, such as Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al., mentioned above, as well as the Examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid of the invention may also be in the form of, be present in and/or be part of a genetic construct, as will be clear to the person skilled in the art. Such genetic constructs generally comprise at least one nucleic acid of the invention that is optionally linked to one or more elements of genetic constructs known per se, such as for example one or more suitable regulatory elements (such as a suitable promoter(s), enhancer(s), terminator(s), etc.) and the further elements of genetic constructs referred to herein. Such genetic constructs comprising at least one nucleic acid of the invention will also be referred to herein as “genetic constructs of the invention”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe genetic constructs of the invention may be DNA or RNA, and are preferably double-stranded DNA. The genetic constructs of the invention may also be in a form suitable for transformation of the intended host cell or host organism, in a form suitable for integration into the genomic DNA of the intended host cell or in a form suitable for independent replication, maintenance and/or inheritance in the intended host organism. For instance, the genetic constructs of the invention may be in the form of a vector, such as for example a plasmid, cosmid, YAC, a viral vector or transposon. In particular, the vector may be an expression vector, i.e. a vector that can provide for expression in vitro and/or in vivo (e.g. in a suitable host cell, host organism and/or expression system).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred but non-limiting aspect, a genetic construct of the invention comprises\n\n \n \n \ni) at least one nucleic acid of the invention; operably connected to\n \nii) one or more regulatory elements, such as a promoter and optionally a suitable terminator;\n\n\nand optionally also\n\n \niii) one or more further elements of genetic constructs known per se;\n\n\nin which the terms “regulatory element”, “promoter”, “terminator” and “operably connected” have their usual meaning in the art (as further described herein); and in which said “further elements” present in the genetic constructs may for example be 3′- or 5′-UTR sequences, leader sequences, selection markers, expression markers/reporter genes, and/or elements that may facilitate or increase (the efficiency of) transformation or integration. These and other suitable elements for such genetic constructs will be clear to the skilled person, and may for instance depend upon the type of construct used, the intended host cell or host organism; the manner in which the nucleotide sequences of the invention of interest are to be expressed (e.g. via constitutive, transient or inducible expression); and/or the transformation technique to be used. For example, regulatory requences, promoters and terminators known per se for the expression and production of antibodies and antibody fragments (including but not limited to (single) domain antibodies and ScFv fragments) may be used in an essentially analogous manner.\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferably, in the genetic constructs of the invention, said at least one nucleic acid of the invention and said regulatory elements, and optionally said one or more further elements, are “operably linked” to each other, by which is generally meant that they are in a functional relationship with each other. For instance, a promoter is considered “operably linked” to a coding sequence if said promoter is able to initiate or otherwise control/regulate the transcription and/or the expression of a coding sequence (in which said coding sequence should be understood as being “under the control of” said promotor). Generally, when two nucleotide sequences are operably linked, they will be in the same orientation and usually also in the same reading frame. They will usually also be essentially contiguous, although this may also not be required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the regulatory and further elements of the genetic constructs of the invention are such that they are capable of providing their intended biological function in the intended host cell or host organism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance, a promoter, enhancer or terminator should be “operable” in the intended host cell or host organism, by which is meant that (for example) said promoter should be capable of initiating or otherwise controlling/regulating the transcription and/or the expression of a nucleotide sequence—e.g. a coding sequence—to which it is operably linked (as defined herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome particularly preferred promoters include, but are not limited to, promoters known per se for the expression in the host cells mentioned herein; and in particular promoters for the expression in the bacterial cells, such as those mentioned herein and/or those used in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA selection marker should be such that it allows—i.e. under appropriate selection conditions—host cells and/or host organisms that have been (successfully) transformed with the nucleotide sequence of the invention to be distinguished from host cells/organisms that have not been (successfully) transformed. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such markers are genes that provide resistance against antibiotics (such as kanamycin or ampicillin), genes that provide for temperature resistance, or genes that allow the host cell or host organism to be maintained in the absence of certain factors, compounds and/or (food) components in the medium that are essential for survival of the non-transformed cells or organisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA leader sequence should be such that—in the intended host cell or host organism—it allows for the desired post-translational modifications and/or such that it directs the transcribed mRNA to a desired part or organelle of a cell. A leader sequence may also allow for secretion of the expression product from said cell. As such, the leader sequence may be any pro-, pre-, or prepro-sequence operable in the host cell or host organism. Leader sequences may not be required for expression in a bacterial cell. For example, leader sequences known per se for the expression and production of antibodies and antibody fragments (including but not limited to single domain antibodies and ScFv fragments) may be used in an essentially analogous manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn expression marker or reporter gene should be such that—in the host cell or host organism—it allows for detection of the expression of (a gene or nucleotide sequence present on) the genetic construct. An expression marker may optionally also allow for the localisation of the expressed product, e.g. in a specific part or organelle of a cell and/or in (a) specific cell(s), tissue(s), organ(s) or part(s) of a multicellular organism. Such reporter genes may also be expressed as a protein fusion with the amino acid sequence of the invention. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples include fluorescent proteins such as GFP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred, but non-limiting examples of suitable promoters, terminator and further elements include those that can be used for the expression in the host cells mentioned herein; and in particular those that are suitable for expression in bacterial cells, such as those mentioned herein and/or those used in the Examples below. For some (further) non-limiting examples of the promoters, selection markers, leader sequences, expression markers and further elements that may be present/used in the genetic constructs of the invention—such as terminators, transcriptional and/or translational enhancers and/or integration factors—reference is made to the general handbooks such as Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al. mentioned above, as well as to the examples that are given in WO 95/07463, WO 96/23810, WO 95/07463, WO 95/21191, WO 97/11094, WO 97/42320, WO 98/06737, WO 98/21355, U.S. Pat. No. 7,207,410, U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,492 and \nEP\n 1 085 089. Other examples will be clear to the skilled person. Reference is also made to the general background art cited above and the further references cited herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe genetic constructs of the invention may generally be provided by suitably linking the nucleotide sequence(s) of the invention to the one or more further elements described above, for example using the techniques described in the general handbooks such as Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al., mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOften, the genetic constructs of the invention will be obtained by inserting a nucleotide sequence of the invention in a suitable (expression) vector known per se. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of suitable expression vectors are those used in the Examples below, as well as those mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acids of the invention and/or the genetic constructs of the invention may be used to transform a host cell or host organism, i.e. for expression and/or production of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention. Suitable hosts or host cells will be clear to the skilled person, and may for example be any suitable fungal, prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell or cell line or any suitable fungal, prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism, for example:\n\n \n \n \n \n \na bacterial strain, including but not limited to gram-negative strains such as strains of \nEscherichia coli\n; of \nProteus\n, for example of \nProteus mirabilis\n; of \nPseudomonas\n, for example of \nPseudomonas fluorescens\n; and gram-positive strains such as strains of \nBacillus\n, for example of \nBacillus subtilis \nor of \nBacillus brevis\n; of \nStreptomyces\n, for example of \nStreptomyces lividans\n; of \nStaphylococcus\n, for example of \nStaphylococcus carnosus\n; and of \nLactococcus\n, for example of \nLactococcus \nlactis; a fungal cell, including but not limited to cells from species of \nTrichoderma\n, for example from \nTrichoderma reesei\n; of \nNeurospora\n, for example from \nNeurospora crassa\n; of \nSordaria\n, for example from \nSordaria macrospora\n; of \nAspergillus\n, for example from \nAspergillus niger \nor from \nAspergillus sojae\n; or from other filamentous fungi;\n \na yeast cell, including but not limited to cells from species of \nSaccharomyces\n, for example of \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n; of \nSchizosaccharomyces\n, for example of \nSchizosaccharomyces pombe\n; of \nPichia\n, for example of \nPichia pastoris \nor of \nPichia methanolica\n; of \nHansenula\n, for example of \nHansenula polymorpha\n; of \nKluyveromyces\n, for example of \nKluyveromyces lactis\n; of \nArxula\n, for example of \nArxula adeninivorans\n; of \nYarrowia\n, for example of \nYarrowia lipolytica; \n \n \nan amphibian cell or cell line, such as \nXenopus \noocytes;\n \nan insect-derived cell or cell line, such as cells/cell lines derived from \nlepidoptera\n, including but not limited to \nSpodoptera \nSF9 and Sf21 cells or cells/cell lines derived from \nDrosophila\n, such as Schneider and Kc cells;\n \na plant or plant cell, for example in tobacco plants; and/or\n \na mammalian cell or cell line, for example a cell or cell line derived from a human, a cell or a cell line from mammals including but not limited to CHO-cells, BHK-cells (for example BHK-21 cells) and human cells or cell lines such as HeLa, COS (for example COS-7) and PER.C6 cells;\n\n\nas well as all other hosts or host cells known per se for the expression and production of antibodies and antibody fragments (including but not limited to (single) domain antibodies and ScFv fragments), which will be clear to the skilled person. Reference is also made to the general background art cited hereinabove, as well as to for example WO 94/29457; WO 96/34103; WO 99/42077; Frenken et al., (1998), supra; Riechmann and Muyldermans, (1999), supra; van der Linden, (2000), supra; Thomassen et al., (2002), supra; Joosten et al., (2003), supra; Joosten et al., (2005), supra; and the further references cited herein.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can also be introduced and expressed in one or more cells, tissues or organs of a multicellular organism, for example for prophylactic and/or therapeutic purposes (e.g. as a gene therapy). For this purpose, the nucleotide sequences of the invention may be introduced into the cells or tissues in any suitable way, for example as such (e.g. using liposomes) or after they have been inserted into a suitable gene therapy vector (for example derived from retroviruses such as adenovirus, or parvoviruses such as adeno-associated virus). As will also be clear to the skilled person, such gene therapy may be performed in vivo and/or in situ in the body of a patient by administering a nucleic acid of the invention or a suitable gene therapy vector encoding the same to the patient or to specific cells or a specific tissue or organ of the patient; or suitable cells (often taken from the body of the patient to be treated, such as explanted lymphocytes, bone marrow aspirates or tissue biopsies) may be treated in vitro with a nucleotide sequence of the invention and then be suitably (re-)introduced into the body of the patient. All this can be performed using gene therapy vectors, techniques and delivery systems which are well known to the skilled person, and for example described in Culver, K. W., “Gene Therapy”, 1994, p. xii, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., Publishers, New York, N.Y); Giordano, Nature F Medicine 2 (1996), 534-539; Schaper, Circ.

No. 55,895,466; or Schaper, Current Opinion in Biotechnology 7 (1996), 635-640. For example, in situ expression of ScFv fragments (Afanasieva et al., Gene Ther., 10, 1850-1859 (2003)) and of diabodies (Blanco et al., J. Immunol, 171, 1070-1077 (2003)) has been described in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor expression of the Nanobodies in a cell, they may also be expressed as so-called “intrabodies”, as for example described in WO 94/02610, WO 95/22618 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,004,940; WO 03/014960; in Cattaneo, A. & Biocca, S. (1997) Intracellular Antibodies: Development and Applications. Landes and Springer-Verlag; and in Kontermann, Methods 34, (2004), 163-170.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can for example also be produced in the milk of transgenic mammals, for example in the milk of rabbits, cows, goats or sheep (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 6,741,957, U.S. Pat. No. 6,304,489 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,849,992 for general techniques for introducing transgenes into mammals), in plants or parts of plants including but not limited to their leaves, flowers, fruits, seed, roots or turbers (for example in tobacco, maize, soybean or alfalfa) or in for example pupae of the silkworm \nBombix mori. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can also be expressed and/or produced in cell-free expression systems, and suitable examples of such systems will be clear to the skilled person. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples include expression in the wheat germ system; in rabbit reticulocyte lysates; or in the \nE. coli \nZubay system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, one of the advantages of the use of Nanobodies is that the polypeptides based thereon can be prepared through expression in a suitable bacterial system, and suitable bacterial expression systems, vectors, host cells, regulatory elements, etc., will be clear to the skilled person, for example from the references cited above. It should however be noted that the invention in its broadest sense is not limited to expression in bacterial systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, in the invention, an (in vivo or in vitro) expression system, such as a bacterial expression system, is used that provides the polypeptides of the invention in a form that is suitable for pharmaceutical use, and such expression systems will again be clear to the skilled person. As also will be clear to the skilled person, polypeptides of the invention suitable for pharmaceutical use can be prepared using techniques for peptide synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor production on industrial scale, preferred heterologous hosts for the (industrial) production of Nanobodies or Nanobody-containing protein therapeutics include strains of \nE. coli, Pichia pastoris, S. cerevisiae \nthat are suitable for large scale expression/production/fermentation, and in particular for large scale pharmaceutical (i.e. GMP grade) expression/production/fermentation. Suitable examples of such strains will be clear to the skilled person. Such strains and production/expression systems are also made available by companies such as Biovitrum (Uppsala, Sweden).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, mammalian cell lines, in particular Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, can be used for large scale expression/production/fermentation, and in particular for large scale pharmaceutical expression/production/fermentation. Again, such expression/production systems are also made available by some of the companies mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of the specific expression system would depend in part on the requirement for certain post-translational modifications, more specifically glycosylation. The production of a Nanobody-containing recombinant protein for which glycosylation is desired or required would necessitate the use of mammalian expression hosts that have the ability to glycosylate the expressed protein. In this respect, it will be clear to the skilled person that the glycosylation pattern obtained (i.e. the kind, number and position of residues attached) will depend on the cell or cell line that is used for the expression. Preferably, either a human cell or cell line is used (i.e. leading to a protein that essentially has a human glycosylation pattern) or another mammalian cell line is used that can provide a glycosylation pattern that is essentially and/or functionally the same as human glycosylation or at least mimics human glycosylation. Generally, prokaryotic hosts such as \nE. coli \ndo not have the ability to glycosylate proteins, and the use of lower eukaryotes such as yeast usually leads to a glycosylation pattern that differs from human glycosylation. Nevertheless, it should be understood that all the foregoing host cells and expression systems can be used in the invention, depending on the desired amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide to be obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, according to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is glycosylated. According to another non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is non-glycosylated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is produced in a bacterial cell, in particular a bacterial cell suitable for large scale pharmaceutical production, such as cells of the strains mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is produced in a yeast cell, in particular a yeast cell suitable for large scale pharmaceutical production, such as cells of the species mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to yet another preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is produced in a mammalian cell, in particular in a human cell or in a cell of a human cell line, and more in particular in a human cell or in a cell of a human cell line that is suitable for large scale pharmaceutical production, such as the cell lines mentioned hereinabove.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen expression in a host cell is used to produce the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and the polypeptides of the invention, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be produced either intracellullarly (e.g. in the cytosol, in the periplasma or in inclusion bodies) and then isolated from the host cells and optionally further purified; or can be produced extracellularly (e.g. in the medium in which the host cells are cultured) and then isolated from the culture medium and optionally further purified. When eukaryotic host cells are used, extracellular production is usually preferred since this considerably facilitates the further isolation and downstream processing of the Nanobodies and proteins obtained. Bacterial cells such as the strains of \nE. coli \nmentioned above normally do not secrete proteins extracellularly, except for a few classes of proteins such as toxins and hemolysin, and secretory production in \nE. coli \nrefers to the translocation of proteins across the inner membrane to the periplasmic space. Periplasmic production provides several advantages over cytosolic production. For example, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the secreted product can be identical to the natural gene product after cleavage of the secretion signal sequence by a specific signal peptidase. Also, there appears to be much less protease activity in the periplasm than in the cytoplasm. In addition, protein purification is simpler due to fewer contaminating proteins in the periplasm. Another advantage is that correct disulfide bonds may form because the periplasm provides a more oxidative environment than the cytoplasm. Proteins overexpressed in \nE. coli \nare often found in insoluble aggregates, so-called inclusion bodies. These inclusion bodies may be located in the cytosol or in the periplasm; the recovery of biologically active proteins from these inclusion bodies requires a denaturation/refolding process. Many recombinant proteins, including therapeutic proteins, are recovered from inclusion bodies. Alternatively, as will be clear to the skilled person, recombinant strains of bacteria that have been genetically modified so as to secrete a desired protein, and in particular an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or a polypeptide of the invention, can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, according to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide that has been produced intracellularly and that has been isolated from the host cell, and in particular from a bacterial cell or from an inclusion body in a bacterial cell. According to another non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide that has been produced extracellularly, and that has been isolated from the medium in which the host cell is cultivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred, but non-limiting promoters for use with these host cells include,\n\n \n \n \n \n \nfor expression in \nE. coli\n: lac promoter (and derivatives thereof such as the lacUV5 promoter); arabinose promoter; left-(PL) and rightward (PR) promoter of phage lambda; promoter of the hp operon; hybrid lac/hp promoters (tac and trc); T7-promoter (more specifically that of T7-phage gene 10) and other T-phage promoters; promoter of the Tn10 tetracycline resistance gene; engineered variants of the above promoters that include one or more copies of an extraneous regulatory operator sequence;\n \nfor expression in \nS. cerevisiae\n: constitutive: ADH1 (alcohol dehydrogenase 1), ENO (enolase), CYC1 (cytochrome c iso-1), GAPDH (glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), PGK1 (phosphoglycerate kinase), PYK1 (pyruvate kinase); regulated: GAL1,10,7 (galactose metabolic enzymes), ADH2 (alcohol dehydrogenase 2), PHOS (acid phosphatase), CUP1 (copper metallothionein); heterologous: CaMV (cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter);\n \nfor expression in \nPichia pastoris\n: the AOX1 promoter (alcohol oxidase I);\n \nfor expression in mammalian cells: human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) immediate early enhancer/promoter; human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) immediate early promoter variant that contains two tetracycline operator sequences such that the promoter can be regulated by the Tet repressor; Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter; Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat (RSV LTR) enhancer/promoter; elongation factor 1α (hEF-1α) promoter from human, chimpanzee, mouse or rat; the SV40 early promoter; HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter; β-actin promoter;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nSome preferred, but non-limiting vectors for use with these host cells include:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nvectors for expression in mammalian cells: pMAMneo (Clontech), pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pMC1neo (Stratagene), pSG5 (Stratagene), EBO-pSV2-neo (ATCC 37593), pBPV-1 (8-2) (ATCC 37110), pdBPV-MMTneo (342-12) (ATCC 37224), pRSVgpt (ATCC37199), pRSVneo (ATCC37198), pSV2-dhfr (ATCC 37146), pUCTag (ATCC 37460) and 1ZD35 (ATCC 37565), as well as viral-based expression systems, such as those based on adenovirus;\n \nvectors for expression in bacterial cells: pET vectors (Novagen) and pQE vectors (Qiagen);\n \nvectors for expression in yeast or other fungal cells: pYES2 (Invitrogen) and \nPichia \nexpression vectors (Invitrogen);\n \nvectors for expression in insect cells: pBlueBacII (Invitrogen) and other baculovirus vectors\n \nvectors for expression in plants or plant cells: for example vectors based on cauliflower mosaic virus or tobacco mosaic virus, suitable strains of \nAgrobacterium\n, or Ti-plasmid based vectors.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nSome preferred, but non-limiting secretory sequences for use with these host cells include:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nfor use in bacterial cells such as \nE. coli\n: Pe1B, Bla, OmpA, OmpC, OmpF, OmpT, StII, PhoA, PhoE, MalE, Lpp, LamB, and the like; TAT signal peptide, hemolysin C-terminal secretion signal;\n \nfor use in yeast: α-mating factor prepro-sequence, phosphatase (phol), invertase (Suc), etc.;\n \nfor use in mammalian cells: indigenous signal in case the target protein is of eukaryotic origin; murine Ig κ-chain V-J2-C signal peptide; etc.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nSuitable techniques for transforming a host or host cell of the invention will be clear to the skilled person and may depend on the intended host cell/host organism and the genetic construct to be used. Reference is again made to the handbooks and patent applications mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter transformation, a step for detecting and selecting those host cells or host organisms that have been succesfully transformed with the nucleotide sequence/genetic construct of the invention may be performed. This may for instance be a selection step based on a selectable marker present in the genetic construct of the invention or a step involving the detection of the amino acid sequence of the invention, e.g. using specific antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe transformed host cell (which may be in the form or a stable cell line) or host organisms (which may be in the form of a stable mutant line or strain) form further aspects of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, these host cells or host organisms are such that they express, or are (at least) capable of expressing (e.g. under suitable conditions), an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention (and in case of a host organism: in at least one cell, part, tissue or organ thereof). The invention also includes further generations, progeny and/or offspring of the host cell or host organism of the invention, that may for instance be obtained by cell division or by sexual or asexual reproduction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo produce/obtain expression of the amino acid sequences of the invention, the transformed host cell or transformed host organism may generally be kept, maintained and/or cultured under conditions such that the (desired) amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is expressed/produced. Suitable conditions will be clear to the skilled person and will usually depend upon the host cell/host organism used, as well as on the regulatory elements that control the expression of the (relevant) nucleotide sequence of the invention. Again, reference is made to the handbooks and patent applications mentioned above in the paragraphs on the genetic constructs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, suitable conditions may include the use of a suitable medium, the presence of a suitable source of food and/or suitable nutrients, the use of a suitable temperature, and optionally the presence of a suitable inducing factor or compound (e.g. when the nucleotide sequences of the invention are under the control of an inducible promoter); all of which may be selected by the skilled person. Again, under such conditions, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be expressed in a constitutive manner, in a transient manner, or only when suitably induced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will also be clear to the skilled person that the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention may (first) be generated in an immature form (as mentioned above), which may then be subjected to post-translational modification, depending on the host cell/host organism used. Also, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention may be glycosylated, again depending on the host cell/host organism used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention may then be isolated from the host cell/host organism and/or from the medium in which said host cell or host organism was cultivated, using protein isolation and/or purification techniques known per se, such as (preparative) chromatography and/or electrophoresis techniques, differential precipitation techniques, affinity techniques (e.g. using a specific, cleavable amino acid sequence fused with the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention) and/or preparative immunological techniques (i.e. using antibodies against the amino acid sequence to be isolated).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, for pharmaceutical use, the polypeptides of the invention may be formulated as a pharmaceutical preparation or compositions comprising at least one polypeptide of the invention and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient and/or adjuvant, and optionally one or more further pharmaceutically active polypeptides and/or compounds. By means of non-limiting examples, such a formulation may be in a form suitable for oral administration, for parenteral administration (such as by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion), for topical administration, for administration by inhalation, by a skin patch, by an implant, by a suppository, etc. Such suitable administration forms—which may be solid, semi-solid or liquid, depending on the manner of administration—as well as methods and carriers for use in the preparation thereof, will be clear to the skilled person, and are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in a further aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition that contains at least one amino acid of the invention, at least one Nanobody of the invention or at least one polypeptide of the invention and at least one suitable carrier, diluent or excipient (i.e. suitable for pharmaceutical use), and optionally one or more further active substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be formulated and administered in any suitable manner known per se, for which reference is for example made to the general background art cited above (and in particular to WO 04/041862, WO 04/041863, WO 04/041865 and WO 04/041867) as well as to the standard handbooks, such as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18\nth \nEd., Mack Publishing Company, USA (1990) or Remington, the Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21th Edition, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins (2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be formulated and administered in any manner known per se for conventional antibodies and antibody fragments (including ScFv's and diabodies) and other pharmaceutically active proteins. Such formulations and methods for preparing the same will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include preparations suitable for parenteral administration (for example intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraluminal, intra-arterial or intrathecal administration) or for topical (i.e. transdermal or intradermal) administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations for parenteral administration may for example be sterile solutions, suspensions, dispersions or emulsions that are suitable for infusion or injection. Suitable carriers or diluents for such preparations for example include, without limitation, sterile water and aqueous buffers and solutions such as physiological phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solutions, dextrose solution, and Hank's solution; water oils; glycerol; ethanol; glycols such as propylene glycol or as well as mineral oils, animal oils and vegetable oils, for example peanut oil, soybean oil, as well as suitable mixtures thereof. Usually, aqueous solutions or suspensions will be preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can also be administered using gene therapy methods of delivery. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,346, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Using a gene therapy method of delivery, primary cells transfected with the gene encoding an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention can additionally be transfected with tissue specific promoters to target specific organs, tissue, grafts, tumors, or cells and can additionally be transfected with signal and stabilization sequences for subcellularly localized expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention. Their percentage in the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations and formulations for oral administration may also be provided with an enteric coating that will allow the constructs of the invention to resist the gastric environment and pass into the intestines. More generally, preparations and formulations for oral administration may be suitably formulated for delivery into any desired part of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, suitable suppositories may be used for delivery into the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention or their salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form must be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical administration, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be applied in pure form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, hydroxyalkyls or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention to the skin are known to the art; for example, see Jacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful dosages of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the concentration of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention in a liquid composition, such as a lotion, will be from about 0.1-25 wt-%, preferably from about 0.5-10 wt-%. The concentration in a semi-solid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder will be about 0.1-5 wt-%, preferably about 0.5-2.5 wt-%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. Also the dosage of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention varies depending on the target cell, tumor, tissue, graft, or organ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn administration regimen could include long-term, daily treatment. By “long-term” is meant at least two weeks and preferably, several weeks, months, or years of duration. Necessary modifications in this dosage range may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein. See Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Martin, E. W., ed. 4), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. The dosage can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one autoimmune disease, allergy, asthma, transplant rejection (acute and chronic), cancer, tumor, effector cell exhaustion, or infection, said method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same. In a preferred aspect, the invention relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least autoimmune diseases such as human anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease, lupus nephritis, diabetes, collagen-induced arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune uveitis, psoriasis vulgaris, rheumatoid arthritis, CNS autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis, Graves disease, Myasthenia gravis (MG), Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and Psoriasis; allergy and asthma such as allergic contact dermatitis and airway hyperresponsiveness (bronchial asthma, allergic lung inflammatory responses); transplant rejections (acute and chronic) such as renal transplant rejection, bone marrow allograft rejection and cardiac allograft rejection; cancer and tumors; and viral infections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of the present invention, the term “prevention and/or treatment” not only comprises preventing and/or treating the disease, but also generally comprises preventing the onset of the disease, slowing or reversing the progress of disease, preventing or slowing the onset of one or more symptoms associated with the disease, reducing and/or alleviating one or more symptoms associated with the disease, reducing the severity and/or the duration of the disease and/or of any symptoms associated therewith and/or preventing a further increase in the severity of the disease and/or of any symptoms associated therewith, preventing, reducing or reversing any physiological damage caused by the disease, and generally any pharmacological action that is beneficial to the patient being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject to be treated may be any warm-blooded animal, but is in particular a mammal, and more in particular a human being. As will be clear to the skilled person, the subject to be treated will in particular be a person suffering from, or at risk of, the diseases and disorders mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder that is associated with an APC target or a T-cell target, with its biological or pharmacological activity, and/or with the biological pathways or signalling in which an APC target or a T-cell target is involved, said method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same. In particular, the invention relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder that can be treated by modulating an APC target or a T-cell target, its biological or pharmacological activity, and/or the biological pathways or signalling in which an APC target or a T-cell target is involved, said method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same. In particular, said pharmaceutically effective amount may be an amount that is sufficient to modulate the APC target or T-cell target, its biological or pharmacological activity, and/or the biological pathways or signalling in which the APC target or T-cell target is involved; and/or an amount that provides a level of the amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention in the circulation that is sufficient to modulate the APC target or T-cell target, its biological or pharmacological activity, and/or the biological pathways or signalling in which the APC target or T-cell target is involved; and/or an amount that provides a level of the amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention in the circulation that is sufficient to increase or decrease T-cell survival and/or differentiation of naive T-cells into activated cytokine secreting T-cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention furthermore relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder that can be prevented and/or treated by administering an amino acid sequence of the invention, a Nanobody of the invention or a polypeptide of the invention to a patient, said method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore in particular, the invention relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder chosen from the group consisting of the diseases and disorders listed herein, said method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention relates to a method for immunotherapy, and in particular for passive immunotherapy, which method comprises administering, to a subject suffering from or at risk of the diseases and disorders mentioned herein, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above methods, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention and/or the compositions comprising the same can be administered in any suitable manner, depending on the specific pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used. Thus, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention and/or the compositions comprising the same can for example be administered orally, intraperitoneally (e.g. intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or via any other route of administration that circumvents the gastrointestinal tract), intranasally, transdermally, topically, by means of a suppository, by inhalation, again depending on the specific pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used. The clinician will be able to select a suitable route of administration and a suitable pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used in such administration, depending on the disease or disorder to be prevented or treated and other factors well known to the clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention and/or the compositions comprising the same are administered according to a regime of treatment that is suitable for preventing and/or treating the disease or disorder to be prevented or treated. The clinician will generally be able to determine a suitable treatment regimen, depending on factors such as the disease or disorder to be prevented or treated, the severity of the disease to be treated and/or the severity of the symptoms thereof, the specific amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to be used, the specific route of administration and pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used, the age, gender, weight, diet, general condition of the patient, and similar factors well known to the clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the treatment regimen will comprise the administration of one or more amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention, or of one or more compositions comprising the same, in one or more pharmaceutically effective amounts or doses. The specific amount(s) or doses to administered can be determined by the clinician, again based on the factors cited above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, for the prevention and/or treatment of the diseases and disorders mentioned herein and depending on the specific disease or disorder to be treated, the potency of the specific amino acid sequence, Nanobody and polypeptide of the invention to be used, the specific route of administration and the specific pharmaceutical formulation or composition used, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention will generally be administered in an amount between 1 gram and 0.01 microgram per kg body weight per day, preferably between 0.1 gram and 0.1 microgram per kg body weight per day, such as about 1, 10, 100 or 1000 microgram per kg body weight per day, either continuously (e.g. by infusion), as a single daily dose or as multiple divided doses during the day. The clinician will generally be able to determine a suitable daily dose, depending on the factors mentioned herein. It will also be clear that in specific cases, the clinician may choose to deviate from these amounts, for example on the basis of the factors cited above and his expert judgment. Generally, some guidance on the amounts to be administered can be obtained from the amounts usually administered for comparable conventional antibodies or antibody fragments against the same target administered via essentially the same route, taking into account however differences in affinity/avidity, efficacy, biodistribution, half-life and similar factors well known to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsually, in the above method, a single amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention will be used. It is however within the scope of the invention to use two or more amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention in combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Nanobodies, amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may also be used in combination with one or more further pharmaceutically active compounds or principles, i.e. as a combined treatment regimen, which may or may not lead to a synergistic effect. Again, the clinician will be able to select such further compounds or principles, as well as a suitable combined treatment regimen, based on the factors cited above and his expert judgement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be used in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds or principles that are or can be used for the prevention and/or treatment of the diseases and disorders cited herein, as a result of which a synergistic effect may or may not be obtained. Examples of such compounds and principles, as well as routes, methods and pharmaceutical formulations or compositions for administering them will be clear to the clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention are used in combination with another pharmaceutically active compound or principles for the prevention and/or treatment of autoimmune diseases, allergy and asthma, transplant rejections (acute and chronic), cancer and tumors, effector cell exhaustion and/or infections. For example, in one embodiment, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention that are directed against CTLA4 or PD-1 are used in combination with tumor vaccination. In another embodiment, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention that are directed against B7-1 and/or B7-2 are used in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds or principles for the prevention and/or treatment of autoimmune diseases, allergy and asthma and/or transplant rejections (acute and chronic).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen two or more substances or principles are to be used as part of a combined treatment regimen, they can be administered via the same route of administration or via different routes of administration, at essentially the same time or at different times (e.g. essentially simultaneously, consecutively, or according to an alternating regime). When the substances or principles are to be administered simultaneously via the same route of administration, they may be administered as different pharmaceutical formulations or compositions or part of a combined pharmaceutical formulation or composition, as will be clear to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, when two or more active substances or principles are to be used as part of a combined treatment regimen, each of the substances or principles may be administered in the same amount and according to the same regimen as used when the compound or principle is used on its own, and such combined use may or may not lead to a synergistic effect. However, when the combined use of the two or more active substances or principles leads to a synergistic effect, it may also be possible to reduce the amount of one, more or all of the substances or principles to be administered, while still achieving the desired therapeutic action. This may for example be useful for avoiding, limiting or reducing any unwanted side-effects that are associated with the use of one or more of the substances or principles when they are used in their usual amounts, while still obtaining the desired pharmaceutical or therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of the treatment regimen used according to the invention may be determined and/or followed in any manner known per se for the disease or disorder involved, as will be clear to the clinician. The clinician will also be able, where appropriate and on a case-by-case basis, to change or modify a particular treatment regimen, so as to achieve the desired therapeutic effect, to avoid, limit or reduce unwanted side-effects, and/or to achieve an appropriate balance between achieving the desired therapeutic effect on the one hand and avoiding, limiting or reducing undesired side effects on the other hand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the treatment regimen will be followed until the desired therapeutic effect is achieved and/or for as long as the desired therapeutic effect is to be maintained. Again, this can be determined by the clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention relates to the use of an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for prevention and/or treatment of at least one autoimmune disease, allergy, asthma, transplant rejection (acute and chronic), cancer, tumor, effector cell exhaustion, or infection; and/or for use in one or more of the methods of treatment mentioned herein. In a preferred aspect, the invention relates to the use of an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for prevention and/or treatment of at least autoimmune diseases such as human anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease, lupus nephritis, diabetes, collagen-induced arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune uveitis, psoriasis vulgaris, rheumatoid arthritis, CNS autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis, Graves disease, Myasthenia gravis (MG), Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and Psoriasis; allergy and asthma such as allergic contact dermatitis and airway hyperresponsiveness (bronchial asthma, allergic lung inflammatory responses); transplant rejections (acute and chronic) such as renal transplant rejection, bone marrow allograft rejection and cardiac allograft rejection; cancer and tumors; and viral infections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject to be treated may be any warm-blooded animal, but is in particular a mammal, and more in particular a human being. As will be clear to the skilled person, the subject to be treated will in particular be a person suffering from, or at risk of, the diseases and disorders mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to the use of an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder that can be prevented and/or treated by administering an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to a patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore in particular, the invention relates to the use of an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and/or treatment of autoimmune diseases, allergies, asthma, transplant rejections (acute and chronic), cancers, tumors, effector cell exhaustion, or infections, and in particular for the prevention and treatment of one or more of the diseases and disorders listed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, in such a pharmaceutical composition, the one or more amino acid sequences, Nanobodies or polypeptides of the invention may also be suitably combined with one or more other active principles, such as those mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, although the use of the Nanobodies of the invention (as defined herein) and of the polypeptides of the invention is much preferred, it will be clear that on the basis of the description herein, the skilled person will also be able to design and/or generate, in an analogous manner, other amino acid sequences and in particular (single) domain antibodies against an APC target or T-cell target, as well as polypeptides comprising such (single) domain antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, it will also be clear to the skilled person that it may be possible to “graft” one or more of the CDR's mentioned above for the Nanobodies of the invention onto such (single) domain antibodies or other protein scaffolds, including but not limited to human scaffolds or non-immunoglobulin scaffolds. Suitable scaffolds and techniques for such CDR grafting will be clear to the skilled person and are well known in the art, see for example U.S. Pat. No. 7,180,370, WO 01/27160, \nEP\n 0 605 522, \nEP\n 0 460 167, U.S. Pat. No. 7,054,297, Nicaise et al., Protein Science (2004), 13:1882-1891; Ewert et al., Methods, 2004 October; 34(2):184-199; Kettleborough et al., Protein Eng. 1991 October; 4(7): 773-783; O'Brien and Jones, Methods Mol. Biol. 2003:207:81-100; Skerra, J. Mol. Recognit. 2000:13:167-187, and Saerens et al., J. Mol. Biol. 2005 Sep. 23; 352(3):597-607, and the further references cited therein. For example, techniques known per se for grafting mouse or rat CDR's onto human frameworks and scaffolds can be used in an analogous manner to provide chimeric proteins comprising one or more of the CDR's of the Nanobodies of the invention and one or more human framework regions or sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should also be noted that, when the Nanobodies of the inventions contain one or more other CDR sequences than the preferred CDR sequences mentioned above, these CDR sequences can be obtained in any manner known per se, for example from Nanobodies (preferred), V\nH \ndomains from conventional antibodies (and in particular from human antibodies), heavy chain antibodies, conventional 4-chain antibodies (such as conventional human 4-chain antibodies) or other immunoglobulin sequences directed against an APC target or T-cell target. Such immunoglobulin sequences directed against an APC target or T-cell target can be generated in any manner known per se, as will be clear to the skilled person, i.e. by immunization with an APC target or T-cell target or by screening a suitable library of immunoglobulin sequences with an APC target or T-cell target, or any suitable combination thereof. Optionally, this may be followed by techniques such as random or site-directed mutagenesis and/or other techniques for affinity maturation known per se. Suitable techniques for generating such immunoglobulin sequences will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the screening techniques reviewed by Hoogenboom, Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1105-1116 (2005) Other techniques for generating immunoglobulins against a specified target include for example the Nanoclone technology (as for example described in the published US patent application 2006-0211088), so-called SLAM technology (as for example described in the \nEuropean patent application\n 0 542 810), the use of transgenic mice expressing human immunoglobulins or the well-known hybridoma techniques (see for example Larrick et al, Biotechnology, Vol. 7, 1989, p. 934). All these techniques can be used to generate immunoglobulins against an APC target or T-cell target, and the CDR's of such immunoglobulins can be used in the Nanobodies of the invention, i.e. as outlined above. For example, the sequence of such a CDR can be determined, synthesized and/or isolated, and inserted into the sequence of a Nanobody of the invention (e.g. so as to replace the corresponding native CDR), all using techniques known per se such as those described herein, or Nanobodies of the invention containing such CDR's (or nucleic acids encoding the same) can be synthesized de novo, again using the techniques mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther uses of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies, polypeptides, nucleic acids, genetic constructs and hosts and host cells of the invention will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. For example, and without limitation, the amino acid sequences of the invention can be linked to a suitable carrier or solid support so as to provide a medium than can be used in a manner known per se to purify an APC target or T-cell target from compositions and preparations comprising the same. Derivatives of the amino acid sequences of the invention that comprise a suitable detectable label can also be used as markers to determine (qualitatively or quantitatively) the presence of an APC target or T-cell target in a composition or preparation or as a marker to selectively detect the presence of an APC target or T-cell target on the surface of a cell or tissue (for example, in combination with suitable cell sorting techniques).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention will now be further described by means of the following non-limiting examples and figures, in which the Figures show:\n\n\n \n\n\nFIGURE LEGENDS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n: Overview of B7:CD28 superfamily.

(Cat # 109-1,6-170).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMouse-anti-human CTLA4 clone BNI3, a monoclonal antibody known to bind human CTLA4 and block CTLA4 interaction with CD80 and CD86, was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) (Cat # ab19792).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA phycoerythrin labeled version of BNI3 was obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, Calif.) (Cat # 555853).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\nImmunizations with CD80 and/or CD86\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo llamas (No. 089 and No. 090) were immunized with 100 or 50 μg doses of R&D Systems Cat # 140-B1, alternated with 20 or 10 μg doses of Ancell Cat # 509-820 according to the scheme outlined in Table C-1. Both proteins were formulated in Stimune adjuvants (Cedi Diagnostics B.V., Lelystad, The Netherlands). Blood was collected from these animals as indicated in Table C-1.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\nLibrary Construction\n\n\n \n \n \nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared from blood samples using Ficoll-Hypaque according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, total RNA was extracted from these cells and used as starting material for RT-PCR to amplify Nanobody encoding gene fragments. These fragments were cloned into phagemid vector pAX50. Phage was prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein) and stored after filter sterilization at 4° C. for further use. The characteristics of the constructed libraries are shown in Table C-2.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nSelections of CD80 and/or CD86 binding Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nPhage libraries from llama No. 089 and No. 090 were used for two rounds (R1, R2) of selections on the same plate-immobilized antigen or on alternating antigens. R&D Systems Cat # 140-B1 (“HuCD80-HuIgG1”) and Cat # 140-B2 (“HuCD86-HuIgG1”) were used as antigens and immobilized directly on Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plates at 2 μg/ml. Table C-3 summarizes the type of selection used in both rounds. Phage populations were pre-incubated with saturating amounts of Sigma-Aldrich I-5154 (human IgG1) and Sigma-Aldrich M-9144 (mouse IgG2a) both prior to the first selection as well as during the phage absorption phase in first and second selection rounds. Plate-immobilized phages were retrieved from both first and second selection rounds using trypsin elution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOutput of both R1 and R2 selections were analyzed for enrichment factor (# phage present in eluate relative to control). Based on these parameters the best selections were chosen for further analysis. To this end, the output from each selection was recloned as a pool into the expression vector pAX51. pAX51 is a derivative of pUC19. It contains the LacZ promoter which enables a controlled induction of expression using IPTG. The vector has a resistance gene for Ampicillin or Carbenicillin. The multicloning sites harbours several restriction sites of which SfiI and BstEII are frequently used for cloning Nanobodies®. In frame with the Nanobody coding sequence the vector codes for a C-terminal c-myc tag and a (His)\n6 \ntag. The signal peptide is the geneIII leader sequence which translocates the expressed Nanobody to the periplasm. Individual colonies were picked and grown in 96 deep well plates (1 ml volume) and induced by adding IPTG for Nanobody expression. Periplasmic extracts (volume: ˜80 μl) were prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein). pAX51 cloned Nanobodies were expressed as fusion proteins containing C-terminal both the c-myc as well as the 6H is tags. The sequences of the clones obtained are depicted in Table B-1.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\nBinding of the CD80 and/or CD86 Binding Nanobodies in ELISA and FACS Binding Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nPeriplasmic extracts were analyzed first for their ability to bind HuCD80-HuIgG1, HuCD86-HuIgG1 or HuIgG1. To this end, 3 independent ELISA assays were set up. In these ELISAs, either HuCD80 or HuCD86 fusion proteins or human IgG1 were coated on ELISA plates which were washed and then blocked using Marvel skimmed milk powder (Premier Brands UK Ltd., Wirral, Merseyside, UK). One parallel set of ELISA plates was not coated but only blocked. Four aliquots of periplasmic extract of individual clones prepared as described in Example 4 were allowed to bind in all four types of ELISA plates. Binding of Nanobody to immobilized antigen was detected using mouse anti-c-myc tag monoclonal antibody as a secundary, followed by a goat-anti-mouse (human and bovine serum protein pre-absorbed) HRP conjugate for detection (for detailed protocol, see the prior art and prior applications filed by applicant).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndividual clones were scored as putative CD80 monoreactive or CD86 monoreactive if the clones yielded high OD's in either the ELISA plate coated with the CD80- or CD86-HuIgG1 fusion protein but not more than background in the other, nor in the plates coated with human IgG1 or uncoated but blocked plate. Clones were scored as putative CD80/CD86 bireactive if they scored high OD's on both ELISA plates but no more than background on both human IgG1 or blocked-only ELISA plates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo verify if putative mono- or bireactive clones could bind to the native form of the antigen, periplasmic extracts of such clones were allowed to bind to Raji cells, a human B-cell lymphoma line known to express high levels of both molecules. Binding of clones was detected using anti-c-myc tag mouse monoclonal antibody, followed by a phycoerythrin conjugated F(ab′)2 derived from goat-anti-mouse IgG (human and bovine crossabsorbed), and read on a BD FACS Calibur instrument. Binding was evaluated in CellQuest software. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis by gating out 7AAD vital dye positive scoring cells. Based on two separate FACS experiments, both cell binding and non-binding clones were identified in both mono- and bireactive clone selections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable C-4 summarizes the ELISA and FACS data for a number of representative clones, binding in both ELISA (fusion protein) and FACS (native antigen) formats. ELISA data are presented as optical density (OD), FACS data were scored as moderate increase (“+”) in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) over background fluorescence (secundary antibody only stained cells or cells stained with irrelevant specificity Nanobody plus secondary antibody), or strong increase over background (“++”).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nCD80 and/or CD86 Binding Nanobody Expression and Purification\n\n\n \n \n \nSelected Nanobodies were expressed in \nE. coli \nas c-myc, His6-tagged proteins in a culture volume of 200 mL. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and allowed to continue for 4 h at 37° C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and periplasmic extracts were prepared by freeze-thawing the pellets. These extracts were used as starting material for immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Nanobodies were eluted from the column with 150 mM imidazole and subsequently subjected to gel filtration to PBS. Total yield and yield per liter of cell culture are listed in Table C-5. SDS-PAGE of purified Nanobodies is shown in \nFIG. 2\n.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\nInhibition of Interaction of CD80 and/or CD86 with CD28 or CTLA4\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine whether mono- or bireactive Nanobodies could inhibit the interaction of CD80 and/or CD86 with CD28 or CTLA4, ELISA plates were coated with either HuCD80-MuIgG2a or HuCD86-MuIgG2a and free binding sites were blocked using 4% Marvell, as per Example 5. Next, dilution series of various confirmed mono- or bireactive clones were allowed to bind to the immobilized antigen (75 microliter volume) before a fixed amount of either HuCD28-HuIgG1 or HuCTLA4-HuIgG1 was added to the wells (25 microliter volume, 2 microgram/ml final concentration), without washing the plates in between. After incubation and a wash step, plate-bound CD80 or CD86 captured CD28- or CTLA4-HuIgG1 was revealed using a HRP conjugated human IgG1 specific secundary reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition was determined based on OD values of controls having received no Nanobody (high control) or no CD28- or CTLA4-HuIgG1 fusion protein (low control).

Next, either HuCD28-HuIgG1 or HuCTLA4-HuIgG1 was added to the cells/Nanobody suspension without washing the cells in between. After a wash step, cell-bound CD28- or CTLA4-HuIg was revealed using a phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 derived from affinity purified goat-anti-human IgG1 antiserum (bovine serum protein crossabsorbed). Percentage inhibition was determined based on MFI values of controls having received an irrelevant specificity Nanobody (high control) or no CD28- or CTLA4-Ig fusion protein at all (low control).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample FACS profiles of representative inhibitory and non-inhibitory Nanobodies are shown in \nFIG. 7\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults from both ELISA and FACS based assays are summarized in Table C-6.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nAffinity Determination of the CD80 and/or CD86 Binding Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAffinity constants (Kd) of individual purified Nanobody clones were determined by surface plasmon resonance on a \nBiacore\n 3000 instrument. In brief, HuCD80-HuIgG1 or HuCD86-HuIgG1 were amine-coupled to a CM5 sensor chip at densities of 3000-4000 RU. Remaining reactive groups were inactivated using ethanolamine. Nanobody binding was assessed at 1 and 0.1 microM. Each sample was injected for 4 min at a flow rate of 45 μl/min to allow for binding to chip-bound antigen. Next, binding buffer without Nanobody was sent over the chip at the same flow rate to allow for dissociation of bound Nanobody. After 2 min, remaining bound analyte was removed by injecting regeneration solution (50 mM NaOH or Glycine/HCl pH 1.5). Binding curves obtained at different concentrations of Nanobody were used to calculate Kd values.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKd values of selected Nanobody clones are shown in Table C-7.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 10\n\n\nConstruction and Expression of Bispecific CD80 and/or CD86 Neutralizing Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nSeveral mono- or bi-reactive Nanobodies were expressed as bispecific fusion proteins, consisting of an N-terminal anti-CD80/CD86 Nanobody, fused to a C-terminal human serum albumin binding Nanobody (ALB1) via a 9 amino acid Gly/Ser linker. These constructs were expressed in \nE. coli \nas c-myc, His6-tagged proteins in shaker cultures as described in Example 6 and subsequently purified from periplasmic extracts by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC).

Purified Nanobodies were tested in ELISA for binding to B7-H2 as described in Example 32. Results are shown in \nFIG. 18\n.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 34\n\n\nDetermining Competition Efficiency of B7-H2 Binding Nanobodies by Titration of Purified Nanobody\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine ICOS competition efficiency of B7-H2 binding Nanobodies, the positive clones of the binding assay were tested in an ELISA competition assay setup. In short, 1 μg/ml B7-H2 ectodomain (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, US, Cat # 165-B7) was immobilized on maxisorp microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) and free binding sites were blocked using 4% Marvel in PBS. Next, 0.25 μg/ml of ICOS-biotin was preincubated with a dilution series of purified Nanobody. An irrelevant Nanobody against FcgR1 (49C5) was used as a negative controle, since this Nanobody does not bind to B7-H2. ICOS without biotin (cold ICOS) was used as a positive controle for competition of ICOS-biotin. The results are shown in \nFIG. 19\n. 5 Nanobody families show competition with ICOS-biotin for binding to B7-H2 in a dose-dependent manner.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 35\n\n\nImmunizations with CD28\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo llamas (No. 45 and No. 46) were immunized with 6 boosts (100 or 50 μg/dose at weekly intervals) of CD28-Fc fusion (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., US), formulated in adjuvant Stimune (Cedi Diagnostics, the Netherlands), according to standard protocols. At \nweek\n 4, sera were collected to define antibody titers against CD28 by ELISA. In short, 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc Wiesbaden, Germany) were coated with hCD28-Fc. After blocking and adding diluted sera samples, the presence of anti-CD28 Nanobodies was demonstrated by using rabbit anti-llama immunoglobulin antiserum and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin alkaline phosphatase conjugate. The titer exceeded 16000 for both animals.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 36\n\n\nLibrary Construction\n\n\n \n \n \nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared from blood samples obtained from llama No. 45 and No. 46 using Ficoll-Hypaque according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, total RNA extracted was extracted from these cells and used as starting material for RT-PCR to amplify Nanobody encoding gene fragments. These fragments were cloned into phagemid vector pAX50. Phage was prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein) and stored after filter sterilization at 4° C. for further use.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 37\n\n\nSelections of CD28 Binding Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nPhage libraries obtained from llamas No 45 and No. 46 were used for phage display selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nhCD28-Fc (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, US, Cat # 342-CD) was coated onto Maxisorp 96-well plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) at 0.5 and 5 μg/ml. The phages were incubated with human IgG (100 μg/ml) in 2% marvel PBST prior to incubation with the immobilized CD28. After extensive washing, plate bound phage was aspecifically eluted with trypsin (1 mg/ml in PBS) or specifically eluted with B7-1 and B7-2 (50 μg/ml). Enrichment above background was observed for all conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe output from the selection were plated onto LB/amp/2% glu plates. Colonies were picked and grown in 96 deep well plates (1 ml volume) and induced by adding IPTG for Nanobody expression. Periplasmic extracts (volume: ˜90 ml) were prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein). The sequences of the clones obtained are depicted in Table B-8.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 38\n\n\nBinding of the Obtained Nanobodies in ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine whether the Nanobodies obtained from the selection described in Example 37 bind CD28, 96 eluted clones were tested in an ELISA binding assay setup.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn short, 1 μg/ml CD28 (hCD28-Fc, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, US, Cat # 342-CD) was immobilized on maxisorp microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) and free binding sites were blocked using 4% Marvel in PBS. Next, 10 μl of periplasmic extract containing Nanobody of the different clones in 100 \nμl\n 2% Marvel PBST were allowed to bind to the immobilized antigen. After incubation and a wash step, Nanobody binding was revealed using a mouse-anti-myc secondary antibody, followed by a wash step and an additional incubation with a HRP-conjugated donkey-anti-mouse antibody. Binding specificity was determined based on OD values compared to controls having received no Nanobody (low control). 57 out of 96 selected clones were able to bind to CD28 with some specificity.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 39\n\n\nInhibition of Interaction of B7-1 with CD28\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine B7-1 competition efficiency of the CD28 binding Nanobodies, a selection of the CD28 binding clones was made and tested for B7-1 competition in an ELISA competition assay setup.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn short, 1 μg/ml B7-1-muFc (Ancell, Bayport, Minn., US, Cat # 510-820) was immobilized on maxisorp microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) and free binding sites were blocked using 4% Marvel in PBS. In another plate, 90 μl 2.2 μg/ml CD28-hFc was mixed with 10 μl periplasmic extract of the CD28 binding clones. This mixture was applied on the coated B7-1 and CD28 was allowed to bind to the immobilized B7-1. After incubation and a wash step the CD28-hFc was detected with a HRP-conjugated anti-human Fc (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa., US, Cat # 109-116-170). Degree of binding inhibition was determined based on OD values compared to controls having received no Nanobody (high control) of no CD28-hFc (low control).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOD values obtained are depicted in \nFIG. 20\n. From these values, clones were selected for recloning in production vector pAX51. After expression, the obtained Nanobodies were purified via the His-tag on Talon beads. Purified Nanobodies were tested in ELISA for binding to CD28 as described in Example 38. Results are shown in \nFIG. 21\n.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 40\n\n\nDetermining Competition Efficiency of CD28 Binding Nanobodies by Titration of Purified Nanobody\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine B7-1 competition efficiency of CD28 binding Nanobodies, the purified Nanobodies that showed binding in the previous binding assay were tested in an ELISA competition assay setup.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn short, 1 μg/ml B7-1-muFc (Ancell, Bayport, Minn., US, Cat # 510-820) was immobilized on maxisorp microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) and free binding sites were blocked using 4% Marvel in PBS. Next, 2 μg/ml CD28-hFc was mixed with a dilution series of purified Nanobody. An irrelevant Nanobody against FcgR1 (49E4) was used as a negative controle, since this Nanobody does not bind to CD28. After incubation and a wash step the CD28-hFc was detected with a HRP-conjugated anti-human Fc (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa., US, Cat # 109-116-170) 1:1500 in 2% MPBST. The results are shown in \nFIG. 22\n. All Nanobodies selected showed competition with B7-1 for binding to CD28 in a dose-dependent manner.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 41\n\n\nBinding of CD28-Fc Binding Nanobodies to Human CD28 Expressing Jurkat Cells in FACS\n\n\n \n \n \nTo verify if the CD28-Fc binding clones could also bind to the native form of the CD28 antigen, serial dilutions of purified protein preparations of such clones were allowed to bind to the human Jurkat T-cell line, which expresses human CD28. Binding of putative CD28 reactive Nanobodies clones was detected using unlabeled anti-c-myc tag mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10, followed by a phycoerythrin conjugated F(ab′)2 derived from goat-anti-mouse IgG (human and bovine crossabsorbed), and read on a BD FACSarray instrument. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis by gating out TOPRO3 vital dye positive scoring cells. Binding of the Nanobodies to cells was evaluated in BD FACSarray control software as PE channel histograms. Based on these FACS experiments, all CD28-Fc binding Nanobody clones bound cell expressed CD28. Results of a representative experiment are depicted in \nFIG. 23\n.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 42\n\n\nInhibition by CD28 binding Nanobodies of the Interaction of CD28 with CD80-Fc or CD86-Fc Analysed in FACS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe potency of cell-expressed CD28 binding Nanobodies to inhibit the interaction of CD28 with either CD80 or CD86 was also ranked using FACS based screening method. In brief, serial dilutions of purified Nanobodies were prepared and incubated at 4° C. with Jurkat cells. To this suspension, either HuCD80-Hu IgG1 Fc fusion protein or HuCD86-Hu IgG1 Fc fusion protein was added 30 minutes after Nanobody incubation had started. After an additional 30 minutes incubation, cells were washed and cell-bound HuCD80-Fc or HuCD86-Fc was detected using a phycoerythrin labeled F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment of goat anti human IgG Fc (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa., US, Cat # 109-116-170). Dead cells were stained by including TOPRO3 vital dye in the final resuspension buffer. All samples were read on a BD FACSarray instrument. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis by gating out TOPRO3 vital dye positive scoring cells Inhibition of CD80-Fc or CD86-Fc binding to cell-displayed CD28 by these Nanobodies was evaluated in BD FACSarray control software as PE channel histograms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults were summarized as mean fluorescence values of these histograms as a function of Nanobody concentration. Results are depicted in \nFIG. 24\n.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 43\n\n\nImmunizations with CTLA4-Ig\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo llamas (No. 119 and No. 120) were immunized with 100 or 50 μg doses of Chimerigen Cat # HF-210A4, according to the scheme outlined in Table C-8. Both proteins were formulated in Stimune adjuvants (Cedi Diagnostics B.V., Lelystad, The Netherlands). Blood was collected from these animals as indicated in Table C-8.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 44\n\n\nSerum Titers of CTLA4-Ig Immunized Animals\n\n\n \n \n \nSera from blood samples of \nllamas\n 119 and 120 were obtained prior to immunization, during the immunization protocol and after completion of the immunizations Chimerigen CTLA4-Ig or an irrelevant specificity human IgG1 isotope monoclonal antibody were coated onto Nunc Maxisorb plates at 2 μg/ml, blocked with 1% casein in PBS and incubated with serial dilutions of pre- and postimmune llama sera. Plate-immobilized llama IgG was detected using HRP conjugated goat-anti-llama IgG (Bethyl Labs, Montgomery, Tex.) and TMB chromogen according to standard methods. Comparison of optical density values clearly indicated immunization induced a humoral immune response against CTLA4-Ig in both animals, and that the response was higher against CTLA4-Ig than the control protein having the same human IgG1 Fc.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 45\n\n\nLibrary Construction\n\n\n \n \n \nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared from blood samples obtained from llama No. 119 and No. 120 using Ficoll-Hypaque according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, total RNA was extracted from these cells and used as starting material for RT-PCR to amplify Nanobody encoding gene fragments. These fragments were cloned into phagemid vector pAX50. Phage was prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein) and stored after filter sterilization at 4° C. for further use. The characteristics of the constructed libraries are shown in Table C-9.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 46\n\n\nSelections of CTLA4 Binding Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nPhage libraries from llama No. 119 and No. 120 were used for two rounds (R1, R2) of selections on the same plate-immobilized antigen or on soluble antigen Chimerigen Cat # HF-210A4 CTLA4-Ig was immobilized at concentrations varying from 5 μg/ml to 0.05 μg/ml on Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plates precoated at 10 μg/ml with anti-human IgG1 Fc Nanobody. Plate-immobilized phages were retrieved using trypsin or BNI3 elution and rescued in \nE. coli\n. Rescued phages were incubated with concentrations of biotinylated CTLA4-Ig varying from 60 nM to 1 pM (Chimerigen Cat # HF-210A4, biotinylated at Ablynx according to standard procedures), captured on neutravidin precoated Maxisorb plates and eluted using trypsin or BNI3. Phage populations were pre-incubated with saturating amounts of Sigma-Aldrich #14506 human IgG prior to both selection rounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOutput of both R1 and R2 selections were analyzed for enrichment factor (# phage present in eluate relative to control). Based on these parameters, the best selections were chosen for further analysis. Individual colonies were picked and grown in 96 deep well plates (1 ml volume) and induced by adding IPTG for Nanobody expression. Periplasmic extracts (volume: ˜80 ml) were prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein). Nanobodies were expressed as fusion proteins containing C-terminal both the c-myc as well as the 6H is tags. The sequences of the clones obtained are depicted in Table B-9.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 47\n\n\nSelective Binding of the Nanobodies to CTLA4-Fc in ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nPeriplasmic extracts as prepared in example 46 were analyzed first for their ability to bind HuCTLA4-HuIgG1 or HuCD28-HuIgG1. To this end, 2 independent ELISA assays were set up. In these ELISAs, either HuCTLA4 (Chimerigen) or HuCD28 (R&D Systems) fusion proteins were coated on ELISA plates which were washed and then blocked using 4% Marvel skimmed milk powder (Premier Brands UK Ltd., Wirral, Merseyside, UK) in PBS. 10 ml aliquots of periplasmic extract of individual clones prepared as described in Example 46 were allowed to bind in both ELISAs. Binding of Nanobody to immobilized antigen was detected using mouse anti-c-myc tag monoclonal antibody as a secondary antibody, followed by a goat-anti-mouse (human and bovine serum protein pre-absorbed) HRP conjugate for detection (for detailed protocol, see the prior art and prior applications filed by applicant).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndividual clones were scored as putative CTLA4 monoreactive if the clones yielded high OD's in the ELISA plate coated with the HuCTLA4-HuIgG1 fusion protein but not more than background in the other. The clones were scored CD28 and/or human IgG1 Fc crossreactive if they yielded high OD's in the ELISA plate coated with the HuCTLA4-HuIgG1 fusion protein as well as in the other. Clones binding both CD28-Fc and CTLA4-Fc were very rare.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the 192 clones tested, 115 were able to bind to CTLA4-Fc with some specificity. Clones were selected for recloning in production vector pAX51. After expression, the obtained Nanobodies were purified via the His-tag on Talon beads.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 48\n\n\nInhibition of the Interaction of CTLA4 with B7-1\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine B7-1 competition efficiency of CTLA4 binding Nanobodies, the purified clones were tested in an ELISA competition assay setup.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn short, 2 μg/ml B7-1-muFc (Ancell, Bayport, Minn., US, Cat # 510-820) was immobilized on maxisorp microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) and free binding sites were blocked using 4% Marvel in PBS. Next, 0.33 nM CTLA4-hFc was mixed with a dilution series of purified Nanobody. An irrelevant Nanobody (1A1) was used as a negative controle, since this Nanobody does not bind to CTLA4. As a positive controle for competition with B7-1, the commercial CTLA-4 binding antibody (BNI-3; competing for B7-1 and B7-2) was used. After incubation and a wash step, the CTLA4-hFc was detected with a HRP-conjugated anti-human Fc (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa., US, Cat # 109-116-170) 1:1500 in 2% MPBST. OD values obtained, depicted in \nFIGS. 26 and 27\n, show that 2 Nanobodies selected show competition with B7-1 for binding to CTLA4 in a dose-dependent manner.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 49\n\n\nInhibition of the Interaction of CTLA4 with B7-2\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine B7-2 competition efficiency of CTLA4 binding Nanobodies, the purified clones were tested in an ELISA competition assay setup.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn short, 5 μg/ml B7-muFc (Ancell, Bayport, Minn., Cat # 509-820) was immobilized on maxisorp microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) and free binding sites were blocked using 4% Marvel in PBS. Next, 22 nM CTLA4-hFc was mixed with a dilution series of purified Nanobody. An irrelevant Nanobody (1A1) was used as a negative controle, since this Nanobody does not bind to CTLA4. As a positive controle for competition, the commercial CTLA-4 binding antibody (BNI-3; competing for B7-1 and B7-2) was used. After incubation and a wash step the CTLA4-hFc was detected with a HRP-conjugated anti-human Fc (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa., US, Cat # 109-116-170) 1:1500 in 2% MPBST. OD values obtained, depicted in \nFIGS. 28 and 29\n, show that 4 Nanobodies selected show competition with B7-2 for binding to CTLA4 in a dose-dependent manner.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 50\n\n\nInhibition of the CTLA4-Fc/CD80-Fc Interaction in Alphascreen\n\n\n \n \n \nPeriplasmic extracts as prepared in example 46 were analyzed for their ability to block the interaction of HuCTLA4-HuIgG1 (Chimerigen) with HuCD80-MuIgG2a (Ancell). To this end, an alphascreen assay (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.) was set up and used as a screening assay. In brief, 5 μl of periplasmic extract of individual Nanobody clones were incubated with 0.15 μM HuCTLA4-HuIgG1 Fc, 0.10 μM biotinylated HuCD80-MuIgG2a Fc, streptavidin coated donor beads and anti-human IgG1 Fc Nanobody coupled acceptor alphascreen beads. The mouse monoclonal antibody BNI3, known to inhibit the CTLA4/CD80 interaction, was used as a positive control. Assays were read in an Envision alphascreen option fitted multimode reader (Perkin Elmer). Individual clones were scored as putative CTLA4/CD80 interaction inhibiting if the presence of the periplasmic extract decreased the fluorescent signal of the acceptor beads.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 51\n\n\nCTLA4-Ig Binding Nanobody Expression and Purification\n\n\n \n \n \nSelected CTLA4/CD80 interaction inhibiting Nanobodies were expressed in the periplasmic space of \nE. coli \nas c-myc, His6-tagged proteins in a culture volume of ˜200 mL. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and allowed to continue for 4 h at 37° C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and periplasmic extracts were prepared. These extracts were used as starting material for immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Nanobodies were eluted from the column with 150 mM imidazole and subsequently subjected to gel filtration to PBS. Total yield and yield per liter of cell culture are listed in Table C-10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSDS-PAGE of purified Nanobodies is shown in \nFIG. 30\n.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 52\n\n\nRanking CTLA4-Fc/CD80-Fc Interaction Inhibition Potency of Nanobodies Using Alphascreen\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine which Nanobodies could inhibit the interaction of CTLA4 with CD80 most efficiently, serial dilutions of purified Nanobodies were prepared and tested in the same alphascreen assay as used for screening periplasmic extracts (as described in Example 50). Table C-11 summarizes the IC50 value of selected Nanobodies in this assay, clearly showing a range of potencies.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 53\n\n\nGeneration of Human and Cynomolgus CTLA4 Overexpressing Stable Cell Lines\n\n\n \n \n \nTo verify if CTLA4-Ig binding Nanobody clones could bind to the native form of either the human or cynomolog monkey CTLA4 antigen, transfected cells stably expressing high levels of either human or cynomolgus monkey CTLA4 on the cell membrane were generated. These clones were generated by transfecting CHO-K1 cells with either full-length human CTLA4 cDNA cloned into pCI-Neo (Promega, Madison, Wis.), where the intracellular position Y201 was mutated to valine in order to ensure retention of the protein on the extracellular membrane (Chuang et al. J. Immunol. 159: 144, 1997), or the same human CTLA4 cDNA where three extracellular domain positions were mutated to the corresponding cynomolgus monkey CTLA4 extracellular domain amino acids (S13N,117T and L105M; U.S. Pat. No. 6,682,736).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntroduction of linearized endotoxin-free plasmid DNA and selection for stable transfected cells was performed according to standard transfection and antibiotic selection methods. Individual high CTLA4 expressing transfectants were cloned from the bulk antibiotic resistant CHO cell population by staining the transfected CHO cells populations using the viability dye TOPRO3, PE labeled BNI3 antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif., Cat # 555853)) and sorting individual live (TOPRO3 negative) highly PE fluorescent cells into microtiter plate wells containing selection medium. Outgrowing clones were expanded and re-screened in FACS for homogeneous and high level CTLA4 expression using PE labeled BNI3.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 54\n\n\nBinding of the CTLA4-Ig Binding Nanobodies to Human and Cyno CTLA4 in FACS\n\n\n \n \n \nTo verify if CTLA4-Ig binding clones which inhibit the interaction of CTLA4 with CD80-Ig could also bind to the native form of the antigen, serial dilutions of purified protein preparations of such clones were allowed to bind to CHO cells expressing either human or cynomolgus monkey CTLA4 (see Example 53). Binding of putative CTLA4 reactive Nanobodies clones was detected using unlabeled anti-c-myc tag mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10, followed by a phycoerythrin conjugated F(ab′)2 derived from goat-anti-mouse IgG (human and bovine crossabsorbed), and read on a BD FACSarray instrument. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis by gating out TOPRO3 vital dye positive scoring cells. Binding of the Nanobodies to cells was evaluated in BD FACSarray control software as PE channel histograms. Based on these FACS experiments, all CTLA4-Ig binding Nanobody clones found to be CD80 interaction inhibitory in alphascreen, also bound cell expressed CTLA4. Both cynomolgus crossreactive as well as essentially non-crossreactive human CTLA4 transfectant binding clones were identified by comparing the mean fluorescence intensity curve of serial dilutions of Nanobody between human and cynomologus CTLA4 transfected CHO cells. Table C-11 summarizes the IC50 value of selected Nanobodies in this assay.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 55\n\n\nInhibition of CTLA4/CD80-Fc Interaction in FACS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe potency of selected Nanobodies to inhibit the interaction of CTLA4 with CD80 was also ranked using FACS based screening method. In brief, serial dilutions of purified Nanobodies were prepared and incubated at 4° C. with either human or cynomologus CTLA4 overexpressing stable transfectants (see Example 53). To this suspension, HuCD80-Hu IgG1Fc fusion protein was added to a concentration of 10 nM (final concentration) 20 minutes after Nanobody incubation had started. This concentration was previously determined to be the minimal amount required to saturate all CD80 binding sites on both human and cyno CTLA4 expressing CHO cell clones in the absence of any CTLA4 interaction blocking proteins. After an additional 30 minutes incubation, cells were washed and cell-bound HuCD80-Hu Fc was detected using a phycoerythrin labeled F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment of goat anti human IgG Fc (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Cat # 109-116-170). Dead cells were stained by including TOPRO3 vital dye in the final resuspension buffer. All samples were read on a BD FACSarray instrument. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis by gating out TOPRO3 vital dye positive scoring cells Inhibition of CD80-Fc binding to cell-displayed CTLA4 by these Nanobodies was evaluated in BD FACSarray control software as PE channel histograms. Results are summarized as mean fluorescence values of these histograms as a function of Nanobody concentration in \nFIGS. 31\n, \n32\n and \n33\n.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 56\n\n\nAffinity Determination of CTLA4 Binding Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAffinity constants (Kd) of individual purified Nanobody clones were determined by surface plasmon resonance on a Biacore T100 instrument. In brief, HuCTLA4-HuIgG1 or HuCD28-HuIgG1 were amine-coupled to a CM5 sensor chip at densities of 740-1700 RU. Remaining reactive groups were inactivated using ethanolamine. Nanobody binding was assessed at concentrations varying from 500 to 0.33 nM. Each sample was injected for 2 min at a flow rate of 45 μl/min to allow for binding to chip-bound antigen. Next, binding buffer without Nanobody was sent over the chip at the same flow rate to allow for dissociation of bound Nanobody. After 2 min, remaining bound analyte was removed by injecting regeneration solution (10 mM Glycine/HCl pH 1.5). Binding curves obtained at different concentrations of Nanobody were used to calculate K\nD \nvalues. For some clones, only a single undetermined concentrations of Nanobody was injected. For these clones, only off-rates could be determined\n\n\n \n \n \n \nK\nD\n, k\non \nand k\noff \nvalues of selected Nanobody clones are shown in Table C-11.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 57\n\n\nCell-Stimulation Assays by CTLA4 Binding Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nPurified Nanobodies were tested in human PBMC and whole blood T-cell stimulation assays (as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,682,736).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, fresh peripheral blood were collected from healthy donors in heparin anticoagulant containing vacutainers. Blood was then diluted with RPMI1640 medium containing penicillin, streptomycin, 100 ng/ml of Staphylococcal enterotoxin A from staphyloccocus aureus (SEA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., Cat # S9399) and aliquotted in 96-well microtiter plates which had been coated overnight with 60 ng/well of mitogenic mouse-anti-human anti-CD3 (clone OKT3, eBioscience, San Diego, Calif., Cat # 16-0037-85).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, PBMC were isolated from freshly drawn heparin anticoagulated blood or buffy coats using a standard Ficoll gradient, resuspended in medium containing SEA as described above and aliquotted into a CD3 coated microtiter plate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerial dilutions of CTLA4 neutralizing antibody BNI3, mouse IgG2a isotype control antibody or endotoxin-free CTLA4 reactive Nanobody preparations were added to the wells of either whole blood or PBMC assay. Plates were incubated for 48, 72 or 96 hours at 37° C. under 5% CO\n2\n/100% humidity atmosphere. Cell-free supernatant from all wells were collected at each timepoint and frozen at −80° C. until the last timepoint was harvested and frozen. IL-2 concentration in these conditioned supernatants was then analyzed after simultaneous thawing of all timepoint samples of any given assay at fixed 1/10 or 1/20 dilutions, using a standard IL-2 sandwich ELISA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., Cat # CHC1244).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCTLA4 neutralization in these assay gave rise to increased levels of IL-2 production. Relative potency of Nanobody clones and reference antibody could be scored and ranked according to the IC50 values of the titration curves obtained. \nFIG. 34\n shows representative IL-2 ELISA results, expressed as optical density.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 58\n\n\nFormatting of CTLA4 Neutralizing Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nNext, Nanobodies binding CTLA4 and neutralizing its activity in bioassays were formatted such that they gain binding affinity (avidity) and potency in bioassays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, CTLA4 neutralizing monomeric Nanobodies were reformatted into bivalent CTLA4 neutralizing constructs by standard PCR-based DNA manipulation, resulting in an \nE. coli \nexpression plasmid encoding a fusion protein comprising two identical copies of the same Nanobody clone, linked in tandem via a gly/ser linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, two identical CTLA4 binding Nanobody clones were reformatted similarly into a trivalent fusion proteins, starting with the bivalent format as described above, but fusing this further to another C-terminal Nanobody clone which binds human serum albumin\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese two bi- or trivalent formats Nanobodies were expressed in \nE. coli \nand subsequently purified using methods identical to those described in Example 51.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, some CTLA4 neutralizing Nanobody clones were reformatted into a bivalent format essentially identical to that described above, but further fused C-terminally to full-length human serum albumin. These fusion protein encoding cassettes were cloned into a \nPichia pastoris \nexpression vector which allows for inducible protein expression, secreted into the culture medium. Such fusion proteins were produced according to standard methods and purified from conditioned medium using protein A (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) chromatography for Nanobody clones known to bind protein A, or Blue Sepharose (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) for Nanobody clones that do not bind protein A, all according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable B-10 lists the sequences of such bivalent, trivalent and bivalent-albumin fusion proteins.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 59\n\n\nPotency of Multivalent CTLA4 Neutralizing Nanobodies as Determined in Alphascreen\n\n\n \n \n \nNanobodies neutralizing CTLA4 and formatted into various multivalent formats as described in Example 58 were titered in a CTLA4-Ig/CD80-Ig interaction alphascreen as described in Example 52. \nFIG. 35\n shows the results of a representative assay where the potency of a monovalent Nanobody clone is compared to that of the multivalently formatted same Nanobody clone. Table C-12 summarizes the IC50 values of selected multivalent Nanobodies.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 60\n\n\nPotency of Multivalent CTLA4 Neutralizing Nanobodies as Detected in FACS\n\n\n \n \n \nNanobodies neutralizing CTLA4 and formatted into various multivalent formats as described in example 58 were titered in a CTLA4 transfected CHO cell line/CD80-Ig interaction FACS assay as described in Example 55. \nFIG. 36\n shows the results of a representative assay where the potency of a monovalent Nanobody clone is compared to that of the multivalently formatted same Nanobody clone. Table C-13 summarizes the IC50 values of selected multivalent Nanobodies.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 61\n\n\nBinding Affinity of Formatted CTLA4 Neutralizing Nanobodies as Measured in BIAcore\n\n\n \n \n \nThe CTLA4-Ig binding affinity/avidity of multivalent Nanobodies as described in example 58 was analyzed in BIAcore as described in Example 56. \nFIG. 37\n shows the results of a representative assay where the association and dissociation of monovalent Nanobody clones was compared to those of the corresponding multivalently formatted Nanobodies. Table C-14 summarizes the off-rates values measured for selected multivalent Nanobodies. To calculate apparent gain of affinity (avidity), the ratio of the formatted clone's off-rate versus the monovalent clone's off-rate was determined. For 11F1, no direct comparison could be made for the 300-375s dissociation period as most monovalent material was dissociated at that time, so the 300-375s dissociation phase kinetics were compared to the 60s dissociation phase of the monomer.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 62\n\n\nPotency of Multivalent CTLA4 Neutralizing Nanobodies as Detected in Bioassay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe potency gain of multivalent formatted Nanobodies was compared versus the original monovalent Nanobody in a T-cell stimulation bioassay, executed as described in Example 57. \nFIG. 38\n shows the results of a representative assay where the potency of a monovalent Nanobody clone is compared to that of the multivalently formatted same Nanobody clone. As can readily be observed, formatting of a neutralizing anti-CTLA4 Nanobody such as 11F1 results in an increase in potency in bioassay.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 63\n\n\nCTLA4 Neutralizing Nanobodies can be Humanized without Significant Loss of Functionality\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 39 and 40\n show the amino acid sequences of respectively Nanobody clones 11F1 and 11E3 aligned with multiple human immunoglobulin germline sequences. Multiple amino acid differences between the Nanobody clones and human germline are thus made evident. In order to reduce the potential immunogenicity of Nanobodies administered to human recipients, Nanobody sequences can be modified to resemble the human germline more than the initial “wild type” sequence, a process termed humanization. However, substitution of certain critical amino acids in Nanobody sequences can lead to reduced or completely abrogated antigen binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMultiple partially humanized Nanobody variant sequences were generated from each clone, as depicted in \nFIGS. 41 and 42\n. Variant sequences were prepared by standard site-directed mutagenensis methods, well known to those skilled in the art. Next, protein was produced and purified from these variants using the same methods as described in the pervious examples, and tested for their potential to inhibit the interaction between CTLA4-Ig and CD80-Ig in alphascreen, as described in Example 52. Results are shown in Table C-15. A “loss factor” was calculated by taking the ratio of the wild type molecule IC50 value and the variant's IC50 value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs can readily be observed, humanization of clone 11F1 does not result in significant loss of potency. Therefore, a variant uniting all mutations in one humanized variant can be expected to retain full potency, while also being very unlikely to induce an immune response in man. A mutation present in all humanized variants of 11E3 results in a 10-20 fold range potency loss, but only one variant showed loss of all inhibition potency. Additional variants containing fewer mutations than the “basic” set contained within all variants listed here (essentially single amino acid reversals to the wild type Nanobody clone sequence) can therefore be designed and tested as described here to determine which mutation(s) is (are) responsible for the overall 10× drop in potency. Then, either all mutations listed and tested here can be united into a single humanized variant, or all individual mutations present in \n \n \nvariants\n \n \n 1, 2 and 4 can be used in combination with the mutations found not to result in 10× potency drops in the less humanized “basic” set of mutations not resulting in 10× potency drops.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 64\n\n\nHumanized CTLA4 Neutralizing Nanobodies can be Formatted\n\n\n \n \n \nHumanized Nanobody sequences found not to result in large losses of affinity and/or potency, as described in Example 63, can be formatted into bivalent, trivalent or higher valency multivalent and/or multispecific Nanobodies, as described in Example 58. These can be produced, purified and tested for gain of affinity/potency using the methods described in Examples 58 to 62. One can, for example, combine the gain of affinity/potency of formatted Nanobodies and the benefit of reduced potential to induce an anti-drug immune response in man in a single molecule. This type of molecule is preferred over molecules with lesser potency and/or shorter half-lives and/or higher anticipated immunogenicity.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 65\n\n\nIn Vivo Efficacy Testing of CTLA4 Binding Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nIn vivo neutralization of CTLA4 gives rise to increased levels of T-cell activity. One indirect method of measuring this increase is via determination of humoral (B-cell) immune responses following an antigenic challenge, as this reflects increased T-cell help (Keler et al., J. Immunol. 171: 6251, 2003). Alternatively, one can compare the relative frequency of IL-2 producing T-cells between treated and control animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, the therapeutic efficacy of CTLA4 neutralizing Nanobodies having crossreactivity with non-human primate CTLA4 is determined by administering the Nanobodies to primates undergoing an immunization scheme. The antigen used for the purpose may be either a vaccine known to be efficacious by itself (i.e. hepatitis vaccine, tetanus toxoid vaccine) or a vaccine which is less than fully protective when used by itself (i.e. certain cancer vaccines) (Keler et al.). Anti-vaccine serum titers can then be determined in ELISA and compared with primates that did not receive CTLA4 neutralizing Nanobodies. Alternatively, increased T-cell reactivity towards the vaccine antigen can be determined by in vitro restimulating PBMC with antigen and comparing the number of IL-2 producing T-cells in ELIspot. Both the required purified vaccine antigen as well as monkey IL-2 ELISpot assays are commercially available (Rollier et al. 2007, Hepatology 45: 602).\n\n\n \n

Compounds of such Formulae can modulate CK2 activity and/or PARP activity, for example. Such compounds therefore can be utilized in multiple applications by a person of ordinary skill in the art. For example, compounds described herein may find uses that include, but are not limited to, (i) modulation of protein kinase activity (e.g., CK2 activity), (ii) modulation of polymerase activity (e.g., PARP activity), (iii) modulation of cell proliferation, (iv) modulation of apoptosis, and (v) treatments of cell proliferation related disorders (e.g., administration alone or co-administration with another molecule).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Optionally substituted” as used herein indicates that the particular group or groups being described may have no non-hydrogen substituents, or the group or groups may have one or more non-hydrogen substituents. If not otherwise specified, the total number of such substituents that may be present is equal to the number of H atoms present on the unsubstituted form of the group being described. Where an optional substituent is attached via a double bond, such as a carbonyl oxygen (═O), the group takes up two available valences, so the total number of substituents that may be included is reduced according to the number of available valences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention often have ionizable groups so as to be capable of preparation as salts. In that case, wherever reference is made to the compound, it is understood in the art that a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may also be used. These salts may be acid addition salts involving inorganic or organic acids or the salts may, in the case of acidic forms of the compounds of the invention be prepared from inorganic or organic bases. Frequently, the compounds are prepared or used as pharmaceutically acceptable salts prepared as addition products of pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acids and bases are well-known in the art, such as hydrochloric, sulphuric, hydrobromic, acetic, lactic, citric, or tartaric acids for forming acid addition salts, and potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, caffeine, various amines, and the like for forming basic salts. Methods for preparation of the appropriate salts are well-established in the art. In some cases, the compounds may contain both an acidic and a basic functional group, in which case they may have two ionized groups and yet have no net charge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, the compounds of the invention contain one or more chiral centers. The invention includes each of the isolated stereoisomeric forms as well as mixtures of stereoisomers in varying degrees of chiral purity, including racemic mixtures. It also encompasses the various diastereomers and tautomers that can be formed. The compounds of the invention may also exist in more than one tautomeric form; the depiction herein of one tautomer is for convenience only, and is also understood to encompass other tautomers of the form shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “alkyl,” “alkenyl” and “alkynyl” include straight-chain, branched-chain and cyclic monovalent hydrocarbyl radicals, and combinations of these, which contain only C and H when they are unsubstituted. Examples include methyl, ethyl, isobutyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentylethyl, 2-propenyl, 3-butynyl, and the like. The total number of carbon atoms in each such group is sometimes described herein, e.g., when the group can contain up to ten carbon atoms it can be represented as 1-10C or as C1-C10 or C1-10. When heteroatoms (N, O and S typically) are allowed to replace carbon atoms as in heteroalkyl groups, for example, the numbers describing the group, though still written as e.g. C1-C6, represent the sum of the number of carbon atoms in the group plus the number of such heteroatoms that are included as replacements for carbon atoms in the backbone of the ring or chain being described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, the alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl substituents of the invention contain 1-10C (alkyl) or 2-10C (alkenyl or alkynyl). Preferably they contain 1-8C (alkyl) or 2-8C (alkenyl or alkynyl). Sometimes they contain 1-4C (alkyl) or 2-4C (alkenyl or alkynyl). A single group can include more than one type of multiple bond, or more than one multiple bond; such groups are included within the definition of the term “alkenyl” when they contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond, and are included within the term “alkynyl” when they contain at least one carbon-carbon triple bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups are often optionally substituted to the extent that such substitution makes sense chemically. Typical substituents include, but are not limited to, halo, ═O, ═N—CN, ═N—OR, ═NR, OR, NR\n2\n, SR, SO\n2\nR, SO\n2\nNR\n2\n, NRSO\n2\nR, NRCONR\n2\n, NRCOOR, NRCOR, CN, C≡CR, COOR, CONR\n2\n, OOCR, COR, and NO\n2\n, wherein each R is independently H, C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 heteroalkyl, C1-C8 acyl, C2-C8 heteroacyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 heteroalkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C2-C8 heteroalkynyl, C6-C10 aryl, or C5-C10 heteroaryl, and each R is optionally substituted with halo, ═O, ═N—CN, ═N—OR′, ═NR′, OR′, NR′\n2\n, SR′, SO\n2\nR′, SO\n2\nNR′\n2\n, NR′SO\n2\nR′, NR′CONR′\n2\n, NR′COOR′, NR′COR′, CN, C≡CR′, COOR′, CONR′\n2\n, OOCR′, COR′, and NO\n2\n, wherein each R\n1 \nis independently H, C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 heteroalkyl, C1-C8 acyl, C2-C8 heteroacyl, C6-C10 aryl or C5-C10 heteroaryl. Alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups can also be substituted by C1-C8 acyl, C2-C8 heteroacyl, C6-C10 aryl or C5-C10 heteroaryl, each of which can be substituted by the substituents that are appropriate for the particular group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Acetylene” substituents are 2-10C alkynyl groups that are optionally substituted, and are of the formula —C≡C—R\na\n, wherein R\na \nis H or C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 heteroalkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 heteroalkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C2-C8 heteroalkynyl, C1-C8 acyl, C2-C8 heteroacyl, C6-C10 aryl, C5-C10 heteroaryl, C7-C12 arylalkyl, or C6-C12 heteroarylalkyl,\n\n \n \n \n \n \nand each R\na \ngroup is optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from halo, ═O, ═N—CN, ═N—OR′, ═NR′, OR′, NR′\n2\n, SR′, SO\n2\nR′, SO\n2\nNR′\n2\n, NR\n1 \nSO\n2\nR′, NR′CONR′\n2\n, NR′COOR′, NR\n1 \nCOR′, CN, COOR′, CONR′\n2\n, OOCR′, COR′, and NO\n2\n, wherein each R\n1 \nis independently H, C1-C6 alkyl, C2-C6 heteroalkyl, C1-C6 acyl, C2-C6 heteroacyl, C6-C10 aryl, C5-C10 heteroaryl, C7-12 arylalkyl, or C6-12 heteroarylalkyl, each of which is optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from halo, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4 heteroalkyl, C1-C6 acyl, C1-C6 heteroacyl, hydroxy, amino, and ═O; and wherein two R\n1 \ncan be linked to form a 3-7 membered ring optionally containing up to three heteroatoms selected from N, O and S. In some embodiments, R\na \nof —C≡C—R\na \nis H or Me.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n“Heteroalkyl”, “heteroalkenyl”, and “heteroalkynyl” and the like are defined similarly to the corresponding hydrocarbyl (alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl) groups, but the ‘hetero’ terms refer to groups that contain 1-3 O, S or N heteroatoms or combinations thereof within the backbone residue; thus at least one carbon atom of a corresponding alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group is replaced by one of the specified heteroatoms to form a heteroalkyl, heteroalkenyl, or heteroalkynyl group. The typical and preferred sizes for heteroforms of alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups are generally the same as for the corresponding hydrocarbyl groups, and the substituents that may be present on the heteroforms are the same as those described above for the hydrocarbyl groups. For reasons of chemical stability, it is also understood that, unless otherwise specified, such groups do not include more than two contiguous heteroatoms except where an oxo group is present on N or S as in a nitro or sulfonyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile “alkyl” as used herein includes cycloalkyl and cycloalkylalkyl groups, the term “cycloalkyl” may be used herein to describe a carbocyclic non-aromatic group that is connected via a ring carbon atom, and “cycloalkylalkyl” may be used to describe a carbocyclic non-aromatic group that is connected to the molecule through an alkyl linker. Similarly, “heterocyclyl” may be used to describe a non-aromatic cyclic group that contains at least one heteroatom as a ring member and that is connected to the molecule via a ring atom, which may be C or N; and “heterocyclylalkyl” may be used to describe such a group that is connected to another molecule through a linker. The sizes and substituents that are suitable for the cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heterocyclyl, and heterocyclylalkyl groups are the same as those described above for alkyl groups. As used herein, these terms also include rings that contain a double bond or two, as long as the ring is not aromatic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “acyl” encompasses groups comprising an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl or arylalkyl radical attached at one of the two available valence positions of a carbonyl carbon atom, and heteroacyl refers to the corresponding groups wherein at least one carbon other than the carbonyl carbon has been replaced by a heteroatom chosen from N, O and S. Thus heteroacyl includes, for example, —C(═O)OR and —C(═O)NR\n2 \nas well as —C(═O)— heteroaryl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcyl and heteroacyl groups are bonded to any group or molecule to which they are attached through the open valence of the carbonyl carbon atom. Typically, they are C1-C8 acyl groups, which include formyl, acetyl, pivaloyl, and benzoyl, and C2-C8 heteroacyl groups, which include methoxyacetyl, ethoxycarbonyl, and 4-pyridinoyl. The hydrocarbyl groups, aryl groups, and heteroforms of such groups that comprise an acyl or heteroacyl group can be substituted with the substituents described herein as generally suitable substituents for each of the corresponding component of the acyl or heteroacyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Aromatic” moiety or “aryl” moiety refers to a monocyclic or fused bicyclic moiety having the well-known characteristics of aromaticity; examples include phenyl and naphthyl. Similarly, “heteroaromatic” and “heteroaryl” refer to such monocyclic or fused bicyclic ring systems which contain as ring members one or more heteroatoms selected from O, S and N. The inclusion of a heteroatom permits aromaticity in 5-membered rings as well as 6-membered rings. Typical heteroaromatic systems include monocyclic C5-C6 aromatic groups such as pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyrazinyl, thienyl, furanyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, and imidazolyl and the fused bicyclic moieties formed by fusing one of these monocyclic groups with a phenyl ring or with any of the heteroaromatic monocyclic groups to form a C8-C10 bicyclic group such as indolyl, benzimidazolyl, indazolyl, benzotriazolyl, isoquinolyl, quinolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzofuranyl, pyrazolopyridyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, cinnolinyl, and the like. Any monocyclic or fused ring bicyclic system which has the characteristics of aromaticity in terms of electron distribution throughout the ring system is included in this definition. It also includes bicyclic groups where at least the ring which is directly attached to the remainder of the molecule has the characteristics of aromaticity. Typically, the ring systems contain 5-12 ring member atoms. Preferably the monocyclic heteroaryls contain 5-6 ring members, and the bicyclic heteroaryls contain 8-10 ring members.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAryl and heteroaryl moieties may be substituted with a variety of substituents including C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C5-C12 aryl, C1-C8 acyl, and heteroforms of these, each of which can itself be further substituted; other substituents for aryl and heteroaryl moieties include halo, OR, NR\n2\n, SR, SO\n2\nR, SO\n2\nNR\n2\n, NRSO\n2\nR, NRCONR\n2\n, NRCOOR, NRCOR, CN, C≡CR, COOR, CONR\n2\n, OOCR, COR, and NO\n2\n, wherein each R is independently H, C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 heteroalkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 heteroalkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C2-C8 heteroalkynyl, C6-C10 aryl, C5-C10 heteroaryl, C7-C12 arylalkyl, or C6-C12 heteroarylalkyl, and each R is optionally substituted as described above for alkyl groups. The substituent groups on an aryl or heteroaryl group may of course be further substituted with the groups described herein as suitable for each type of such substituents or for each component of the substituent. Thus, for example, an arylalkyl substituent may be substituted on the aryl portion with substituents described herein as typical for aryl groups, and it may be further substituted on the alkyl portion with substituents described herein as typical or suitable for alkyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, “arylalkyl” and “heteroarylalkyl” refer to aromatic and heteroaromatic ring systems which are bonded to their attachment point through a linking group such as an alkylene, including substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated, cyclic or acyclic linkers. Typically the linker is C1-C8 alkyl or a hetero form thereof. These linkers may also include a carbonyl group, thus making them able to provide substituents as an acyl or heteroacyl moiety. An aryl or heteroaryl ring in an arylalkyl or heteroarylalkyl group may be substituted with the same substituents described above for aryl groups. Preferably, an arylalkyl group includes a phenyl ring optionally substituted with the groups defined above for aryl groups and a C1-C4 alkylene that is unsubstituted or is substituted with one or two C1-C4 alkyl groups or heteroalkyl groups, where the alkyl or heteroalkyl groups can optionally cyclize to form a ring such as cyclopropane, dioxolane, or oxacyclopentane. Similarly, a heteroarylalkyl group preferably includes a C5-C6 monocyclic heteroaryl group that is optionally substituted with the groups described above as substituents typical on aryl groups and a C1-C4 alkylene that is unsubstituted or is substituted with one or two C1-C4 alkyl groups or heteroalkyl groups, or it includes an optionally substituted phenyl ring or C5-C6 monocyclic heteroaryl and a C1-C4 heteroalkylene that is unsubstituted or is substituted with one or two C1-C4 alkyl or heteroalkyl groups, where the alkyl or heteroalkyl groups can optionally cyclize to form a ring such as cyclopropane, dioxolane, or oxacyclopentane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere an arylalkyl or heteroarylalkyl group is described as optionally substituted, the substituents may be on either the alkyl or heteroalkyl portion or on the aryl or heteroaryl portion of the group. The substituents optionally present on the alkyl or heteroalkyl portion are the same as those described above for alkyl groups generally; the substituents optionally present on the aryl or heteroaryl portion are the same as those described above for aryl groups generally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Arylalkyl” groups as used herein are hydrocarbyl groups if they are unsubstituted, and are described by the total number of carbon atoms in the ring and alkylene or similar linker. Thus a benzyl group is a C7-arylalkyl group, and phenylethyl is a C8-arylalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Heteroarylalkyl” as described above refers to a moiety comprising an aryl group that is attached through a linking group, and differs from “arylalkyl” in that at least one ring atom of the aryl moiety or one atom in the linking group is a heteroatom selected from N, O and S. The heteroarylalkyl groups are described herein according to the total number of atoms in the ring and linker combined, and they include aryl groups linked through a heteroalkyl linker; heteroaryl groups linked through a hydrocarbyl linker such as an alkylene; and heteroaryl groups linked through a heteroalkyl linker. Thus, for example, C7-heteroarylalkyl would include pyridylmethyl, phenoxy, and N-pyrrolylmethoxy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkylene” as used herein refers to a divalent hydrocarbyl group; because it is divalent, it can link two other groups together. Typically it refers to —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n— where n is 1-8 and preferably n is 1-4, though where specified, an alkylene can also be substituted by other groups, and can be of other lengths, and the open valences need not be at opposite ends of a chain. Thus —CH(Me)— and —C(Me)\n2\n- may also be referred to as alkylenes, as can a cyclic group such as cyclopropan-1,1-diyl. Where an alkylene group is substituted, the substituents include those typically present on alkyl groups as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, any alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, or aryl or arylalkyl group or any heteroform of one of these groups that is contained in a substituent may itself optionally be substituted by additional substituents. The nature of these substituents is similar to those recited with regard to the primary substituents themselves if the substituents are not otherwise described. Thus, where an embodiment of, for example, R\n7 \nis alkyl, this alkyl may optionally be substituted by the remaining substituents listed as embodiments for R\n7 \nwhere this makes chemical sense, and where this does not undermine the size limit provided for the alkyl per se; e.g., alkyl substituted by alkyl or by alkenyl would simply extend the upper limit of carbon atoms for these embodiments, and is not included. However, alkyl substituted by aryl, amino, alkoxy, ═O, and the like would be included within the scope of the invention, and the atoms of these substituent groups are not counted in the number used to describe the alkyl, alkenyl, etc. group that is being described. Where no number of substituents is specified, each such alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, or aryl group may be substituted with a number of substituents according to its available valences; in particular, any of these groups may be substituted with fluorine atoms at any or all of its available valences, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Heteroform” as used herein refers to a derivative of a group such as an alkyl, aryl, or acyl, wherein at least one carbon atom of the designated carbocyclic group has been replaced by a heteroatom selected from N, O and S. Thus the heteroforms of alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, aryl, and arylalkyl are heteroalkyl, heteroalkenyl, heteroalkynyl, heteroacyl, heteroaryl, and heteroarylalkyl, respectively. It is understood that no more than two N, O or S atoms are ordinarily connected sequentially, except where an oxo group is attached to N or S to form a nitro or sulfonyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Halo”, as used herein includes fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. Fluoro and chloro are often preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Amino” as used herein refers to NH\n2\n, but where an amino is described as “substituted” or “optionally substituted”, the term includes NR\n1\nR″ wherein each R\n1 \nand R″ is independently H, or is an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, aryl, or arylalkyl group or a heteroform of one of these groups, and each of the alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, aryl, or arylalkyl groups or heteroforms of one of these groups is optionally substituted with the substituents described herein as suitable for the corresponding group. The term also includes forms wherein R\n1 \nand R″ are linked together to form a 3-8 membered ring which may be saturated, unsaturated or aromatic and which contains 1-3 heteroatoms independently selected from N, O and S as ring members, and which is optionally substituted with the substituents described as suitable for alkyl groups or, if NR\n1\nR″ is an aromatic group, it is optionally substituted with the substituents described as typical for heteroaryl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “carbocycle” refers to a cyclic compound containing only carbon atoms in the ring, whereas a “heterocycle” refers to a cyclic compound comprising a heteroatom. The carbocyclic and heterocyclic structures encompass compounds having monocyclic, bicyclic or multiple ring systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “heteroatom” refers to any atom that is not carbon or hydrogen, such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIllustrative examples of heterocycles include but are not limited to tetrahydrofuran, 1,3 dioxolane, 2,3 dihydrofuran, pyran, tetrahydropyran, benzofuran, isobenzofuran, 1,3 dihydro isobenzofuran, isoxazole, 4,5 dihydroisoxazole, piperidine, pyrrolidine, \npyrrolidin\n 2 one, pyrrole, pyridine, pyrimidine, octahydro pyrrolo[3,4 b]pyridine, piperazine, pyrazine, morpholine, thiomorpholine, imidazole, \n \nimidazolidine\n \n 2,4 dione, 1,3 \ndihydrobenzimidazol\n 2 one, indole, thiazole, benzothiazole, thiadiazole, thiophene, \n \ntetrahydro thiophene\n \n 1,1 dioxide, diazepine, triazole, guanidine, diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, 2,5 diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, 2,3,4,4a,9,9a hexahydro 1H β carboline, oxirane, oxetane, tetrahydropyran, dioxane, lactones, aziridine, azetidine, piperidine, lactams, and may also encompass heteroaryls. Other illustrative examples of heteroaryls include but are not limited to furan, pyrrole, pyridine, pyrimidine, imidazole, benzimidazole and triazole.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “inorganic substituent” refers to substituents that do not contain carbon or contain carbon bound to elements other than hydrogen (e.g., elemental carbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and carbonate). Examples of inorganic substituents include but are not limited to nitro, halogen, azido, cyano, sulfonyls, sulfinyls, sulfonates, phosphates, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treat” and “treating” as used herein refer to ameliorating, alleviating, lessening, and removing symptoms of a disease or condition. A candidate molecule or compound described herein may be in a therapeutically effective amount in a formulation or medicament, which is an amount that can lead to a biological effect, such as apoptosis of certain cells (e.g., cancer cells), reduction of proliferation of certain cells, or lead to ameliorating, alleviating, lessening, or removing symptoms of a disease or condition, for example. The terms also can refer to reducing or stopping a cell proliferation rate (e.g., slowing or halting tumor growth) or reducing the number of proliferating cancer cells (e.g., removing part or all of a tumor). These terms also are applicable to reducing a titre of a microorganism in a system (i.e., cell, tissue, or subject) infected with a microorganism, reducing the rate of microbial propagation, reducing the number of symptoms or an effect of a symptom associated with the microbial infection, and/or removing detectable amounts of the microbe from the system. Examples of microorganism include but are not limited to virus, bacterium and fungus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “apoptosis” refers to an intrinsic cell self-destruction or suicide program. In response to a triggering stimulus, cells undergo a cascade of events including cell shrinkage, blebbing of cell membranes and chromatic condensation and fragmentation. These events culminate in cell conversion to clusters of membrane-bound particles (apoptotic bodies), which are thereafter engulfed by macrophages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention in part provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound within the scope of the invention as described herein, and methods of using compounds described herein. For example, the invention in part provides methods for identifying a candidate molecule that interacts with a CK2 or PARP protein, which comprises contacting a composition containing a CK2 or PARP protein and a molecule described herein with a candidate molecule and determining whether the amount of the molecule described herein that interacts with the protein is modulated, whereby a candidate molecule that modulates the amount of the molecule described herein that interacts with the protein is identified as a candidate molecule that interacts with the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided are methods for modulating the activity of a CK2 protein or PARP protein, which comprises contacting a system comprising the protein with a compound described herein in an amount effective for modulating (e.g., inhibiting) the activity of the protein. The system in such embodiments can be a cell-free system or a system comprising cells. Also provided are methods for reducing cell proliferation, and optionally inducing apoptosis, which comprises contacting cells with a compound described herein in an amount effective to reduce proliferation of the cells. The cells in such embodiments can be in a cell line, in a tissue or in a subject (e.g., a research animal or human). In related embodiments, provided are compositions comprising a compound described herein in combination with a protein or cell, such as an isolated protein (e.g., isolated CK2 or other serine-threonine protein kinase protein or PARP protein) or a cell in a cell line (e.g., HCT-116 cell line).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProvided also are methods for modulating a serine-threonine protein kinase activity. Serine-threonine protein kinases catalyze the transfer of a gamma phosphate from adenosine triphosphate to a serine or threonine amino acid in a peptide or protein substrate. Thus, included herein are methods which comprise contacting a system comprising a serine-threonine protein kinase protein with a compound described herein in an amount effective for modulating (e.g., inhibiting) the activity of the protein. In some embodiments, the activity of the serine-threonine protein kinase is the catalytic activity of the protein (e.g., catalyzing the transfer of a gamma phosphate from adenosine triphosphate to a peptide or protein substrate). In certain embodiments, provided are methods for identifying a candidate molecule that interacts with a serine-threonine protein kinase, which comprise: contacting a composition containing a serine-threonine protein kinase and a compound described herein with a candidate molecule under conditions in which the compound and the protein interact, and determining whether the amount of the compound that interacts with the protein is modulated relative to a control interaction between the compound and the protein without the candidate molecule, whereby a candidate molecule that modulates the amount of the compound interacting with the protein relative to the control interaction is identified as a candidate molecule that interacts with the protein. Systems in such embodiments can be a cell-free system or a system comprising cells (e.g., in vitro). The protein, the compound or the molecule in some embodiments is in association with a solid phase. In certain embodiments, the interaction between the compound and the protein is detected via a detectable label, where in some embodiments the protein comprises a detectable label and in certain embodiments the compound comprises a detectable label. The interaction between the compound and the protein sometimes is detected without a detectable label.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe serine-threonine protein kinase can be from any source, such as a mammal, ape or human, for example. Examples of serine-threonine protein kinases that can be inhibited by compounds disclosed herein include without limitation human versions of CK2, CK2α2, Pim-1, CDK1/cyclinB, c-RAF, Mer, MELK, DYRK2, Flt3, Flt3 (D835Y), Flt4, HTPK3, HTPK2, ZIPK and ZIPK. A serine-threonine protein kinase sometimes is a member of a sub-family containing one or more of the following amino acids at positions corresponding to those listed in human CK2: leucine at position 45, methionine at position 163 and isoleucine at position 174. Examples of such protein kinases include without limitation human versions of CK2, STK10, HIPK2, HIPK3, DAPK3, DYK2 and PIM-1. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences for serine-threonine protein kinases and reagents are publicly available (e.g., World Wide Web URLs ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/ and Invitrogen.com).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also in part provides methods for treating a condition related to aberrant cell proliferation. For example, provided are methods of treating a cell proliferative condition in a subject, which comprises administering a compound described herein to a subject in need thereof in an amount effective to treat the cell proliferative condition. The subject may be a research animal (e.g., rodent, dog, cat, monkey), optionally containing a tumor such as a xenograft tumor (e.g., human tumor), for example, or may be a human. A cell proliferative condition sometimes is a tumor or non-tumor cancer, including but not limited to, cancers of the colorectum, breast, lung, liver, pancreas, lymph node, colon, prostate, brain, head and neck, skin, liver, kidney, blood and heart (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, carcinoma).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided are methods for treating a condition related to inflammation or pain. For example, provided are methods of treating pain in a subject, which comprise administering a compound described herein to a subject in need thereof in an amount effective to treat the pain. Provided also are methods of treating inflammation in a subject, which comprises administering a compound described herein to a subject in need thereof in an amount effective to treat the inflammation. The subject may be a research animal (e.g., rodent, dog, cat, monkey), for example, or may be a human. Conditions associated with inflammation and pain include without limitation acid reflux, heartburn, acne, allergies and sensitivities, Alzheimer's disease, asthma, atherosclerosis, bronchitis, carditis, celiac disease, chronic pain, Crohn's disease, cirrhosis, colitis, dementia, dermatitis, diabetes, dry eyes, edema, emphysema, eczema, fibromyalgia, gastroenteritis, gingivitis, heart disease, hepatitis, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, interstitial cystitis, joint pain/arthritis/rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic syndrome (syndrome X), myositis, nephritis, obesity, osteopenia, osteoporosis, Parkinson's disease, periodontal disease, polyarteritis, polychondritis, psoriasis, scleroderma, sinusitis, Sjögren's syndrome, spastic colon, systemic candidiasis, tendonitis, urinary track infections, vaginitis, inflammatory cancer (e.g., inflammatory breast cancer) and the like. Methods for determining effects of compounds herein on pain or inflammation are known. For example, formalin-stimulated pain behaviors in research animals can be monitored after administration of a compound described herein to assess treatment of pain (e.g., Li et al., \nPain \n115(1-2): 182-90 (2005)). Also, modulation of pro-inflammatory molecules (e.g., IL-8, GRO-alpha, MCP-1, TNFalpha and iNOS) can be monitored after administration of a compound described herein to assess treatment of inflammation (e.g., Parhar et al., \nInt J Colorectal Dis. \n22(6): 601-9 (2006)), for example. Thus, also provided are methods for determining whether a compound herein reduces inflammation or pain, which comprise contacting a system with a compound described herein in an amount effective for modulating (e.g., inhibiting) the activity of a pain signal or inflammation signal. Provided also are methods for identifying a compound that reduces inflammation or pain, which comprise: contacting a system with a compound of Formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV or XVI; and detecting a pain signal or inflammation signal, whereby a compound that modulates the pain signal relative to a control molecule is identified as a compound that reduces inflammation of pain. Non-limiting examples of pain signals are formalin-stimulated pain behaviors and examples of inflammation signals include without limitation a level of a pro-inflammatory molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also in part pertains to methods for modulating angiogenesis in a subject, and methods for treating a condition associated with aberrant angiogenesis in a subject. Thus, provided are methods for determining whether a compound herein modulates angiogenesis, which comprise contacting a system with a compound described herein in an amount effective for modulating (e.g., inhibiting) angiogenesis or a signal associated with angiogenesis. Signals associated with angiogenesis are levels of a pro-angiogenesis growth factor such as VEGF. Methods for assessing modulation of angiogenesis also are known, such as analyzing human endothelial tube formation (BD BioCoat™ Angiogenesis System from BD Biosciences). Provided also are methods for identifying a compound that modulates angiogenesis, which comprise contacting a system with a compound of Formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV or XVI; and detecting angiogenesis in the system or an angiogenesis signal, whereby a compound that modulates the angiogenesis or angiogenesis signal relative to a control molecule is identified as a compound that modulates angiogenesis. Also provided are methods for treating an angiogenesis condition, which comprise administering a compound described herein to a subject in need thereof in an amount effective to treat the angiogenesis condition. Angiogenesis conditions include without limitation solid tumor cancers, varicose disease and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable formulation of a compound described above can be prepared for administration. Any suitable route of administration may be used, including, but not limited to, oral, parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, transdermal, topical and subcutaneous routes. Depending on the subject to be treated, the mode of administration, and the type of treatment desired—e.g., prevention, prophylaxis, therapy; the compounds are formulated in ways consonant with these parameters. Preparation of suitable formulations for each route of administration are known in the art. A summary of such formulation methods and techniques is found in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\n, latest edition, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., which is incorporated herein by reference. The formulation of each substance or of the combination of two substances will generally include a diluent as well as, in some cases, adjuvants, buffers, preservatives and the like. The substances to be administered can be administered also in liposomal compositions or as microemulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor injection, formulations can be prepared in conventional forms as liquid solutions or suspensions or as solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection or as emulsions. Suitable excipients include, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol and the like. Such compositions may also contain amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, such as, for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, and so forth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious sustained release systems for drugs have also been devised, and can be applied to compounds of the invention. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,677, the methods of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSystemic administration may also include relatively noninvasive methods such as the use of suppositories, transdermal patches, transmucosal delivery and intranasal administration. Oral administration is also suitable for compounds of the invention. Suitable forms include syrups, capsules, tablets, as is understood in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor administration to animal or human subjects, the appropriate dosage of the a compound described above often is 0.01-15 mg/kg, and sometimes 0.1-10 mg/kg. Dosage levels are dependent on the nature of the condition, drug efficacy, the condition of the patient, the judgment of the practitioner, and the frequency and mode of administration; however, optimization of such parameters is within the ordinary level of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic Combinations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods to treat conditions such as cancer and inflammation by administering to a subject in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic agent that binds to certain DNA segments and administering to the same subject a PARP or CK2 modulator in an amount that is effective to enhance the activity of the therapeutic agent. A PARP or CK2 modulator is an agent that inhibits or enhances a biological activity of a PARP protein or a CK2 protein, and is generically referred to hereafter as a “modulator.” The therapeutic agent and the modulator may be administered together, either as separate pharmaceutical compositions or admixed in a single pharmaceutical composition. The therapeutic agent and the modulator may also be administered separately, including at different times and with different frequencies, as long as the modulator is administered at a time that increases the potency of the therapeutic agent. The modulator may be administered by any known route, such as orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, nasally, and the like; and the therapeutic agent may also be administered by any conventional route. In many embodiments, at least one and optionally both of the modulator and the therapeutic agent may be administered orally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the modulator and the therapeutic agent are administered at the same time, whether in separate dosages or admixed in a single dosage. Where the frequency of administration of the two materials can be adjusted to match, the modulator and therapeutic agent are preferably combined into a single pharmaceutical composition, so the treated patient may receive a single oral dosage or a single injection, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of each of these materials to be administered will vary with the route of administration, the condition of the subject, other treatments being administered to the subject, and other parameters. The therapeutic agents of the invention may, of course, cause multiple desired effects; and the amount of modulator to be used in combination with the therapeutic agent should be an amount that increases one or more of these desired effects. The modulator is to be administered in an amount that is effective to enhance a desired effect of the therapeutic agent. An amount is “effective to enhance a desired effect of the therapeutic agent”, as used herein, if it increases by at least about 25% at least one of the desired effects of the therapeutic agent alone. Preferably, it is an amount that increases a desired effect of the therapeutic agent by at least 50% or by at least 100% (i.e., it doubles the effective activity of the therapeutic agent.) In some embodiments, it is an amount that increases a desired effect of the therapeutic agent by at least 200%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of a modulator that increases a desired effect of a therapeutic agent may be determined using in vitro methods, such as cell proliferation assays. The therapeutic agents of the invention are useful to counter hyperproliferative disorders such as cancer, thus they reduce cell proliferation. Thus, for example, a suitable amount of a modulator could be the amount needed to enhance an antiproliferative effect of a therapeutic agent by at least 25% as determined in a cell proliferation assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe modulator used in the present invention enhances at least one desired effect produced by the therapeutic agent it is used with, thus the combinations of the invention provide a synergistic effect, not merely an additive effect. The modulators themselves are at times useful for treating the same types of conditions, and thus may also have some direct effect in such assays. In that event, the “amount effective to increase a desired effect” must be a synergistic enhancement of the activity of the therapeutic agent that is attributable to enhancement by the modulator of an effect of the therapeutic agent, rather than a simple additive effect that would be expected with separate administration of the two materials. In many cases, the modulator can be used in an amount (concentration) that would not be expected to have any apparent effect on the treated subject or the in vitro assay, so the increased effect achieved with the combination is directly attributable to a synergistic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes methods and compositions for treating a patient having a cell proliferation disorder or an inflammatory disorder with a therapeutic agent as described herein, and a “modulator” described above, where the timing of administration of the modulator permits it to enhance a desired effect of the therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModulators of PARP and CK2 are known. Inhibitors of PARP are well known in the art, and some have been shown to potentiate the activity of other drugs for certain uses. For example, it has been reported that treating a carcinoma cell colony with a PARP inhibitor at a concentration that had no substantial growth inhibition or cellular toxicity alone increased the activity of cytotoxic agents temozolomide and topotecan substantially. C. R. Calabrese, et al., \nClin. Cancer Res\n., vol. 9, 2711-18 (July 2003). This effect is believed to be related to the role PARP plays in DNA repair: because PARP promotes repair of damaged DNA, it is thought to increase the effects of compounds that act by damaging DNA. These include compounds that alkylate DNA, which may include temozolomide, and topoisomerase inhibitors such as topotecan. Id.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to the use of a “modulator” as described above in combination with a therapeutic agent that can act by binding to regions of DNA that can form certain quadruplex structures; the therapeutic agents have anticancer activity on their own, but their activity is enhanced when they are used in combination with a modulator. This synergistic effect allows the therapeutic agent to be administered in a lower dosage while achieving equivalent or higher levels of at least one desired effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic agents of the invention are compounds that bind to certain motifs in nucleic acids. The therapeutic agent to be used can be selected from several different classes of compounds, such as those that bind to quadruplex-forming regions of DNA.

Examples of PARP inhibitors are known in the art, and are disclosed, for example, in C. R. Calebrese, et al., \nClin. Cancer Res\n. vol. 9, 2711-18 (2003); S. J. Veuger, et al., \nCancer Res\n. vol. 63, 6008-15 (2003); C. R. Calabrese et al., \nJ. Nat'l.

Jagtap, \nNature Rev.: Drug Discovery\n, vol. 4, 421-40 (20045). The PARP inhibitors disclosed in these documents are suitable for use in the methods and compositions of the present invention. Additional PARP inhibitors that can be used include, for example, 10-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-2H-7-oxa-1,2-diaza-benzo[de]anthracen-3-one (GPI 15427) and 2-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-5H-benzo[c][1,5]naphthyridin-6-one (GPI 16539). See Di Paola, et al., \nEur. J. Pharmacology, \n527(1-3), 163-71 (2005). Representative, but non-limiting, examples of PARP inhibitors that are suitable for use in the invention include the known compounds shown hereafter, including the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and individual isomers or mixtures of isomers thereof.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModulators that can be utilized in combination with a therapeutic agent described above also include compounds having structures of Formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI or XII described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound TA1-1A is a preferred therapeutic agent for use in the methods and compositions of the invention. More detail on suitable methods for its formulation and administration are provided in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/803,864 to Lim, et al., which was filed on Jun. 3, 2006.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also in part provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one therapeutic agent within the scope of the invention as described herein in combination with at least one modulator. Optionally, the composition may comprise a diluent or other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor administration to animal or human subjects, the appropriate dosage of the therapeutic agent is typically 0.01-15 mg/kg, preferably 0.1-10 mg/kg. Dosage levels are dependent on the nature of the condition, drug efficacy, the condition of the patient, the judgment of the practitioner, and the frequency and mode of administration; however, optimization of such parameters is within the ordinary level of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, the dosage of a modulator, such as a compound of Formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI or XII described herein, is typically between about 0.01-15 mg/kg, and about 0.1-10 mg/kg. A modulator may be separately active for treating a cancer. For combination therapies described above, when used in combination with a therapeutic agent, the dosage of a modulator will frequently be two-fold to ten-fold lower than the dosage required when the modulator is used alone to treat the same condition or subject. Determination of a suitable amount of the modulator for use in combination with a therapeutic agent is readily determined by methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided are methods for modulating the activity of a PARP protein, which comprises contacting a system comprising the PARP protein with a composition described herein in an amount effective for modulating (e.g., inhibiting) the activity of the protein. The system in such embodiments can be a cell-free system or a system comprising cells. Also provided are methods for reducing cell proliferation, and optionally inducing apoptosis, which comprises contacting cells with a composition or a combination therapy as described herein, wherein a therapeutic agent is administered in an amount effective to reduce proliferation of the cells, and a PARP inhibitor is administered in an amount sufficient to enhance the efficacy of the therapeutic agent. The cells in such embodiments can be in a cell line, in a tissue or in a subject (e.g., a research animal or human).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also in part provides methods for treating a condition related to aberrant cell proliferation. For example, provided are methods of treating a cell proliferative condition in a subject, which comprises administering a therapeutic agent described herein and a PARP inhibitor described herein to a subject in need of treatment for a cell proliferative disorder; the therapeutic agent and the PARP inhibitor are administered in amounts effective to treat the cell proliferative condition. The subject may be a research animal (e.g., rodent, dog, cat, monkey), optionally containing a tumor such as a xenograft tumor (e.g., human tumor), for example, or may be a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA cell proliferative condition sometimes is a tumor or non-tumor cancer, including but not limited to, cancers of the colorectum, breast, lung, liver, pancreas, lymph node, colon, prostate, brain, head and neck, skin, liver, kidney, blood and heart (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, carcinoma).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable formulation of the therapeutic agent and the PARP inhibitor can be prepared for administration, either together or separately. Any suitable route of administration may be used for each component, including but not limited to oral, parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, transdermal, topical and subcutaneous routes. The two substances used together (PARP inhibitor and therapeutic agent) may be administered separately or together. When administered together, they may be in separate dosage forms, or they may be combined into a single combination drug. Thus, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutic agent as described herein and at least one PARP inhibitor, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples illustrate and do not limit the invention.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nProcesses for Synthesizing Compounds of Formulae I, II, III and \nIV\n \n \n\n\nProcess\n \n \n 1\n\n\n \n \n \n3-bromo-4-pyridine carboxylic acid (3.0 g, 14.9 mmol) in ethanol (100 mL) was treated with concentrated sulfuric acid (5 mL).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThe mixture was brought to reflux at which time everything went into solution.

Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 microliters of ATP Solution (90% 75 mM MgCl\n2\n, 75 micromolar ATP dissolved in ADB; 10% [γ-\n33\n1]ATP (\nstock\n 1 mCi/100 μl; 3000 Ci/mmol (Perkin Elmer) and maintained for 10 minutes at 30 degrees C. The reactions were quenched with 100 microliters of 0.75% phosphoric acid, then transferred to and filtered through a phosphocellulose filter plate (Millipore). After washing each well 5 times with 0.75% phosphoric acid, the plate was dried under vacuum for 5 min and, following the addition of 15 ul of scintilation fluid to each well, the residual radioactivity was measured using a Wallac luminescence counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPARP Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPARP assays are conducted using a chemiluminescent PARP assay kit (Trevigen). Briefly, reactions are performed in Histone-coated strip wells, by adding 10 microliters test compound dissolved in 1×PARP Buffer (prepared by mixing 20×PARP buffer diluted with high-purity water) and 15 microliters diluted PARP-HSA enzyme (diluted in 1× PARP buffer, 0.1 unit per well) to 25 microliters PARP cocktail (prepared from 10×PARP cocktail and 10× activated DNA, both 2.5 microliters per well and 20 microliters per well of 1×PARP buffer). The reactions are incubated at ambient temperature for 60 minutes, then the liquid was removed. After washing the wells four times with PBS (200 ul), 50 microliters of STREP-HRP (Horseradish Peroxidase) solution (diluted 500-fold in 1× Strep-Diluent) was added and the reactions were allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. The liquid was removed and, after washing the wells four times with PBS (200 ul), 50 microliters each of PeroxyGlo A and B (Chemiluminescent Horseradish Peroxidase substrates) are added and the

Before treatment cells were washed, resuspended at a density of about 10\n6 \ncells/milliliter in medium containing 1% fetal calf serum and incubated in the presence of indicated mounts of drug for two hours. Cells were recovered by centrifugation, lysed using a hypotonic buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4; 2 mM EDTA; 5 mM EGTA; 10 mM mercaptoethanol; 10 mM NaF; 1 uM Okadaic acid; 10% v/v glycerol; 0.05% NP-40; 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) and protein from the cleared lysate was diluted to 1 microgram per microliter in Assay Dilution Buffer (ADB; 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mM (3-glycerolphosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and 1 mM dithiothreitol). To 20 microliters of diluted protein was added 10 microliters of substrate peptide (RRRDDDSDDD, dissolved in ADB at a concentration of 1 mM) and 10 microliters of PKA Inhibitor cocktail (Upstate). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 microliters of ATP Solution (90% 75 mM MgCl\n2\n, 100 uM ATP dissolved in ADB; 10% [gamma-\n33\nP]ATP (\nstock\n 1 mCi/100 microliters; 3000Ci/mmol (Perkin Elmer)) and maintained for 15 min at 32 degrees C. The reactions were quenched with 100 microliters of 0.75% phosphoric acid, then transferred to and filtered through a phosphocellulose filter plate (Millipore). After washing each well 5 times with 0.75% phosphoric acid, the residual radioactivity was measured using a Wallac luminescence counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModulatory activities of two compounds assessed by the assay are shown in \nFIG. 1\n.

Blood samples were collected at predetermined times and the plasma separated. Plasma was separated from the blood samples collected at 5, 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours post-dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrug levels were quantified by the LC/MS/MS method described below. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was applied for intravenous administration. A linear trapezoidal rule was used to compute AUC(0-24). The terminal t\n1/2 \nand C\n0 \nwere calculated using the last three and the first three data points, respectively\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBioanalysis was performed using a Quattro Micro LC/MS/MS instrument in the MRM detection mode, with an internal standard (IS). Briefly, 15 □L plasma samples were prepared for analysis using protein precipitation with 120 μL of acetonitrile. The supernatants were transferred into a 96 well plate and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using a Phenomenex Polar-RP HPLC column.

The in vivo experiments followed protocols approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee. Female NCr nu/nu mice were purchased from Taconic Farms and group housed in a ventilated rack system on a 12/12 light cycle. All housing materials and water were autoclaved prior to use. The mice were fed ad libitum with gamma irradiated laboratory chow and acidified water. Animals were handled under laminar-flow hoods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor size (mm\n3\n) was calculated using the formula (l×w\n2\n)/2, where w=width and l=length in mm of the tumor. Tumor weight was estimated with the assumption that 1 mg is equivalent to 1 mm\n3 \nof tumor volume.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor intravenous administration of compound A1, animals were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 5×10\n6 \nMiaPaca cells. Tumors were monitored twice weekly and then daily as they approached the appropriate size for study. On \nDay\n 1 of the study, the animals were randomized into n=5 treatment groups with group mean tumor sizes of 160 mm\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGrp\n 1\n \nMean\n \n160.966\n \n \nUTC\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGrp\n \n \n \n 2\n \nMean\n \n161.816\n \nGemzar\n \n \n \n \n \nGrp 3\n \nMean\n \n161.807\n \n30 mg/kg CK2 Compound\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGrp\n 4\n \nMean\n \n159.621\n \n60 mg/kg CK2 Compound\n \n \n \n \n \n% Dif.\n \n1.363\n \n \n \n \n \nSD\n \n1.034.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAnimals received 14 doses of Vehicle, Gemzar at 100 mg/kg Q3D or compound A1 at either 30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg by QD intravenous administration. Tumor volume measurements (\nFIG. 3A\n) and body weight (\nFIG. 3B\n) were recorded on \n \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n \n 3, 6, 8, 10, 13 and 15. Photographs of specific untreated control animals and animals administered 60 mg/kg compound A1 are shown in \nFIGS. 3C and 3D\n. Compound A1 is referred to as “CK2 inhibitor” in \nFIGS. 3A\n, \n3\nB, \n3\nC and \n3\nD.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound A1 also was administered orally to MiaPaca xenograft animals and inhibited tumor growth. Compound A1 was formulated as a sodium salt at 10 mg/mL, with 2% PEG 300 and buffered to pH 8.4 using sodium phosphate buffer. Compound A1 when administered orally to the animals at a dose of 100 mg/kg QDx8 and then 200 mg/kg QDx5 significantly inhibited tumor growth relative to an untreated control group. Gemar™ administered at a dose of 80 mg/kg IP Q3D was used as a positive control. Compound A1 also was delivered by oral administration at 100 mg/kg to animals bearing MCF-7 xenografts and at 150 mg/kg to animals bearing PC-3 xenografts, and in both sets of studies, significantly inhibited tumor growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt also was determined that compound A1 reduced CK2 activity in tumors. Assessment of CK2 activity in tumors revealed that tumors from animals treated with compound A1 had about 40% of the CK2 activity of tumors from animals not treated with compound A1 or treated with Gemzar™\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe distribution of compound A1 in the plasma and tumors of animals was assessed. In animals administered 30 mg/kg compound A1 IV, 60 mg/kg compound A1 IV and 200 mg/kg compound A1 orally, about 6.8, 2.2 and 9.5 micromolar compound A1, respectively, was identified in plasma, and about 42.9, 7.0 and 6.4 micromolar compound A1, respectively, was identified in tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCaspase staining also was assessed as a biomarker for compound A1 treatment of tumors. In animals treated with 60 mg/kg of compound A1 by IV administration, caspase-3 cell staining levels were four-fold greater than in untreated control cells. These results suggest caspase-3 staining can be a useful biomarker for monitoring inhibition of cell proliferation and tumor inhibition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor assessment of compound A2, the compound was delivered by intravenous and intraperitoneal administration to tumor-bearing xenograft mice. Animals were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 5×10\n6 \nBC-PC3 cells. Tumors were monitored twice weekly and then daily as they approached the appropriate size for study. On \nDay\n 1 of the study, the animals were randomized into n=8 treatment groups (n=5 for positive and negative control groups) with group mean tumor sizes of 97 mm\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGrp\n 1\n \nMean\n \n97.80\n \n \nUTC\n \n \n \n \nGrp\n \n \n \n 2\n \nMean\n \n96.95\n \n \nGemzar Q3D\n \n \n \n \nGrp\n \n \n \n 3\n \nMean\n \n96.68\n \n50 mg/kg CX-5011 IV BID \nx10 days\n \n \n \n \nGrp\n \n \n \n 4\n \nMean\n \n98.95\n \n60 mg/kg CX-5011 IV QD \nx17 days\n \n \n \n \nGrp\n \n \n \n 5\n \nMean\n \n96.51\n \n100 mg/kg CX-5011 IP BID x17 days\n \n \n \n% Dif\n \n2.50\n \n \n \nSD\n \n1.01\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAnimals received 17 doses of Vehicle, Gemzar at 100 mg/kg Q3D or compound at either 60 mg/kg QD intravenous administration or 100 mg/kg BID intraperitoneal administration.

Tumor volume measurements and body weight were recorded on \n \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n \n 1, 4, 7, 11, 13, 15, and 18, and data showed compound A2 significantly inhibited tumor progression (\nFIG. 4A\n) while not significantly altering body weight (\nFIG. 4B\n). Delivery of compound A2 to animals bearing MiaPaca xenografts by IV administration at 50 and 60 mg/kg and by IP administration at 100 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor progression. Also, delivery of compound A2 to animals bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts by IV administration at 30 and 60 mg/kg and by oral administration at 200 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor progression. Delivery of compound A2 to animals bearing MiaPaca xenografts by oral administration at 100 mg/kg QDx8 and 200 mg/kg QDx6 significantly inhibited tumor progression. A meglumine salt of compound A2 at pH 10.0 and at 10 mg/mL was utilized as an oral formulation for the studies.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor pharmacokinetic studies of compound A2 were carried out in which 30 mg/kg of the compound was dosed IV QDx6. Plasma, blood and tumor samples were taken on \n \n \nday\n \n \n 1, 4 and 6 and three animals sacrificed for each time point. Steady state was reached after about three days, the terminal slope decreases, the half life about doubles, the minimum concentration was 4-5 times higher after six days and there were no significant differences between \n \nday\n \n 4 and 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery of compound A3 to animals bearing MiaPaca xenografts by IV administration also significantly inhibited tumor progression.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nModulation of Non-CK2 Protein Kinase Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds described herein are profiled for in vitro modulatory activity against protein kinases other than CK2. The in vitro analysis is conducted using known protocols (e.g., assay protocols described at world-wide web address upstate.com/img/pdf/KP_Assay Protocol_Booklet_v3.pdf). Compounds described herein are screened in the assays and prioritized based upon modulatory activity against protein kinases other than CK2 and specificity for CK2 or PARP.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nEvaluation of Angiogenesis Inhibition by Endothelial Tube Formation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nA human endothelial tube formation assay was performed using the 96-well BD BioCoat™ Angiogenesis System from BD Biosciences, using the manufacturer's recommended protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, HUVEC cells (from ATCC) were suspended in 150 ul of media containing 10% FBS at 4×10\n5 \ncells/ml in each of the 96-wells of the matrigel coated plate in the presence or absence of various concentrations of compound A2. The plate was incubated for 18 hrs at 37° C. The cells were stained with calcein AM and the results visualized by fluorescent microscopy or by phase contrast. It was observed that compound A2 inhibited tube formation in the assay described above over a concentration range of 1 to 5 mM.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nModulation of Protein Kinase Activity in Cell-Free In Vitro Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a PIM-1 assay, test compounds in aqueous solution are added at a volume of 5 ul, to a reaction mixture comprising 5 ul of 5× Reaction buffer (40 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA), 2.5 ul of recombinant human PIM-1 solution (10 ng), 2.5 ul of substrate peptide (KKRNRTLTK) and 10 ul of ATP solution—98% (75 mM MgCl2 37.5 uM ATP) 2% ([γ-33P]ATP: 3000Ci/mmol —Perkin Elmer). The reactions are incubated for 10 min at 30° C., quenched with 100 ul of 0.75% Phosphoric acid, then transferred to and filtered through a Phosphocellulose filter plate (Millipore). After washing each well 5 times with 0.75% Phosphoric acid, Scintilation fluid (15 ul) is added to each well. The residual radioactivity is measured using a luminescence counter. Compound A2 inhibited PIM-1 with IC\n50\n=189 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound A2 was tested further for its activity against other protein kinases. The following kinase inhibition IC\n50 \ndata were determined using standardized radiometric kinase assays for each individual kinase, which entail filter binding of \n33\nP labeled substrate proteins by the kinase of interest.

An antibody preparation according to \nclaim 1\n, wherein the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof neutralises the activity of IGF-1R. Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof that specifically bind human Insulin-like Growth Factor Receptor (hIGF-1R). The present invention also concerns methods of treating diseases or disorders with said antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof and methods of manufacture.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nThe human insulin-like growth factor receptor (also known as IGF-1R, CD221 or EC 2.7.112) is a tyrosine kinase receptor with 70% homology to the insulin receptor. The receptor is activated by two ligands—IGF-I and IGF-II which bind the receptor with high affinity. The receptor is a disulphide linked aβ dimer, denoted (aβ)\n2\n. The α-chain is entirely extracellular whilst the β-chain is membrane-spanning and has both an extracellular domain and an intracellular signalling domain. Ligand-mediated receptor activation triggers intracellular events including activation of MAPK and PI3K-protein kinase B pathways. Whilst IGF-1R is known to have an essential role in normal foetal and postnatal growth and development, it has assumed an important role in cancer biology and has been implicated in a number of biological pathways such as mitogenesis, transformation and protection from apoptosis (reviewed extensively in Baserga et al. (1997, 2003), Hasnain et al. (2000), Larsson et al. (2005), Romano (2003)). Furthermore the levels of receptor expression are known to be up-regulated on a variety of tumours types (reviewed by Khandwala et al. (2000)) and increased levels of the ligand IGF-I are associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer (Chan et al. (1998)). Antagonists of the IGF-1R signalling pathway are known for their anti-tumour effects in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in Hofmann et al. (2005) and Zhang et al. (2004)). Approaches include neutralising antibodies (see Kull et al. (1983) and Li et al, (1993), Xiong et al. (1992), Burtrum et al. (2003), Cohen et al. (2005), Maloney et al. (2003), Jackson-Booth et al. (2003)), anti-sense (see Resnicoff et al. (1994), Lee et al. (1996), Muller et al. (1998), Trojan et al. (1993), Lie et al. (1998), Shapiro et al. (1994)), dominant negative mutants (Prager et al. (1994)) and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (see Hopfner et al. (2006) and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs—see Nickerson et al. (1997)) Known monoclonal antibodies include those described in: WO99/60023, WO03/100008, WO02/053596, WO04/071529, EP0629240B, WO03/059951, WO03/106621, WO04/083248, WO04/087756, US2006452167A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody structures are well known in the art and in particular it is known that the heavy chain constant region has a glycosylated sugar chain, this may be an N-glycoside linked sugar chain for example N-acetylyglucosamine and it may or may not be fucosylated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for measuring levels of fucosylation are well known in the art for example, for a population of antibodies, acid hydrolysis can be used to remove the monosacchharides of the glycosylated sugar chain from the antibody and these can be labelled with a dye such as 2-aminobenzoic acid (2-AA). Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection can then be carried out and a standard curve constructed for sample quantitation. The ratio of fucose to mannose per antibody population can then be calculated\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus there is a need for antibodies with improved effector function, for example with improved ADCC and/or CDC function.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n: Binding of purified murine monoclonal antibodies to human IGF-1R as determined by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2A-E\n: Binding of purified 6E11 chimeric and 6E11 humanised antibodies to human IGF-1R as determined by ELISA.

These are explained later in further detail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogenous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic binding site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Identity,” means, for polynucleotides and polypeptides, as the case may be, the comparison calculated using an algorithm provided in (1) and (2) below:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(1) Identity for polynucleotides is calculated by multiplying the total number of nucleotides in a given sequence by the integer defining the percent identity divided by 100 and then subtracting that product from said total number of nucleotides in said sequence, or:\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nnn≦xn\n−(\nxn·y\n),\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein nn is the number of nucleotide alterations, xn is the total number of nucleotides in a given sequence, y is 0.95 for 95%, 0.97 for 97% or 1.00 for 100%, and · is the symbol for the multiplication operator, and wherein any non-integer product of xn and y is rounded down to the nearest integer prior to subtracting it from xn. Alterations of a polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide may create nonsense, missense or frameshift mutations in this coding sequence and thereby alter the polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotide following such alterations.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(2) Identity for polypeptides is calculated by multiplying the total number of amino acids by the integer defining the percent identity divided by 100 and then subtracting that product from said total number of amino acids, or:\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nna≦xa\n−(\nxa·y\n),\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein na is the number of amino acid alterations, xa is the total number of amino acids in the sequence, y is 0.95 for 95%, 0.97 for 97% or 1.00 for 100%, and · is the symbol for the multiplication operator, and wherein any non-integer product of xa and y is rounded down to the nearest integer prior to subtracting it from xa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Variant(s)” as used herein, refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide that differs from a reference polynucleotide or polypeptide respectively, but retains essential properties. A typical variant of a polynucleotide differs in nucleotide sequence from another, reference polynucleotide. Changes in the nucleotide sequence of the variant may or may not alter the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide encoded by the reference polynucleotide. Nucleotide changes may result in amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions, fusion proteins and truncations in the polypeptide encoded by the reference sequence, as discussed below. A typical variant of a polypeptide differs in amino acid sequence from another, reference polypeptide. Generally, differences are limited so that the sequences of the reference polypeptide and the variant are closely similar overall and, in many regions, identical. A variant and reference polypeptide may differ in amino acid sequence by one or more substitutions, additions, deletions in any combination. A substituted or inserted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code. It is well recognised in the art that certain amino acid substitutions are regarded as being “conservative”. Amino acids are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties and substitutions within groups that maintain all or substantially all of the binding affinity of the antibody of the invention or antigen binding fragment thereof are regarded as conservative substitutions, see table below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSide chain\n\n\nMembers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHydrophobic\n\n\nmet, ala, val, leu, ile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nneutral hydrophilic\n\n\ncys, ser, thr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAcidic\n\n\nasp, glu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBasic\n\n\nasn, gln, his, lys, arg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nresidues that influence chain orientation\n\n\ngly, pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAromatic\n\n\ntrp, tyr, phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some aspects of the invention variants in which several, for example 5-10, 1-5, 1-3, 1-2 amino acid residues or 1 amino acid residue are substituted, deleted, or added in any combination may be included. A variant of a polynucleotide or polypeptide may be a naturally occurring such as an allelic variant, or it may be a variant that is not known to occur naturally. Non-naturally occurring variants of polynucleotides and polypeptides may be made by mutagenesis techniques, by direct synthesis, and by other recombinant methods known to skilled artisans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Isolated” means altered “by the hand of man” from its natural state, has been changed or removed from its original environment, or both. For example, a polynucleotide or a polypeptide naturally present in a living organism is not “isolated,” but the same polynucleotide or polypeptide separated from the coexisting materials of its natural state is “isolated”, including but not limited to when such polynucleotide or polypeptide is introduced back into a cell, even if the cell is of the same species or type as that from which the polynucleotide or polypeptide was separated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout the present specification and the accompanying claims the term “comprising” and “comprises” incorporates “consisting of” and “consists of”. That is, these words are intended to convey the possible inclusion of other elements or integers not specifically recited, where the context allows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “glycosylation profile” as used herein refers to the levels of glycosylation in an antibody population.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “specifically binds” as used throughout the present specification in relation to antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof of the invention means that the antibody binds human IGF-1R (hIGF-1R) with no or insignificant binding to other human proteins. The term however does not exclude the fact that antibodies of the invention may also be cross-reactive with other forms of IGF-1R, for example primate IGF-1R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “neutralises” as used throughout the present specification in relation to antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof of the invention means that the biological activity of IGF-1R is reduced in the presence of the antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof of the present invention in comparison to the activity of IGF-1R in the absence of such antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof. Neutralisation may be due to but not limited to one or more of blocking ligand binding, preventing the ligand activating the receptor, down regulating the IGF-1R or affecting effector functionality. Levels of neutralisation can be measured in several ways, for example by use of the assays as set out in the examples below, for example in a LISN cell proliferation assay which may be carried out for example as described in Example 23. The neutralisation of IGF-1R in this assay is measured by assessing the decreased tumour cell proliferation in the presence of neutralising antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLevels of neutralisation can also be measured, for example in a receptor phosphorylation assay which may be carried out for example as described in Example 13. The neutralisation of IGF-1R in this assay is measured by assessing the inhibition of receptor phosphorylation in the presence of neutralising antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof is capable of neutralisation then this is indicative of inhibition of the interaction between human IGF-1R binding proteins for example hIGF-I or hIGF-II and its receptor. Antibodies which are considered to have neutralising activity against human IGF-1R would have an IC\n50 \nof less than 10 micrograms/ml, or less than 5 micrograms/ml, or less than 2 micrograms/ml, or less than 1 microgram/ml in the LISN cell proliferation assay or receptor phosphorylation assay as set out in Examples 23 and Example 13 respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative aspect of the present invention there is provided antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof which have equivalent neutralising activity to the antibodies exemplified herein, for example antibodies which retain the neutralising activity of H0L0 and H0L0 IgG1m(AA) and H1L0 and H10L0 IgG1m(AA) in the LISN cell proliferation assay or receptor phosphorylation assay as set out in Examples 23 and 13 respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout this specification, amino acid residues in antibody sequences are numbered according to the Kabat scheme. Similarly, the terms “CDR”, “CDRL1”, “CDRL2”, “CDRL3”, “CDRH1”, “CDRH2”, “CDRH3” follow the Kabat numbering system as set forth in Kabat et al; Sequences of proteins of Immunological Interest NIH, 1987. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that there are alternative definitions of CDR sequences such as for example those set out in Chothia et al. (1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the term “derived” is intended to define not only the source in the sense of it being the physical origin for the material but also to define material which is structurally identical (in terms of primary amino acid sequence) to the material but which does not originate from the reference source. Thus “residues found in the donor antibody from which CDRH3 is derived” need not necessarily have been purified from the donor antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “chimeric antibody” refers to a type of engineered antibody which contains a naturally-occurring variable domain (light chain and heavy chains) derived from a donor antibody in association with light and heavy chain constant regions derived from an acceptor antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “humanised antibody” refers to a type of engineered antibody having its CDRs derived from a non-human donor immunoglobulin, the remaining immunoglobulin-derived parts of the molecule being derived from one (or more) human immunoglobulin(s). In addition, framework support residues may be altered to preserve binding affinity (see, e.g., Queen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci USA, 86:10029-10032 (1989), Hodgson et al., Bio/Technology, 9:421 (1991)). A suitable human acceptor antibody may be one selected from a conventional database, e.g., the KABAT® database, Los Alamos database, and Swiss Protein database, by homology to the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the donor antibody. A human antibody characterized by a homology to the framework regions of the donor antibody (on an amino acid basis) may be suitable to provide a heavy chain constant region and/or a heavy chain variable framework region for insertion of the donor CDRs. A suitable acceptor antibody capable of donating light chain constant or variable framework regions may be selected in a similar manner. It should be noted that the acceptor antibody heavy and light chains are not required to originate from the same acceptor antibody. The prior art describes several ways of producing such humanised antibodies—see for example EP-A-0239400 and EP-A-054951.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “donor antibody” refers to an antibody (monoclonal, and/or recombinant) which contributes the amino acid sequences of its variable domains, CDRs, or other functional fragments or analogs thereof to a first immunoglobulin partner, so as to provide the altered immunoglobulin coding region and resulting expressed altered antibody with the antigenic specificity and neutralizing activity characteristic of the donor antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “acceptor antibody” refers to an antibody (monoclonal and/or recombinant) heterologous to the donor antibody, which contributes all (or any portion, but preferably all) of the amino acid sequences encoding its heavy and/or light chain framework regions and/or its heavy and/or light chain constant regions to the first immunoglobulin partner. The human antibody is the acceptor antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“CDRs” are defined as the complementarity determining region amino acid sequences of an antibody which are the hypervariable domains of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. See, e.g., Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 4th Ed., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (1987). There are three heavy chain and three light chain CDRs (or CDR regions) in the variable portion of an immunoglobulin. Thus, “CDRs” as used herein refers to all three heavy chain CDRs, or all three light chain CDRs (or both all heavy and all light chain CDRs, if appropriate). The structure and protein folding of the antibody may mean that other residues are considered part of the antigen binding region and would be understood to be so by a skilled person. See for example Chothia et al., (1989) Conformations of immunoglobulin hypervariable domains; Nature 342, p 877-883.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDRs provide the majority of contact residues for the binding of the antibody to the antigen or epitope. CDRs of interest in this invention are derived from donor antibody variable heavy and light chain sequences, and include analogs of the naturally occurring CDRs, which analogs also share or retain the same antigen binding specificity and/or neutralizing ability as the donor antibody from which they were derived.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “V\nH\n” and “V\n6\n” are used herein to refer to the heavy chain variable domain and light chain variable domain respectively of an antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Effector Function” as used herein is meant to refer to one or more of Antibody dependant cell mediated cytotoxic activity (ADCC) and complement-dependant cytotoxic activity (CDC) mediated responses, Fc-mediated phagocytosis and antibody recycling via the FcRn receptor. The interaction between the constant region of an antibody and various Fc receptors (FcR) is believed to mediate the effector functions of the antibody. Significant biological effects can be a consequence of effector functionality, in particular, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), fixation of complement (complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC), phagocytosis (antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis or ADCP) and half-life/clearance of the antibody. Usually, the ability to mediate effector function requires binding of the antibody to an antigen and not all antibodies will mediate every effector function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffector function can be measured in a number of ways including for example via binding of the FcγRIII to Natural Killer cells or via FcγRI to monocytes/macrophages to measure for ADCC effector function. For example the antibody or antigen binding fragment of the present invention has an increased ADCC effector function when measured against the equivalent wild type antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof in a Natural Killer cell assay. Examples of such assays can be found in Shields et al, 2001 The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 276, p 6591-6604; Chappel et al, 1993 The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol 268, p 25124-25131; Lazar et al, 2006 PNAS, 103; 4005-4010.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of assays to determine CDC function include that described in 1995 J Imm Meth 184:29-38.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious modifications to the heavy chain constant region of antibodies may be carried out depending on the desired effector property. Human constant regions which essentially lack the functions of a) activation of complement by the classical pathway; and b) mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity include the IgG4 constant region and the IgG2 constant region. IgG1 constant regions containing specific mutations have separately been described to reduce binding to Fc receptors and therefore reduce ADCC and CDC (Duncan et al. Nature 1988, 332; 563-564; Lund et al. J. Immunol. 1991, 147; 2657-2662; Chappel et al. PNAS 1991, 88; 9036-9040; Burton and Woof, Adv. Immunol. 1992, 51; 1-84; Morgan et al., Immunology 1995, 86; 319-324; Hezareh et al., J. Virol. 2001, 75 (24); 12161-12168). Human IgG1 constant regions containing specific mutations or altered glycosylation on residue Asn297 have also been described to enhance binding to Fc receptors. These have also been shown to enhance ADCC and CDC, in some cases (Lazar et al. \nPNAS\n 2006, 103; 4005-4010; Shields et al. J Biol Chem 2001, 276; 6591-6604; Nechansky et al. Mol Immunol, 2007, 44; 1815-1817).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor IgG antibodies, effector functionalities including ADCC and ADCP are mediated by the interaction of the heavy chain constant region with a family of Fcγ receptors present on the surface of immune cells. In humans these include FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32) and FcγRIII (CD16). Interaction between the antibody bound to antigen and the formation of the Fc/Fcγ complex induces a range of effects including cytotoxicity, immune cell activation, phagocytosis and release of inflammatory cytokines. Specific substitutions in the constant region (including S239D/I332E) are know to increase the affinity of the heavy chain constant region for certain Fc receptors, thus enhancing the effector functionality of the antibody (Lazar et al. PNAS 2006).\n\n\n \n1. Antibody Structures\n\n\n1.1 Intact Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nIntact antibodies include heteromultimeric glycoproteins comprising at least two heavy and two light chains. Aside from IgM, intact antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of approximately 150 Kda, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Typically, each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes varies. Each heavy and light chain also has intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V\nH\n) followed by a number of constant regions (CH\n1\n, CH\n2\n, CH\n3\n). Each light chain has a variable domain (V\nL\n) and a constant region at its other end; the heavy chain constant region of the light chain is aligned with the first constant region of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. The light chains of antibodies from most vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two types called Kappa and Lambda based on the amino acid sequence of the constant region. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain constant region of their heavy chains, human antibodies can be assigned to five different classes, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. IgG and IgA can be further subdivided into subclasses, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4; and IgA1 and IgA2. Species variants exist with mouse and rat having at least IgG2a, IgG2b. The variable domain of the antibody confers binding specificity upon the antibody with certain regions displaying particular variability called complementarity determining regions (CDRs). The more conserved portions of the variable domain are called Framework regions (FR). The variable domains of intact heavy and light chains each comprise four FR connected by three CDRs. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies. The constant regions are not directly involved in the binding of the antibody to the antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation in antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis via binding to Fcγ receptor, half-life/clearance rate via neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and complement dependent cytotoxicity via the C1q component of the complement cascade.\n\n\n \n1.1.2 Human Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman antibodies may be produced by a number of methods known to those of skill in the art. Human antibodies can be made by the hybridoma method using human myeloma or mouse-human heteromyeloma cells lines see Kozbor J. Immunol 133, 3001, (1984) and Brodeur, \nMonoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications\n, pp 51-63 (Marcel Dekker Inc, 1987). Alternative methods include the use of phage libraries or transgenic mice both of which utilize human variable domain repertories (see Winter G, (1994), Annu. Rev. Immunol 12, 433-455, Green L L (1999), J. Immunol. methods 231, 11-23).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral strains of transgenic mice are now available wherein their mouse immunoglobulin loci has been replaced with human immunoglobulin gene segments (see Tomizuka K, (2000) PNAS 97, 722-727; Fishwild D. M (1996) Nature Biotechnol. 14, 845-851, Mendez M J, 1997, Nature Genetics, 15, 146-156). Upon antigen challenge such mice are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies from which antibodies of interest can be selected. Of particular note is the Trimera™ system (see Eren R et al, (1998) Immunology 93:154-161) where human lymphocytes are transplanted into irradiated mice, the Selected Lymphocyte Antibody System (SLAM, see Babcook et al, PNAS (1996) 93:7843-7848) where human (or other species) lymphocytes are effectively put through a massive pooled in vitro antibody generation procedure followed by deconvulated, limiting dilution and selection procedure and the Xenomouse II™ (Abgenix Inc). An alternative approach is available from Morphotek Inc using the Morphodoma™ technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display technology can be used to produce human antibodies (and fragments thereof), see McCafferty; Nature, 348, 552-553 (1990) and Griffiths A D et al (1994) EMBO 13:3245-3260. According to this technique antibody variable domain genes are cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat of protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M13 or fd and displayed (usually with the aid of a helper phage) as functional antigen binding fragments thereof on the surface of the phage particle. Selections based on the functional properties of the antibody result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. The phage display technique can be used to select antigen specific antibodies from libraries made from human B cells taken from individuals afflicted with a disease or disorder described above or alternatively from unimmunized human donors (see Marks; J. Mol. Bio. 222, 581-597, 1991). Where an intact human antibody is desired comprising a constant domain it is necessary to reclone the phage displayed derived fragment into a mammalian expression vectors comprising the desired constant regions and establishing stable expressing cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe technique of affinity maturation (Marks; Bio/\ntechnol\n 10, 779-783 (1992)) may be used to improve binding affinity wherein the affinity of the primary human antibody is improved by sequentially replacing the H and L chain variable domains with naturally occurring variants and selecting on the basis of improved binding affinities. Variants of this technique such as “epitope imprinting” are now also available see WO 93/06213. See also Waterhouse; Nucl. \nAcids Res\n 21, 2265-2266 (1993).\n\n\n \n1.2 Chimaeric and Humanised Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe use of intact non-human antibodies in the treatment of human diseases or disorders carries with it the potential for the now well established problems of immunogenicity, that is the immune system of the patient may recognise the non-human intact antibody as non-self and mount a neutralising response. This is particularly evident upon multiple administration of the non-human antibody to a human patient. Various techniques have been developed over the years to overcome these problems and generally involve reducing the composition of non-human amino acid sequences in the intact antibody whilst retaining the relative ease in obtaining non-human antibodies from an immunised animal e.g. mouse, rat or rabbit. Broadly two approaches have been used to achieve this. The first are chimaeric antibodies, which generally comprise a non-human (e.g. rodent such as mouse) variable domain fused to a human constant region. Because the antigen-binding site of an antibody is localised within the variable domains the chimaeric antibody retains its binding affinity for the antigen but acquires the effector functions of the human constant region and are therefore able to perform effector functions such as described supra. Chimaeric antibodies are typically produced using recombinant DNA methods. DNA encoding the antibodies (e.g. cDNA) is isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the H and L chains of the antibody of the invention. Hybridoma cells serve as a typical source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA is placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE. Coli\n, COS cells, CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain synthesis of the antibody. The DNA may be modified by substituting the coding sequence for human L and H chains for the corresponding non-human (e.g. murine) H and L constant regions see e.g. Morrison; PNAS 81, 6851 (1984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second approach involves the generation of humanised antibodies wherein the non-human content of the antibody is reduced by humanizing the variable domains. Two techniques for humanisation have gained popularity. The first is humanisation by CDR grafting. CDRs build loops close to the antibody's N-terminus where they form a surface mounted in a scaffold provided by the framework regions. Antigen-binding specificity of the antibody is mainly defined by the topography and by the chemical characteristics of its CDR surface. These features are in turn determined by the conformation of the individual CDRs, by the relative disposition of the CDRs, and by the nature and disposition of the side chains of the residues comprising the CDRs. A large decrease in immunogenicity can be achieved by grafting only the CDRs of a non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies (“donor” antibodies) onto human framework (“acceptor framework”) and constant regions (see Jones et al (1986) Nature 321, 522-525 and Verhoeyen M et al (1988) Science 239, 1534-1536). However, CDR grafting per se may not result in the complete retention of antigen-binding properties and it is frequently found that some framework residues (sometimes referred to as “back mutations”) of the donor antibody need to be preserved in the humanised molecule if significant antigen-binding affinity is to be recovered (see Queen C et al (1989) PNAS 86, 10,029-10,033, Co, M et al (1991) Nature 351, 501-502). In this case, human variable domains showing the greatest sequence homology to the non-human donor antibody are chosen from a database in order to provide the human framework (FR). The selection of human FRs can be made either from human consensus or individual human antibodies. Where necessary key residues from the donor antibody are substituted into the human acceptor framework to preserve CDR conformations. Computer modelling of the antibody maybe used to help identify such structurally important residues, see WO99/48523.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, humanisation maybe achieved by a process of “veneering”. A statistical analysis of unique human and murine immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable domains revealed that the precise patterns of exposed residues are different in human and murine antibodies, and most individual surface positions have a strong preference for a small number of different residues (see Padlan E. A. et al; (1991) Mol. Immunol. 28, 489-498 and Pedersen J. T. et al (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 235; 959-973). Therefore it is possible to reduce the immunogenicity of a non-human Fv by replacing exposed residues in its framework regions that differ from those usually found in human antibodies. Because protein antigenicity may be correlated with surface accessibility, replacement of the surface residues may be sufficient to render the mouse variable domain “invisible” to the human immune system (see also Mark G. E. et al (1994) in Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology vol. 113: The pharmacology of monoclonal Antibodies, Springer-Verlag, pp 105-134). This procedure of humanisation is referred to as “veneering” because only the surface of the antibody is altered, the supporting residues remain undisturbed.\n\n\n \n1.3 Bispecific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nA bispecific antibody is an antibody having binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Methods of making such antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin H chain-L chain pairs, where the two H chains have different binding specificities see Millstein et al, Nature 305 537-539 (1983), WO93/08829 and Traunecker et al EMBO, 10, 1991, 3655-3659. Because of the random assortment of H and L chains, a potential mixture of ten different antibody structures are produced of which only one has the desired binding specificity. An alternative approach involves fusing the variable domains with the desired binding specificities to heavy chain constant region comprising at least part of the hinge region, CH2 and CH3 regions. In one embodiment the CH1 region containing the site necessary for light chain binding is present in at least one of the fusions. DNA encoding these fusions, and if desired the L chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are then co-transfected into a suitable host organism. It is possible though to insert the coding sequences for two or all three chains into one expression vector. In one approach, the bispecific antibody is composed of a H chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a H-L chain pair, providing a second binding specificity in the other arm, see WO94/04690. Also see Suresh et al Methods in Enzymology 121, 210, 1986.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention there is provided a bispecific antibody wherein at least one binding specificity of said antibody is for hIGF-1R, and said antibody neutralises the activity of hIGF-1R. Such antibodies may further comprise a human constant region of the IgG isotype, e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4. Antibodies of the present invention may also be multispecific, for example multispecific antibodies formed by assembly of a number of antigen-binding fragments.\n\n\n \n1.4 Antigen Binding Fragments\n\n\n \n \n \nSuch antigen binding fragments comprise a partial heavy or light chain variable sequence (e.g., minor deletions at the amino or carboxy terminus of the immunoglobulin variable domain) which retains the same antigen binding specificity and the same or similar neutralizing ability as the antibody from which the fragment was derived.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention there is provided antigen binding fragments which neutralise the activity of hIGF-1R. Such fragments may be functional antigen binding fragments of intact and/or humanised and/or chimaeric antibodies such as Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, ScFv fragments of the antibodies described supra. Traditionally such fragments are produced by the proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies by e.g. papain digestion (see for example, WO 94/29348) but may be produced directly from recombinantly transformed host cells. For the production of ScFv, see Bird et al; (1988) Science, 242, 423-426. In addition, antigen binding fragments may be produced using a variety of engineering techniques as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFv fragments appear to have lower interaction energy of their two chains than Fab fragments. To stabilise the association of the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains, they have been linked with peptides (Bird et al, (1988) Science 242, 423-426, Huston et al, PNAS, 85, 5879-5883), disulphide bridges (Glockshuber et al, (1990) Biochemistry, 29, 1362-1367) and “knob in hole” mutations (Zhu et al (1997), Protein Sci., 6, 781-788). ScFv fragments can be produced by methods well known to those skilled in the art see Whitlow et al (1991) Methods companion Methods Enzymol, 2, 97-105 and Huston et al (1993) \nInt. Rev. Immunol\n 10, 195-217. ScFv may be produced in bacterial cells such as \nE. Coli \nbut are more preferably produced in eukaryotic cells. One disadvantage of ScFv is the monovalency of the product, which precludes an increased avidity due to polyvalent binding, and their short half-life. Attempts to overcome these problems include bivalent (ScFv′)\n2 \nproduced from ScFV containing an additional C terminal cysteine by chemical coupling (Adams et al (1993) Can. Res 53, 4026-4034 and McCartney et al (1995) Protein Eng. 8, 301-314) or by spontaneous site-specific dimerization of ScFv containing an unpaired C terminal cysteine residue (see Kipriyanov et al (1995) Cell. Biophys 26, 187-204). Alternatively, ScFv can be forced to form multimers by shortening the peptide linker to 3 to 12 residues to form “diabodies”, see Holliger et al PNAS (1993), 90, 6444-6448. Reducing the linker still further can result in ScFV trimers (“triabodies”, see Kortt et al (1997) Protein Eng, 10, 423-433) and tetramers (“tetrabodies”, see Le Gall et al (1999) FEBS Lett, 453, 164-168). Construction of bivalent ScFV molecules can also be achieved by genetic fusion with protein dimerizing motifs to form “miniantibodies” (see Pack et al (1992) Biochemistry 31, 1579-1584) and “minibodies” (see Hu et al (1996), Cancer Res. 56, 3055-3061). ScFv-Sc-Fv tandems ((ScFV)2) may also be produced by linking two ScFv units by a third peptide linker, see Kurucz et al (1995) J. Immol. 154, 4576-4582. Bispecific diabodies can be produced through the noncovalent association of two single chain fusion products consisting of V\nH \ndomain from one antibody connected by a short linker to the V\nL \ndomain of another antibody, see Kipriyanov et al (1998), Int. J. Can 77, 763-772. The stability of such bispecific diabodies can be enhanced by the introduction of disulphide bridges or “knob in hole” mutations as described supra or by the formation of single chain diabodies (ScDb) wherein two hybrid ScFv fragments are connected through a peptide linker see Kontermann et al (1999) J. Immunol. Methods 226 179-188. Tetravalent bispecific molecules are available by e.g. fusing a ScFv fragment to the CH3 domain of an IgG molecule or to a Fab fragment through the hinge region see Coloma et al (1997) Nature Biotechnol. 15, 159-163. Alternatively, tetravalent bispecific molecules have been created by the fusion of bispecific single chain diabodies (see Alt et al, (1999) FEBS Lett 454, 90-94. Smaller tetravalent bispecific molecules can also be formed by the dimerization of either ScFv-ScFv tandems with a linker containing a helix-loop-helix motif (DiBi miniantibodies, see Muller et al (1998) FEBS Lett 432, 45-49) or a single chain molecule comprising four antibody variable domains (V\nH \nand V\nL\n) in an orientation preventing intramolecular pairing (tandem diabody, see Kipriyanov et al, (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 293, 41-56). Bispecific F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments can be created by chemical coupling of Fab′ fragments or by heterodimerization through leucine zippers (see Shalaby et al, (1992) J. Exp. Med. 175, 217-225 and Kostelny et al (1992), J. Immunol. 148, 1547-1553). Also available are isolated V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains (Domantis plc), see U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,516; U.S. Pat. No. 6,291,158; U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,197.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment there is provided an antigen binding fragment (e.g. ScFv, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n) or an engineered antigen binding fragment as described supra that specifically binds hIGF-1R neutralises the activity of hIGF-1R. The antigen binding fragment may comprise one or more of the following sequences CDRH3 as set out in SEQ. ID. NO: 1, CDRH2 as set out in SEQ. ID. NO: 2, CDRH1 as set out in SEQ. ID. NO: 3, CDRL1 as set out in SEQ. ID. NO: 4, CDRL2 as set out in SEQ. ID. NO: 5, and CDRL3 as set out in SEQ. ID. NO: 6.\n\n\n \n1.5 Heteroconjugate Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nHeteroconjugate antibodies also form an embodiment of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies formed using any convenient cross-linking methods. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.\n\n\n \n1.6 Other Modifications.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe interaction between the constant region of an antibody and various Fc receptors (FcγR) is believed to mediate the effector functions of the antibody which include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), fixation of complement, phagocytosis and half-life/clearance of the antibody. Various modifications to the constant region of antibodies of the invention may be carried out depending on the desired property. For example, specific mutations in the constant region to render an otherwise lytic antibody, non-lytic is detailed in EP 0629 240B1 and EP 0307 434B2 or one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody to increase serum half life see U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277. There are five currently recognised human Fcγ receptors, FcγR (I), FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa and neonatal FcRn. Shields et al, (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 6591-6604 demonstrated that a common set of IgG1 residues is involved in binding all FcγRs, while FcγRII and FcγRIII utilize distinct sites outside of this common set. One group of IgG1 residues reduced binding to all FcγRs when altered to alanine: Pro-238, Asp-265, Asp-270, Asn-297 and Pro-239. All are in the IgG CH2 domain and clustered near the hinge joining CH1 and CH2. While FcγRI utilizes only the common set of IgG1 residues for binding, FcγRII and FcγRIII interact with distinct residues in addition to the common set. Alteration of some residues reduced binding only to FcγRII (e.g. Arg-292) or FcγRIII (e.g. Glu-293). Some variants showed improved binding to FcγRII or FcγRIII but did not affect binding to the other receptor (e.g. Ser-267Ala improved binding to FcγRII but binding to FcγRIII was unaffected). Other variants exhibited improved binding to FcγRII or FcγRIII with reduction in binding to the other receptor (e.g. Ser-298Ala improved binding to FcγRIII and reduced binding to FcγRII). For FcγRIIIa, the best binding IgG1 variants had combined alanine substitutions at Ser-298, Glu-333 and Lys-334. The neonatal FcRn receptor is believed to be involved in both antibody clearance and the transcytosis across tissues (see Junghans R. P (1997) Immunol. \nRes\n 16. 29-57 and Ghetie et al (2000) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 18, 739-766). Human IgG1 residues determined to interact directly with human FcRn includes Ile253, Ser254, Lys288, Thr307, Gln311, Asn434 and His435. Switches at any of these positions described in this section may enable increased serum half-life and/or altered effector properties of antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications include glycosylation variants of the antibodies of the invention. Glycosylation of antibodies at conserved positions in their constant regions is known to have a profound effect on antibody function, particularly effector functioning such as those described above, see for example, Boyd et al (1996), Mol. Immunol. 32, 1311-1318. Glycosylation variants of the antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof of the present invention wherein one or more carbohydrate moiety is added, substituted, deleted or modified are contemplated. Introduction of an asparagine-X-serine or asparagine-X-threonine motif creates a potential site for enzymatic attachment of carbohydrate moieties and may therefore be used to manipulate the glycosylation of an antibody. In Raju et al (2001) \nBiochemistry\n 40, 8868-8876 the terminal sialyation of a TNFR-IgG immunoadhesin was increased through a process of regalactosylation and/or resialylation using beta-1,4-galactosyltransferace and/or alpha, 2,3 sialyltransferase. Increasing the terminal sialylation is believed to increase the half-life of the immunoglobulin. Antibodies, in common with most glycoproteins, are typically produced as a mixture of glycoforms. This mixture is particularly apparent when antibodies are produced in eukaryotic, particularly mammalian cells. A variety of methods have been developed to manufacture defined glycoforms, see Zhang et al Science (2004), 303, 371, Sears et al, Science, (2001) 291, 2344, Wacker et al (2002) Science, 298 1790, Davis et al (2002) Chem. Rev. 102, 579, Hang et al (2001) Acc. Chem. Res 34, 727. Thus the invention contemplates a plurality of (monoclonal) antibodies (which maybe of the IgG isotype, e.g. IgG1) as herein described comprising a defined number (e.g. 7 or less, for example 5 or less such as two or a single) glycoform(s) of said antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther embodiments of the invention include antibodies of the invention or antigen binding fragments thereof coupled to a non-proteinaeous polymer such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol or polyoxyalkylene. Conjugation of proteins to PEG is an established technique for increasing half-life of proteins, as well as reducing antigenicity and immunogenicity of proteins. The use of PEGylation with different molecular weights and styles (linear or branched) has been investigated with intact antibodies as well as Fab′ fragments, see Koumenis I. L. et al (2000) Int. J. Pharmaceut. 198:83-95.\n\n\n \n2. Production Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies of the invention maybe produced as a polyclonal population but are more preferably produced as a monoclonal population (that is as a substantially homogenous population of identical antibodies directed against a specific antigenic binding site). It will of course be apparent to those skilled in the art that a population implies more than one antibody entity. Antibodies of the present invention may be produced in transgenic organisms such as goats (see Pollock et al (1999), J. Immunol. Methods 231:147-157), chickens (see Morrow K J J (2000) Genet. Eng. News 20:1-55, mice (see Pollock et al) or plants (see Doran P M, (2000) Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 11, 199-204, Ma J K-C (1998), Nat. Med. 4; 601-606, Baez J et al, BioPharm (2000) 13: 50-54, Stoger E et al; (2000) Plant Mol. Biol. 42:583-590). Antibodies may also be produced by chemical synthesis. However, antibodies of the invention are typically produced using recombinant cell culturing technology well known to those skilled in the art. A polynucleotide encoding the antibody is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector such as a plasmid for further cloning (amplification) or expression. One useful expression system is a glutamate synthetase system (such as sold by Lonza Biologics), particularly where the host cell is CHO or NS0 (see below). Polynucleotide encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. oligonucleotide probes). Vectors that may be used include plasmid, virus, phage, transposons, minichromsomes of which plasmids are a typical embodiment. Generally such vectors further include a signal sequence, origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter and transcription termination sequences operably linked to the light and/or heavy chain polynucleotide so as to facilitate expression. Polynucleotide encoding the light and heavy chains may be inserted into separate vectors and transfected into the same host cell or, if desired both the heavy chain and light chain can be inserted into the same vector for transfection into the host cell. Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a process of constructing a vector encoding the light and/or heavy chains of an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof of the invention, which method comprises inserting into a vector, a polynucleotide encoding either a light chain and/or heavy chain of an antibody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is known to those skilled in the art that synthetic genes, which encode the same protein as a naturally occurring or wild type gene, may be designed by changing the codons that are used in the gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese design techniques involve replacing those codons in a gene that are rarely used in mammalian genes with codons that are more frequently used for that amino acid in mammalian gene. This process, called codon optimisation, is used with the intent that the total level of protein produced by the host cell is greater when transfected with the codon-optimised gene in comparison with the level when transfected with the wild-type sequence. Several method have been published (Nakamura et. al., Nucleic Acids Research 1996,24: 214-215; WO98/34640; WO97/11086).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCodon frequencies can be derived from literature sources for the highly expressed genes of many species (see e.g. Nakamura et al. Nucleic Acids Research 1996,24 : 214-215). Codon usage tables for human (have also been published (WO2005025614).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be immediately apparent to those skilled in the art that due to the redundancy of the genetic code, alternative polynucleotides to those disclosed herein (particularly those codon optimised for expression in a given host cell) are also available that will encode the polypeptides of the invention.\n\n\n \n3.1 Signal Sequences\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention may be produced as a fusion protein with a heterologous signal sequence having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein. The signal sequence should be recognised and processed by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells, the signal sequence may be for example an alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, or heat stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the signal sequences may be for example a yeast invertase leader, α factor leader or acid phosphatase leaders see e.g. WO90/13646. In mammalian cell systems, viral secretory leaders such as herpes simplex gD signal and a native immunoglobulin signal sequence may be suitable. Typically the signal sequence is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the antibody of the invention.\n\n\n \n3.2 Origin of Replication\n\n\n \n \n \nOrigin of replications are well known in the art with pBR322 suitable for most gram-negative bacteria, 2μ plasmid for most yeast and various viral origins such as SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV for most mammalian cells. Generally the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors but the SV40 may be used since it contains the early promoter.\n\n\n \n3.3 Selection Marker\n\n\n \n \n \nTypical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate or tetracycline or (b) complement auxiotrophic deficiencies or supply nutrients not available in the complex media. The selection scheme may involve arresting growth of the host cell. Cells, which have been successfully transformed with the genes encoding the antibody of the present invention, survive due to e.g. drug resistance conferred by the selection marker. Another example is the so-called DHFR selection marker wherein transformants are cultured in the presence of methotrexate. In typical embodiments, cells are cultured in the presence of increasing amounts of methotrexate to amplify the copy number of the exogenous gene of interest. CHO cells are a particularly useful cell line for the DHFR selection. A further example is the glutamate synthetase expression system (Lonza Biologics). A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene, see Stinchcomb et al Nature 282, 38, 1979.\n\n\n \n3.4 Promoters\n\n\n \n \n \nSuitable promoters for expressing antibodies of the invention are operably linked to DNA/polynucleotide encoding the antibody. Promoters for prokaryotic hosts include phoA promoter, Beta-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, tryptophan and hybrid promoters such as Tac. Promoters suitable for expression in yeast cells include 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes e.g. enolase, \nglyceralderhyde\n 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose 6 phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase and glucokinase. Inducible yeast promoters include \nalcohol dehydrogenase\n 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, metallothionein and enzymes responsible for nitrogen metabolism or maltose/galactose utilization. Promoters for expression in mammalian cell systems include viral promoters such as polyoma, fowlpox and adenoviruses (e.g. adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus (in particular the immediate early gene promoter), retrovirus, hepatitis B virus, actin, rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter and the early or \nlate Simian virus\n 40. Of course the choice of promoter is based upon suitable compatibility with the host cell used for expression. In one embodiment therefore there is provided a first plasmid comprising a RSV and/or SV40 and/or CMV promoter, DNA encoding light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) of the invention, κC region together with neomycin and ampicillin resistance selection markers and a second plasmid comprising a RSV or SV40 promoter, DNA encoding the heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) of the invention, DNA encoding the γ1 constant region, DHFR and ampicillin resistance markers\n\n\n \n3.5 Enhancer Element\n\n\n \n \n \nWhere appropriate, e.g. for expression in higher eukaroytics, an enhancer element operably linked to the promoter element in a vector may be used. Suitable mammalian enhancer sequences include enhancer elements from globin, elastase, albumin, fetoprotein and insulin. Alternatively, one may use an enhancer element from a eukaroytic cell virus such as SV40 enhancer (at bp 100-270), cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, polyma enhancer, baculoviral enhancer or murine IgG2a locus (see WO04/009823). The enhancer may be located on the vector at a site upstream to the promoter.\n\n\n \n3.5.5—Polyadenylation Signals\n\n\n \n \n \nIn eukaryotic systems, polyadenylation signals are operably linked to DNA/polynucleotide encoding the antibody of this invention. Such signals are typically placed 3′ of the open reading frame. In mammalian systems, non-limiting example include signals derived from growth hormones, elongation factor-1 alpha and viral (eg SV40) genes or retroviral long terminal repeats. In yeast systems non-limiting examples of polydenylation/termination signals include those derived from the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and the alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH) genes. In prokaryotic system polyadenylation signals are typically not required and it is instead usual to employ shorter and more defined terminator sequences. Of course the choice of polyadenylation/termination sequences is based upon suitable compatibility with the host cell used for expression.\n\n\n \n3.6 Host Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nSuitable host cells for cloning or expressing vectors encoding antibodies of the invention are prokaroytic, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Suitable prokaryotic cells include eubacteria e.g. enterobacteriaceae such as \nEscherichia \ne.g. \nE. Coli \n(for example ATCC 31,446; 31,537; 27,325), \nEnterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella Proteus, Salmonella \ne.g. \nSalmonella typhimurium, Serratia \ne.g. \nSerratia marcescans \nand \nShigella \nas well as Bacilli such as \nB. subtilis \nand \nB. licheniformis \n(see DD 266 710), \nPseudomonas \nsuch as \nP. aeruginosa \nand \nStreptomyces\n. Of the yeast host cells, \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces \n(e.g. ATCC 16,045; 12,424; 24178; 56,500), \nyarrowia \n(EP402, 226), \nPichia Pastoris \n(EP183, 070, see also Peng et al J. Biotechnol. 108 (2004) 185-192), \nCandida, Trichoderma reesia \n(EP244, 234), \nPenicillin, Tolypocladium \nand \nAspergillus \nhosts such as \nA. nidulans \nand \nA. niger \nare also contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough Prokaryotic and yeast host cells are specifically contemplated by the invention, host cells of the present invention are higher eukaryotic cells. Suitable higher eukaryotic host cells include mammalian cells such as COS-1 (ATCC NO: CRL 1650) COS-7 (ATCC CRL 1651), human embryonic kidney line 293, baby hamster kidney cells (BHK) (ATCC CRL. 1632), BHK570 (ATCC NO: CRL 10314), 293 (ATCC NO: CRL 1573), Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO (e.g. CHO-K1, ATCC NO: CCL 61, DHFR-CHO cell line such as DG44 (see Urlaub et al, (1986) Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 12, 555-556)), particularly those CHO cell lines adapted for suspension culture, mouse sertoli cells, monkey kidney cells, African green monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL-1587), HELA cells, canine kidney cells (ATCC CCL 34), human lung cells (ATCC CCL 75), Hep G2 and myeloma or lymphoma cells e.g. NS0 (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,715), Sp2/0, Y0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus in one embodiment of the invention there is provided a stably transformed host cell comprising a vector encoding a heavy chain and/or light chain of the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof as herein described. Such host cells comprise a first vector encoding the light chain and a second vector encoding said heavy chain.\n\n\n \nBacterial Fermentation\n\n\n \n \n \nBacterial systems are particularly suited for the expression of antigen binding fragments. Such fragments are localised intracellularly or within the periplasma. INSOluble periplasmic proteins can be extracted and refolded to form active proteins according to methods known to those skilled in the art, see Sanchez et al (1999) J. Biotechnol. 72, 13-20 and Cupit P M et al (1999) Lett Appl Microbiol, 29, 273-277.\n\n\n \n3.7 Cell Culturing Methods.\n\n\n \n \n \nHost cells transformed with vectors encoding the antibodies of the invention or antigen binding fragments thereof may be cultured by any method known to those skilled in the art. Host cells may be cultured in spinner flasks, roller bottles or hollow fibre systems but for large scale production that stirred tank reactors are used particularly for suspension cultures. Preferably the stirred tankers are adapted for aeration using e.g. spargers, baffles or low shear impellers. For bubble columns and airlift reactors direct aeration with air or oxygen bubbles maybe used. Where the host cells are cultured in a serum free culture media, the media is supplemented with a cell protective agent such as pluronic F-68 to help prevent cell damage as a result of the aeration process. Depending on the host cell characteristics, either microcarriers maybe used as growth substrates for anchorage dependent cell lines or the cells maybe adapted to suspension culture (which is typical). The culturing of host cells, particularly invertebrate host cells may utilise a variety of operational modes such as fed-batch, repeated batch processing (see Drapeau et al (1994) cytotechnology 15: 103-109), extended batch process or perfusion culture. Although recombinantly transformed mammalian host cells may be cultured in serum-containing media such as fetal calf serum (FCS), for example such host cells are cultured in synthetic serum-free media such as disclosed in Keen et al (1995) Cytotechnology 17:153-163, or commercially available media such as ProCHO-CDM or UltraCHO™ (Cambrex N.J., USA), supplemented where necessary with an energy source such as glucose and synthetic growth factors such as recombinant insulin. The serum-free culturing of host cells may require that those cells are adapted to grow in serum free conditions. One adaptation approach is to culture such host cells in serum containing media and repeatedly exchange 80% of the culture medium for the serum-free media so that the host cells learn to adapt in serum free conditions (see e.g. Scharfenberg K et al (1995) in Animal Cell technology: Developments towards the 21st century (Beuvery E. C. et al eds), pp 619-623, Kluwer Academic publishers).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the invention secreted into the media may be recovered and purified using a variety of techniques to provide a degree of purification suitable for the intended use. For example the use of antibodies of the invention for the treatment of human patients typically mandates at least 95% purity, more typically 98% or 99% or greater purity (compared to the crude culture medium). In the first instance, cell debris from the culture media is typically removed using centrifugation followed by a clarification step of the supernatant using e.g. microfiltration, ultrafiltration and/or depth filtration. A variety of other techniques such as dialysis and gel electrophoresis and chromatographic techniques such as hydroxyapatite (HA), affinity chromatography (optionally involving an affinity tagging system such as polyhistidine) and/or hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,429,746) are available. In one embodiment, the antibodies of the invention, following various clarification steps, are captured using Protein A or G affinity chromatography followed by further chromatography steps such as ion exchange and/or HA chromatography, anion or cation exchange, size exclusion chromatography and ammonium sulphate precipitation. Typically, various virus removal steps are also employed (e.g. nanofiltration using e.g. a DV-20 filter). Following these various steps, a purified (preferably monoclonal) preparation comprising at least 75 mg/ml or greater e.g. 100 mg/ml or greater of the antibody of the invention or antigen binding fragment thereof is provided and therefore forms an embodiment of the invention. Suitably such preparations are substantially free of aggregated forms of antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n4.

Examples of such carriers include sterilised carrier such as saline, Ringers solution or dextrose solution, buffered with suitable buffers to a pH within a range of 5 to 8. Pharmaceutical compositions for injection (e.g. by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intraportal) or continuous infusion are suitably free of visible particulate matter and may comprise between 0.1 ng to 100 mg of antibody, for example between 5 mg and 25 mg of antibody.

Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be lyophilised (freeze dried) for reconstitution prior to administration according to methods well known or apparent to those skilled in the art.

SJL mice were primed and boosted by intraperitoneal injection with recombinant human IGF-1R(R&D Systems, #305-GR) in RIBI adjuvant. Spleens from responder animals were harvested and fused to X63Ag8653GFP1L5 myeloma cells to generate hybridomas. The hybridoma supernatant material was screened for binding to IGF-1R using the FMAT (AB18200) and BIAcore A100. The AB18200 was used to confirm binding to recombinant IGF-1R (R&D Systems-305-GR-050 and 391-GR-050) and HEK293T-expressed human IGF-1R, HEK293T expressed cynomolgus macaque IGF-1R and absence of binding to HEK293T-expressed human insulin receptor. The BIAcore A100 was used to estimate the kinetics of binding of hybridoma produced antibodies to recombinant IGF-1R(R&D Systems, #305-GR). Antibodies were captured onto the chip using a rabbit anti-mouse IgG (BR-1005-14, Biacore AB). Hybridomas of interest were monocloned using semi-solid media (methyl cellulose solution), Omnitrays and the ClonePix FL system.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nScale-Up and Purification of Hybridoma Material and Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nHybridomas to be scaled up were grown in tissue culture to the scale of 4 confluent 225 cm\n2 \nflasks. At this point the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 400g for 5 minutes. The pellet was resuspended with 100 ml serum free media (JRH610) to wash the cells. The cells were then centrifuged at 400g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was aspirated and discarded. 150 ml of fresh serum free media was used to resuspend the cell pellet. The cell suspension was then transferred into a fresh 225 cm2 flask and placed in an incubator for a period of 5 days. The supernatant was then harvested and centrifuged at 400g for 20 minutes. The supernatant was harvested and sterile filtered with a 0.2 μM filter in preparation for purification. The antibody was purified using protein A resin columns. The purified antibody was dialysed against PBS pH7.4.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nConstruction of IGF-1R Expression Vectors\n\n\nGeneration of Expression Cassette for Full Length Human IGF-1R\n\n\n \n \n \nThe human IGF-1R cDNA expression cassette was identical to Genbank X04434 except for a change at nucleotide 3510. This results in the silent change of the codon for glycine 1170 from “GGC” to “GGG”. Human IGF-1R cDNA was expressed from the pcDNA3.1(−) vector (Invitrogen). The sequence of human IGF-1R is set out in SEQ ID NO 44.\n\n\n \nGeneration of Expression Cassette for Full Length Murine IGF-1R\n\n\n \n \n \nThe murine IGF-1R cDNA expression cassette was identical to Genbank AF056187 except for a change at nucleotide 3522.

Primers were based on the human IGF-1R database entry, NM\n—\n000875. PCR primers were designed with a Kozak motif at the 5′ end and with flanking BamHI and NotI restriction sites. The BamHI-NotI PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3.1D with the vector T7 sequences proximal to the 5′ end of the IGF-1R coding sequence. The cDNA obtained is 99.6% identical to the human sequence at the protein level (4aa differences from human). The sequence of cynomolgus macaque IGF-1R is set out in SEQ ID NO 45.\n\n\n \nGeneration of Expression Cassette for Full Length Human Insulin Receptor (Type B)\n\n\n \n \n \nA DNA cassette encoding human insulin receptor type B (SEQ ID NO 53) was cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen).

This was ligated with a 3.1 kb NruI-Bst11071 fragment from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) which contains the cytomegalovirus immediate early (CMV IE) promoter with a polylinker and BGH poly A site and the SV40 promoter driving expression of the G418 resistance gene. This vector will allow production of a baculovirus which expresses a gene under the control of the CMV promoter in mammalian cells. It is also possible to select for stable derivatives by putting cells under G418 selection.\n\n\n \nHuman IGF-1R-Fc Fusion Protein\n\n\n \n \n \nA plasmid designed to express human IGF-1R extracellular domain sequences fused to a factor Xa cleavage site and human Fc sequences from IgG1 was constructed. Sequences encoding the extracellular domain (amino acids 1-935) of the human IGF-1R cDNA were amplified by PCR and fused to a Factor Xa cleavage site and Fc sequences from human IgG1. The entire insert was then sub-cloned as a HindIII-BamHI fragment into the pFastBacMam expression vector. The sequence of human IGF-1R-Fc fusion protein is set out in SEQ ID NO 47.\n\n\n \n \nCynomolgus Macaque Monkey (\nMacaca fascicularis\n) IGF-1R-Fc Fusion Protein\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA plasmid designed to express cynomolgus macaque monkey IGF-1R extracellular domain sequences fused to a factor Xa cleavage site and human Fc sequences from IgG1 was constructed. The human IGF-1R expression plasmid was modified by the removal of a 82 bp XbaI fragment of vector backbone by cutting with XbaI and re-ligating. This removes a second NotI site. The coding sequence for the extracellular domain of cynomolgus macaque monkey IGF-1R (amino acids 1-935) was amplified by PCR as a HindIII-NotI fragment and ligated into the modified human IGF-1R expression plasmid which had been cut with HindIII and Not Ito remove the human sequences. The sequence of cynomolgus macaque IGF-1R-Fc fusion protein is set out in SEQ ID NO 48.\n\n\n \nExpression of Recombinant Proteins Using BacMam\n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmid vectors encoding human and cynomolgus macaque monkey IGF-1R extracellular domain sequences fused to a Factor Xa cleavage site and Fc sequences from human IgG1 were used to direct protein expression using the BacMam system. Baculoviruses were generated using the Invitrogen Bac-to-Bac system. The initial P0 stock was scaled to a one litre P1 stock using standard procedures. Protein production was initiated by the infection of 1-5 litres of HEK293-F cells in suspension culture with the required BacMam virus (typically at a MOI of 10 to 100 to 1 although this was usually optimized to maximize protein production). After 2-3 days culture the cell culture supernatant was harvested, cells were removed by centrifugation and the expressed protein was then purified from the cleared supernatant.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nConstruction of IGF-1R Ligand Expression Plasmids\n\n\n \n \n \nGene sequences for the processed forms of IGF-I (amino acids 49-118, Swiss-prot P01343) and IGF-II (amino acids 25-91, Swiss-prot P01344) were codon optimised for \nE. coli \nexpression. The genes prepared de novo by build up of overlapping oligonucleotides and cloned into the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET-21b (Novagen). For the production of biotinylated IGF-1R ligands, a C-\nterminal\n 15 amino acid biotinylation tag sequence (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE, ref: Schatz 1993) SEQ ID NO:17 was included in the gene build up.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequences of human IGF-I ligand and IGF-II ligand are set out in SEQ ID NO 49. and SEQ ID NO 51 respectively.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nExpression and Purification of IGF-1R Ligands\n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmids were transformed in \nE. coli \nBL21(DE3) cells then expression carried out using LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin following induction with 1 mM IPTG at 37° C. for 16 hours, The cell pellets were harvested by centrifugation. IGF-1R ligands were isolated as insoluble inclusion bodies by resuspending cell pellets in 50 mM Tris pH8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, lysed by sonication and recovered in the inclusion body fraction by centrifugation. Soluble IGF-1R ligands were produced by solubilising the inclusion bodies in 50 mM Tris pH8.0, 6M Guanidine Hydrochloride, then rapidly diluting into a 100 fold excess volume of 50 mM Tris pH8.0, 1 mM oxidised glutathione, 1 mM reduced glutathione followed by mixing for 16 hours at 4° C. Soluble protein was concentrated and centrifuged to remove insoluble material then biologically active IGF-1R ligands purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a Spherisorb C6 column (Waters) with an acetonitrile gradient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor IGF-1R ligands with biotinylation tags, biotinylation was carried out by adding 5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM d-biotin and 1 μM biotin ligase to the purified proteins. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. The biotinylated IGF-1R ligands were purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). Purified IGF-1R ligands were dialysed against PBS, quantified using BSA standards and a BioRad coomassie based protein assay then stored in aliquots at −80 C. Molecular weights of purified proteins were verified by mass spectroscopy. The sequences of human tagged IGF-I ligand and tagged IGF-II ligand are set out in \nSEQ ID NO\n 50. and SEQ ID NO 52 respectively.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nSequencing of Variable Domains of Hybridomas\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal RNA was extracted from pellets of approximately 10\n6 \ncells for each hybridoma clone using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen (#74106). AccessQuick RT-PCR System (A1702) was used to produce cDNA of the variable heavy and light regions using degenerate primers specific for the murine leader sequences and murine IgG1/\nK \nor IgG2b/\nK \nconstant regions. The purified RT-PCR fragments were cloned and a consensus sequence obtained for each hybridoma by sequence alignment, database searching and alignment with known immunoglobulin variable sequences listed in KABAT (Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 4th Ed., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (1987).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequences listing numbers of the variable domains of hybridomas 6E11, 9C7, 2B9, 15D9 and 5G4 and shown in the Table 1 below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ I.D.

The PCR product was cloned into mammalian expression vectors containing the \nhuman gamma\n 1 constant region and the human kappa constant region respectively. This is the wild type Fc region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing a similar strategy, the variable heavy regions were also cloned onto a variant of the \nhuman gamma\n 1 constant region which contained two alanine substitutions L235A and G237A (EU index numbering). These constructs are referred to herein as IgG1m(AA). The two humanised constructs which comprised the IgG1m(AA) variant are set out as H0L0 IgG1m(AA) (SEQ ID NO 54 and SEQ ID NO 39) and H1L0 IgG1m(AA) (\nSEQ ID NO\n 56 and SEQ ID NO 39).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise stated all humanised constructs used in the examples herein comprise wild type \nhuman gamma\n 1 constant regions.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nRecombinant Antibody Expression in CHO Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression plasmids encoding the heavy and light chains respectively of chimeric or humanised antibodies were transiently co-transfected into CHO-K1 cells. In some instances the supernatant material was used as the test article in binding and activity assays. In other instances, the supernatant material was filter sterilised and the antibody recovered by affinity chromatography using a Protein A. Antibodies were also expressed in a stable polyclonal CHO cell system. DNA vectors encoding the heavy and light chains were co-electroporated into suspension CHO cells. Cells were passaged in shake flasks in MR1 basal selective medium at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n, 130-150 rpm until cell viability and cell counts improved. CHO cells were then inoculated into MR1 basal ×2 selective medium and incubated for 10 to 14 days at 34° C., 5% CO\n2\n, 130-150 rpm. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant sterile filtered.

Anti-IGF-1R antibodies from the test supernatants or purified material were titrated across the plate. The levels of receptor-bound was detected by treatment with an HRP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dako, P0260) or goat anti-human Kappa Light Chains peroxidase conjugate (Sigma, A7164).

HRP conjugated anti mouse Ig (DAKO #P0260) was added to each well at 1/5000 (650 ng/ml) in 4% BSA/PBS and the plates incubated for 1 hour. Plates were washed and developed by the addition of TMB substrate (Sigma T8665). The reaction was stopped with 2M Sulphuric acid and binding detected by measuring absorbance at 450 nm.

In contrast to the positive control antibody (R&D Systems MAB15441), purified antibodies 6E11, 5G4 and 15D9 showed no binding to the insulin receptor at concentrations up to 10 μg/ml.\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nDetermination of Kinetics of Binding\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding kinetics of anti-IGF-1R antibodies for human IGF-1R were assessed using the Biacore™ system. The kinetic analysis was carried out using an antibody capture method. Briefly, an anti-mouse IgG antibody (Biacore, catalogue number BR-1005-14) was used for analysis of mouse parental antibodies and Protein A, for humanised antibodies. Either the anti mouse antibody or the Protein A was immobilised on a CM5 Biosensor chip by primary amine coupling in accordance with Biacore™ standard protocols, utilising the immobilisation Wizard facility, inherent in the machines software, (levels of 3000-4000 resonance units (RU's) where typically immobilised). Anti-IGF-1R antibodies were then captured either directly from hybridoma supernatants or from purified material. The capture levels for supernatants depended upon the starting concentration of the hybridoma and these varied between around 20 RU's to 650 RU's. For the purified material, the level captured for the antibodies tested were generally between 250 and 500 RU's. After capture, the baseline was allowed to stabilise before recombinant IGF-1R, histidine tagged material from R&D Systems (catalogue number 305-GR) was then passed over the surface at defined concentrations (usually in the range of 0-256 nM). Due to the high affinity of the interaction, dissociation times of up to one hour were used. Regeneration was by acid elution using either 100 mM phosphoric acid or 10 mM Glycine, pH 1.5, the regeneration did not significantly affect the surfaces ability to capture antibody for another analysis step. The runs were carried out at both 25° C. and 37° C. The experiments were carried out on the T100 Biacore™ system, using the T100 control and analysis software. The experimental data was fitted to the 1:1 model of binding inherent in the machines analysis software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTables 2-6 show a series of experiments conducted with supernatant and purified material.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKinetic data for a selection of the purified murine IGF-1R monoclonals at\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25° C. and 37° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAffinity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAffinity\n\n\n(nM) 25° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAffinity (nM) 25° C.\n\n\n(nM) 37° C.\n\n\n(Run\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n(Run 1-T0011 R6)\n\n\n(Run 2-T0011 R4)\n\n\n3-T0022 R5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6E11\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n0.164\n\n\n0.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5G4\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n5.9\n\n\nNot tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15D9\n\n\n0.233\n\n\n0.558\n\n\nNot tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKinetic data for supernatant material of a H1L0 and H0L0 in comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith 6E11c.

Briefly either 200 or 4000 RU's was stably captured on a streptavidin sensor chip. To test the neutralisation capacity of anti-IGF-1R antibodies, different concentrations of antibodies were pre-mixed with a fixed concentration of recombinant IGF-1R. As a control non biotinylated IGF-1 was also mixed with the same concentration of IGF-1R. This mixture was then passed over the IGF-I surface and the point of maximal association measured. This reading was then compared to a sample with the same concentration of his-tagged IGF-1R in the absence of anti-IGF-1R antibodies. The presence of a neutralising antibody blocked binding of IGF-1R to IGF-I and reduced the maximal observed association. Percentage inhibition was calculated by comparing the values. Regeneration was carried out using two pulses of 4M magnesium chloride. The experiments were carried out on a Biacore 3000 system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTables 7 and 8—below show the percentage inhibition obtained and also detail the concentrations of antibodies, IGF-1 and IGF-1R used to obtain these results.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition Values for the 200 RU's IGF-1 Surface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody + IGF-1R complex\n\n\n% Inhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIGF1 (125 nM) + His IGF-1R (25 nM)\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIGF1 (500 nM) + His IGF-1R (25 nM)\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6E11 (125 nM) + His IGF-1R (25 nM)\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6E11 (500 nM) + His IGF-1R (25 nM)\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition Values for the 4000 RU's IGF-1 Surface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody + IGF-1R complex\n\n\n% Inhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIGF1 (5 μM) + His IGF-1R (50 nM)\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIGF1 (500 nM) + His IGF-1R (50 nM)\n\n\n86\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6E11 (500 nM) + His IGF-1R (50 nM)\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 19\n\n\nFluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nColo205 cells were stained with anti hIGF-1R purified antibodies at 10 μg/ml for 1 hour in FACs buffer (4% FCS in PBS).

Following this secondary incubation, the slides were washed and developed using the DakoCytomation Envision DAB solution, rinsed, dehydrated and cover-slipped for viewing.

However, the presence of the biotin-tag was found to decrease the activity of these' antibodies as determined by ELISA (data not shown), therefore the concentration of primary antibody used was increased to up to 100 ug/ml. The secondary antibody listed above (DakoCytomation Envision Kit—Anti-mouse Ig-HRP conjugate) was substituted with streptavidin-HRP, (DakoCytomation Cat# 1016).

Cells were incubated for 1 hour before the further addition of IGF-1 (R&D Systems #291-G1) to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. All treatments were carried out in triplicate. Cells were incubated for 5 days at 37 deg C., 5% CO2. After incubation, 15 μl of MTT dye solution (Promega #G402A) was added to each well and the plates incubated for a further 4 hours. 100 μl of Stop/Solublisation solution (Promega #G401A) was added to each well and the plate shaken gently overnight at room temperature.

The media was removed and cells incubated in serum free DMEM for 4 hours. Media was removed and replaced with a range of concentrations (0.0041-3 μg/ml final concentration) of purified antibodies diluted in serum free media (50 μl/well). Cells were incubated for 1 hour before the further addition of 50 μl/well IGF-1 (R&D Systems 291-G1 or IGF-I—see Examples 5 and 6) to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. All treatments were carried out in triplicate. Cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 deg C., 5% CO2. After incubation, 100 μl of freshly prepared Promega CellTitre-Glo reagent (Promega G7571) was added to each well and the plates shaken for 2 mins.

The following day the cells were washed with SFM (serum free RPMI media) and incubated in 1 ml of the same media for 4 hours. The media was aspirated from the cells and 500 μl of SFM containing 20 μg/ml of purified antibodies was added (10 μg/ml final concentration). Cells were incubated for 1 hour. In some wells, IGF-I (R&D Systems 291-G1) in SFM was added to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. The treated cells were incubated overnight. The following day the cells were washed gently in PBS and then harvested by adding 200 μl of Versene solution (Invitrogen #15040). The cell suspensions were transferred to a 96 well V-bottomed plate. After pelleting the cells by centrifugation they were fixed by the addition of chilled 80% Ethanol and incubation on ice for 30 min. Cells were pelleted and re-suspended in 200 μl of 50 μg/ml Propidium Iodide, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05 mg/ml RNAse A.

The media was removed prior to treatment with either no antibody, a negative control antibody or a purified anti hIGF-1R antibody at 20 μg/ml. Cells were additionally treated with either SFM alone, SFM+IGF-1 at 20 ng/ml, SFM+Camptothecin at 5 μM or SFM+Camptothecin at 5 μM+IGF-1 at 20 ng/ml. All treatments were tested in triplicate in a final volume of 100 μl. The plate was then incubated for 20 hours. The media was aspirated from the wells and the cells lysed by the addition of 200 μl of 0.5% NP-40 in PBS followed by 5 min incubation with shaking at room temperature. 20 μl of lysate was transferred to a prepared microplate from the Roche Cell Death ELISA Kit and 80 μl of incubation buffer added.

Purified anti IGF-1R antibodies were titrated onto the cells in complete DMEM, each dilution being tested in triplicate. An antibody reported to have agonistic activity (#556000, BD Biosciences) and/or 50 ng/ml of IGF-I were included in some experiments as a positive control. Negative controls of irrelevant antibody and media alone were included. In other experiments, an anti-mouse cross-linking antibody (Sigma M8144) or an anti human cross linking antibody (Sigma 13382) were included in the antibody titration at a ratio of 2:1 [anti IGF-1 Ab]:[cross linking Ab]. Plates were incubated for 30 mins. Media was aspirated and cells were washed gently with PBS once before being lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM TrisHCl, 6 mM Na Deoxycholate, 1% Tween 20) plus protease inhibitor cocktail (\nRoche\n 11 697 498 001). The plate was placed at −20° C. overnight. After thawing, 100 μl samples of lysate were transferred to a 96 well ELISA plate pre-coated with an anti IGF-1R capture antibody (MAB391, R&D Systems) at 2 μg/ml and blocked with 4% BSA/TBS. The plate was incubated overnight at 4° C. The plate was washed 4 times with TBST (TBS+0.1% Tween 20) and a Europium labelled anti Phosphotyrosine antibody (DELFIA Eu-N1 PT66, PerkinElmer) diluted 1/2500 in 4% BSA/TBS was added to each well. After 1 hour incubation the plate was washed as before and DELFIA Enhancement solution (PerkinElmer 1244-105) added. After 10 min incubation the level of receptor phosphorylation was determined using a plate reader set up to measure Europium time resolved fluorescence (TRF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 20\n. shows that 6E11 had no agonistic activity at concentrations up 10 μg/ml in the presence of cross-linking antibodies.\n\n\n \nExample 27\n\n\nAllograft Model—3T3/LISN c4\n\n\n \n \n \nAn in vivo tumour model using 3T3/LISN c4 cells was used to establish the ability of 6E11 murine monoclonal antibody to inhibit the growth of pre-established tumours in athymic nude mice. Tumours were induced by similar methods to those published in Cohen et al, Clinical Cancer Research 11:2063-2073 ((2005). In summary, 2.5×10\n6 \nLISN cells suspended in 0.1 ml of Matrigel™ were subcutaneously inoculated into 4-6 week old athymic CD1 nu/nu mice. Once tumours had reached approximately 150 mm\n3 \nin size, mice were treated twice weekly for three weeks with 250 μg of antibody in 0.2 ml of PBS by intraperitoneal injection. Tumours were measured by Vernier callipers across two diameters three times per week and the volume calculated using the formula (length×[width]\n2\n)/2. Data were analysed as follows: Log\n10 \ntransformed tumour volumes were analysed using a random coefficient regression analysis. This estimates the intercept (baseline) and slope (rate of tumour growth) for each group. Compared with the PBS treated group, there was a reduction of 31% in the growth rate in the 6E11 group (\nFIG. 21\n, p=0.0007).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a similar experiment, nude mice were implanted sub-cutaneously with 2.5×10\n6 \ncells in Matrigel. Eighteen days after implantation, mice with tumor volumes of 100-200 mm\n3 \nwere randomized into groups of 8 animals/treatment group. Anti-IGF-1R antibody 6E11 was administered by intraperitoneal injection at 250 μg/mouse and 100 μg/mouse dose, twice weekly for 3 weeks. Control animals received saline at the same schedule. Tumor size and mouse body weight were measured twice weekly. Compared with the saline treated group, there was a reduction of 56% and 70% in the tumour volume measured at \nday\n 35 for the 100 μg/mouse and 250 μg/mouse groups respectively (\nFIG. 22\n).\n\n\n \nExample 28\n\n\nGrowth Inhibition of Colo205 Cell Tumours by 6E11 Mouse Parental Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nAn in vivo tumour model using Colo205 cells was used to establish the ability of 6E11 murine monoclonal antibody to inhibit the growth of pre-established tumours in HRLN female nu/nu mice. 1×10\n6 \nColo205 cells were suspended in 50% Matrigel and subcutaneously implanted into the flank of the nude mice. Once tumours had reached approximately 80-120 mm\n3 \nin size (equivalent to \nday\n 1 in \nFIG. 23\n), mice were treated every 3 days with 10 mg/kg of antibody by intraperitoneal injection, for a total of 10 injections. Tumours were measured by callipers and the volume calculated using the formula (length×[width]\n2\n)/2. Data were analysed as follows: Log\n10 \ntransformed tumour volumes were analysed using a random coefficient regression analysis. This estimates the intercept (baseline) and slope (rate of tumour growth) for each group. Compared with the vehicle control (PBS), there was a 58% reduction in the growth rate in the 6E11 antibody (\nFIG. 23\n, p=0.0019).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar experiment to that described above was performed on a separate occasion. However, in this second experiment using Colo205 cells no inhibition of tumour growth was observed for the 6E11 treated animals. The reasons for the absence of inhibition with 6E11 are unknown (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar experiment to that described above was also performed using mice implanted with 1×10\n7 \nA549 cells. However, in this experiment no inhibition of tumour growth was observed for the 6E11 treated animals. The reasons for the absence of inhibition with 6E11 are unknown (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhilst the data from these last two experiments appears to show that the antibodies of the invention do not inhibit tumour growth in these models, it is believed that the first two tumour models (the allograft model and the first colo205 model) are more robust. A control antibody that gave a positive signal (i.e. showed inhibition of tumour growth) in these first two models showed no inhibition in the second Colo205 tumour model study or the A549 tumour model study, hence we have more confidence that the data from the first two tumour models is more indicative of activity of the test antibody than that of the second two models.\n\n\n \nExample 29\n\n\nConstruction of Expression Vectors\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo anti-CD20 antibodies were constructed. The variable regions were obtained from the PDB protein databank (accession 2OSL). Two IgG1 constant regions were used. A wild-type IgG1 constant region and a variant Fc region which is based on a wild-type human IgG1 sequence with two substitutions (S239D/I332E, based on Kabat, EU index). The variable region and constant regions of the antibody were codon optimised and assembled by overlapping oligonucleotide PCR techniques. The variable and Fc regions were cloned using standard molecular biology techniques, into pTT5 episomal vectors and mammalian expression vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polynucleotide sequences of the anti-CD20 IgG1 heavy chain, anti-CD20 IgG1 heavy chain containing the S239D/I332E substitutions and anti-CD20 light chain Ck are given in SEQ ID: 71-73 respectively. The corresponding protein sequences are given in SEQ ID: 74-76\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IGF-1R antibodies were generated using a similar approach and standard molecular biology techniques. Variable and constant regions for both heavy and light chains were assembled by overlapping oligonucleotide PCR techniques and fused together by restriction digestion and ligation into a standard mammalian expression vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polynucleotide sequences of the anti-IGF-1R HO IgG1 heavy chain, anti-IGF-1R H0 IgG1 heavy chain containing the S239D/I332E substitutions and anti-IGF-1R L0 light chain Ck are given in SEQ ID: 70, 67 and 69 respectively. The corresponding protein sequences are given in SEQ ID: 37, 68 and 39 respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, the polynucleotide sequence and corresponding protein sequences represent the mature antibody sequence where the signal peptide sequence has been cleaved off during post-translational processing. To direct expression of secreted proteins, it is necessary to add a signal peptide sequence to the N-terminus. One such example is given by SEQ ID: 43.\n\n\n \nExample 30\n\n\nAntibody Expression and Purification of Anti-CD20 and anti-IGF1R Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAdherent CHO DG44 FUT8 deleted cells were cultured until cells were in logarithmic growth phase, then rinsed and trypsinized before pelleting the cells by centrifugation. Suspension CHO-E1a cells were also cultured to logarithmic growth phase before pelleting the required cell number by centrifugation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth adherent and suspension CHO cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and resuspended in electroporation buffer. The cells were co-transfected by electroporation with expression plasmids containing the humanized heavy and light chain DNA sequences listed in the table below (Table 10). The electroporated cells were resuspended in a selection medium and incubated at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the FUT8 deleted cells, once colonies of transfectants were observed, the cell cultures were expanded and allowed to reach confluency before harvest. For the CHO-E1 a cell lines, 10-14 day production runs were set up once viability reached 80%. Harvests were performed at the end of the production runs.

The plates were washed twice with Tris-Buffered Saline with 0.05% of Tween-20. 200 μL of blocking solution (5% BSA in DPBS buffer) was added in each well and the plates were incubated for at least 1 hour at room temperature. Another wash step was then performed. 0.4 μg/mL of recombinant human IGF-1R (R&D systems) was added to each well at 50 μL per well. The plates were incubated for an hour at room temperature and then washed. The test antibodies were successively diluted across the plate in blocking solution. After one hour incubation, the plates were washed. Goat anti-human kappa light chain specific peroxidase conjugated antibody was diluted in blocking solution to 1 μg/mL and 50 μL was added to each well. The plates were incubated for one hour. After another wash step, 50 μl of OPD SigmaFast substrate solution were added to each well and the reaction was stopped 15 minutes later by addition of 25 μL of 3M sulphuric acid. Absorbance was read at 490 nm using the VersaMax Tunable Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices) using a basic endpoint protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs illustrated in \nFIG. 25\n, antibody samples IGF1R-E, -F, -G and -H show comparable binding to recombinant human IGF-1R.

SEQ ID: 77 and SEQ ID: 78 give the protein sequences of the expression cassettes for the V and F variants of FcγRIIIa respectively. 10 L scale wave-bag cultures of HEK cells were infected with Bacmam virus. Supernatant was harvested and concentrated to 1 L by tangential flow filtration (10 kmwco) and buffer exchanged into 50 mM HEPES pH 7.7, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Imidazole. Purification followed a two step chromatography process; Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (5 ml H is Trap crude FF, GE HEalthcare) followed by Size Exclusion Chromatography on Superdex 75 (XK26/60, GE Healthcare). A HEPES buffer system was used throughout \nfinal buffer\n 50 mM HEPES pH 7.7, 150 mM NaCl. A single peak were observed on a size exclusion column. The final protein product gave a smeared appearance on an SDS-PAGE gel indicative of heterogeneous glycosylation.\n\n\n \nExample 34\n\n\nKinetics of Binding to FcγRIIIa Receptors\n\n\n \n \n \nQiagen anti-polyhistidine antibody (Cat No. 34670) was immobilised on CM5 biosensor chip using standard NHS/EDC activation, the antibody was diluted to 50 ug/ml in acetate pH4.0 buffer and passed over the activated surface for 20 minutes at 5 ul/minute, the surface was then blocked with ethanolamine. Prior to use the chip was conditioned by performing several regeneration steps using 100 mM phosphoric acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor analysis of the interaction of the FcγRIIIa with various antibody constructs, the poly-histidine tagged receptors were captured to around 20 RU's. Antibodies were injected over the captured surface at 512, 128, 32, 8 and 2 nM with an injection of buffer over the receptor captured surface used for double referencing. Regeneration was carried out using 100 mM phosphoric acid following each antibody/buffer injection. The run was carried out using HBS-EP buffer and carried out at 25° C. on a T100 Biacore machine. The data was analysed using the analysis software inherent to the machine using the 1:1 and Bivalent models. For these experiments, generally the Bivalent model provided a better fit to the experimental data.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are shown in Table 11 and \nFIG. 27\n (anti-CD20 antibodies) and Table 12 and \nFIG. 28\n (anti-IGF-1R antibodies). \nFIGS. 27 and 28\n show a representative trace at one antibody concentration for the different antibodies to illustrate the differences in the off-rate between the different constructs.

The cell suspension was flicked vigorously at the start of the labelling and then every 10 minutes during the 30 minute incubation period on ice. Following labelling, 10 ml of ice cold repair buffer (HEPES buffer containing 294 mg/l CaCl\n2\n.2H\n2\nO and 1.8 g/l D-Glucose, pH7.4) was added and the cells incubated on ice for a further 10 minutes. The cells were then centrifuged, the supernatant decanted and the cells washed twice further with repair buffer and then once with complete medium. The labelled cells were counted and resuspended in serum free medium at 10\n5\n/ml. The cells were stored on ice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman purified blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's or effectors) were prepared as follows. 100 ml of whole blood was centrifuged at 2000 \nrpm\n 10 mins, and the serum removed. The remaining sample was diluted to twice the original volume with PBS. The density gradient tubes were prepared by adding 15 mls lymphoprep and centrifuged for 1 min at 1500 rpm. 25 ml of blood suspension was added to the density gradient tubes and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 20 mins with the centrifuge brake off. The top 10 ml of supernatant was discarded. The remainder (including the “buffy” layer) was poured into a clean tube, topped up with PBS and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, the cell pellets were pooled, washed once in medium and centrifuged. The cells were counted and diluted to 5×10\n6\n/ml in serum free medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay plates were set up as follows using 96-well round bottom plates. The test antibodies were diluted serum free RPMI medium at 12 μg/ml (4 μg/ml final concentration) in a 1.0 ml final volume. Further 3-fold dilutions were made in serum free RPMI medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n50 μl antibody dilution was added to the appropriate wells according to the plate layout shown below. 50 μl medium to all wells in rows A, and H. 100 μl of Europium labelled target cells were added to all wells in appropriately labelled plates. 20 μl of 10× triton was added to all wells in row H on all plates. The plates were incubated at 4° C. for \nminimum\n 30 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n50 μl medium was added to all wells in columns labelled targets alone. 50 μl PBMCs was added to all wells in columns labelled effector:targets to give a final effector : target ratio of 25:1. The plates were centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 3 mins and incubate 37° C. for 3-4 hrs. 200 μl enhancement solution (Wallac/Perkin Elmer Catalogue #1244-105) was added to a 96-well Nunc immunosorbant ELISA plates (one Elisa plate for correspond with each assay plate). 20 μl of supernatant from the assay plate was transferred to the ELISA plate and incubated at room temperature on \nplate shaker minimum\n 30 minutes, or overnight at 4° C. Europium release was measured using time-delayed fluorimetry (Wallac Victor plate reader). Spontaneous lysis=measurement of Europium released from cells and medium alone. Maximum lysis=non-specific lysis of target cells by addition of Triton-X100 (non-ionic detergent).\n\n\n \n96-Well Plate Layout\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEffector: Targets\n\n\nTargets\n\n\nEffector: Targets\n\n\nTargets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn No.\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n10\n\n\n11\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow A\n\n\nSpontaneous\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nrelease\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow B\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n3\n\n\nug/ml\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.003\n\n\nug/\nml\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRow C\n \n \n \n \n\n\n1\n\n\nug/ml\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.001\n\n\nug/ml\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow D\n\n\n0.3\n\n\nug/ml\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.0003\n\n\nug/ml\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow E\n\n\n0.1\n\n\nug/ml\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.0001\n\n\nug/ml\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow F\n\n\n0.03\n\n\nug/ml\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.00003\n\n\nug/ml\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow G\n\n\n0.01\n\n\nug/ml\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.00001\n\n\nug/ml\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow H\n\n\nMaximum release\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of one ADCC assay for the anti-CD20 antibodies are shown in \nFIG. 26\n and confirm that antibody samples CD20-A, -B, -C and -D show specific activity against RAJI cells, with samples CD20-B, -C and -D showing comparable activity. The assay has been repeated a total of five times using PBMC effector cells from five different donors. In all cases the same trend was seen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt would also be possible to run a similar assay using alternative target cells lines which express different levels of CD20. Examples of such cell lines include Daudi, Ramos, DOHH-2, Granta-519, FL-18. Alternatively it is possible to engineering cell lines to express different levels of CD20. An example of this methodology is given is reported by van Meerten et al. (Clinical Cancer Research Vol. 12, 4027-4035, Jul. 1, 2006). For both approaches, it will be necessary to optimise the assay for each target:effector combination by for example altering the target cell loading conditions, or the effector:target cell ratio, incubation time or by using alternative read-outs such as LDH. It is anticipated that an alternative target cell line may offer the opportunity to distinguish between the different antibody samples in terms of ADCC activity.\n\n\n \nExample 36\n\n\nADCC Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nA similar ADCC assay for IGF-1R was carried out using IGF-1R-G, IGF-1R-H and a non-antibody control using a preparation of A549 target cells and CD3/CD19 depleted PBMC effectors cells. Cell lysis was measured by Lactate dehydrogenase release according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). For a number of the samples the total lysis observed was in excess of the theoretical maximum and for this reason the assay was deemed a technical failure (Results not shown). Further optimisation will be required to establish a meaningful assay.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQUENCE LISTING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSequence identifier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolynucleotide or amino acid sequence:\n\n\n(SEQ.
