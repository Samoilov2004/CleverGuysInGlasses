Description\n\n\n\n\nThe present invention relates to Cycloalkane-substituted substituted pyrazoline compounds, methods for their preparation, medicaments comprising these compounds as well as their use for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of humans and animals.\n\n\nCannabinoids are compounds, which are derived from the cannabis sativa plant which is commonly known as marijuana. The most active chemical compound of the naturally occurring cannabinoids is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), particularly Δ\n9\n-THC.\n\n\nThese naturally occurring cannabinoids as well as their synthetic analogues promote their physiological effects via binding to specific G-coupled receptors, the so-called cannabinoid-receptors.\n\n\nAt present, two distinct types of receptors that bind both the naturally occurring and synthetic cannabinoids have been identified and cloned. These receptors, which are designated CB\n1 \nand CB\n2 \nare involved in a variety of physiological or pathophysiological processes in humans and animals, e.g. processes related to the central nervous system, immune system, cardiovascular system, endocrinous system, respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract or to reproduction, as described for example, in Hollister, Pharm.

Eds., CRC Press, 1992.\n\n\nTherefore, compounds, which have a high binding affinity for these cannabinoid receptors and which are suitable for modulating these receptors are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of cannabinoid-receptor related disorders.\n\n\nIn particular, the CB\n1\n-Receptor is involved in many different food-intake related disorders such as bulimia or obesity, including obesity associated with type II diabetes (non-insulin-dependent diabetes) and thus, compounds suitable for regulating this receptor may be used in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of these disorders.\n\n\nThus, it was an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds for use as active substances in medicaments. In particular, these active substances should be suitable for the modulation of Cannabinoid receptors, more particularly for the modulation of Cannabinoid 1 (CB\n1\n) receptors.\n\n\nSaid object was achieved by providing the cycloalkane-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I given below, their stereoisomers, corresponding salts and corresponding solvates thereof.\n\n\nIt has been found that these compounds have a high affinity for cannabinoid receptors, particularly for the CB\n1\n-receptor, and that they act as modulators e.g. antagonists, inverse agonists or agonists on these receptors. They are therefore suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of various disorders related to the central nervous system, the immune system, the cardiovascular system, the endocrinous system, the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract or reproduction in humans and/or animals, preferably humans including infants, children and grownups.\n\n\nThus, in one of its aspects the present invention relates to Cycloalkane-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein\n\n\nZ is selected from C\n1-4\n-Alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or linear, saturated or unsaturated;\n\n\nX and Y independently represent phenyl, thienyl, naphtyl or pyridyl which groups may be substituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents W, which can be the same or different, selected from the group\n        \n \nbranched or linear C\n1-3\n-alkyl or branched or linear C\n1-3\n-alkoxy, phenyl, hydroxy, chloro, bromo, fluoro, iodo, SH, trifluoromethyl, CHF\n2\n, CH\n2\nF, OCHF\n2\n, trifluoromethylthio, trifluoromethoxy, methylsulfonyl, carboxyl, trifluoromethylsulfonyl, cyano, carbamoyl, sulfamoyl and acetyl; O—P, with P denominating a prodrug group consisting of aryl, C\n8-20\n-alkyl, heterocyclyl, C(O)-aryl, C(O)-heterocyclyl, C(O)—C\n1-20\n-alkyl;\n \n\n\n\n\nR\n8 \nrepresenting Cycloalkyl unsubstituted or at least monosubstituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents S′, which can be the same or different, selected from the group:\n        \n \nH, F, Cl, Br, I, OH, SH, C\n1-4\nalkyl, C\n1-4\nalkoxy, CF\n3\n, CHF\n2\n, CH\n2\nF, OCF\n3\n, a keto-group, NO\n2 \nor NH\n2\n;\n \n\n\n\n\nn being 0 or 1\n\n\noptionally in the form of its racemate, pure stereoisomers, especially enantiomers or diastereomers or in the form of mixtures of stereoisomers, especially enantiomers or diastereomers, in any suitable ratio;\n\n\nin the form shown or in form of the acid or base or in form of a salt, especially a physiologically acceptable salt, or in form of a solvate, especially a hydrate or in form of a corresponding N-oxide thereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a very preferred embodiment of the present invention R\n8 \nrepresents Cyclohexyl or a C\n7-8\n-Cycloalkyl unsubstituted or at least monosubstituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents S′, which can be the same or different, selected from the group:\n\n \n \n \n \nH, F, Cl, Br, I, OH, SH, C\n1-4\nalkyl, C\n1-4\nalkoxy, CF\n3\n, CHF\n2\n, CH\n2\nF, OCF\n3\n, a keto-group, NO\n2 \nor NH\n2\n;\n \npreferably R\n8 \nrepresents C\n7-8\n-Cycloalkyl unsubstituted or at least monosubstituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents S′, which can be the same or different, selected from the group:\n \nH, F, Cl, Br, I, OH, SH, C\n1-4\nalkyl, C\n1-4\nalkoxy, CF\n3\n, CHF\n2\n, CH\n2\nF, OCF\n3\n, a keto-group, NO\n2 \nor NH\n2\n.\n \n \n \n\n\nIn a very preferred aspect the present invention relates to Cycloalkane-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein\n\n\nZ is selected from C\n1-4\n-Alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or linear, saturated or unsaturated;\n\n\nX and Y independently represent phenyl, thienyl, naphtyl or pyridyl which groups may be substituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents W, which can be the same or different, selected from the group\n        \n \nbranched or linear C\n1-3\n-alkyl or branched or linear C\n1-3\n-alkoxy, phenyl, hydroxy, chloro, bromo, fluoro, iodo, SH, trifluoromethyl, CHF\n2\n, CH\n2\nF, OCHF\n2\n, trifluoromethylthio, trifluoromethoxy, methylsulfonyl, carboxyl, trifluoromethylsulfonyl, cyano, carbamoyl, sulfamoyl and acetyl; O—P, with P denominating a prodrug group consisting of aryl, C\n8-20\n-alkyl, heterocyclyl, C(O)-aryl, C(O)-heterocyclyl, C(O)—C\n1-20\n-alkyl;\n \n\n\n\n\nR\n8 \nrepresenting a C\n7-8\n-Cycloalkyl unsubstituted or at least monosubstituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents S′, which can be the same or different, selected from the group:\n        \n \nH, F, Cl, Br, I, OH, SH, C\n1-4\nalkyl, C\n1-4\nalkoxy, CF\n3\n, CHF\n2\n, CH\n2\nF, OCF\n3\n, a keto-group, NO\n2 \nor NH\n2\n;\n \n\n\n\n\nn being 0 or 1\n\n\noptionally in the form of its racemate, pure stereoisomers, especially enantiomers or diastereomers or in the form of mixtures of stereoisomers, especially enantiomers or diastereomers, in any suitable ratio;\n\n\nin the form shown or in form of the acid or base or in form of a salt, especially a physiologically acceptable salt, or in form of a solvate, especially a hydrate or in form of a corresponding N-oxide thereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of this invention, alkyl radical or group is understood as meaning saturated and unsaturated, linear or branched hydrocarbons, which can be unsubstituted or mono- or polysubstituted.

The respective description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the disclosure. Preferably sodium pyruvate may be used as the pyruvate compound. Preferably said reaction is carried out in a protic reaction medium such as a C\n1-4 \nalkyl alcohol or mixtures of these. Mixtures of such alcohols with water, e.g. ethanol/water may also be used.\n\n\nReaction temperature as well as the duration of the reaction may vary over a broad range. Preferred reaction temperatures range from −10° C. to the boiling point of the reaction medium. Suitable reaction times may vary for example from several minutes to several hours.\n\n\nAlso preferred the reaction of the benzaldehyde compound of general formula V with a pyruvate compound of general formula VI is carried out under acid catalysed conditions, more preferably by refluxing the mixture in dichloromethane in the presence of copper(II) trifluoromethanesulfonate as described, for example, in Synlett, (1), 147-149, 2001.

Preferably the compounds of general formula (IX) are transferred into an acid chloride, an acid anhydride, a mixed anhydride, a C\n1-4 \nalkyl ester, an activated ester such as p-nitrophenylester. Other well known methods for the activation of acids include the activation with N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or benzotriazol-N-oxotris(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP)).\n\n\nIf said activated compound of general formula (XI) is an acid chloride, it is preferably prepared by reaction of the corresponding acid of general formula (IX) with thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride, whereby said chlorinating agent is also used as the solvent. Also preferably an additional solvent may be used.

Suitable bases are e.g. hydroxides, carbonates or alkoxides, which include suitable cations, derived e.g. from alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals or organic cations, e.g. [NH\nn\nR\n4−n\n]\n+\n, wherein n is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 and R represents a branched or unbranched C\n1-4\n-alkyl-radical. Suitable reaction media are, for example, any of the ones given above.\n\n\nSolvates, preferably hydrates, of the substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula (I), of corresponding stereoisomers, of corresponding N-oxides or of corresponding salts thereof may also be obtained by standard procedures known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nSubstituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I, which comprise nitrogen-atom containing saturated, unsaturated or aromatic rings may also be obtained in the form of their N-oxides by methods well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThose skilled in the art understand that the term substituted pyrazoline compounds as used herein is to be understood as encompassing derivatives such as ethers, esters and complexes of these compounds as well. The term “derivatives” as used in this application is defined here as meaning a chemical compound having undergone a chemical derivation starting from an acting (active) compound to change (ameliorate for pharmaceutical use) any of its physico-chemical properties, especially a so-called prodrug, e.g. their esters and ethers. Examples of well known methods of producing a prodrug of a given acting compound are known to those skilled in the art and can be found e.g. in Krogsgaard-Larsen et al., Textbook of Drug design and Discovery, Taylor & Francis (April 2002). The respective description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the disclosure.\n\n\nThe purification and isolation of the inventive substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula (I), of a corresponding stereoisomer, or salt, or N-oxide, or solvate or any intermediate thereof may, if required, be carried out by conventional methods known to those skilled in the art, e.g. chromatographic methods or recrystallization.\n\n\nThe Cycloalkane-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I given above, their stereoisomers, corresponding N-oxides, corresponding salts thereof and corresponding solvates are toxicologically acceptable and are therefore suitable as pharmaceutical active substances for the preparation of medicaments.\n\n\nIt has been found that the Cycloalkane-substituted pyrazoline compounds of general formula I given above, stereoisomers thereof, N-oxides thereof, corresponding salts and corresponding solvates have a high affinity to cannabinoid receptors, particularly cannabinoid 1 (CB\n1\n)-receptors, i.e. they are selective ligands for the (CB\n1\n)-receptor and act as modulators, e.g. antagonists, inverse agonists or agonists, on these receptors. In particular, these pyrazoline compounds show little or no development of tolerance during treatment, particularly with respect to food intake, i.e. if the treatment is interrupted for a given period of time and then continued afterwards, the inventively used pyrazoline compounds will again show the desired effect. After ending the treatment with the pyrazoline compounds, the positive influence on the body weight is found to continue.\n\n\nFurthermore, these Cycloalkane-substituted pyrazoline compounds show relatively weak Herg channel affinity, thus a low risk of prolongation of the QT-interval is to be expected for these compounds.\n\n\nIn summary, the inventively used 4-substituted pyrazoline compounds are distinguished by a broad spectrum of beneficial effects, while at the same time showing relatively little undesired effects, i.e. effects which do not positively contribute to or even interfere with the well being of the patient.\n\n\nThus, an other aspect of the present invention relates to a medicament comprising at least one Cycloalkane-substituted pyrazoline compound of general formula I, optionally in form of one of its stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, a racemate or in form of a mixture of at least two of its stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in any mixing ratio, or a corresponding N-oxide thereof, or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, or a corresponding solvate thereof, and optionally at least one physiologically acceptable auxiliary agent.\n\n\nPreferably said medicament is suitable for the modulation (regulation) of cannabinoid-receptors, preferably cannabinoid 1 (CB\n1\n) receptors, for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, disorders of the immune system, disorders of the cardiovascular system, disorders of the endocrinous system, disorders of the respiratory system, disorders of the gastrointestinal tract or reproductive disorders.\n\n\nParticularly preferably said medicament is suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of psychosis.\n\n\nAlso particularly preferably said medicament is suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of food intake disorders, preferably bulimia, anorexia, cachexia, obesity and/or type II diabetus mellitus (non-insuline dependent diabetes mellitus), more preferably obesity.

Med. 1998, 15, pages 539-53, the respective description thereof is herewith incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure). The other, more widely accepted, definition of the metabolic syndrome was established by the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) in 2001, as described in JAMA 2001; 285; 2486-97, the respective description thereof is herewith incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure.\n\n\nThe metabolic syndrome is characterized by an interaction of several physiological parameters such as triglycerides, lipids, blood pressure, glucose levels and insulin levels.\n\n\nEven though obesity may play a critical role in the development of metabolic syndrome, many of its aspects are weight independent, especially some lipid parameters. Especially the positive influence on the weight independent aspects of the metabolic syndrome (see e.g. Pagotto and Pasquali, The Lancet, Vol. 365 (2005), 1363, 1364, included herewith by reference)

These illustrations are given solely by way of example and do not limit the general spirit of the present invention.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe following compounds were prepared according to the general processes described above. Those skilled in the art are familiar with the starting materials that are needed to obtain said compounds.\n\n\na) Preparation of compound of general formula (E)-4-(4-substituted-phenyl)-3-methyl (or 3-ethyl)-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Where W has the meaning given above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a solution of aqueous 0.5 M NaOH (1.5 equivalents), under N\n2 \nat room temperature, 2-oxobutyric acid (1.1 equivalents) is added in portions. The reaction is then left stirring for 5 min and a solution of 4-substituted-benzaldehyde (1 equivalent) in abs. EtOH (0.9 M) is then slowly added (10 mL/h). The reaction is left to stir at 25° C. overnight.\n\n\nWater is added, and the solution evaporated under reduced pressure to eliminate the excess of EtOH. The solution is then washed with toluene and evaporated (to eliminate traces of this solvent). The aqueous solution is then cooled down in an ice bath and conc. HCl (0.2 mL of conc HCl per mL of base) are slowly added under magnetically stirring. A white solid precipitates from the solution which is kept at 0° C. for another hour. The solid is filtered under vacuum through a sintered funnel (porosity 3) and dried at 40° C. under vacuum.\n\n\nThe yield range for this aldolic condensation is 60-86%.\n\n\nIf the starting material is 2-oxopentanoic acid (oxovaleric acid) instead of 2-oxobutyric acid, this reaction leads to (E)-4-(4-substituted-phenyl)3-ethyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic acids, although in this case, the yield of the reaction is slightly lower (around 40-50%)\n\n\n(E)-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ 2.17 (3H, s, CH\n3\n), 7.44 (4H, ap d, J=3.28 Hz, ArH), 8.41 (1H, s, CH).\n\n\n(E)-4-(4-bromophenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CD\n3\nOD): δ 1.99 (3H, s, CH\n3\n), 7.36 (2H, d, J=8.5 Hz, ArH), 7.40 (1H, s, CH), 7.53 (2H, d, J=8.5 Hz, ArH).\n\n\n(E)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d\n6\n): δ 2.18 (3H, s, CH\n3\n), 7.20 (2H, m), 7.53 (2H, m), 8.26 (1H, s, CH);\n\n\n(E)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid\n\n\nThis compound is prepared following the method described above but using 3 eq of NaOH instead of 1.5 eq.\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (200 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ 2.09 (3H, s, CH\n3\n), 3.84 (3H, s, OCH\n3\n), 7.01 (2H, d, J=8.8 Hz, ArH), 7.50 (1H, s, CH), 7.52 (2H, d, J=8.8 Hz, ArH).\n\n\n(E)-4-(4-bromophenyl)-3-ethyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ 1.16 (3H, t, J=7.5 Hz, CH\n3\n), 2.62 (2H, q, J=7.5 Hz, CH\n2\n), 7.35 (2H, d, J=8.4 Hz, ArH), 7.59 (2H, d, J=8.4 Hz, ArH), 8.23 (1H, s, CH).\n\n\nb) Preparation of compound of general formula cis or trans 5-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl (or 4-ethyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Where W has the meaning given above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA suspension of 2,4-dichlorophenylhydrazine hydrochloride (1 equivalent) in glacial acetic acid (40 equivalents) is heated at 80° C. under nitrogen atmosphere. When the suspension becomes a solution, a solution of (E)-4-(4-substituted-phenyl-3-methyl-2-oxo-3-butenoic acid (1 equivalent) in acetic acid (20 equivalents) is added and the solution left to stir at 80° C. for 2 h.\n\n\nThen, the mixture can be let crystallizing at 0-4° C. overnight after some concentration of acetic acid. The beige solid formed afterwards is filtrated under vacuum through a sintered funnel (porosity 4) and washed several times with water. This crystallization process leads to the major diastereoisomeric acid cis.\n\n\nThe yield range for the cyclization with hydrazine to obtain the main diastereoisomer cis is around 46-60%.\n\n\nIf the starting material is (E)-4-(4-substituted-phenyl)3-ethyl-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid, cis-5-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-ethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid is obtained. In this case, the yield for the cyclization is around 40%.\n\n\nThe reaction mixture can also be cooled down to room temperature and poured through an addition funnel to water, cooled in an ice bath with magnetically stirring. The addition must be slow and at least double the volume of water per volume of acetic acid is required. It should form a precipitate, but in the case a gum starts to be formed, it should be filtered and the rest of the material poured into another large volume of water. The solid obtained is suspended in water several times and filtered until the pH of the water is above 3. This solid also corresponds to the cis form.\n\n\nAlternatively, the dark mixture can be extracted with dichloromethane washed thoroughly with H\n2\nO, dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4 \nand evaporated to dryness. Recrystallisation of the crude material with toluene (3 to 4 mL of toluene per gram of material) allows the recovery of the major diastereoisomer cis.\n\n\nFormation of the methyl esters, followed by purification by column chromatography, allows the separation of the two diastereoisomeric forms. Then, a hydrolysis of the pure esters gives the corresponding acids cis and trans. Example: Methyl iodide (0.16 ml, 2.25 mmol) was added dropwise to a mixture of 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (0.47 g, 1.27 mmol) and KHCO\n3 \n(0.19 g, 1.9 mmol) in anhydrous dimethylformamide (10 ml) under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen overnight (ca 16 h). Water was added, the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and the combined organic layers were thoroughly washed with aq. NaCl. After drying over Na\n2\nSO\n4 \nand evaporation under reduced pressure, 0.5 g of the crude product were obtained. Purification by column chromatography (SiO\n2\n, 40:1 SiO\n2\n, packed with 100% hexane and eluted with a gradient of 1% to 5% ethyl acetate) affords 0.045 g (9% yield) of the minor isomer (trans racemic mixture) and 0.23 g (48% yield) of the major isomer (cis racemic mixture). Hydrolysis of the esters in the presence of NaOH leads to the corresponding acids.\n\n\nAnother way to acids trans is described below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a stirred solution of 2,4-dichloroaniline (1 g, 6.17 mmol) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (1.5 ml) in ice (1.5 ml) a solution of NaNO\n2 \n(0.460 mg, 6.68 mmol) in water (0.8 ml) is slowly added and the mixture is stirred for 1 h at 0-5° C. Then, this solution is added over a cold mixture of NaOAc (1.64 g, 19.6 mmol), ethanol (26 ml) and ethyl-2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (1.0 g, 6.06 mmol) and let stirring for 1 hour until the formed precipitate is collected by filtration, washed with ethanol and dichloromethane and dried in vacuo to give the yellow solid ethyl 2-chloro-2-(2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)hydrazono)acetate (70-80% yield), which is used in the next step without any further purification.\n\n\nThen, triethylamine (2.8 eq) is added to a solution of 2-chloro-2-(2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)hydrazono)acetate (1 eq) and a 4-substituted trans-β-methylstyrene (3 eq) in toluene, and the mixture is stirred at reflux temperature for 1 hour. The formed precipitate is removed by filtration after cooling to room temperature. The filtrate is concentrated and purified using a Combiflah system from Isco, eluting with cyclohexane and ethyl acetate (in a gradient program until 30% AcOEt), to obtain pure ethyl trans-5-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate, (˜40% yield). Another compound can be isolated from the purification, which is identified as the regioisomer ethyl trans-4-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate (˜10% yield).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nethyl trans-4-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (300 MHz, CHLOROFORM-d) δ ppm 1.00 (d, J=6.6 Hz, 3 H) 1.18 (t, J=7.2 Hz, 3 H) 4.06 (d, J=3.3 Hz, 1 H) 4.16 (m, 2 H) 4.91 (m, 1 H) 7.10-7.45 (m, 8 H)\n\n\nEthyl trans-5-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate is hydrolyzed in the presence of aqueous 2 M NaOH (2 eq) and tetrahydrofuran for 4 hours. Then, tetrahydrofuran is partially removed by evaporation, 1 M HCl is added until pH is below 3 and the aqueous mixture is extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to yield a white solid identified as trans-5-(4-substituted-phenyl)-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (85% yield). The resgioisomer ethyl trans-4-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate can be hydrolyzed in the same way.\n\n\nThe two enantiomers of each acid (cis or trans) can be separated by chiral HPLC or by crystallization of the diastereoisomeric salts formed with chiral amines.\n\n\ncis-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid\n\n\nIR (KBr, cm\n−1\n): 2976, 1682, 1566, 1542, 1490, 1270, 1242, 1117.\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CHLOROFORM-d) δ ppm 0.96 (d, J=7.42 Hz, 3 H) 3.82 (td, J=11.72, 7.42 Hz, 1 H) 5.91 (d, J=11.72 Hz, 1 H) 7.04 (d, J=8.60 Hz, 2 H) 7.11 (dd, J=8.60, 2.34 Hz, 1 H) 7.21-7.30 (m, 4 H)\n\n\n \n13\nC NMR (100 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ 13.6 (CH\n3\n), 43.5 (CH), 72.0 (CH), 124.9 (CH), 127.6 (CH), 129.1 (CH), 129.6 (CH), 130.9 (CH), 131.3 (C), 132.7 (C), 134.5 (C), 138.7 (C), 144.6 (C), 165.9 (CO).\n\n\ncis-5-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid\n\n\nIR (KBr, cm\n−1\n): 2976, 1683, 1541, 1486, 1385, 1270, 1242, 1116.\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ 0.96 (3H, d, J=7.3 Hz, CH\n3\n), 3.82 (1H, qd, J=11.9, 7.3, 7.3, 7.3 Hz, 1H), 5.88 (1H, d, J=11.9 Hz, CH), 6.99 (2H, ap d, J=8.4 Hz, ArH), 7.12 (1H, dd, J=8.7, 2.3 Hz, 1H), 7.17 (1H, m, ArH), 7.27 (1H, m, ArH), 7.39 (2H, d, J=8.4 Hz, ArH).\n\n\ncis-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid\n\n\nIR (KBr, cm\n−1\n): 2978, 1682, 1486, 1471, 1264, 1117.\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CHLOROFORM-d) δ ppm 0.97 (d, J=7.42 Hz, 3 H) 3.82 (td, J=11.72, 7.42 Hz, 1 H) 5.91 (d, J=12.0 Hz, 1 H), 6.95 (m, 2 H), 7.10 (m, 3 H), 7.20 (d, J=9.0 Hz, 1 H), 7.30 (d, J=3.0 Hz, 1 H).\n\n\ncis-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid\n\n\nIR (KBr, cm\n−1\n): 2936, 2836, 1681, 1612, 1512, 1480, 1460, 1248, 1113.\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ 0.97 (3H, d, J=7.3 Hz, CH\n3\n), 3.74 (3H, s, OCH\n3\n), 3.80 (1H, m, 1H), 5.88 (1H, d, J=11.8 Hz, CH), 6.76 (2H, ap d, J=8.6 Hz, ArH), 7.00 (2H, d, J=8.6, ArH), 7.09 (1H, dd, J=8.6, 2.3 Hz, ArH), 7.16-7.28 (2H, m, ArH).\n\n\ncis-5-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-ethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid\n\n\nIR (KBr, cm\n−1\n): 2969, 1682, 1480, 1452, 1270, 1236, 1151, 1106.\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ 0.69 (3H, t, J=7.4 Hz, CH\n3\n), 1.28-1.34 (1H, m, CHH), 1.95-2.00 (1H, m, CHH), 3.68 (1H, ddd, J=11.5, 9.7, 4.0 Hz, CH), 5.92 (1H, d, J=11.5 Hz, CH), 7.02 (2H, ap d, J=8.4 Hz, ArH), 7.09 (1H, dd, J=8.7, 2.4 Hz, ArH), 7.20 (1H, d, J=8.7 Hz, ArH), 7.28 (1H, d, J=2.4 Hz, ArH), 7.36 (2H, ap d, J=8.4 Hz, ArH);\n\n\n \n13\nC NMR (100 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ 12.4 (CH\n3\n), 20.0 (CH\n2\n), 50.5 (CH\n3\n), 52.3 (OCH\n3\n), 72.0 (CH), 122.5 (C), 124.8 (CH), 127.4 (C), 127.5 (CH), 129.9 (CH), 130.4 (CH), 131.1 (C), 131.7 (CH), 132.7 (C), 138.5 (C), 143.8 (C), 165.4 (CO).\n\n\ntrans-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CHLOROFORM-d) δ ppm 1.52 (d, J=7.03 Hz, 3 H) 3.52 (m, 1 H) 5.39 (d, J=5.47 Hz, 1 H) 7.08 (ddd, J=13.92, 5.62, 5.28 Hz, 3 H) 7.14-7.34 (m, 4 H)\n\n\n \n13\nC NMR (100 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ 18.4 (CH\n3\n), 48.9 (CH), 76.2 (CH), 126.4 (CH), 126.7 (C), 127.8 (CH), 128.0 (CH), 129.5 (CH), 130.5 (CH), 131.5 (C), 134.7 (C), 137.6 (C), 138.6 (C), 144.2 (C), 166.5 (CO).\n\n\ntrans-5-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ1.52 (3H, d, J=7.1 Hz, CH\n3\n), 3.52 (1H, m, 1H), 5.35 (1H, d, J=5.8 Hz, CH), 7.00 (2H, ap d, J=8.4 Hz, ArH), 7.10 (1H, dd, J=8.7, 2.3 Hz, 1H), 7.22 (1H, d, J=8.7, ArH), 7.27 (1H, d, J=2.3 Hz, ArH), 7.37 (2H, d, J=8.4 Hz, ArH).\n\n\n(c) cis or trans 5-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl (or 4-ethyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonyl chloride\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Where W has the meaning given above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncis or trans 5-(4-substituted-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl (or 4-ethyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (15 mmols) obtained according to step (b) was dissolved in 120 mL of dry toluene and thionyl chloride (18 mmols) was added.

In-vitro determination of affinity to CB1/CB2-Receptors\n\n\n\nThe in-vitro determination of the affinity of the inventive quaternary ammonium salts of substituted pyrazoline compounds to CB\n1\n/CB\n2\n-Receptors is carried out as described in the publication of Ruth A. Ross, Heather C. Brockie et al., “Agonist-inverse agonist characterization at CB\n1 \nand CB\n2 \ncannabinoid receptors of L-759633, L759656 and AM630”, British Journal of Pharmacology, 126, 665-672, (1999), whereby the transfected human CB\n1 \nand CB\n2 \nreceptors of Receptor Biology, Inc. are used. The radioligand used for both receptors is [\n3\nH]-CP55940. The respective parts of the description are hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure.\n\n\nResults:\n\n\nThe affinity of the inventive substituted pyrazoline compounds to CB\n1\n/CB\n2 \nreceptors was determined as described above. Some of the EC50-values obtained are given in the table 3 below:\n\n\nAs can be seen from the values given in table 3 the inventive pyrazoline compounds are particularly suitable for regulating the CB\n1\n-Receptor.\n\n\nII. In-Vivo Bioassay System for Determination of Cannabinoid Activity\n\n\nMouse Tetrad Model\n\n\nSubstances with affinity for cannabinoid receptors are known to produce a wide range of pharmacological effects. It is also known that intravenous administration of a substance with affinity for cannabinoid receptors in mice produces analgesia, hypothermia, sedation and catalepsy. Individually, none of these effects can be considered as proof that a tested substance has affinity for cannabinoid-receptors, since all of these effects are common for various classes of centrally active agents. However, substances, which show all of these effects, i.e. substances that are active in this so-called tetrad model are considered to have affinity for the cannabinoid receptors. It has further been shown that cannabinoid receptor antagonists are highly effective in blocking the effects of a cannabinoid agonist in the mouse tetrad model.\n\n\nThe tetrad model is described, for example, in the publication of A. C. Howlett et al, International Union of Pharmacology XXVII. Classification of Cannabinoid Receptors, Pharmacol Rev 54,161-202, 2002 and David R. Compton et al., “In-vivo Characterization of a Specific Cannabinoid Receptor Antagonist (SR141716A): Inhibition of Tetrahydrocannbinol-induced Responses and Apparent Agonist Activity”, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 277, 2, 586-594, 1996. The corresponding parts of the description are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\n\nMale NMRI mice with a weight of 20-30 g (Harlan, Barcelona, Spain) are used in all of the following experiments.\n\n\nBefore testing in the behavioral procedures given below, mice are acclimatized to the experimental setting. Pre-Treatment control values are determined for analgesia hot plate latency (in seconds), rectal temperature, sedation and catalepsy.\n\n\nIn order to determine the agonistic activity of the substance to be tested, the mice are injected intravenously with the substance to be tested or the vehicle alone. 15 minutes after injection, latency in hot plate analgesia is measured. Rectal temperature, sedation and catalepsy are measured 20 minutes after injection.\n\n\nIn order to determine the antagonistic activity the identical procedure is used as for the determination of the agonistic effects, but with the difference that the substance to be evaluated for its antagonistic activity is injected 5 minutes before the intravenous injection of 1.25 mg/kg Win-55,212 a known cannabinoid-receptor agonist.\n\n\nHot Plate Analgesia\n\n\nThe hot plate analgesia is determined according to the method described in Woolfe D. et al. “The evaluation of analgesic action of pethidine hydrochloride (Demerol)”, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 80, 300-307, 1944. The respective description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure.\n\n\nThe mice are placed on a hot plate (Harvard Analgesimeter) at 55±0.5° C. until they show a painful sensation by licking their paws or jumping and the time for these sensations to occur is recorded. This reading is considered the basal value (B). The maximum time limit the mice are allowed to remain on the hot plate in absence of any painful response is 40 seconds in order to prevent skin damage. This period is called the cut-off time (PC).\n\n\nFifteen minutes after the administration of the substance to be tested, the mice are again placed on the hot plate and the afore described procedure is repeated. This period is called the post-treatment reading (PT).\n\n\nThe degree of analgesia is calculated from the formula:\n\n\n% MPE of Analgesia=(\nPT−B\n)/(\nPC−B\n)×100\n\n\n\nMPE=Maximum possible effect.\n\n\nDetermination of Sedation and Ataxia\n\n\nSedation and ataxia is determined according to the method described in Desmet L. K. C. et al. “Anticonvulsive properties of Cinarizine and Flunarizine in Rats and Mice”, Arzneim. -Forsch. (Frug Res) 25, 9, 1975. The respective description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure.\n\n\nThe chosen scoring system is\n\n \n \n0: no ataxia;\n \n1: doubtful;\n \n2: obvious calmness and quiet;\n \n3 pronounced ataxia;\n \n\n\nprior to as well as after treatment.\n\n\nThe percentage of sedation is determined according to the formula:\n\n\n% of sedation=arithmetic mean/3×100\n\n\nHypothermia:\n\n\n\nHypothermia is determined according to the method described in David R. Compton et al. “In-vivo Characterization of a Specific Cannabinoid Receptor Antagonist (SR141716A) Inhibition of Tetrahydrocannbinol-induced Responses and Apparent Agonist Activity”, J. Pharmacol Exp Ther. 277, 2, 586-594, 1996. The respective description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure.\n\n\nThe base-line rectal temperatures are determined with a thermometer (Yello Springs Instruments Co., Panlabs) and a thermistor probe inserted to 25 mm before the administration of the substance to be tested. Rectal temperature is again measured 20 minutes after the administration of the substances to be tested. The temperature difference is calculated for each animal, whereby differences of ≧−2° C. are considered to represent activity.\n\n\nCatalepsy:\n\n\nCatalepsy is determined according to the method described in Alpermann H. G. et al. “Pharmacological effects of Hoe 249: A new potential antidepressant”, Drugs Dev. Res. 25, 267-282. 1992. The respective description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the present disclosure.\n\n\nThe cataleptic effect of the substance to be tested is evaluated according to the duration of catalepsy, whereby the animals are placed head downwards with their kinlegs upon the top of the wooden block.\n\n\nThe chosen scoring system is:\n\n\nCatalepsy for:\n\n\nmore than 60 seconds=6; 50-60 seconds=5, 40-50 seconds=4, 30-40 seconds=3, 20-30 seconds=2, 5-10 seconds=1, and less than 5 seconds=0.\n\n\nThe percentage of catalepsy is determined according of the following formula:\n\n\n% Catalepsy=arithmetic mean/6×100\n\n\nAntagonistic Assay:\n\n\nMaterials and Methods.\n\n\nMembrane Preparation:\n\n\n\nChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing recombinant human cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1) were cultured in nutrient mixture Ham's F 12 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 U/ml streptomycin and 0.5 mg/ml geneticin. In order to obtain cells, culture flasks were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline and scraped. Then, cells were collected by centrifugation (200×g, 10 min) and stored dry at −80° C. Cells were homogenized in ice-cold 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 40,000×g for 15 min at 4° C. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5) and centrifuged for 15 min at 4° C. The final pellet was resuspended in 20 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), and divided in aliquots and stored at −80° C. until use.\n\n\n[\n35\nS]GTPγS Binding Assay:\n\n\nThe reaction was performed in 96-well plates. Membranes (15 □g protein/well) were incubated for 60 min at 30° C. in buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% wt/vol bovine serum albumin, 5 μM GDP, saponin (10 μg/ml), 0.5 nM [\n35\nS]GTPγS, pH 7.4) with compound at 1 μM final concentration in either the absence or presence of dose response curve of agonist WIN 55,212-2 between 3 nM and 3 μM. The incubation was terminated by rapid filtration through Millipore Multiscreen glass fiber FB, and rinsed two-times with ice-cold assay buffer. Filter plates were dried and 30 μl of scintillation liquid was added. Radioactivity was determined using Wallac Microbeta Trilux. Each experiment was performed at least in duplicate. A WIN 55,212-2 dose-response was systematically performed.\n\n\nCalculations:\n\n\nThe average of basal [\n35\nS]GTPγS binding was subtracted from all binding data. In order to compare the antagonism results from one screening campaign to another one, the difference between the maximal agonist effect of WIN 55,212-2 alone, and the maximal antagonism effect due to WIN 55,212-2 with an internal standard CB1-antagonist was defined as 100%.\n\n\nResults:\n\n\nThe determination of cannabinoid activity in-vivo was determined as described above. The antagonistic effect (against Win 55212-2) was determined for some of the compounds as given in the table 3 below:\n\n\nThe results of testing some of the above examples for binding and antagonism are shown together in the following table 3:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExample\n \nIC50 (nM)\n \nAntagonism (%)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n31.9\n \n 79 ± 18\n \n \n \n5\n \n30\n \n  58.1\n \n \n \n7\n \n112\n \n83 ± 0\n \n \n \n11\n \n66\n \n78 ± 8\n \n \n \n17\n \n \n \n13\n \n \n \n18\n \n69\n \n93 ± 8\n \n \n \n29\n \n \n \n37\n \n \n \n30\n \n \n \n85\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIII.

(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present application claims the benefits of the filing of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/734,984 filed Apr. 13, 2007, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/797,504 filed May 3, 2006. The complete disclosures of the aforementioned related patent applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nNoxious chemical, thermal and mechanical stimuli excite peripheral nerve endings of small diameter sensory neurons (nociceptors) deriving from sensory ganglia (e.g., dorsal root, nodose and trigeminal ganglia) and initiate signals that are perceived as pain. Such nociceptive neurons (i.e., nociceptors) are crucial for the detection of harmful or potentially harmful stimuli (e.g., noxious thermal, chemical, and/or mechanical) that arise from changes in the extracellular environment during inflammatory, ischemic or otherwise traumatic conditions and that cause or have the potential to cause tissue damage (Wall, P. D., and Melzack, R., Textbook of Pain, 1994, New York: Churchill Livingstone).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNociceptors transduce noxious stimuli into membrane depolarization that leads to an action potential, its subsequent conduction to the CNS, and ultimately to the perception of pain, discomfort, etc. as well as to certain responses thereto. At the molecular level, nociception is carried out by ion channels and/or receptors. Plant-derived vanilloid compounds (e.g., capsaicin and resiniferatoxin) are known to selectively depolarize nociceptors and elicit sensations of burning pain: the sensation that is typically evoked by capsaicin-containing hot chili peppers. Therefore, capsaicin mimics the action of physiological/endogenous stimuli that activate the “nociceptive pathway”. Recent advances in pain biology have identified a receptor, called VR1 (a.k.a. capsaicin receptor or TRPV1) for vanilloids, protons and noxious heat. Because nociceptors are drivers of unwanted pain and inflammatory conditions in human beings and animals, modulation of their function is a validated strategy for palliative and other analgesic therapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds that are modulators (competitive and non-competitive agonists or antagonists [with respect to capsaicin and/or its recognition site] and allosteric modulators) at VR1 have broad therapeutic potential, as demonstrated by the clinical usefulness of marketed, VR1-targeted pharmaceutical agents or the efficacy of VR1 modulators in animal models of disease. Furthermore, it is recognized that agonist modulators of VR1 may possess clinical utility deriving from their agonist properties, per se, and/or from their ability to produce an agonist-mediated desensitization, which would indirectly manifest as a functional antagonism. Similarly, antagonist modulators could exhibit direct antagonist (competitive or non-competitive) properties and/or indirect antagonist properties via the aforementioned desensitization mechanism. It is further recognized that positive and negative allosteric modulators may produce any or all of the aforementioned functional consequences and, as such, may also have clinical utility. Accordingly, this invention is directed to each of these types of modulators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective use of VR1 agonists has been demonstrated in inflammatory, neuropathic, and visceral pain states. In an experimental human pain model, dermal capsaicin pretreatment reduced the pain caused by intradermal injection of an acidic solution (Bianco, E. D.; Geppetti, P.; Zippi, P.; Isolani, D.; Magini, B.; Cappugi, P. Brit J of Clin Pharmacol 1996, 41, 1-6), suggesting the benefit of VR1 agonists in the treatment of inflammatory pain. A particular role for VR1 agonists has been shown in inflammation and inflammatory pain: for example, resiniferatoxin prevented inflammatory hypersensitivity and edema induction by carrageenan (Kissin, I.; Bright, C. A.; Bradley, E. L., Jr. Anesth Analg 2002, 94, 1253-1258).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, capsaicin-containing creams (for example, Axcain® and Lidocare®) are marketed for dermal relief of pain related to diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, indicative of the usefulness of VR1 agonists in the treatment of neuropathic pain states. Furthermore, such creams have been shown to reduce postsurgical neuropathic pain (Ellison, N., Loprinzi, C. L., Kugler, J., Hatfield, A. K., Miser, A., Sloan, J. A., Wender, D. B., Rowland, K. M., Molina, R., Cascino, T. L., Vukov, A. M., Dhaliwal, H. S. and Ghosh, C. J. Clin. Oncol. 15:2974-2980, 1997). In cancer patients, capsaicin contained in a taffy vehicle, was shown to substantially reduce oral mucositis pain caused by chemotherapy and radiation therapy (Berger, A., Henderson, M., Naadoolman, W., Duffy, V., Cooper, D., Saberski, L. and Bartoshuk, L. J. Pain Sympt. Mgmt 10:243-248, 1995.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVR1 also plays a role in the physiology of bladder emptying. VR1 is expressed by bladder sensory neurons, where it modulates bladder responsivity to liquid filling. The VR1 agonist resiniferatoxin desensitized bladder afferents in a dose-dependent manner (Avelino, A.; Cruz, F.; Coimbra, A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999, 378, 17-22), supporting its usefulness for the treatment of overactive bladder (Chancellor, M. B.; De Groat, W. C. J. Urol. (Baltimore) 1999, 162, 3-11). Indeed, intravesicular administration of capsaicin or resiniferatoxin inhibited bladder contraction in both normal and spinal cord injured rats (Komiyama, I.; Igawa, Y.; Ishizuka, O.; Nishizawa, O.; Andersson, K.-E. J. Urol. (Baltimore) 1999, 161, 314-319), indicative of the usefulness of VR1 agonists in nerve-injured incontinent patients. The effectiveness of capsaicin or resiniferatoxin treatment on incontinence in spinal cord injured patients was confirmed in a clinical study (de Seze, M.; Wiart, L.; de Seze, M.-P.; Soyeur, L.; Dosque, J.-P.; Blajezewski, S.; Moore, N.; Brochet, B.; Mazaux, J.-M.; Barat, M.; Joseph, P.-A. Journal of Urology (Hagerstown, Md., United States) 2003, 171, 251-255).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of VR1 agonists in the reduction of elevated blood pressure is suggested by capsaicin reduction in blood pressure in SHR and WKY rats (Li, J.; Kaminski, N. E.; Wang, D. H. Hypertension 2003, 41, 757-762.). Capsaicin was also gastroprotective with respect to gastric antral ulcers (Yamamoto, H.; Horie, S.; Uchida, M.; Tsuchiya, S.; Murayama, T.; Watanabe, K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001, 432, 203-210).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVR1 antagonists also may be useful in the treatment of inflammatory, neuropathic and visceral pain. For example, the therapeutic utility of VR1 antagonists has been demonstrated in visceral inflammatory conditions. VR1 is elevated in colonic nerve fibers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and VR1 antagonists relieved pain and dysmotility (Yiangou, Y.; Facer, P.; Dyer, N. H.; Chan, C. L.; Knowles, C.; Williams, N. S.; Anand, P. Lancet 2001, 357, 1338-1339). Intestinal inflammation induced by toxin A or dextran sulfate sodium in rodents was attenuated by VR1 antagonists (McVey, D. C.; Schmid, P. C.; Schmid, H. H. O.; Vigna, S. R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 304, 713-722). In addition, a synthetic VR1 antagonist reduced colitis disease scores at several important endpoints, including macroscopic damage, microscopic epithelial damage, myeloperoxidase levels, and diarrhea scores, strongly supporting the therapeutic use of VR1 antagonists in inflammatory bowel diseases (Kimball, E. S.; Wallace, N. H.; Schneider, C. R.; D'Andrea, M. R.; Hornby, P. J. Neurogasteroenterology 2004, 16, 811-818). The VR1 antagonists capsazepine and BCTC reversed mechanical hyperalgesia in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain in guinea pigs (Walker, K. M.; Urban, L.; Medhurst, S. J.; Patel, S.; Panesar, M.; Fox, A. J.; McIntyre, P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 304, 56-62) and rats (Pomonis, J. D.; Harrison, J. E.; Mark, L.; Bristol, D. R.; Valenzano, K. J.; Walker, K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 306, 387-393).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLPS-induced fever was attenuated in VR1 knock out mice (Lida, T.; Shimizu, I.; Nealen, M. L.; Campbell, A.; Caterina, M. Neurosci. Lett. 2005, 378, 28-33). VR1 agonist-induced rises in core body temperature were suppressed by capsazepine, indicative of the usefulness of VR1 antagonists in the treatment of pyresis (Ohnluki, K.; Haramizu, S.; Watanabe, T.; Yazawa, S.; Fushiki, T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo) 2001, 47, 295-298).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVR1 agonists also modulate body temperature and fever. In ferret, rat and mouse, administration of resiniferatoxin-induced hypothermia (Woods, A. J.; Stock, M. J.; Gupta, A. N.; Wong, T. T. L.; Andrews, P. L. R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994, 264, 125-133). Additionally, phase I of LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced fever did not occur in animals desensitized with low intraperitoneal doses of capsaicin (Romanovsky, A. A. Frontiers in Bioscience 2004, 9, 494-504).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic potential of VR1 antagonists in inflammatory bronchial conditions is demonstrated by the finding that they antagonize capsaicin- and acid-induced bronchoconstriction (Nault, M. A.; Vincent, S. G.; Fisher, J. T. J. Physiol. 1999, 515, 567-578). Related findings demonstrate that the VR1 antagonist capsazepine attenuates anandamide-induced cough in guinea pigs (Jia, Y.; McLeod, R. L.; Wang, X.; Parra, L. E.; Egan, R. W.; Hey, J. A. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 2002, 137, 831-836).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe VR1 antagonist capsazepine was demonstrated to significantly reduce anxiety-like behaviors in rats using the elevated plus maze (Kasckow, J. W.; Mulchahey, J. J.; Geracioti, T. D. Jr. Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacol. and Biological Psychiatry 2004, 28, 291-295). Thus, VR1 antagonists may have utility in the treatment of anxiety, panic disorders, phobias or other non-adaptive stress responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat.

There is also a need for novel benzimidazole compounds that act as potent functional antagonists and/or agonists of the human and rat VR1 ion channel. Finally, there is a need for novel benzimidazoles that bind with high affinity to VR1 and also act as potent functional antagonists of the human and rat VR1 ion channel.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to a compound of Formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand a form thereof, wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3a\n, R\n3b\n, R\n4\n, p, q, r, L and A\n1 \nare as defined herein, and their use as potent modulators of VR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is also directed to a method for treating a VR1 ion channel mediated disease in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I).

\nAs modulators of the vanilloid VR1 ion channel, the compounds of Formula (I) are useful in methods for treating a VR1 ion channel mediated disease in a subject which disease is affected by the modulation of one or more vanilloid receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention is directed to a method of treating a VR1 ion channel mediated disease in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a salt or solvate thereof.\n\n\n \nCompound Forms\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term “form” means, in reference to compounds of the present invention, such may exist as, without limitation, a salt, stereoisomer, tautomer, crystalline, polymorph, amorphous, solvate, hydrate, ester, prodrug or metabolite form. The present invention encompasses all such compound forms and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “isolated form” means, in reference to compounds of the present invention, that such may exist in an essentially pure state such as, without limitation, an enantiomer, a racemic mixture, a geometric isomer (such as a cis or trans stereoisomer), a mixture of geometric isomers, and the like. The present invention encompasses all such isolated forms and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of Formula (I) may exist in various stereoisomeric or tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof. The invention encompasses all such compounds and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be present in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. For use in medicines, the “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” of the compounds of this invention refer to non-toxic acidic/anionic or basic/cationic salt forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore when the compounds of the present invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may include alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts; and salts formed with suitable organic ligands, e.g. quaternary ammonium salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, representative pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the following: acetate, adipate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, bromide, calcium, camsylate (or camphorsulphonate), carbonate, chloride, choline, clavulanate, citrate, dihydrochloride, disodium, edetate, fumarate, gluconate, glutamate, hydrabamine, hydrobromine, hydrochloride, iodide, isothionate, lactate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, nitrate, oleate, pamoate, palmitate, phosphate/diphosphate, salicylate, sodium, stearate, sulfate, succinate, tartrate, tromethane, tosylate, trichloroacetate, trifluoroacetate and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example of the present invention includes compounds of Formula (I) and a salt form thereof wherein the salt is selected from the group consisting of disodium, hydrochloride and sodium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes compounds of various isomers and mixtures thereof. The term “isomer” refers to compounds that have the same composition and molecular weight but differ in physical and/or chemical properties. Such substances have the same number and kind of atoms but differ in structure. The structural difference may be in constitution (geometric isomers) or in an ability to rotate the plane of polarized light (stereoisomers).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “optical isomer” means isomers of identical constitution that differ only in the spatial arrangement of their groups. Optical isomers rotate the plane of polarized light in different directions. The term “optical activity” means the degree to which an optical isomer rotates the plane of polarized light.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “racemate” or “racemic mixture” means an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, wherein each of the isolated species rotates the plane of polarized light in the opposite direction such that the mixture is devoid of optical activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “enantiomer” means an isomer having a nonsuperimposable mirror image. The term “diastereomer” means stereoisomers that are not enantiomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “chiral” means a molecule, which in a given configuration, cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This is in contrast to achiral molecules, which can be superimposed on their mirror images.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is considered to include the tautomeric forms of all compounds of Formula (I). In addition, for chiral embodiments of the invention, the invention is considered to include pure enantiomers, racemic mixtures, as well as mixtures of enantiomers having 0.001% to 99.99% enantiomeric excess. In addition, some of the compounds represented by Formula (I) may be prodrugs, i.e., derivatives of a drug that possess superior delivery capabilities and therapeutic value as compared to the active drug. Prodrugs are transformed into active drugs by in vivo enzymatic or chemical processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe two distinct mirror image versions of the chiral molecule are also known as levo (left-handed), abbreviated L, or dextro (right handed), abbreviated D, depending on which way they rotate polarized light. The symbols “R” and “S” represent the configuration of groups around a stereogenic carbon atom(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example of an enantiomerically enriched form isolated from a racemic mixture includes a dextrorotatory enantiomer, wherein the mixture is substantially free of the levorotatory isomer. In this context, substantially free means the levorotatory isomer may, in a range, comprise less than 25% of the mixture, less than 10%, less than 5%, less than 2% or less than 1% of the mixture according to the formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlevorotatory\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlevorotatory\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndextrorotatory\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlevorotatory\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, an example of an enantiomerically enriched form isolated from a racemic mixture includes a levorotatory enantiomer, wherein the mixture is substantially free of the dextrorotatory isomer.

Substituent atoms (other than hydrogen) on each side of a carbon-carbon double bond may be in an E or Z configuration. In the “E” configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides in relationship to the carbon-carbon double bond. In the “Z” configuration, the substituents are oriented on the same side in relationship to the carbon-carbon double bond. The scope of the present invention is intended to include all such “E” and “Z” isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstituent atoms (other than hydrogen) attached to a ring system may be in a cis or trans configuration. In the “cis” configuration, the substituents are on the same side in relationship to the plane of the ring; in the “trans” configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides in relationship to the plane of the ring. Compounds having a mixture of “cis” and “trans” species are designated “cis/trans”. The scope of the present invention is intended to include all such “cis” and “trans” isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe isomeric descriptors (“R,” “S,” “E,” and “Z”) indicate atom configurations relative to a core molecule and are intended to be used as defined in the literature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, compounds of the present invention may have at least one crystalline, polymorph or amorphous form. The plurality of such forms is included in the scope of the invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents (e.g., organic esters such as ethanolate and the like). The plurality of such solvates is also intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \nChemical Nomenclature and Definitions\n\n\n \n \n \nBond lines drawn into a ring system from a substituent variable indicate that the substituent may be attached to any of the substitutable ring atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the following terms are intended to have the following meanings (additional definitions are provided where prophetic throughout the Specification).

A suitably substituted phenyl group can be appended to AA3 by a variety of coupling reactions (Suzuki, Stille) that are well known to those versed in the art. A particularly useful substitution method employs a palladium catalyzed cross-coupling Suzuki reaction (Huff, B. et. al. \nOrg. Syn. \n1997, 75: 53-60; and, Goodson, F. E. et. al. \nOrg.

In this instance, borane DD2 is reacted with a suitable aryl halide, tetrakis (triphenylphosphine) palladium (0) and tri-tert-butylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate in 2M aqueous potassium carbonate in toluene at 100° C. to give the protected form of DD3.

As an example, reaction of EE1 in a solvent such as THF with a substituted acid chloride and a base such as triethylamine gives the corresponding amide of EE2. As a further example, reaction of EE1 in THF with a substituted chloroformate and triethylamine gives the corresponding substituted carbamate of EE2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEE1 can be converted to sulfonamides by utilizing various sulfonylation conditions. For instance, reaction of EE1 in a solvent such as THF with an alkylsulfonyl chloride and triethylamine gives the alkylsulfonamide EE3. EE1 can be selectively, and successively substituted to give EE3. An efficient method of achieving this is via reductive alkylation with aldehydes or ketones (see Mattson, R. J. et. al. \nJ. Org. Chem. \n1990, 55, 2552-2554) and references cited therein]. In this procedure, equal amounts of EE1 and an aldehyde or ketone are stirred with titanium (IV) isopropoxide, followed the addition of sodium cyanoborohydride in a solvent such as ethanol to give substituted amine EE3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReaction Scheme FF\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA synthetic sequence to produce compounds of the present invention wherein L is cyclopropyl is described in reaction Scheme FF.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReaction of cinnamate ester FF1, in this case a methyl ester, with trimethylsulfonium iodide methylide in a solvent such as DMSO and sodium hydride (as exemplified by Burger, A. et. al. \nJ.

An exotherm developed (about 38-40° C.), which was maintained for 30 min. Piperidine (14.202 mL, 143.58 mmol) was then added to the reaction and a second exotherm developed (T\nmax \nabout 42° C. after about 10 min.). The reaction was stirred for 30 min and then heated to 60° C. for 18 h (overnight). The reaction appeared to be complete by TLC, and was cooled to about 40° C., diluted into water (2 L; done to prevent reaction freezing), cooled to room temperature, and further diluted with water (4 L, 6 L total). The slurry was acidified to pH=2.0-3.0 with concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 675-700 mL). The material was stirred for 30 min., and a white solid was collected by filtration. The filter cake was washed with water until the filtrate was neutral (pH about 5.5-6, 2.5 L), air-dried in a Buchner funnel for 2 h, and then further dried in a vacuum oven at 60° C. overnight to provide 300.5 g (96%) of the title Compound 10a as a white solid.\n\n\n \nStep B. (E)-5-bromo-2-[2-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-vinyl]-1H-benzimidazole\n\n\n \n \n \nTo a 5-L 4-neck round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, argon inlet-argon outlet to a carbonate scrub, two stoppers, and a room temperature water bath was charged with 4-(trifluoromethyl)cinnamic acid (315 g, 1.46 mol) and dichloromethane (3.15 L) to give a slurry. To the slurry was added oxalyl chloride (151.71 mL, 1.75 mol) and DMF (1.13 mL, 14.57 mmol). Upon addition of DMF, gas evolution commenced, and the reaction was continued for about 3 h during which time a solution developed. When the reaction was complete (LC-MS), it was concentrated to dryness to give 342.4 g of 3-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-acryloyl chloride Compound 10b (>100%) as a yellow oily solid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 5-L 4-neck round bottom flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, thermocouple, air condenser with argon inlet, and a stopper was charged with 4-bromo-benzene-1,2-diamine (244 g, 1.27 mol) and acetic acid (2.13 L). To this solution was added a solution of Compound 10b (327 g, 1.39 mol) in toluene (237 mL). After this addition, the temperature spiked to 45° C. in about 30 seconds and then subsided. The reaction was then heated to 90° C. for 16 h (overnight). The reaction was cooled to 40° C., and poured into a mixed solution of EtOAc and heptane (about 1:3, 5.75 L) and a precipitate occurred. The resulting slurry was stirred for 3 h, and the solid was collected by filtration, washed with EtOAc:heptane (1:3, 3 L), and then dried in a vacuum oven (60° C.) to give 324.3 g (65%) of the title Compound 10c as a partial acetate salt.\n\n\n \nStep C. 2-(2-bromo-phenyl)-propan-2-ol\n\n\n \n \n \nA 12-Liter 4-neck flask equipped with a thermocouple, condenser, septum, addition funnel and overhead mechanical stirrer under argon was charged with methyl-2-bromobenzoate (226.5 g, 1.05 mol) and THF (1.6 L, 19.66 mol). The mixture was cooled to a temperature between 2 and 5° C. with stirring and held for 30 min. To the solution was slowly added methyl magnesium bromide in diethyl ether (3M, 1.05 L; 3.15 mol) via the addition funnel at a rate to maintain the reaction temperature below 15° C. An exotherm was observed during the addition, the reaction temperature warmed from 3 to 15° C. The addition of 1.05 L Grignard was complete in 4 h (approximate feed rate was 4.17 mL/min). The reaction mixture appeared to be off-white/yellow slurry. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight (15 h). The reaction was sampled by HPLC/TLC and showed no starting material present. The ice bath was again applied to the reaction flask and a 0.5 M HCl solution (4.5 L; 2.25 mol) was slowly added over a period of 2 h. The temperature increased dramatically from 0 to 15° C. After the quench was complete, the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Additional 2 N HCl (500 mL; 1.00 mol) was slowly added to maintain a pH less than 6. MTBE (1 L) was added to help with the phase split. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 1 to 2 h to dissolve the solid material into the aqueous phase (most likely Mg(OH)\n2 \nwhich is very basic). The pH must be checked and adjusted with additional acid when necessary. The phases were separated and the aqueous layer was washed with an additional 1 L MTBE (2×500 mL). The organic phases were combined, washed with NaHCO\n3 \nsolution (2×300 mL), dried over MgSO\n4\n, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to yield the title Compound 10d (220.83 g, 97.48% yield) as a clear yellow oil.\n\n\n \nStep D. 3,3-dimethyl-3H-benzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-1-ol\n\n\n \n \n \nA 12-Liter 4-neck round bottom flask equipped with a thermocouple, condenser, addition funnel and overhead mechanical stirrer under dry Argon was charged with anhydrous THF, (3 L) and chilled to −70 to −78° C. via a dry ice/acetone bath. n-Butyl lithium (2.5N in hexanes, 860 mL, 2.15 mol) was slowly added via addition funnel. An exotherm was observed as the temperature rose from −78 to −70° C. To the addition funnel was added a solution of Compound 10d (220 g, 979.97 mmol) in anhydrous THF (1 L). The 2-(2-bromophenyl)propan-2-ol solution was slowly added to the n-BuLi solution. The addition took 90 min in order to maintain a reaction temperature below −70° C. After the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was stirred at −70 to −75° C. for 30 min. The triethylborate (230 mL, 1.35 mol) was quickly added in 3 portions at −70° C. An exotherm was observed, the batch temperature rose from −70 to −64° C. The reaction was stirred at −70° C. and slowly warmed to room temperature over night. After the reaction was cooled to 0-5° C., the reaction was slowly quenched with 2 M HCl (1 L, 2.00 mol) added via the addition funnel while maintaining the batch temperature 0-5° C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h. The aqueous phase pH was 9-10. The pH was then adjusted to acidic (4-5) with 2 M HCl (200 mL). The two phases were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with MTBE (2×500 mL). The combined organic phases were dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solution was filtered and concentrated to yield a yellow oil. The yellow oil was diluted with MTBE (1.5 L) and washed with 1M NaOH (3×500 mL). The product containing basic aqueous phases were combined and acidified with 2 M HCl (800 mL) (the clear solution turns turbid with the addition of acid). After stirring the turbid solution for 15 min (pH=4-5) (Note 1), it was extracted with MTBE (2×500 mL). The organic phases were combined and dried over MgSO\n4\n. The solution was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to yield the title Compound 10e as a clear yellow oil (121.78 grams, 77% yield).\n\n\n \nStep E. (E)-2-(2-{2-[2-(4-Trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-vinyl]-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl}-phenyl)-propan-2-ol\n\n\n \n \n \nA 5-L 4-neck flask equipped with a thermocouple controller, condenser, overhead mechanical stirrer, Firestone Valve® and a nitrogen inlet/outlet was charged with dimethoxyethane (2 L), DI water (1 L) and sodium carbonate (230.9 g, 2.18 mol). The solution was degassed and purged with N\n2 \nthree times. Compound 10e (71.7 g, 0.35 mol) and Compound 10c (100.0 g, 0.27 mol) were added to the degassed solution. The solution was degassed and purged with N\n2 \nthree times. PdCl\n2\n(dppf) (44.48 g, 54.4 mmol) was added to the solution, and the solution was degassed and purged with N\n2 \nthree times. The resulting two-phase suspension was heated to reflux for 18 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was transferred to a 12-L separatory funnel, and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with brine (1 L). The two aqueous layers were combined and extracted with EtOAc (1 L). The combined organic layers were dried (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n), filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to an oil. Two separate 100 g coupling reactions were combined and purified by chromatography in 10 successive chromatography runs on an ISCO preparative chromatography system (10×1.5 Kg SiO2, 5 column volumes of EtOAc, 250 mL/min flow rate). The combined fractions were transferred to two 22 L 4-neck round bottom flasks, and Silicycle Si-thiol functionalized silica gel (2 g) was added to each solution. The solutions were warmed to 40° C. and aged for 1 h. The solutions were filtered thru a medium glass funnel and washed with EtOAc (4 L) and combined. The filtrate was evaporated to a semi solid, which was transferred to a 2 L round bottom flask, to which EtOAc (0.4 L) was added. The resulting white precipitate slurry was cooled to −5° C. and stirred for 1 h. The slurry was filtered and washed twice with cold EtOAc (100 mL). The solids were dried in a vacuum oven at 40° C. for 40 h to afford 84.0 g (36.5% yield, 98.8 area % purity) of the title Compound 18 as a white solid. Anal.

N-methylbenzenesulfonamide-2-boronic acid\n\n\n \n \n \nTo a solution of N-methylbenzenesulfonamide (2.00 g, 0.0117 mmol) in 20 mL THF at 0° C. was added dropwise n-butyl lithium (1.6 M in hexanes, 14.6 mL, 0.0234 mmol). After 30 min., triisopropyl borate (3.1 mL, 0.0164 mmol) was added, and the mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 2 hours. The reaction was quenched by addition of 20 mL of 1M HCl (aq). The mixture was extracted with EtOAc, and the organic fractions were washed with brine, dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to provide the title Compound 18a as a yellow oil. \n1\nH-NMR (400 MHz, CD\n3\nOD) δ (ppm): 7.81 (d, 1H) 7.62-7.56 (m, 2H) 2.52 (s, 3H).\n\n\n \nStep B.

The reaction mixture was cooled, and concentrated. The residue was purified by chromatography (silica gel, hexanes:EtOAc, 2:1) to provide the title Compound 18b as a yellow oil. \n1\nH-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 8.12 (d, 1H) 7.86 (d, 1H) 7.62-7.46 (m, 3H) 7.22 (d, 1H) 7.14 (d, 1H) 2.62 (d, 3H) 1.55 (s, 9H) 1.44 (s, 9H).\n\n\n \nStep C. 3′,4′-diamino-biphenyl-2-sulfonic acid methylamide\n\n\n \n \n \nA solution of Compound 18b (21.4 g, 0.0995 mol) in 210 mL of 4M HCl in dioxane was stirred for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated, made basic with 1M NaOH (aq), and extracted with EtOAc. The organic fraction was dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to provide the title Compound 18c as a brown oil. \n1\nH-NMR (400 MHz, CD\n3\nOD) δ (ppm): 8.00 (dd, 1H, J=1.6 and 8.0 Hz) 7.59 (dt, 1H, J=1.6 and 8.4 Hz) 7.48 (dt, 1H, J=1.2 and 8.4 Hz) 7.33 (dd, 1H, J=1.2 and 8.0 Hz) 6.79 (d, 1H, J=2.0 Hz) 6.75 (d, 1H, J=8.4 Hz) 6.68 (d, 1H, J=2.0 and 7.6 Hz) 2.93 (s, 3H) MS (ESI, pos. ion) m/z: 277.9 (M+1).\n\n\n \nStep D. (E)-N-methyl-2-{2-[2-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-vinyl]-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl}-benzenesulfonamide\n\n\n \n \n \nA mixture of Compound 18c (0.100 g, 0.361 mmol) and 4-trifluoromethyl cinnamic acid (0.324 mmol) in 2 mL of POCl\n3 \nwas heated to 100° C. for 14 hours. Evaporation of the reaction mixture provided a residue, which was then purified by HPLC (H\n2\nO:MeCN, 90:10 to 30:70, over 15 min) to provide the title Compound 310 as a white solid. \n1\nH-NMR (400

Increases in Ca\n++\n concentration were readily detected upon challenge with capsaicin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHEK293 cells expressing hVR1 were grown on poly-D-lysine coated 384 well black-walled plates (BD 354663) and 1 day later loaded with Calcium 3 Dye for 35 min at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nand then for 25 min at room temperature, and subsequently tested for agonist-induced increases in intracellular Ca\n2+\n levels using FLIPR™ technology. Cells were challenged with test compounds (at varying concentrations) and intracellular Ca\n2+\n was measured for 5 min prior to the addition of capsaicin to all wells to achieve a final concentration of 0.030 μM eliciting about 80% maximal response. IC\n50 \nvalues were determined from concentration-response studies, which were generated using the average of quadruplicate wells for each data point.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor those compounds tested, an IC\n50 \n(nM) value and percent inhibition value is shown in Table 2. Except where indicated, the percent inhibition values were obtained at a test concentration of 1 μM; otherwise: \n(1)\nthe test concentration was 5 μM. The percent inhibition value is provided for those compounds where an IC\n50 \nvalue was not obtained. The term “NA” means that the data is “not available” because it was not obtained for a particular compound.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCpd\n\n\n%

inflammatory pain. To assess the ability of test compounds to reverse thermal hyperalgesia, baseline response latencies on a radiant heat (RH) paw stimulator were obtained before an intraplantar injection of 100 μL (1 μg/μL) CFA (1:1 CFA:saline) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Only withdrawal responses that were quick hind paw movements (with or without licking of the hind paw) were recorded. Paw movements associated with locomotion or a shifting of weight were not considered a withdrawal response. The stimulus intensity that produced 10-15 sec baseline withdrawal latencies was used and a maximum cutoff of 20 sec was imposed. Hypersensitivity was evaluated 24 hr after CFA. Only rats that exhibited at least a 25% reduction in response latency from baseline (i.e. hyperalgesia) were included in further analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing the post-inflammogen latency assessment, rats were orally dosed (2.5 mL/kg) with test compound (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (20% hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextran). To determine the time of peak effect, latencies were redetermined 30, 60, 100, 180 and 300 min after compound administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData are presented as the maximal percent reversal of hypersensitivity obtained during the 300 min test, which was calculated for each animal according to the formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n% reversal=100%×(treatment response−post-inflammogen response)/(pre-inflammogen response−post-inflammogen response)\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCpd\n\n\n% Reversal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n104\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n133\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n31\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n47\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n70\n\n\n76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n78\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n114\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n310\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n464\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nIncision-Induced Model of Postoperative Surgery\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention were tested in animal models of postoperative surgery, as previously described (Brennan, T. J. et al., \nPain, \n1996, 64: 493-501). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized with 2-3 isoflurane and the plantar surface of the hindpaw was sterilized using three alternating betadine and alcohol scrubs. A 1 cm longitudinal incision through the skin of the plantar paw was made using a number 10 scalpel beginning 0.5 cm from the proximal heel and extending toward the toes. The plantaris muscle was excised using a forcep and incised longitudinally. The skin was then sutured in two locations using 5-0 silk. The wound site was then covered with antibiotic ointment and the animals were returned to their individual home cages. Changes in thermal sensitivity were evaluated before surgery and 24 hr after surgery. Vehicle (20% HPβCD) or test compound was orally administered and thermal sensitivity was re-assessed 30, 60, 100, 180 and 300 min later.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData are presented as the maximal percent reversal of hypersensitivity obtained during the 300 min test, which was calculated for each animal according to the formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n% reversal=100% (treatment response−post-inflammogen response)/(pre-inflammogen response−post-inflammogen response)\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCpd\n\n\n% Reversal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n132\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the foregoing specification teaches the principles of the present invention, with examples provided for the purpose of illustration, it will be understood that the practice of the invention encompasses all of the usual variations, adaptations and/or modifications as come within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll publications disclosed in the above specification are hereby incorporated by reference in full."
